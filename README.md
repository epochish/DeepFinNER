## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### Web Application (Recommended)
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This launches an interactive web interface for financial document analysis.

### Programmatic Usage
```python
# Import the main modules
from src.scraper import EDGARScraper
from src.nlp_processor import NLPProcessor
from src.entity_extractor import EntityExtractor

# Initialize scraper
scraper = EDGARScraper()
scraper.scrape_company_reports('AAPL')

# Process text
processor = NLPProcessor()
processed_text = processor.clean_and_tokenize(raw_text)

# Extract entities
extractor = EntityExtractor()
entities = extractor.extract_financial_entities(processed_text)
```
