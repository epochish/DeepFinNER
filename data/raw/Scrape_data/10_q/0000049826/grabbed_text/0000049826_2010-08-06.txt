DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WAS $33.7 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE LOSS ON SALE OF THE CLICK COMMERCE INDUSTRIAL SOFTWARE BUSINESS OF $29.8 MILLION. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE COMPANY’S PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT, CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS, TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH AND TO FUND SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE PRIMARY USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE: · DIVIDEND PAYMENTS – THE COMPANY’S DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINES ARE 25% TO 35% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS’ AVERAGE INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS; · ACQUISITIONS; AND · ANY EXCESS LIQUIDITY MAY BE USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES. THE COMPANY’S OPEN-ENDED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ALLOWS IT FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING THE TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO. CASH FLOW THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010 AND 2009 WAS AS FOLLOWS: ON AUGUST 20, 2007 THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (“ROIC”) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS’ USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ROIC IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE YEAR AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2010 AND 2009, ROIC WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE ROIC INCREASE OF 8.4% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010 WAS THE RESULT OF AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME INCREASING 102.0%, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BASE BUSINESS, WHILE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASED SLIGHTLY. THE ROIC INCREASE OF 8.2% FOR YEAR-TO-DATE 2010 WAS THE RESULT OF AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME INCREASING 124.8%, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BASE BUSINESS, WHILE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASED SLIGHTLY. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, THE COMPANY RECORDED A DISCRETE TAX CHARGE OF $21.9 MILLION. SINCE THE CHARGE WAS UNUSUAL, THE ROIC CALCULATION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THIS ITEM TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY AND BETTER REFLECT THE RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED.

NO AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE FACILITIES AT JUNE 30, 2010. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED ON ITS CURRENT FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW, DEBT-TO-CAPITALIZATION RATIOS AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY. THE COMPANY'S TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO IS 20% TO 30%, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ANY LARGER ACQUISITIONS.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WAS $33.7 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE LOSS ON SALE OF THE CLICK COMMERCE INDUSTRIAL SOFTWARE BUSINESS OF $29.8 MILLION. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE COMPANY’S PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT, CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS, TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH AND TO FUND SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE PRIMARY USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE: · DIVIDEND PAYMENTS – THE COMPANY’S DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINES ARE 25% TO 35% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS’ AVERAGE INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS; · ACQUISITIONS; AND · ANY EXCESS LIQUIDITY MAY BE USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES. THE COMPANY’S OPEN-ENDED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ALLOWS IT FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING THE TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO. CASH FLOW THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010 AND 2009 WAS AS FOLLOWS: ON AUGUST 20, 2007 THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (“ROIC”) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS’ USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ROIC IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE YEAR AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2010 AND 2009, ROIC WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE ROIC INCREASE OF 8.4% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010 WAS THE RESULT OF AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME INCREASING 102.0%, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BASE BUSINESS, WHILE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASED SLIGHTLY. THE ROIC INCREASE OF 8.2% FOR YEAR-TO-DATE 2010 WAS THE RESULT OF AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME INCREASING 124.8%, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BASE BUSINESS, WHILE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASED SLIGHTLY. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, THE COMPANY RECORDED A DISCRETE TAX CHARGE OF $21.9 MILLION. SINCE THE CHARGE WAS UNUSUAL, THE ROIC CALCULATION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THIS ITEM TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY AND BETTER REFLECT THE RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED.

NO AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE FACILITIES AT JUNE 30, 2010. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED ON ITS CURRENT FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW, DEBT-TO-CAPITALIZATION RATIOS AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY. THE COMPANY'S TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO IS 20% TO 30%, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ANY LARGER ACQUISITIONS.
