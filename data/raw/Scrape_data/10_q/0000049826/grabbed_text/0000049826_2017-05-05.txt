THE FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT IMPACT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY’S CURRENT GUIDANCE.19NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIN MAY 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (THE "FASB") ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE TO CHANGE THE CRITERIA FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION. THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF THE NEW STANDARD IS THAT REVENUE SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION DISCLOSURES WILL BE REQUIRED. UNDER CURRENT GUIDANCE, THE COMPANY GENERALLY RECOGNIZES OPERATING REVENUE AT THE TIME OF PRODUCT SHIPMENT AS TYPICAL SALES ARRANGEMENTS ARE FOR STANDARD PRODUCTS AND PROVIDE FOR TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP AND RISK OF LOSS AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT OR DELIVERY OF SERVICE. WHILE THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE NEW GUIDANCE, WE DO NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING REVENUE, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES IN THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRED UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2018 AND ALLOWS FOR EITHER FULL OR MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE ADOPTION METHODS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO ADOPT THE NEW REVENUE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE UTILIZING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE TO CHANGE THE CRITERIA FOR RECOGNIZING LEASING TRANSACTIONS. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, A LESSEE WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE A LEASE LIABILITY AND LEASE ASSET FOR ALL LEASES, INCLUDING OPERATING LEASES, WITH A LEASE TERM GREATER THAN TWELVE MONTHS IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION. SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT, INCLUDING PRESENTATION OF EXPENSES AND CASH FLOWS, WILL DEPEND ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE LEASE AS EITHER A FINANCING OR OPERATING LEASE. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL NEW DISCLOSURES WILL BE REQUIRED. THIS GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2019, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET COMPLETED ITS EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE WILL HAVE ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECOGNIZE RIGHT OF USE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR ITS OPERATING LEASES IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION UPON ADOPTION. IN MARCH 2016, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE THAT INCLUDED SEVERAL CHANGES TO SIMPLIFY THE ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, INCLUDING THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, FORFEITURES, STATUTORY TAX WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS AND CLASSIFICATION OF TAX BENEFITS IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. AMONG THE MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES, THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THAT THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS TO BE RECOGNIZED THROUGH INCOME TAX EXPENSE RATHER THAN DIRECTLY IN EQUITY. ADDITIONALLY, THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS RELATED TO EXCESS TAX BENEFITS SHOULD BE PRESENTED WITHIN OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS RATHER THAN AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY. EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN EQUITY WERE $13 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2016 AND $29 MILLION FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE NEW GUIDANCE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2017 AND APPLIED THE NEWLY ADOPTED PROVISIONS PROSPECTIVELY. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2017, EXCESS TAX BENEFITS OF $12 MILLION WERE INCLUDED IN INCOME TAXES IN THE STATEMENT OF INCOME. THE EXPECTED EFFECT ON INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR NET CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES RELATED TO FUTURE STOCK-BASED AWARD SETTLEMENTS WILL VARY EACH QUARTER AND WILL DEPEND ON INPUTS SUCH AS THE STOCK PRICE AT THE TIME OF SETTLEMENT AND THE NUMBER OF AWARDS SETTLED IN THE PERIOD PRESENTED. IN OCTOBER 2016, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE REQUIRING THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INTRA-ENTITY TRANSFER OF AN ASSET, OTHER THAN INVENTORY, WHEN THE TRANSFER OCCURS RATHER THAN WHEN TRANSFERRED TO A THIRD PARTY AS REQUIRED UNDER THE CURRENT GUIDANCE. THE NEW GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2018. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THE GUIDANCE WILL HAVE UPON ADOPTION.IN MARCH 2017, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE WHICH CHANGES THE INCOME STATEMENT PRESENTATION OF THE COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST RELATED TO DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. THE PRIMARY CHANGE UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE IS THAT ONLY THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN OPERATING INCOME AND IS ELIGIBLE FOR CAPITALIZATION AS AN ASSET. THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST SHOULD BE PRESENTED BELOW OPERATING INCOME. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY STARTING JANUARY 1, 2018 AND WILL BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY TO THE PRESENTATION OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST AND PROSPECTIVELY TO THE CAPITALIZATION OF SERVICE COST. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESTHE COMPANY’S PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE CASH FLOW AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAD $2.5 BILLION OF CASH ON HAND AT MARCH 31, 2017 AND ALSO MAINTAINS STRONG ACCESS TO PUBLIC DEBT MARKETS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE SOURCES ARE SUFFICIENT TO SERVICE DEBT AND TO FINANCE THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL ALLOCATION PRIORITIES, WHICH INCLUDE:•INTERNAL INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT ORGANIC GROWTH AND SUSTAIN CORE BUSINESSES;•PAYMENT OF AN ATTRACTIVE DIVIDEND TO SHAREHOLDERS; AND20•EXTERNAL INVESTMENTS IN SELECTIVE STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS THAT SUPPORT ORGANIC GROWTH FOCUS, AND AN ACTIVE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT, BASED ON ITS REVENUE, OPERATING MARGIN, CURRENT FREE CASH FLOW, AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY.CASH FLOWTHE COMPANY USES FREE CASH FLOW TO MEASURE CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, ACQUISITIONS AND DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES. FREE CASH FLOW REPRESENTS NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS ADDITIONS TO PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. FREE CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

AS OF MARCH 31, 2017, THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY $3.2 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THE 2015 PROGRAM.21ADJUSTED AFTER-TAX RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITALTHE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED AFTER-TAX RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL ("ROIC") TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS’ USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ROIC IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. ADJUSTED AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S EQUITY INVESTMENT IN THE WILSONART BUSINESS (FORMERLY THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT). AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE PERIOD AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. ROIC FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017 AND 2016 WAS AS FOLLOWS:ROIC INCREASED 260 BASIS POINTS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2017 COMPARED TO 2016 AS A RESULT OF A 14.7% IMPROVEMENT IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME VERSUS A 2.0% INCREASE IN ADJUSTED AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL. THE $12 MILLION DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IMPROVED AFTER-TAX ROIC BY APPROXIMATELY 60 BASIS POINTS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2017.22WORKING CAPITALMANAGEMENT USES WORKING CAPITAL AS A MEASUREMENT OF THE SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY.

IN THE U.S., THE COMPANY UTILIZES CASH FLOWS FROM DOMESTIC OPERATIONS TO FUND DOMESTIC CASH NEEDS, WHICH PRIMARILY CONSIST OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, SHARE REPURCHASES, ACQUISITIONS, SERVICING OF DOMESTIC DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, WHICH IS BACKED BY LONG-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES, FOR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S LONG TERM FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA. EBITDA AND THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.

THE FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT IMPACT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY’S CURRENT GUIDANCE.19NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIN MAY 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (THE "FASB") ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE TO CHANGE THE CRITERIA FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION. THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF THE NEW STANDARD IS THAT REVENUE SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION DISCLOSURES WILL BE REQUIRED. UNDER CURRENT GUIDANCE, THE COMPANY GENERALLY RECOGNIZES OPERATING REVENUE AT THE TIME OF PRODUCT SHIPMENT AS TYPICAL SALES ARRANGEMENTS ARE FOR STANDARD PRODUCTS AND PROVIDE FOR TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP AND RISK OF LOSS AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT OR DELIVERY OF SERVICE. WHILE THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE NEW GUIDANCE, WE DO NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING REVENUE, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES IN THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRED UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2018 AND ALLOWS FOR EITHER FULL OR MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE ADOPTION METHODS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO ADOPT THE NEW REVENUE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE UTILIZING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE TO CHANGE THE CRITERIA FOR RECOGNIZING LEASING TRANSACTIONS. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, A LESSEE WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE A LEASE LIABILITY AND LEASE ASSET FOR ALL LEASES, INCLUDING OPERATING LEASES, WITH A LEASE TERM GREATER THAN TWELVE MONTHS IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION. SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT, INCLUDING PRESENTATION OF EXPENSES AND CASH FLOWS, WILL DEPEND ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE LEASE AS EITHER A FINANCING OR OPERATING LEASE. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL NEW DISCLOSURES WILL BE REQUIRED. THIS GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2019, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET COMPLETED ITS EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE WILL HAVE ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECOGNIZE RIGHT OF USE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR ITS OPERATING LEASES IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION UPON ADOPTION. IN MARCH 2016, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE THAT INCLUDED SEVERAL CHANGES TO SIMPLIFY THE ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, INCLUDING THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, FORFEITURES, STATUTORY TAX WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS AND CLASSIFICATION OF TAX BENEFITS IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. AMONG THE MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES, THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THAT THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS TO BE RECOGNIZED THROUGH INCOME TAX EXPENSE RATHER THAN DIRECTLY IN EQUITY. ADDITIONALLY, THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS RELATED TO EXCESS TAX BENEFITS SHOULD BE PRESENTED WITHIN OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS RATHER THAN AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY. EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN EQUITY WERE $13 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2016 AND $29 MILLION FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE NEW GUIDANCE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2017 AND APPLIED THE NEWLY ADOPTED PROVISIONS PROSPECTIVELY. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2017, EXCESS TAX BENEFITS OF $12 MILLION WERE INCLUDED IN INCOME TAXES IN THE STATEMENT OF INCOME. THE EXPECTED EFFECT ON INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR NET CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES RELATED TO FUTURE STOCK-BASED AWARD SETTLEMENTS WILL VARY EACH QUARTER AND WILL DEPEND ON INPUTS SUCH AS THE STOCK PRICE AT THE TIME OF SETTLEMENT AND THE NUMBER OF AWARDS SETTLED IN THE PERIOD PRESENTED. IN OCTOBER 2016, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE REQUIRING THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INTRA-ENTITY TRANSFER OF AN ASSET, OTHER THAN INVENTORY, WHEN THE TRANSFER OCCURS RATHER THAN WHEN TRANSFERRED TO A THIRD PARTY AS REQUIRED UNDER THE CURRENT GUIDANCE. THE NEW GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2018. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THE GUIDANCE WILL HAVE UPON ADOPTION.IN MARCH 2017, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE WHICH CHANGES THE INCOME STATEMENT PRESENTATION OF THE COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST RELATED TO DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. THE PRIMARY CHANGE UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE IS THAT ONLY THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN OPERATING INCOME AND IS ELIGIBLE FOR CAPITALIZATION AS AN ASSET. THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST SHOULD BE PRESENTED BELOW OPERATING INCOME. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY STARTING JANUARY 1, 2018 AND WILL BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY TO THE PRESENTATION OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST AND PROSPECTIVELY TO THE CAPITALIZATION OF SERVICE COST. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESTHE COMPANY’S PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE CASH FLOW AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAD $2.5 BILLION OF CASH ON HAND AT MARCH 31, 2017 AND ALSO MAINTAINS STRONG ACCESS TO PUBLIC DEBT MARKETS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE SOURCES ARE SUFFICIENT TO SERVICE DEBT AND TO FINANCE THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL ALLOCATION PRIORITIES, WHICH INCLUDE:•INTERNAL INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT ORGANIC GROWTH AND SUSTAIN CORE BUSINESSES;•PAYMENT OF AN ATTRACTIVE DIVIDEND TO SHAREHOLDERS; AND20•EXTERNAL INVESTMENTS IN SELECTIVE STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS THAT SUPPORT ORGANIC GROWTH FOCUS, AND AN ACTIVE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT, BASED ON ITS REVENUE, OPERATING MARGIN, CURRENT FREE CASH FLOW, AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY.CASH FLOWTHE COMPANY USES FREE CASH FLOW TO MEASURE CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, ACQUISITIONS AND DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES. FREE CASH FLOW REPRESENTS NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS ADDITIONS TO PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.
