DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA CONTAINED IN THE COMPANY’S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012.ENTERPRISE STRATEGYDURING 2012, THE COMPANY EMBARKED ON AN ENTERPRISE STRATEGY THAT INCLUDES THREE KEY INITIATIVES - PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION, AND STRATEGIC SOURCING. THESE INITIATIVES ARE EXPECTED TO ENHANCE THE BUSINESS THROUGH 2017 AND ARE TARGETED AT EXPANDING ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH, AND IMPROVING PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS.PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT - THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE AIMS TO CONSTRUCT A BUSINESS PORTFOLIO THAT LEVERAGES THE COMPANY’S DIFFERENTIATED BUSINESS MODEL. AS PART OF THIS INITIATIVE, THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS OPERATIONS FOR BUSINESSES THAT MAY NO LONGER BE ALIGNED WITH ITS LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS DIVESTITURE ACTIVITY IN THE 2012 TO 2014 PERIOD TO INCREASE OVER HISTORICAL PERIODS. THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES WITH COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS WELL AS LARGER ACQUISITIONS THAT REPRESENT POTENTIAL NEW PLATFORMS. GOING FORWARD, THE FOCUS WILL BE ON BUSINESSES WITH STRONG DIFFERENTIATION AND GROWTH POTENTIAL. BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION - THE BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION INITIATIVE SIMPLIFIES AND ADDS SCALE TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATING DIVISIONS IN ORDER TO INCREASE ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH, ENHANCE GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS AND DRIVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES. THIS INITIATIVE WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING DIVISIONS AND INCREASE THE AVERAGE REVENUE SIZE OF EACH DIVISION, WHILE RETAINING THE POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES OF A DECENTRALIZED OPERATING MODEL. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO ENHANCE ITS PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF APPLYING ITS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS TO THE NEW DIVISIONS, MORE FOCUSED GROWTH INVESTMENTS AND REDUCED INFRASTRUCTURE.STRATEGIC SOURCING - THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC SOURCING INITIATIVE FOCUSES ON BUILDING SOURCING CAPABILITY IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE PURCHASING SCALE TO ENHANCE PROFITABILITY AND GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS. IT INCORPORATES BOTH ENTERPRISE-LEVEL AND SEGMENT-LEVEL PURCHASING THAT CROSS THE COMPANY'S MANY BUSINESSES. THIS INITIATIVE IS EXPECTED TO TRANSFORM SOURCING INTO A CORE STRATEGIC FUNCTION IN THE COMPANY.14DIVESTITURE OF MAJORITY INTEREST IN FORMER DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT ON AUGUST 15, 2012, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT (THE “INVESTMENT AGREEMENT”) TO DIVEST A 51% MAJORITY INTEREST IN ITS DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT TO CERTAIN FUNDS MANAGED BY CLAYTON, DUBILIER & RICE, LLC (“CD&R”).

THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES WITH COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS WELL AS LARGER ACQUISITIONS THAT REPRESENT POTENTIAL NEW PLATFORMS. GOING FORWARD, THE FOCUS WILL BE ON BUSINESSES WITH STRONG DIFFERENTIATION AND GROWTH POTENTIAL. BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION - THE BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION INITIATIVE SIMPLIFIES AND ADDS SCALE TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATING DIVISIONS IN ORDER TO INCREASE ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH, ENHANCE GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS AND DRIVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES. THIS INITIATIVE WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING DIVISIONS AND INCREASE THE AVERAGE REVENUE SIZE OF EACH DIVISION, WHILE RETAINING THE POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES OF A DECENTRALIZED OPERATING MODEL. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO ENHANCE ITS PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF APPLYING ITS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS TO THE NEW DIVISIONS, MORE FOCUSED GROWTH INVESTMENTS AND REDUCED INFRASTRUCTURE.STRATEGIC SOURCING - THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC SOURCING INITIATIVE FOCUSES ON BUILDING SOURCING CAPABILITY IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE PURCHASING SCALE TO ENHANCE PROFITABILITY AND GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS.
