THE MAJORITY OF THE BASE REVENUE INCREASE WAS THE RESULT OF PRICE INCREASES IMPLEMENTED TO OFFSET RAW MATERIAL COST INCREASES. INTERNATIONALLY, BASE BUSINESS REVENUES INCREASED 1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND 3% YEAR-TO-DATE EVEN AS INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION IN THE MAJOR EUROPEAN ECONOMIES SLOWED IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS OF 2005 OVER FOURTH QUARTER 2004 PRODUCTION LEVELS. OPERATING INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005 AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD IMPROVED PRIMARILY DUE TO LEVERAGE FROM THE GROWTH IN BASE BUSINESS REVENUE, INCOME FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND FAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET IN BOTH PERIODS BY VARIABLE MARGIN DECLINES PRIMARILY DUE TO RAW MATERIAL COST INCREASES. LEASING AND INVESTMENTS INCOME DECREASED IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE DUE TO HIGHER INCOME REALIZED LAST YEAR FROM BOTH GAINS ON SALES IN THE COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO AND FAVORABLE MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS ON VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, OPERATING INCOME IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY PRETAX CHARGES TO EXPENSE STOCK OPTIONS OF $6.5 MILLION AND $13.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. A FIRST QUARTER 2005 CHARGE OF $8.7 MILLION TO RESOLVE ACCOUNTING ISSUES AT A EUROPEAN FOOD EQUIPMENT BUSINESS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED INCOME IN THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD. AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANYS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $11.3 MILLION WERE INCURRED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005. THE IMPAIRED ASSETS REFLECTED DIMINISHED EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND PRIMARILY RELATED TO A CANADIAN STRETCH PACKAGING EQUIPMENT BUSINESS, A U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESS AND A U.S. BUSINESS THAT MANUFACTURES CLEAN ROOM MATS.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO APPROXIMATELY 340 OF ITS 650 REPORTING UNITS. WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE UNITS GOODWILL AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL.
