IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO APPROXIMATELY 375 OF ITS THEN 700 REPORTING UNITS. WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE UNITS GOODWILL AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL. AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR THE PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, 2006 AND 2005 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31 2006 2005 GOODWILL: IMPAIRMENT $ 9,200 $ 6,206 INTANGIBLE ASSETS: AMORTIZATION 23,788 14,735 IMPAIRMENT 2,985 5,049 TOTAL $ 35,973 $ 25,990 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $12.2 MILLION.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE EXISTING DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT OBJECTIVE OF 25-30% OF THE LAST THREE YEARS AVERAGE NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH AND SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS AND DEBT REPAYMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO APPROXIMATELY 375 OF ITS THEN 700 REPORTING UNITS. WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE UNITS GOODWILL AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL. AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR THE PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, 2006 AND 2005 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31 2006 2005 GOODWILL: IMPAIRMENT $ 9,200 $ 6,206 INTANGIBLE ASSETS: AMORTIZATION 23,788 14,735 IMPAIRMENT 2,985 5,049 TOTAL $ 35,973 $ 25,990 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $12.2 MILLION. THE FIRST QUARTER 2006 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $9.2 MILLION WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO A U.S. JOIST BUSINESS, A U.S. HEAT TRANSFER BUSINESS, AND AN ASIAN CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS AND RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OF $3.0 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESS IN THE SPECIALTY SYSTEMS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT AND A U.S. CONTAMINATION CONTROL BUSINESS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE EXISTING DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT OBJECTIVE OF 25-30% OF THE LAST THREE YEARS AVERAGE NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH AND SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS AND DEBT REPAYMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.
