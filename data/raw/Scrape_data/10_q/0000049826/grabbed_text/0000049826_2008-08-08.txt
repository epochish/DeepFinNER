TOTAL BASE REVENUES DECLINED 0.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER, PRIMARILY DUE TO A 4.6% AND 1.5% DECLINE IN THE INDUSTRIAL AND APPLIANCE BUSINESSES AND CONSUMER PACKAGING BUSINESSES, RESPECTIVELY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF 9.0% IN THE TEST AND MEASUREMENT BUSINESSES. THE 1.2% DECLINE IN THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A 9.2% INCREASE IN THE TEST AND MEASUREMENT BUSINESSES, OFFSET BY A 6.4% AND 1.3% DECLINE IN THE INDUSTRIAL APPLIANCE FINISHING BUSINESSES AND CONSUMER PACKAGING BUSINESSES, RESPECTIVELY. THE TEST AND MEASUREMENT BUSINESSES BENEFITED FROM A STRONG BACKLOG AT THE END OF 2007 AND NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 6.4% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO CURRENCY TRANSLATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF LEVERAGE FROM THE DECREASE IN BASE REVENUE DISCUSSED ABOVE. OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 25.0% FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FIRST QUARTER 2008 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO A WORLDWIDE SOFTWARE BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES, AS A RESULT OF TIGHTER COST CONTROLS AND THE BENEFITS OF PRIOR YEAR RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS, AND THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION PARTIALLY OFFSET THE DECLINES. AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED OPERATING SEGMENT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO 59 OF ITS 60 OPERATING SEGMENTS. WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT AN ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING SEGMENT. WHEN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD IS NOT SOLELY REPRESENTATIVE OF FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY MAY ALSO EMPLOY ADDITIONAL VALUATION TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS MARKET COMPARABLES. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING SEGMENT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE OPERATING SEGMENTS GOODWILL AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN TOTAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $98.6 MILLION. THE FIRST QUARTER 2008 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $97.2 MILLION RELATED TO THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE SOFTWARE BUSINESS IN THE ALL OTHER SEGMENT. THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE COMBINATION OF LOWER FORECASTS FOR THIS BUSINESS AND LOWER MARKET DRIVEN MULTIPLES THAT WERE BEING PAID FOR SIMILAR BUSINESSES. INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $74.1 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2008 FROM $50.0 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEREST ON THE 5.25% EURO NOTES ISSUED IN OCTOBER 2007. OTHER INCOME OTHER INCOME DECREASED TO $2.8 MILLION FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2008 VERSUS INCOME OF $37.1 MILLION IN 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO A FIRST QUARTER 2008 CHARGE FOR EUROPEAN TRANSFER TAXES RELATED TO LEGAL ENTITY STRUCTURING TRANSACTIONS AND LOWER INVESTMENT INCOME. THESE AMOUNTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST INCOME IN 2008 EARNED ON SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND LOWER CURRENCY TRANSLATION LOSSES IN 2008 VERSUS 2007. INCOME TAXES THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2008 WAS 31.16% COMPARED TO 30.83% FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2007. THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM THE IMPAIRMENT OF NON-DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008. EXCLUDING THE IMPAIRMENT, THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS WAS 29.01%. THE REDUCTION IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, EXCLUDING THE IMPAIRMENT, RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM A HIGHER PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF INCOME IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS WITH LOWER TAX RATES. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $829.8 MILLION ($1.57 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2008 WAS 4.1% LOWER THAN THE 2007 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $865.4 MILLION ($1.54 PER DILUTED SHARE). FOREIGN CURRENCY THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2008 INCREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2008 BY APPROXIMATELY $450 MILLION AND INCREASED EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY 9 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2007 INCREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2007 BY APPROXIMATELY $228 MILLION AND INCREASED EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY 5 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2007, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE DIVESTITURES OF A CONSUMER PACKAGING BUSINESS AND AN AUTOMOTIVE MACHINERY BUSINESS WHICH RESULTED IN AN AFTER-TAX GAIN OF $41.2 MILLION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY ALSO CLASSIFIED A SEPARATE CONSUMER PACKAGING BUSINESS AND AN AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS BUSINESS AS HELD FOR SALE. THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THESE BUSINESSES, ALONG WITH THE GAINS REALIZED, NET OF TAX, HAVE BEEN PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. ASSETS OF $144.7 MILLION AND LIABILITIES OF $5.1 MILLION RELATED TO THE TWO BUSINESSES HELD FOR SALE AS OF JUNE 30, 2008, HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS PREPAIDS AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND ACCRUED EXPENSES, RESPECTIVELY. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ON JANUARY 1, 2008, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 158, EMPLOYERS' ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS-AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND 132(R) ("SFAS 158"), WHICH REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO CHANGE ITS MEASUREMENT DATE TO CORRESPOND WITH THE COMPANY'S FISCAL YEAR END. THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY USED A SEPTEMBER 30 MEASUREMENT DATE. AS ALLOWED UNDER SFAS 158, THE COMPANY ELECTED TO REMEASURE ITS PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR. UPON ADOPTION, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $12.8 MILLION TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS AND AN AFTER-TAX GAIN TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF $3.6 MILLION, RELATED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINE OF 25% TO 35% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS AVERAGE INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS USED TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008 AND 2007 WAS AS FOLLOWS: ON AUGUST 20, 2007 THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME. IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2008, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 11.8 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $49.71 PER SHARE. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY $2.0 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ROIC FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008 AND 2007 WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE 170 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN ROIC FOR YEAR-TO-DATE 2008 WAS THE RESULT OF AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASING 11.0% WHILE AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME INCREASED ONLY 0.5%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $97.2 MILLION IMPAIRMENT OF MOSTLY NON-TAX DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008. WORKING CAPITAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AT JUNE 30, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: TRADE RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED SALES, ACQUISITIONS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. SHORT-TERM DEBT INCREASED DUE TO THE 5.75% REDEEMABLE NOTES BECOMING CURRENT, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FUND STOCK REPURCHASES AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS IN EXCESS OF OPERATING CASH FLOWS. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF ACQUISITIONS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. DEBT TOTAL DEBT AT JUNE 30, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007 WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OF $733.4 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2008 AND $201.0 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. IN 1999, THE COMPANY ISSUED $500.0 MILLION OF 5.75% REDEEMABLE NOTES DUE MARCH 1, 2009. THE BALANCE RELATED TO THESE NOTES OUTSTANDING AT JUNE 30, 2008 WAS CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM DEBT. THE BALANCE OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 WAS CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM DEBT. IN JUNE 2007, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $1.0 BILLION LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 13, 2008.

NORTH AMERICAN LAMINATE BASE REVENUE INCREASED 0.7% AND 0.4% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO PRODUCT PENETRATION IN THE PREMIUM HIGH DEFINITION LAMINATE PRODUCT LINE. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET BY SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE DOUBLE DIGIT BASE REVENUE DECLINES IN THE FLOORING BUSINESSES PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINES IN THE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION MARKET. INTERNATIONAL BASE REVENUES GREW 0.3% AND 2.2% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO STRONG DEMAND IN THE ASIAN END MARKETS. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 0.5% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008 AND INCREASED 6.2% FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OVER THE SAME PERIODS OF 2007. FOR THE SECOND QUARTER, THE DECREASE IN INCOME AND OPERATING MARGIN IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NEGATIVE LEVERAGE EFFECT FROM THE DECREASE IN REVENUES DESCRIBED ABOVE. FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD, INCOME INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION, LOWER OVERHEAD EXPENSE AND LEVERAGE FROM THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES AND LOWER OVERHEAD EXPENSE DUE TO 2007 SELLING EXPENSES RELATED TO A NEW PRODUCT LAUNCH.

GROWTH IN ACQUISITION REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE PURCHASE OF AN INTERNATIONAL FLUID PRODUCTS BUSINESS, TWO POLYMERS AND INDUSTRIAL ADHESIVES BUSINESSES, AN AUSTRALIAN POLYMERS BUSINESS, TWO NORTH AMERICAN CONSTRUCTION ADHESIVES BUSINESSES AND A SOUTH AMERICAN SEALANT BUSINESS. BASE REVENUES INCREASED IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN NORTH AMERICAN POLYMERS BUSINESSES OF 9.4% AND 5.5% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, MAINLY IN SPECIALTY ADHESIVES AND EPOXY PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN DEMAND IN THE EUROPEAN FLUIDS AND CONSTRUCTION POLYMERS BUSINESSES. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 35.5% AND 30.1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2008, RESPECTIVELY, OVER THE SAME PERIODS OF 2007 PRIMARILY FROM REDUCED OVERHEAD EXPENSES AND THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF LEVERAGE FROM THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES, INCOME FROM ACQUISITIONS AND THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION. TOTAL OPERATING MARGINS FOR BOTH PERIODS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO TIGHTER COST CONTROLS AND BENEFITS OF PRIOR YEAR RESTRUCTURING AT BASE BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MARGINS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AND INCREASED RAW MATERIAL COSTS.

THE INCREASE IN ACQUISITION REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PURCHASE OF TWO TEST AND MEASUREMENT BUSINESSES, TWO DECORATING AND GRAPHICS BUSINESSES, AN INDUSTRIAL SOFTWARE BUSINESS, AND A LABEL BUSINESS. TOTAL BASE REVENUES DECLINED 0.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER, PRIMARILY DUE TO A 4.6% AND 1.5% DECLINE IN THE INDUSTRIAL AND APPLIANCE BUSINESSES AND CONSUMER PACKAGING BUSINESSES, RESPECTIVELY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF 9.0% IN THE TEST AND MEASUREMENT BUSINESSES. THE 1.2% DECLINE IN THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A 9.2% INCREASE IN THE TEST AND MEASUREMENT BUSINESSES, OFFSET BY A 6.4% AND 1.3% DECLINE IN THE INDUSTRIAL APPLIANCE FINISHING BUSINESSES AND CONSUMER PACKAGING BUSINESSES, RESPECTIVELY. THE TEST AND MEASUREMENT BUSINESSES BENEFITED FROM A STRONG BACKLOG AT THE END OF 2007 AND NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 6.4% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO CURRENCY TRANSLATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF LEVERAGE FROM THE DECREASE IN BASE REVENUE DISCUSSED ABOVE. OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 25.0% FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FIRST QUARTER 2008 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO A WORLDWIDE SOFTWARE BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES, AS A RESULT OF TIGHTER COST CONTROLS AND THE BENEFITS OF PRIOR YEAR RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS, AND THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION PARTIALLY OFFSET THE DECLINES. AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED OPERATING SEGMENT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO 59 OF ITS 60 OPERATING SEGMENTS. WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT AN ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING SEGMENT. WHEN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD IS NOT SOLELY REPRESENTATIVE OF FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY MAY ALSO EMPLOY ADDITIONAL VALUATION TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS MARKET COMPARABLES. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING SEGMENT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE OPERATING SEGMENTS GOODWILL AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN TOTAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $98.6 MILLION. THE FIRST QUARTER 2008 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $97.2 MILLION RELATED TO THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE SOFTWARE BUSINESS IN THE ALL OTHER SEGMENT. THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE COMBINATION OF LOWER FORECASTS FOR THIS BUSINESS AND LOWER MARKET DRIVEN MULTIPLES THAT WERE BEING PAID FOR SIMILAR BUSINESSES. INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $74.1 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2008 FROM $50.0 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEREST ON THE 5.25% EURO NOTES ISSUED IN OCTOBER 2007. OTHER INCOME OTHER INCOME DECREASED TO $2.8 MILLION FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2008 VERSUS INCOME OF $37.1 MILLION IN 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO A FIRST QUARTER 2008 CHARGE FOR EUROPEAN TRANSFER TAXES RELATED TO LEGAL ENTITY STRUCTURING TRANSACTIONS AND LOWER INVESTMENT INCOME. THESE AMOUNTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST INCOME IN 2008 EARNED ON SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND LOWER CURRENCY TRANSLATION LOSSES IN 2008 VERSUS 2007. INCOME TAXES THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2008 WAS 31.16% COMPARED TO 30.83% FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2007. THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM THE IMPAIRMENT OF NON-DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008. EXCLUDING THE IMPAIRMENT, THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS WAS 29.01%. THE REDUCTION IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, EXCLUDING THE IMPAIRMENT, RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM A HIGHER PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF INCOME IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS WITH LOWER TAX RATES. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $829.8 MILLION ($1.57 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2008 WAS 4.1% LOWER THAN THE 2007 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $865.4 MILLION ($1.54 PER DILUTED SHARE). FOREIGN CURRENCY THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2008 INCREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2008 BY APPROXIMATELY $450 MILLION AND INCREASED EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY 9 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2007 INCREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2007 BY APPROXIMATELY $228 MILLION AND INCREASED EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY 5 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2007, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE DIVESTITURES OF A CONSUMER PACKAGING BUSINESS AND AN AUTOMOTIVE MACHINERY BUSINESS WHICH RESULTED IN AN AFTER-TAX GAIN OF $41.2 MILLION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY ALSO CLASSIFIED A SEPARATE CONSUMER PACKAGING BUSINESS AND AN AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS BUSINESS AS HELD FOR SALE. THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THESE BUSINESSES, ALONG WITH THE GAINS REALIZED, NET OF TAX, HAVE BEEN PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. ASSETS OF $144.7 MILLION AND LIABILITIES OF $5.1 MILLION RELATED TO THE TWO BUSINESSES HELD FOR SALE AS OF JUNE 30, 2008, HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS PREPAIDS AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND ACCRUED EXPENSES, RESPECTIVELY. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ON JANUARY 1, 2008, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 158, EMPLOYERS' ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS-AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND 132(R) ("SFAS 158"), WHICH REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO CHANGE ITS MEASUREMENT DATE TO CORRESPOND WITH THE COMPANY'S FISCAL YEAR END. THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY USED A SEPTEMBER 30 MEASUREMENT DATE. AS ALLOWED UNDER SFAS 158, THE COMPANY ELECTED TO REMEASURE ITS PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR. UPON ADOPTION, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $12.8 MILLION TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS AND AN AFTER-TAX GAIN TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF $3.6 MILLION, RELATED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINE OF 25% TO 35% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS AVERAGE INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS USED TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008 AND 2007 WAS AS FOLLOWS: ON AUGUST 20, 2007 THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME. IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2008, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 11.8 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $49.71 PER SHARE. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY $2.0 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ROIC FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008 AND 2007 WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE 170 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN ROIC FOR YEAR-TO-DATE 2008 WAS THE RESULT OF AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASING 11.0% WHILE AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME INCREASED ONLY 0.5%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $97.2 MILLION IMPAIRMENT OF MOSTLY NON-TAX DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008. WORKING CAPITAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AT JUNE 30, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: TRADE RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED SALES, ACQUISITIONS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. SHORT-TERM DEBT INCREASED DUE TO THE 5.75% REDEEMABLE NOTES BECOMING CURRENT, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FUND STOCK REPURCHASES AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS IN EXCESS OF OPERATING CASH FLOWS. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF ACQUISITIONS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. DEBT TOTAL DEBT AT JUNE 30, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007 WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OF $733.4 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2008 AND $201.0 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. IN 1999, THE COMPANY ISSUED $500.0 MILLION OF 5.75% REDEEMABLE NOTES DUE MARCH 1, 2009. THE BALANCE RELATED TO THESE NOTES OUTSTANDING AT JUNE 30, 2008 WAS CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM DEBT.
