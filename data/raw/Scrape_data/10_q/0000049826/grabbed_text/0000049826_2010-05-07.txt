MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT, CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS, TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH AND TO FUND SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE PRIMARY USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE: · DIVIDEND PAYMENTS – THE COMPANY’S DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINES ARE 25% TO 35% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS’ AVERAGE INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS; · ACQUISITIONS; AND · ANY EXCESS LIQUIDITY MAY BE USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES. THE COMPANY’S OPEN-ENDED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ALLOWS IT FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING THE TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO. CASH FLOW THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ROIC IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE YEAR AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010 AND 2009, ROIC WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE ROIC INCREASE OF 8.0% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010 WAS THE RESULT OF OPERATING INCOME AFTER TAXES INCREASING 163.2%, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BASE BUSINESS, WHILE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASED SLIGHTLY. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, THE COMPANY RECORDED A DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENT OF $21.9 MILLION. SINCE THIS CHARGE WAS UNUSUAL, THE ROIC CALCULATION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THIS ITEM TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY AND BETTER REFLECT THE RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED.
