THE INCREASE IN ACQUISITION REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PURCHASE OF A WORLDWIDE TEST AND MEASUREMENT BUSINESS, A WORLDWIDE GRAPHICS BUSINESS AND A NORTH AMERICAN LABEL BUSINESS. BASE REVENUES FOR THE INDUSTRIAL PLASTIC AND METALS WORLDWIDE, FINISHING WORLDWIDE AND CONSUMER PACKAGING WORLDWIDE BUSINESSES DECLINED 8.2%, 2.1% AND 1.1%, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER NORTH AMERICA END MARKET DEMAND. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 9.5% INCREASE IN BASE REVENUE IN THE TEST AND MEASUREMENT BUSINESS WORLDWIDE PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER EUROPEAN SALES OF AUTOMOTIVE TESTING EQUIPMENT. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 65.3% PRIMARILY DUE TO AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $97.2 MILLION RELATED TO THE GOODWILL OF A WORLDWIDE INDUSTRIAL SOFTWARE BUSINESS. ADDITIONALLY, OPERATING INCOME DECLINED DUE TO THE NEGATIVE LEVERAGE EFFECT OF THE DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES. BASE OPERATING MARGINS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER OVERHEAD COSTS AS A RESULT OF STRONG COST CONTROL MEASURES AND THE BENEFITS OF 2007 RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES. OPERATING REVENUES THE RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES TO TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES IS AS FOLLOWS: AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO 59 OF ITS 60 OPERATING SEGMENTS. WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING SEGMENT. WHEN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY MAY ALSO EMPLOY ADDITIONAL VALUATION TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS MARKET MULTIPLES FROM SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING SEGMENT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE SEGMENTS GOODWILL AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN TOTAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $98.6 MILLION. THE FIRST QUARTER 2008 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $97.2 MILLION RELATED TO THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE INDUSTRIAL SOFTWARE BUSINESS IN THE ALL OTHER SEGMENT. THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE COMBINATION OF LOWER FORECASTS FOR THIS BUSINESS AND LOWER MARKET DRIVEN MULTIPLES THAT WERE BEING PAID FOR SIMILAR BUSINESSES. INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $37.5 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2008 FROM $24.4 MILLION IN 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE 5.25% EURO NOTES ISSUED IN OCTOBER 2007. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) WAS EXPENSE OF $21.4 MILLION FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2008 VERSUS INCOME OF $15.1 MILLION IN 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO EUROPEAN TRANSFER TAXES RELATED TO LEGAL ENTITY STRUCTURING TRANSACTIONS. THE EXPENSE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST INCOME IN 2008, PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS. INCOME TAXES THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST RATE THREE MONTHS OF 2008 WAS 34.64% COMPARED TO 31.14% FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2007. THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM THE IMPAIRMENT OF NON-DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL. EXCLUDING THE IMPAIRMENT, THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE QUARTER WAS 29.01%. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $301.4 MILLION ($0.57 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2008 WAS 21.7% LOWER THAN THE 2007 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $385.0 MILLION ($0.68 PER DILUTED SHARE). FOREIGN CURRENCY THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2008 INCREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2008 BY APPROXIMATELY $193.5 MILLION AND INCREASED EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY 3 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2007 INCREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2007 BY APPROXIMATELY $103.5 MILLION AND INCREASED EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY 2 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE DIVESTITURE OF A CONSUMER PACKAGING BUSINESS WHICH RESULTED IN AN AFTER-TAX GAIN OF $17.4 MILLION. AS OF MARCH 31, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY ALSO CLASSIFIED A CONSUMER PACKAGING AND AN AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS BUSINESS AS HELD FOR SALE.

AS A RESULT OF STRONG DEMAND IN INTERNATIONAL END MARKETS, BASE BUSINESS REVENUES INCREASED 4.5% PRIMARILY DUE TO A 5.0% GROWTH IN WORLDWIDE POLYMERS BUSINESSES AND A 3.2% GROWTH IN THE FLUIDS BUSINESSES. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 22.8% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008 VERSUS THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007 PRIMARILY FROM THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF LEVERAGE FROM THE INCREASE IN BASE BUSINESS REVENUES, THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION, 2007 INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE AND INCOME FROM ACQUISITIONS. TOTAL OPERATING MARGINS DECREASED DUE TO LOWER MARGINS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BASE BUSINESS MARGIN GAINS FROM INCREASED VOLUME.

THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE ALL OTHER SEGMENT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008 AND 2007 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31 2008 2007 OPERATING REVENUES $800,479 $739,228 OPERATING INCOME 42,407 122,385 MARGIN % 5.3 % 16.6 % IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, THE CHANGES IN REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGINS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31 % INCREASE (DECREASE) % POINT INCREASE (DECREASE) OPERATING REVENUES OPERATING INCOME OPERATING MARGINS BASE MANUFACTURING BUSINESS: REVENUE CHANGE/OPERATING LEVERAGE (1.6 )% (4.4 )% (0.5 )% CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS  10.2 1.7 TOTAL (1.6 ) 5.8 1.2 ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 6.2 2.8 0.2 RESTRUCTURING COSTS  0.7 0.1 IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES  (79.2 ) (13.3 ) TRANSLATION 3.7 4.5 0.5 OTHER  0.1  TOTAL 8.3 % (65.3 )% (11.3 )% OPERATING REVENUES REVENUES INCREASED 8.3% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008 VERSUS THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUES FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION. THE INCREASE IN ACQUISITION REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PURCHASE OF A WORLDWIDE TEST AND MEASUREMENT BUSINESS, A WORLDWIDE GRAPHICS BUSINESS AND A NORTH AMERICAN LABEL BUSINESS. BASE REVENUES FOR THE INDUSTRIAL PLASTIC AND METALS WORLDWIDE, FINISHING WORLDWIDE AND CONSUMER PACKAGING WORLDWIDE BUSINESSES DECLINED 8.2%, 2.1% AND 1.1%, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER NORTH AMERICA END MARKET DEMAND. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 9.5% INCREASE IN BASE REVENUE IN THE TEST AND MEASUREMENT BUSINESS WORLDWIDE PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER EUROPEAN SALES OF AUTOMOTIVE TESTING EQUIPMENT. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 65.3% PRIMARILY DUE TO AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $97.2 MILLION RELATED TO THE GOODWILL OF A WORLDWIDE INDUSTRIAL SOFTWARE BUSINESS. ADDITIONALLY, OPERATING INCOME DECLINED DUE TO THE NEGATIVE LEVERAGE EFFECT OF THE DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES. BASE OPERATING MARGINS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER OVERHEAD COSTS AS A RESULT OF STRONG COST CONTROL MEASURES AND THE BENEFITS OF 2007 RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES. OPERATING REVENUES THE RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES TO TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES IS AS FOLLOWS: AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO 59 OF ITS 60 OPERATING SEGMENTS. WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING SEGMENT. WHEN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY MAY ALSO EMPLOY ADDITIONAL VALUATION TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS MARKET MULTIPLES FROM SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING SEGMENT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE SEGMENTS GOODWILL AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN TOTAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $98.6 MILLION. THE FIRST QUARTER 2008 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $97.2 MILLION RELATED TO THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE INDUSTRIAL SOFTWARE BUSINESS IN THE ALL OTHER SEGMENT. THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE COMBINATION OF LOWER FORECASTS FOR THIS BUSINESS AND LOWER MARKET DRIVEN MULTIPLES THAT WERE BEING PAID FOR SIMILAR BUSINESSES. INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $37.5 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2008 FROM $24.4 MILLION IN 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE 5.25% EURO NOTES ISSUED IN OCTOBER 2007. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) WAS EXPENSE OF $21.4 MILLION FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2008 VERSUS INCOME OF $15.1 MILLION IN 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO EUROPEAN TRANSFER TAXES RELATED TO LEGAL ENTITY STRUCTURING TRANSACTIONS. THE EXPENSE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST INCOME IN 2008, PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS. INCOME TAXES THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST RATE THREE MONTHS OF 2008 WAS 34.64% COMPARED TO 31.14% FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2007. THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM THE IMPAIRMENT OF NON-DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL. EXCLUDING THE IMPAIRMENT, THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE QUARTER WAS 29.01%. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $301.4 MILLION ($0.57 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2008 WAS 21.7% LOWER THAN THE 2007 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $385.0 MILLION ($0.68 PER DILUTED SHARE). FOREIGN CURRENCY THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2008 INCREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2008 BY APPROXIMATELY $193.5 MILLION AND INCREASED EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY 3 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2007 INCREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2007 BY APPROXIMATELY $103.5 MILLION AND INCREASED EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY 2 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE DIVESTITURE OF A CONSUMER PACKAGING BUSINESS WHICH RESULTED IN AN AFTER-TAX GAIN OF $17.4 MILLION. AS OF MARCH 31, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY ALSO CLASSIFIED A CONSUMER PACKAGING AND AN AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS BUSINESS AS HELD FOR SALE. THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THESE BUSINESSES, ALONG WITH THE GAINS REALIZED, NET OF TAX, HAVE BEEN PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. ASSETS OF $141.3 MILLION AND LIABILITIES OF $6.0 MILLION RELATED TO THE TWO BUSINESSES HELD FOR SALE AS OF MARCH 31, 2008 HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS PREPAIDS AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND ACCRUED EXPENSES, RESPECTIVELY. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ON JANUARY 1, 2008, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 158, EMPLOYERS' ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS-AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND 132(R) ("SFAS 158"), WHICH REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO CHANGE ITS MEASUREMENT DATE TO CORRESPOND WITH THE COMPANY'S FISCAL YEAR END. THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY USED A SEPTEMBER 30 MEASUREMENT DATE. AS ALLOWED UNDER SFAS 158, THE COMPANY ELECTED TO REMEASURE ITS PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR. UPON ADOPTION, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $12.8 MILLION TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS AND AN AFTER-TAX GAIN TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF $3.6 MILLION, RELATED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINE OF 25% TO 35% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS AVERAGE INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS USED TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY $2.2 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ROIC FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008 AND 2007 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) THE 330 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN ROIC IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008 WAS THE RESULT OF AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASING 9.8% WHILE AFTER TAX OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 13.2%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $97.2 MILLION IMPAIRMENT OF MOSTLY NON-TAX DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL.
