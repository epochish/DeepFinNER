NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS IN JULY 2006, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION (FIN) NO. 48, ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES  AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109. THIS INTERPRETATION PRESCRIBES A RECOGNITION THRESHOLD AND MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF A TAX POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN, AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION, CLASSIFICATION, AND INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. THIS INTERPRETATION WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON JANUARY 1, 2007, WITH THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE RECORDED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE INTERPRETATION ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION FAS 13-2, (FSP 13-2) ACCOUNTING FOR A CHANGE OR PROJECTED CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES GENERATED BY A LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTION. FSP 13-2 ADDRESSES HOW A CHANGE OR PROJECTED CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES GENERATED BY A LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTION AFFECTS THE ACCOUNTING BY A LESSOR FOR THAT LEASE. FSP 13-2 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON JANUARY 1, 2007, WITH THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE RECORDED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF FSP 13-2 ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 158, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS  AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND 132(R) (SFAS 158).

EFFECTIVE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING 2008, SFAS 158 REQUIRES THE MEASUREMENT DATE FOR PLAN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO COINCIDE WITH THE COMPANYS YEAR-END. THE COMPANY IS EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF SFAS 158 ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE EXISTING DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT OBJECTIVE OF 25-35% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS AVERAGE NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZED ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2006 AND 2005 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW AND NET PROCEEDS FROM DEBT WERE USED TO FUND ACQUISITIONS, REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AND CASH DIVIDENDS. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ROIC FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2006 AND 2005 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) THE 140 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC FOR YEAR-TO-DATE 2006 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO AN 18% INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED OPERATING INCOME FROM BASE BUSINESS AND A DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO 30.5% IN 2006 FROM 32.0% IN 2005. THE ABOVE POSITIVE IMPACT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 9% INCREASE IN AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL PRIMARILY DUE TO ACQUISITIONS. WORKING CAPITAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND DECEMBER 31, 2005 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) TRADE RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES INCREASED DUE TO INCREASED SALES, ACQUISITIONS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO A $168.0 MILLION INCREASE IN INCOME TAX REFUNDS RECEIVABLE. THIS INCREASE IS RELATED TO THE TIMING OF INCOME TAX PAYMENTS AND A FAVORABLE CONCLUSION OF AN IRS TAX AUDIT. SHORT-TERM DEBT INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER IN THE THIRD QUARTER IN ORDER TO FUND THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO ACQUISITIONS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. DEBT TOTAL DEBT AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND DECEMBER 31, 2005 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OF $449.8 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND $94.5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005.

BASE BUSINESS REVENUES INCREASED 5.0% AND 3.9% INTERNATIONALLY FOR THE SAME PERIODS. THE GROWTH IN NORTH AMERICAN REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A REASONABLY STRONG INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT THAT INCLUDES MODERATING DEMAND IN THE CAPITAL EQUIPMENT AND CONSUMABLE MARKETS SERVED BY ITW, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN CONSTRUCTION AND AUTOMOTIVE DEMAND. IMPROVEMENTS IN ECONOMIC GROWTH CONDITIONS IN EUROPE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INTERNATIONAL BASE REVENUE GROWTH IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE. OPERATING INCOME FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2006 IMPROVED DUE TO LEVERAGE FROM THE GROWTH IN BASE BUSINESS REVENUE, INCOME FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND LOWER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES. CURRENCY TRANSLATION POSITIVELY IMPACTED OPERATING INCOME IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006 BUT HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD. VARIABLE MARGINS DECLINED 60 BASIS POINTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO SALES VOLUME DECREASES FOR CERTAIN BUSINESSES IN NORTH AMERICA AND MARGIN DECLINES RELATED TO INCREASED RAW MATERIAL COSTS AND RELATED PRICE INCREASES. FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD, VARIABLE MARGINS INCREASED 50 BASIS POINTS DUE TO OPERATING EFFICIENCY GAINS. INCOME FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD WAS FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY A FIRST QUARTER 2005 CHARGE OF $8.7 MILLION TO RESOLVE ACCOUNTING ISSUES AT A EUROPEAN FOOD EQUIPMENT BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006 WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY A $19.7 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO RETIREE HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE LIABILITIES. AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANYS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $12.2 MILLION WERE INCURRED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006. THE IMPAIRED ASSETS REFLECTED DIMINISHED EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND PRIMARILY RELATED TO A U.S. JOIST BUSINESS, A U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESS, A U.S. THERMAL TRANSFER RIBBON BUSINESS, AN ASIAN CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS AND A CONTAMINATION CONTROL BUSINESS.

THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE SPECIALTY SYSTEMS  INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2006 AND 2005 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2006, THE CHANGES IN REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGINS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30 NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30 % INCREASE (DECREASE) % POINT INCREASE (DECREASE) % INCREASE (DECREASE) % POINT INCREASE (DECREASE) OPERATING REVENUES OPERATING INCOME OPERATING MARGINS OPERATING REVENUES OPERATING INCOME OPERATING MARGINS BASE MANUFACTURING BUSINESS: REVENUE CHANGE/OPERATING LEVERAGE 5.4 % 18.5 % 1.4 % 4.8 % 16.3 % 1.3 % CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS  11.6 1.3  9.5 1.0 TOTAL 5.4 30.1 2.7 4.8 25.8 2.3 ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 10.8 (1.5 ) (1.6 ) 8.8 0.7 (1.1 ) RESTRUCTURING COSTS  18.5 2.0  7.1 0.8 IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES     (0.1 )  TRANSLATION 3.3 3.0 (0.2 ) (2.6 ) (3.2 )  TOTAL 19.5 % 50.1 % 2.9 % 11.0 % 30.3 % 2.0 % REVENUES INCREASED IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO BASE BUSINESS REVENUE GROWTH AND REVENUES FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES. CURRENCY TRANSLATION WAS FAVORABLE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006 AND UNFAVORABLE YEAR-TO-DATE. FOOD EQUIPMENT BASE REVENUES INCREASED 0.8% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND 2.3% YEAR-TO-DATE, DUE PRIMARILY TO GROWTH IN EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONAL DEMAND. INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING BASE REVENUES INCREASED 1.2% AND 1.3% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. OTHER BASE BUSINESS REVENUES, INCLUDING THE WELDING AND FINISHING BUSINESSES, INCREASED 15.3% FOR THE QUARTER AND 12.7% YEAR-TO-DATE LED BY STRONG WELDING EQUIPMENT AND CONSUMABLE SALES IN ASIA AND EUROPE.

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2006 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE REVENUE INCREASES DESCRIBED ABOVE, REDUCED OPERATING COSTS AND LOWER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES. VARIABLE MARGINS INCREASED 80 BASIS POINTS IN BOTH THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006 AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD DUE TO OPERATING EFFICIENCY GAINS AND POSITIVE PRODUCT MIX. IN ADDITION, INCOME FOR BOTH PERIODS WAS FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY LOWER OVERHEAD EXPENSES STEMMING FROM 2005 RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS IN THE FOOD EQUIPMENT, INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING AND DECORATING BUSINESSES. YEAR-TO-DATE INCOME WAS ALSO POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY A NONRECURRING FIRST QUARTER 2005 CHARGE OF $8.7 MILLION TO RESOLVE ACCOUNTING ISSUES AT A EUROPEAN FOOD EQUIPMENT BUSINESS. CURRENCY TRANSLATION POSITIVELY IMPACTED INCOME IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006, BUT HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT YEAR-TO-DATE. OPERATING REVENUES THE RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES TO TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES IS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO APPROXIMATELY 375 OF ITS 700 REPORTING UNITS. WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE UNITS GOODWILL AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL. AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR THE PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND 2005 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30 NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30 2006 2005 2006 2005 GOODWILL: IMPAIRMENT $  $  $ 9,200 $ 6,206 INTANGIBLE ASSETS: AMORTIZATION 25,237 15,770 73,689 45,718 IMPAIRMENT   2,985 5,049 TOTAL $ 25,237 $ 15,770 $ 85,874 $ 56,973 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $12.2 MILLION. THE FIRST QUARTER 2006 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $9.2 MILLION WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO A U.S. JOIST BUSINESS, A U.S. THERMAL TRANSFER RIBBON BUSINESS, AND AN ASIAN CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS AND RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OF $3.0 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESS IN THE SPECIALTY SYSTEMS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT AND A U.S. CONTAMINATION CONTROL BUSINESS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $6.2 MILLION, WHICH WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO A CANADIAN STRETCH PACKAGING EQUIPMENT BUSINESS AND A U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESS, AND WHICH RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED.

INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED TO $58.7 MILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2006 FROM $69.5 MILLION IN 2005 PRIMARILY DUE TO A LOWER AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2006 AND HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2005 DUE TO FORWARD CONTRACT DISCOUNT AMORTIZATION. INVESTMENT INCOME INVESTMENT INCOME DECREASED TO $64.8 MILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2006 FROM $85.6 MILLION IN 2005. THE DECREASE IN 2006 VERSUS 2005 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER GAINS ON SALES OF MORTGAGE INVESTMENT PROPERTIES, LOWER INCOME FROM PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT AS FEWER HOMES WERE SOLD IN 2006 THAN 2005 AND THE NORMAL SCHEDULED DECLINE IN LEVERAGED LEASE INCOME. THESE DECLINES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER GAINS ON VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN 2006 THAN IN 2005. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) OTHER INCOME DECREASED TO $6.9 MILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2006 FROM $9.2 MILLION IN 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO CURRENCY TRANSLATION LOSSES IN 2006 VERSUS GAINS IN 2005. INCOME TAXES THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2006 WAS 30.5%, 1.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS LOWER THAN THE EFFECTIVE RATE FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2005. NET INCOME NET INCOME OF $1,278.5 MILLION ($2.24 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2006 WAS 16.8% HIGHER THAN THE 2005 NET INCOME OF $1,094.3 MILLION ($1.89 PER DILUTED SHARE). FOREIGN CURRENCY THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2006 DECREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2006 BY APPROXIMATELY $77.8 MILLION AND DECREASED EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY 1 CENT PER DILUTED SHARE. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS IN JULY 2006, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION (FIN) NO. 48, ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES  AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109. THIS INTERPRETATION PRESCRIBES A RECOGNITION THRESHOLD AND MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF A TAX POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN, AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION, CLASSIFICATION, AND INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. THIS INTERPRETATION WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON JANUARY 1, 2007, WITH THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE RECORDED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE INTERPRETATION ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION FAS 13-2, (FSP 13-2) ACCOUNTING FOR A CHANGE OR PROJECTED CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES GENERATED BY A LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTION. FSP 13-2 ADDRESSES HOW A CHANGE OR PROJECTED CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES GENERATED BY A LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTION AFFECTS THE ACCOUNTING BY A LESSOR FOR THAT LEASE. FSP 13-2 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON JANUARY 1, 2007, WITH THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE RECORDED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS.

EFFECTIVE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING 2008, SFAS 158 REQUIRES THE MEASUREMENT DATE FOR PLAN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO COINCIDE WITH THE COMPANYS YEAR-END. THE COMPANY IS EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF SFAS 158 ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE EXISTING DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT OBJECTIVE OF 25-35% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS AVERAGE NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZED ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2006 AND 2005 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW AND NET PROCEEDS FROM DEBT WERE USED TO FUND ACQUISITIONS, REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AND CASH DIVIDENDS.

ROIC FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2006 AND 2005 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) THE 140 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC FOR YEAR-TO-DATE 2006 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO AN 18% INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED OPERATING INCOME FROM BASE BUSINESS AND A DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO 30.5% IN 2006 FROM 32.0% IN 2005. THE ABOVE POSITIVE IMPACT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 9% INCREASE IN AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL PRIMARILY DUE TO ACQUISITIONS. WORKING CAPITAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND DECEMBER 31, 2005 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) TRADE RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES INCREASED DUE TO INCREASED SALES, ACQUISITIONS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO A $168.0 MILLION INCREASE IN INCOME TAX REFUNDS RECEIVABLE. THIS INCREASE IS RELATED TO THE TIMING OF INCOME TAX PAYMENTS AND A FAVORABLE CONCLUSION OF AN IRS TAX AUDIT. SHORT-TERM DEBT INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER IN THE THIRD QUARTER IN ORDER TO FUND THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO ACQUISITIONS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. DEBT TOTAL DEBT AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND DECEMBER 31, 2005 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OF $449.8 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND $94.5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005.
