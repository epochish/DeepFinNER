DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA CONTAINED IN THE COMPANY’S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013.ENTERPRISE STRATEGYDURING 2012, THE COMPANY EMBARKED ON AN ENTERPRISE STRATEGY THAT INCLUDES THREE KEY INITIATIVES - PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION, AND STRATEGIC SOURCING. THESE ENTERPRISE INITIATIVES ARE EXPECTED TO ENHANCE THE BUSINESS THROUGH 2017 AND ARE TARGETED AT EXPANDING ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH AND IMPROVING PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS.PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT - THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE AIMS TO CONSTRUCT A BUSINESS PORTFOLIO THAT LEVERAGES THE COMPANY’S DIFFERENTIATED BUSINESS MODEL AND GROWTH POTENTIAL. AS PART OF THIS INITIATIVE, THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS OPERATIONS FOR BUSINESSES THAT MAY NO LONGER BE ALIGNED WITH ITS LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY'S DIVESTITURE ACTIVITY INCREASED OVER HISTORICAL PERIODS IN 2012 AND 2013 AND IS INCREASING FURTHER IN 2014 WITH THE DIVESTITURE OF THE INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENT. THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES WITH COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS WELL AS LARGER ACQUISITIONS THAT REPRESENT POTENTIAL NEW PLATFORMS. GOING FORWARD, THE FOCUS WILL BE ON BUSINESSES WITH SUSTAINABLE DIFFERENTIATION AND GROWTH POTENTIAL. REFER TO THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NOTE IN ITEM 1 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY’S DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION - THE BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION INITIATIVE SIMPLIFIES THE COMPANY'S ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL AND ADDS SCALE TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATING DIVISIONS IN ORDER TO INCREASE ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH, ENHANCE GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS AND DRIVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES. THIS INITIATIVE FOCUSES ON REDUCING THE NUMBER OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING DIVISIONS AND INCREASING THE AVERAGE REVENUE SIZE OF EACH DIVISION, WHILE RETAINING THE POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES OF A DECENTRALIZED OPERATING MODEL. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO ENHANCE ITS PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF APPLYING ITS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS TO THE NEW DIVISIONS, MORE FOCUSED GROWTH INVESTMENTS AND REDUCED INFRASTRUCTURE.STRATEGIC SOURCING - THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC SOURCING INITIATIVE FOCUSES ON BUILDING SOURCING CAPABILITY IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE PURCHASING SCALE TO ENHANCE PROFITABILITY AND GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS. IT INCORPORATES BOTH ENTERPRISE-LEVEL AND SEGMENT-LEVEL PURCHASING THAT CROSS THE COMPANY'S MANY BUSINESSES. THIS INITIATIVE IS EXPECTED TO TRANSFORM SOURCING INTO A CORE STRATEGIC FUNCTION IN THE COMPANY.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSTHE COMPANY PERIODICALLY REVIEWS ITS OPERATIONS FOR BUSINESSES WHICH MAY NO LONGER BE ALIGNED WITH ITS ENTERPRISE INITIATIVES AND LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY MAY COMMIT TO A PLAN TO EXIT OR DISPOSE OF CERTAIN BUSINESSES AND PRESENT THEM AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. 10IN FEBRUARY 2013, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS INITIATING A REVIEW PROCESS TO EXPLORE STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES FOR THE INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENT.

AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE PERIOD AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014 AND 2013, ADJUSTED ROIC WAS AS FOLLOWS:THE ANNUALIZED ADJUSTED ROIC INCREASE OF 240 BASIS POINTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014 COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF AN IMPROVEMENT IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME OF 13.9% AND A 1.9% DECREASE IN ADJUSTED AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL.24WORKING CAPITALMANAGEMENT USES WORKING CAPITAL AS A MEASUREMENT OF THE SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY.

PROCEEDS FROM THE FEBRUARY 2014 DEBT ISSUANCES WERE USED TO REPAY COMMERCIAL PAPER.TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDATHE COMPANY USES THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA TO MEASURE ITS ABILITY TO REPAY ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S LONG TERM FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA. ADJUSTED EBITDA AND THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA REPRESENTS TOTAL DEBT DIVIDED BY INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ON A TRAILING TWELVE MONTH BASIS.TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING TWELVE MONTH PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, 2014 AND DECEMBER 31, 2013 WAS AS FOLLOWS:STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITYTHE CHANGES TO STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY DURING 2014 WERE AS FOLLOWS:(IN MILLIONS) TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY, DECEMBER 31, 2013$9,709NET INCOME473CASH DIVIDENDS DECLARED(174)REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK(1,500)STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK ACTIVITY34FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS28OTHER10TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY, MARCH 31, 2014$8,58026FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSTHIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.

AS PART OF THIS INITIATIVE, THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS OPERATIONS FOR BUSINESSES THAT MAY NO LONGER BE ALIGNED WITH ITS LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY'S DIVESTITURE ACTIVITY INCREASED OVER HISTORICAL PERIODS IN 2012 AND 2013 AND IS INCREASING FURTHER IN 2014 WITH THE DIVESTITURE OF THE INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENT. THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES WITH COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS WELL AS LARGER ACQUISITIONS THAT REPRESENT POTENTIAL NEW PLATFORMS. GOING FORWARD, THE FOCUS WILL BE ON BUSINESSES WITH SUSTAINABLE DIFFERENTIATION AND GROWTH POTENTIAL.
