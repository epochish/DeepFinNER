ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSINTRODUCTIONILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. (THE "COMPANY" OR "ITW") IS A GLOBAL MANUFACTURER OF A DIVERSIFIED RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT WITH 87 DIVISIONS IN 55 COUNTRIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE COMPANY EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 48,000 PEOPLE.THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS ARE ORGANIZED AND MANAGED BASED ON SIMILAR PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND END MARKETS, AND ARE REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT AS THE FOLLOWING SEVEN SEGMENTS: AUTOMOTIVE OEM; FOOD EQUIPMENT; TEST & MEASUREMENT AND ELECTRONICS; WELDING; POLYMERS & FLUIDS; CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS; AND SPECIALTY PRODUCTS.DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF DIVERSE BUSINESSES AND THE COMPANY'S DECENTRALIZED OPERATING STRUCTURE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT REQUIRE ITS BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE DETAILED INFORMATION ON OPERATING RESULTS. INSTEAD, THE COMPANY'S CORPORATE MANAGEMENT COLLECTS DATA ON SEVERAL KEY MEASUREMENTS: OPERATING REVENUE, OPERATING INCOME, OPERATING MARGIN, OVERHEAD COSTS, NUMBER OF MONTHS ON HAND IN INVENTORY, DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PAST DUE RECEIVABLES AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. THESE KEY MEASURES ARE MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OPERATING RESULTS VERSUS CURRENT TRENDS IN END MARKETS AND VARIANCES FROM FORECASTS ARE DISCUSSED WITH OPERATING UNIT MANAGEMENT.THE ITW BUSINESS MODELTHE POWERFUL AND HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED ITW BUSINESS MODEL IS THE COMPANY’S CORE SOURCE OF VALUE CREATION. THIS BUSINESS MODEL IS THE COMPANY’S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND DEFINES HOW ITW CREATES VALUE FOR ITS SHAREHOLDERS AND COMPRISES THREE UNIQUE ELEMENTS:•ITW’S 80/20 FRONT-TO-BACK PROCESS IS THE OPERATING SYSTEM THAT IS APPLIED IN EVERY ITW BUSINESS. INITIALLY INTRODUCED AS A MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY TOOL IN THE 1980S, ITW HAS CONTINUALLY REFINED, IMPROVED AND EXPANDED 80/20 INTO A PROPRIETARY, HOLISTIC BUSINESS MANAGEMENT PROCESS THAT GENERATES SIGNIFICANT VALUE FOR THE COMPANY AND ITS CUSTOMERS. THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF DATA DRIVEN INSIGHTS GENERATED BY 80/20 PRACTICE, ITW FOCUSES ON ITS LARGEST AND BEST OPPORTUNITIES (THE “80”) AND ELIMINATES COST, COMPLEXITY AND DISTRACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LESS PROFITABLE OPPORTUNITIES (THE “20”). 80/20 ENABLES ITW BUSINESSES TO CONSISTENTLY ACHIEVE WORLD-CLASS OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE IN PRODUCT AVAILABILITY, QUALITY, AND INNOVATION, WHILE GENERATING SUPERIOR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE;•CUSTOMER-BACK INNOVATION HAS FUELED DECADES OF PROFITABLE GROWTH AT ITW. THE COMPANY’S UNIQUE INNOVATION APPROACH IS BUILT ON INSIGHT GATHERED FROM THE 80/20 FRONT-TO-BACK PROCESS. WORKING FROM THE CUSTOMER BACK, ITW BUSINESSES POSITION THEMSELVES AS THE GO-TO PROBLEM SOLVER FOR THEIR “80” CUSTOMERS. ITW’S INNOVATION EFFORTS ARE FOCUSED ON UNDERSTANDING CUSTOMER NEEDS, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN “80” MARKETS WITH SOLID LONG-TERM GROWTH FUNDAMENTALS, AND SUBSEQUENTLY CREATING UNIQUE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. THESE CUSTOMER INSIGHTS AND LEARNINGS DRIVE INNOVATION AT ITW AND HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A PORTFOLIO OF APPROXIMATELY 18,000 GRANTED AND PENDING PATENTS;•ITW’S DECENTRALIZED, ENTREPRENEURIAL CULTURE ENABLES ITW BUSINESSES TO BE FAST, FOCUSED, AND RESPONSIVE. ITW BUSINESSES HAVE SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL TO CUSTOMIZE THEIR APPROACH IN ORDER TO BEST SERVE THEIR SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS' NEEDS. ITW COLLEAGUES RECOGNIZE THEIR UNIQUE RESPONSIBILITIES TO EXECUTE THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY AND VALUES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A FOCUSED AND SIMPLE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE THAT, COMBINED WITH OUTSTANDING EXECUTION, DELIVERS BEST-IN-CLASS SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS ADAPTED TO EACH BUSINESS' CUSTOMERS AND END MARKETS.ENTERPRISE STRATEGYIN LATE 2012, ITW BEGAN ITS STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK TRANSITIONING THE COMPANY ON ITS CURRENT PATH TO FULLY LEVERAGE THE COMPELLING PERFORMANCE POTENTIAL OF THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL. SINCE THEN, ITW HAS MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN ITS PATH TO FULL POTENTIAL.THE ROOTS OF ITW’S ENTERPRISE STRATEGY BEGAN IN LATE 2011 / EARLY 2012, WHEN THE COMPANY UNDERTOOK A COMPLETE REVIEW OF ITS PERFORMANCE. FOCUSING ON ITS BUSINESSES DELIVERING CONSISTENT ABOVE-MARKET GROWTH WITH BEST-IN-CLASS MARGINS AND RETURNS, ITW DEVELOPED A STRATEGY TO REPLICATE THAT PERFORMANCE ACROSS ITS OPERATIONS.BASED ON THIS RIGOROUS EVALUATION, ITW DETERMINED THAT SOLID AND CONSISTENT ABOVE-MARKET ORGANIC GROWTH MUST BE THE CORE GROWTH ENGINE TO DELIVER WORLD-CLASS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND COMPELLING LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR ITS SHAREHOLDERS. TO SHIFT ITS PRIMARY GROWTH ENGINE TO ORGANIC, THE COMPANY BEGAN EXECUTING A MULTI-STEP APPROACH.15•THE FIRST STEP WAS TO NARROW THE FOCUS AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF ITW’S BUSINESS PORTFOLIO. AS PART OF THE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE, ITW EXITED BUSINESSES THAT WERE OPERATING IN COMMODITIZED MARKET SPACES AND PRIORITIZED SUSTAINABLE DIFFERENTIATION AS A MUST-HAVE REQUIREMENT FOR ALL ITW BUSINESSES. THIS PROCESS INCLUDED BOTH DIVESTING ENTIRE BUSINESSES AND EXITING COMMODITIZED PRODUCT LINES AND CUSTOMERS INSIDE OTHERWISE HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED ITW DIVISIONS.AS A RESULT OF THIS WORK, ITW’S BUSINESS PORTFOLIO NOW HAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ORGANIC GROWTH POTENTIAL. ITW SEGMENTS AND DIVISIONS NOW POSSESS ATTRACTIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCT LINES AND END MARKETS AS THEY CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OPERATING MARGINS AND GENERATE PRICE/COST INCREASES. THE COMPANY ACHIEVED THIS THROUGH PRODUCT LINE SIMPLIFICATION, OR ELIMINATING THE COMPLEXITY AND OVERHEAD COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SMALLER PRODUCT LINES AND CUSTOMERS, WHILE SUPPORTING AND GROWING THE BUSINESSES’ LARGEST / MOST PROFITABLE CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCT LINES. •STEP TWO, BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION, WAS IMPLEMENTED TO SIMPLIFY AND SCALE-UP ITW’S OPERATING STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT INCREASED ENGINEERING, MARKETING, AND SALES RESOURCES, AND, AT THE SAME TIME, IMPROVE GLOBAL REACH AND COMPETITIVENESS, ALL OF WHICH WERE CRITICAL TO DRIVING ACCELERATED ORGANIC GROWTH. ITW NOW HAS 87 SCALED-UP DIVISIONS WITH SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED FOCUS ON GROWTH INVESTMENTS, CORE CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCTS, AND CUSTOMER-BACK INNOVATION.•THE STRATEGIC SOURCING INITIATIVE ESTABLISHED SOURCING AS A CORE STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY AT ITW. THE COMPANY’S 80/20-ENABLED SOURCING ORGANIZATION HAS DELIVERED AN AVERAGE OF ONE PERCENT REDUCTION IN SPEND EACH YEAR FROM 2013 THROUGH 2018 AND IS ON TRACK TO DO THE SAME IN 2019.•WITH THE INITIAL PORTFOLIO REALIGNMENT AND SCALE-UP WORK LARGELY COMPLETE, THE COMPANY HAS SHIFTED ITS FOCUS TO PREPARING FOR AND ACCELERATING ORGANIC GROWTH, REAPPLYING THE 80/20 FRONT-TO-BACK PROCESS TO OPTIMIZE ITS NEWLY SCALED-UP DIVISIONS FOR GROWTH, FIRST, TO BUILD A FOUNDATION OF OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, AND SECOND, TO IDENTIFY THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES TO DRIVE ORGANIC GROWTH.ITW HAS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR 80/20 MANAGEMENT, RESULTING IN MEANINGFUL INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENT IN MARGINS AND RETURNS AS EVIDENCED BY THE COMPANY’S OPERATING MARGIN AND AFTER-TAX RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. AT THE SAME TIME, THESE 80/20 INITIATIVES CAN ALSO RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES THAT REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS.PATH TO FULL POTENTIAL - FINISHING THE JOBSINCE THE LAUNCH OF THE ENTERPRISE STRATEGY, THE COMPANY HAS MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS TO POSITION ITSELF TO REACH FULL POTENTIAL. THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL AND UNIQUE SET OF CAPABILITIES ARE A SOURCE OF STRONG AND ENDURING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, BUT FOR THE COMPANY TO TRULY REACH ITS FULL POTENTIAL OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, EVERY ONE OF ITS DIVISIONS MUST ALSO BE OPERATING AT ITS FULL POTENTIAL. TO DO SO, THE COMPANY REMAINS FOCUSED ON THREE KEY AREAS TO FINISH THE JOB OF POSITIONING ITW TO PERFORM TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL:•PORTFOLIO DISCIPLINE•80/20 FRONT-TO-BACK PRACTICE EXCELLENCE•FULL-POTENTIAL ORGANIC GROWTHPORTFOLIO DISCIPLINETHE COMPANY ONLY OPERATES IN INDUSTRIES WHERE IT CAN GENERATE SIGNIFICANT, LONG-TERM COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FROM THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL. ITW BUSINESSES HAVE THE RIGHT “RAW MATERIAL” IN TERMS OF MARKET AND BUSINESS ATTRIBUTES THAT BEST FIT THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL AND HAVE SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL TO DRIVE ABOVE-MARKET ORGANIC GROWTH OVER THE LONG-TERM.THE COMPANY FOCUSES ON HIGH-QUALITY BUSINESSES, ENSURING IT OPERATES IN MARKETS WITH POSITIVE LONG-TERM MACRO FUNDAMENTALS AND WITH CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE CRITICAL NEEDS AND VALUE ITW'S DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS. ITW’S PORTFOLIO OPERATES IN DIVERSE END MARKETS AND GEOGRAPHIES WHICH MAKES THE COMPANY MORE RESILIENT IN THE FACE OF UNCERTAIN OR VOLATILE MARKET ENVIRONMENTS.80/20 FRONT-TO-BACK PRACTICE EXCELLENCETHE 80/20 FRONT-TO-BACK PROCESS IS A RIGOROUS, ITERATIVE AND HIGHLY DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH TO IDENTIFY WHERE THE COMPANY HAS TRUE DIFFERENTIATION AND THE ABILITY TO DRIVE SUSTAINABLE, HIGH-QUALITY ORGANIC GROWTH. THE COMPANY SIMPLIFIES AND ELIMINATES COMPLEXITY AND REDESIGNS EVERY ASPECT OF ITS BUSINESS TO ENSURE FOCUSED EXECUTION ON KEY OPPORTUNITIES, MARKETS, CUSTOMERS, 16AND PRODUCTS. ITW WILL CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO DRIVE 80/20 FRONT-TO-BACK PRACTICE EXCELLENCE IN EVERY DIVISION IN THE COMPANY, EVERY DAY.FULL-POTENTIAL ORGANIC GROWTHREACHING FULL POTENTIAL MEANS THAT EVERY DIVISION IS POSITIONED FOR SUSTAINABLE, HIGH-QUALITY ORGANIC GROWTH. THE COMPANY HAS CLEARLY DEFINED ACTION PLANS AIMED AT LEVERAGING THE PERFORMANCE POWER OF THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL TO ACHIEVE FULL-POTENTIAL ORGANIC GROWTH IN EVERY DIVISION. AT THE SAME TIME, THE COMPANY CONSISTENTLY REVIEWS ITS PORTFOLIO, ASSESSES BUSINESSES THAT ARE GROWTH-CHALLENGED AND EVALUATES IF FURTHER PORTFOLIO REFINEMENTS MAY BE NEEDED. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EXPLORING OPTIONS, INCLUDING POTENTIAL DIVESTITURES, FOR CERTAIN BUSINESSES WITH REVENUES TOTALING UP TO $1 BILLION. IF A DECISION IS MADE TO DIVEST ANY OF THESE BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT EARNINGS PER SHARE DILUTION WOULD BE OFFSET BY INCREMENTAL SHARE REPURCHASES.TERMS USED BY ITWMANAGEMENT USES THE FOLLOWING TERMS TO DESCRIBE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY:•ORGANIC BUSINESS - ACQUIRED BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR MORE THAN 12 MONTHS ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS.•OPERATING LEVERAGE - THE ESTIMATED EFFECT OF THE ORGANIC REVENUE VOLUME CHANGES ON ORGANIC OPERATING INCOME, ASSUMING VARIABLE MARGINS REMAIN THE SAME AS THE PRIOR PERIOD.•PRICE/COST - REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED NET IMPACT OF INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THE COST OF MATERIALS USED IN THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS VERSUS CHANGES IN THE SELLING PRICE TO THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS.•PRODUCT LINE SIMPLIFICATION (PLS) - FOCUSES BUSINESSES ON ELIMINATING THE COMPLEXITY AND OVERHEAD COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SMALLER PRODUCT LINES AND CUSTOMERS, AND FOCUSES BUSINESSES ON SUPPORTING AND GROWING THEIR LARGEST CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCT LINES; IN THE SHORT-TERM, PLS MAY RESULT IN A DECREASE IN REVENUE AND OVERHEAD COSTS WHILE IMPROVING OPERATING MARGIN.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSINTRODUCTIONILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. (THE "COMPANY" OR "ITW") IS A GLOBAL MANUFACTURER OF A DIVERSIFIED RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT WITH 87 DIVISIONS IN 55 COUNTRIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE COMPANY EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 48,000 PEOPLE.THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS ARE ORGANIZED AND MANAGED BASED ON SIMILAR PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND END MARKETS, AND ARE REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT AS THE FOLLOWING SEVEN SEGMENTS: AUTOMOTIVE OEM; FOOD EQUIPMENT; TEST & MEASUREMENT AND ELECTRONICS; WELDING; POLYMERS & FLUIDS; CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS; AND SPECIALTY PRODUCTS.DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF DIVERSE BUSINESSES AND THE COMPANY'S DECENTRALIZED OPERATING STRUCTURE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT REQUIRE ITS BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE DETAILED INFORMATION ON OPERATING RESULTS. INSTEAD, THE COMPANY'S CORPORATE MANAGEMENT COLLECTS DATA ON SEVERAL KEY MEASUREMENTS: OPERATING REVENUE, OPERATING INCOME, OPERATING MARGIN, OVERHEAD COSTS, NUMBER OF MONTHS ON HAND IN INVENTORY, DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PAST DUE RECEIVABLES AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. THESE KEY MEASURES ARE MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OPERATING RESULTS VERSUS CURRENT TRENDS IN END MARKETS AND VARIANCES FROM FORECASTS ARE DISCUSSED WITH OPERATING UNIT MANAGEMENT.THE ITW BUSINESS MODELTHE POWERFUL AND HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED ITW BUSINESS MODEL IS THE COMPANY’S CORE SOURCE OF VALUE CREATION. THIS BUSINESS MODEL IS THE COMPANY’S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND DEFINES HOW ITW CREATES VALUE FOR ITS SHAREHOLDERS AND COMPRISES THREE UNIQUE ELEMENTS:•ITW’S 80/20 FRONT-TO-BACK PROCESS IS THE OPERATING SYSTEM THAT IS APPLIED IN EVERY ITW BUSINESS. INITIALLY INTRODUCED AS A MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY TOOL IN THE 1980S, ITW HAS CONTINUALLY REFINED, IMPROVED AND EXPANDED 80/20 INTO A PROPRIETARY, HOLISTIC BUSINESS MANAGEMENT PROCESS THAT GENERATES SIGNIFICANT VALUE FOR THE COMPANY AND ITS CUSTOMERS. THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF DATA DRIVEN INSIGHTS GENERATED BY 80/20 PRACTICE, ITW FOCUSES ON ITS LARGEST AND BEST OPPORTUNITIES (THE “80”) AND ELIMINATES COST, COMPLEXITY AND DISTRACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LESS PROFITABLE OPPORTUNITIES (THE “20”). 80/20 ENABLES ITW BUSINESSES TO CONSISTENTLY ACHIEVE WORLD-CLASS OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE IN PRODUCT AVAILABILITY, QUALITY, AND INNOVATION, WHILE GENERATING SUPERIOR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE;•CUSTOMER-BACK INNOVATION HAS FUELED DECADES OF PROFITABLE GROWTH AT ITW. THE COMPANY’S UNIQUE INNOVATION APPROACH IS BUILT ON INSIGHT GATHERED FROM THE 80/20 FRONT-TO-BACK PROCESS. WORKING FROM THE CUSTOMER BACK, ITW BUSINESSES POSITION THEMSELVES AS THE GO-TO PROBLEM SOLVER FOR THEIR “80” CUSTOMERS. ITW’S INNOVATION EFFORTS ARE FOCUSED ON UNDERSTANDING CUSTOMER NEEDS, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN “80” MARKETS WITH SOLID LONG-TERM GROWTH FUNDAMENTALS, AND SUBSEQUENTLY CREATING UNIQUE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. THESE CUSTOMER INSIGHTS AND LEARNINGS DRIVE INNOVATION AT ITW AND HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A PORTFOLIO OF APPROXIMATELY 18,000 GRANTED AND PENDING PATENTS;•ITW’S DECENTRALIZED, ENTREPRENEURIAL CULTURE ENABLES ITW BUSINESSES TO BE FAST, FOCUSED, AND RESPONSIVE. ITW BUSINESSES HAVE SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL TO CUSTOMIZE THEIR APPROACH IN ORDER TO BEST SERVE THEIR SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS' NEEDS. ITW COLLEAGUES RECOGNIZE THEIR UNIQUE RESPONSIBILITIES TO EXECUTE THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY AND VALUES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A FOCUSED AND SIMPLE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE THAT, COMBINED WITH OUTSTANDING EXECUTION, DELIVERS BEST-IN-CLASS SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS ADAPTED TO EACH BUSINESS' CUSTOMERS AND END MARKETS.ENTERPRISE STRATEGYIN LATE 2012, ITW BEGAN ITS STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK TRANSITIONING THE COMPANY ON ITS CURRENT PATH TO FULLY LEVERAGE THE COMPELLING PERFORMANCE POTENTIAL OF THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL. SINCE THEN, ITW HAS MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN ITS PATH TO FULL POTENTIAL.THE ROOTS OF ITW’S ENTERPRISE STRATEGY BEGAN IN LATE 2011 / EARLY 2012, WHEN THE COMPANY UNDERTOOK A COMPLETE REVIEW OF ITS PERFORMANCE. FOCUSING ON ITS BUSINESSES DELIVERING CONSISTENT ABOVE-MARKET GROWTH WITH BEST-IN-CLASS MARGINS AND RETURNS, ITW DEVELOPED A STRATEGY TO REPLICATE THAT PERFORMANCE ACROSS ITS OPERATIONS.BASED ON THIS RIGOROUS EVALUATION, ITW DETERMINED THAT SOLID AND CONSISTENT ABOVE-MARKET ORGANIC GROWTH MUST BE THE CORE GROWTH ENGINE TO DELIVER WORLD-CLASS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND COMPELLING LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR ITS SHAREHOLDERS. TO SHIFT ITS PRIMARY GROWTH ENGINE TO ORGANIC, THE COMPANY BEGAN EXECUTING A MULTI-STEP APPROACH.15•THE FIRST STEP WAS TO NARROW THE FOCUS AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF ITW’S BUSINESS PORTFOLIO. AS PART OF THE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE, ITW EXITED BUSINESSES THAT WERE OPERATING IN COMMODITIZED MARKET SPACES AND PRIORITIZED SUSTAINABLE DIFFERENTIATION AS A MUST-HAVE REQUIREMENT FOR ALL ITW BUSINESSES. THIS PROCESS INCLUDED BOTH DIVESTING ENTIRE BUSINESSES AND EXITING COMMODITIZED PRODUCT LINES AND CUSTOMERS INSIDE OTHERWISE HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED ITW DIVISIONS.AS A RESULT OF THIS WORK, ITW’S BUSINESS PORTFOLIO NOW HAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ORGANIC GROWTH POTENTIAL. ITW SEGMENTS AND DIVISIONS NOW POSSESS ATTRACTIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCT LINES AND END MARKETS AS THEY CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OPERATING MARGINS AND GENERATE PRICE/COST INCREASES. THE COMPANY ACHIEVED THIS THROUGH PRODUCT LINE SIMPLIFICATION, OR ELIMINATING THE COMPLEXITY AND OVERHEAD COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SMALLER PRODUCT LINES AND CUSTOMERS, WHILE SUPPORTING AND GROWING THE BUSINESSES’ LARGEST / MOST PROFITABLE CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCT LINES. •STEP TWO, BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION, WAS IMPLEMENTED TO SIMPLIFY AND SCALE-UP ITW’S OPERATING STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT INCREASED ENGINEERING, MARKETING, AND SALES RESOURCES, AND, AT THE SAME TIME, IMPROVE GLOBAL REACH AND COMPETITIVENESS, ALL OF WHICH WERE CRITICAL TO DRIVING ACCELERATED ORGANIC GROWTH. ITW NOW HAS 87 SCALED-UP DIVISIONS WITH SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED FOCUS ON GROWTH INVESTMENTS, CORE CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCTS, AND CUSTOMER-BACK INNOVATION.•THE STRATEGIC SOURCING INITIATIVE ESTABLISHED SOURCING AS A CORE STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY AT ITW. THE COMPANY’S 80/20-ENABLED SOURCING ORGANIZATION HAS DELIVERED AN AVERAGE OF ONE PERCENT REDUCTION IN SPEND EACH YEAR FROM 2013 THROUGH 2018 AND IS ON TRACK TO DO THE SAME IN 2019.•WITH THE INITIAL PORTFOLIO REALIGNMENT AND SCALE-UP WORK LARGELY COMPLETE, THE COMPANY HAS SHIFTED ITS FOCUS TO PREPARING FOR AND ACCELERATING ORGANIC GROWTH, REAPPLYING THE 80/20 FRONT-TO-BACK PROCESS TO OPTIMIZE ITS NEWLY SCALED-UP DIVISIONS FOR GROWTH, FIRST, TO BUILD A FOUNDATION OF OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, AND SECOND, TO IDENTIFY THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES TO DRIVE ORGANIC GROWTH.ITW HAS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR 80/20 MANAGEMENT, RESULTING IN MEANINGFUL INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENT IN MARGINS AND RETURNS AS EVIDENCED BY THE COMPANY’S OPERATING MARGIN AND AFTER-TAX RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. AT THE SAME TIME, THESE 80/20 INITIATIVES CAN ALSO RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES THAT REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS.PATH TO FULL POTENTIAL - FINISHING THE JOBSINCE THE LAUNCH OF THE ENTERPRISE STRATEGY, THE COMPANY HAS MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS TO POSITION ITSELF TO REACH FULL POTENTIAL. THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL AND UNIQUE SET OF CAPABILITIES ARE A SOURCE OF STRONG AND ENDURING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, BUT FOR THE COMPANY TO TRULY REACH ITS FULL POTENTIAL OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, EVERY ONE OF ITS DIVISIONS MUST ALSO BE OPERATING AT ITS FULL POTENTIAL. TO DO SO, THE COMPANY REMAINS FOCUSED ON THREE KEY AREAS TO FINISH THE JOB OF POSITIONING ITW TO PERFORM TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL:•PORTFOLIO DISCIPLINE•80/20 FRONT-TO-BACK PRACTICE EXCELLENCE•FULL-POTENTIAL ORGANIC GROWTHPORTFOLIO DISCIPLINETHE COMPANY ONLY OPERATES IN INDUSTRIES WHERE IT CAN GENERATE SIGNIFICANT, LONG-TERM COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FROM THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL. ITW BUSINESSES HAVE THE RIGHT “RAW MATERIAL” IN TERMS OF MARKET AND BUSINESS ATTRIBUTES THAT BEST FIT THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL AND HAVE SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL TO DRIVE ABOVE-MARKET ORGANIC GROWTH OVER THE LONG-TERM.THE COMPANY FOCUSES ON HIGH-QUALITY BUSINESSES, ENSURING IT OPERATES IN MARKETS WITH POSITIVE LONG-TERM MACRO FUNDAMENTALS AND WITH CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE CRITICAL NEEDS AND VALUE ITW'S DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS. ITW’S PORTFOLIO OPERATES IN DIVERSE END MARKETS AND GEOGRAPHIES WHICH MAKES THE COMPANY MORE RESILIENT IN THE FACE OF UNCERTAIN OR VOLATILE MARKET ENVIRONMENTS.80/20 FRONT-TO-BACK PRACTICE EXCELLENCETHE 80/20 FRONT-TO-BACK PROCESS IS A RIGOROUS, ITERATIVE AND HIGHLY DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH TO IDENTIFY WHERE THE COMPANY HAS TRUE DIFFERENTIATION AND THE ABILITY TO DRIVE SUSTAINABLE, HIGH-QUALITY ORGANIC GROWTH. THE COMPANY SIMPLIFIES AND ELIMINATES COMPLEXITY AND REDESIGNS EVERY ASPECT OF ITS BUSINESS TO ENSURE FOCUSED EXECUTION ON KEY OPPORTUNITIES, MARKETS, CUSTOMERS, 16AND PRODUCTS. ITW WILL CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO DRIVE 80/20 FRONT-TO-BACK PRACTICE EXCELLENCE IN EVERY DIVISION IN THE COMPANY, EVERY DAY.FULL-POTENTIAL ORGANIC GROWTHREACHING FULL POTENTIAL MEANS THAT EVERY DIVISION IS POSITIONED FOR SUSTAINABLE, HIGH-QUALITY ORGANIC GROWTH. THE COMPANY HAS CLEARLY DEFINED ACTION PLANS AIMED AT LEVERAGING THE PERFORMANCE POWER OF THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL TO ACHIEVE FULL-POTENTIAL ORGANIC GROWTH IN EVERY DIVISION. AT THE SAME TIME, THE COMPANY CONSISTENTLY REVIEWS ITS PORTFOLIO, ASSESSES BUSINESSES THAT ARE GROWTH-CHALLENGED AND EVALUATES IF FURTHER PORTFOLIO REFINEMENTS MAY BE NEEDED. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EXPLORING OPTIONS, INCLUDING POTENTIAL DIVESTITURES, FOR CERTAIN BUSINESSES WITH REVENUES TOTALING UP TO $1 BILLION. IF A DECISION IS MADE TO DIVEST ANY OF THESE BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT EARNINGS PER SHARE DILUTION WOULD BE OFFSET BY INCREMENTAL SHARE REPURCHASES.TERMS USED BY ITWMANAGEMENT USES THE FOLLOWING TERMS TO DESCRIBE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY:•ORGANIC BUSINESS - ACQUIRED BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR MORE THAN 12 MONTHS ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS.•OPERATING LEVERAGE - THE ESTIMATED EFFECT OF THE ORGANIC REVENUE VOLUME CHANGES ON ORGANIC OPERATING INCOME, ASSUMING VARIABLE MARGINS REMAIN THE SAME AS THE PRIOR PERIOD.•PRICE/COST - REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED NET IMPACT OF INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THE COST OF MATERIALS USED IN THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS VERSUS CHANGES IN THE SELLING PRICE TO THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS.•PRODUCT LINE SIMPLIFICATION (PLS) - FOCUSES BUSINESSES ON ELIMINATING THE COMPLEXITY AND OVERHEAD COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SMALLER PRODUCT LINES AND CUSTOMERS, AND FOCUSES BUSINESSES ON SUPPORTING AND GROWING THEIR LARGEST CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCT LINES; IN THE SHORT-TERM, PLS MAY RESULT IN A DECREASE IN REVENUE AND OVERHEAD COSTS WHILE IMPROVING OPERATING MARGIN. IN THE LONG-TERM, PLS IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN GROWTH IN REVENUE, PROFITABILITY, AND RETURNS.UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED, THE CHANGES IN FINANCIAL RESULTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT REPRESENT THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD VERSUS THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.
