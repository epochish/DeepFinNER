DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSINTRODUCTIONMANAGEMENT ANALYZES THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE RESULTS OF EACH SEGMENT BY IDENTIFYING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN THE RESULTS OF THE ORGANIC BUSINESS (BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR MORE THAN 12 MONTHS), NEWLY ACQUIRED AND RECENTLY DIVESTED COMPANIES, RESTRUCTURING COSTS, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AND CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON THE OPERATING REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME OF EACH SEGMENT. THE CHANGES TO OPERATING INCOME OF ORGANIC BUSINESSES INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF BOTH OPERATING LEVERAGE AND CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS. OPERATING LEVERAGE IS THE ESTIMATED EFFECT OF THE ORGANIC REVENUE VOLUME CHANGES ON ORGANIC OPERATING INCOME, ASSUMING VARIABLE MARGINS REMAIN THE SAME AS THE PRIOR PERIOD. AS MANUFACTURING AND ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD COSTS USUALLY DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE AS A RESULT OF REVENUES INCREASING OR DECREASING, THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN OPERATING INCOME DUE TO OPERATING LEVERAGE IS USUALLY MORE THAN THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE REVENUES. CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED EFFECT OF NON-VOLUME RELATED CHANGES IN THE OPERATING INCOME OF ORGANIC BUSINESSES AND MAY BE DRIVEN BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX, THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS, LABOR AND OVERHEAD, AND PRICING TO CUSTOMERS. SELLING PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED NET IMPACT OF INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THE COST OF MATERIALS USED IN THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS VERSUS CHANGES IN THE SELLING PRICE TO THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THESE PRICE VERSUS COST COMPARISONS BY ANALYZING THE NET IMPACT OF CHANGES TO EACH SEGMENT'S OPERATING MARGIN.ENTERPRISE STRATEGYIN 2012, THE COMPANY EMBARKED ON AN ENTERPRISE STRATEGY WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF FULLY LEVERAGING ITW’S CORE CAPABILITIES TO DELIVER STRONG FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. ITW’S ENTERPRISE STRATEGY IS CENTERED ON THREE KEY INITIATIVES - PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION, AND STRATEGIC SOURCING. THESE ENTERPRISE INITIATIVES ARE EXPECTED TO ENHANCE THE BUSINESS THROUGH 2017 AND ARE TARGETED AT EXPANDING ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH AND IMPROVING PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS.THE FOUNDATION OF THIS STRATEGY IS A SET OF BUSINESS PRACTICES REFERRED TO AS THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL CONSISTING OF THREE CORE ELEMENTS:80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS - THE CONCEPT OF THE 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS IS TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT (THE 20% OF THE ITEMS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 80% OF THE VALUE) AND TO SPEND LESS TIME AND RESOURCES ON THE LESS IMPORTANT (THE 80% OF THE ITEMS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 20% OF THE VALUE). THE COMPANY USES THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS TO SIMPLIFY AND FOCUS ON THE KEY DRIVERS OF BUSINESS PROFITABILITY, AND AS A RESULT, REDUCES COMPLEXITY THAT OFTEN CREATES UNNECESSARY EXPENSE AND DISGUISES WHAT IS TRULY IMPORTANT. THE COMPANY UTILIZES THE 80/20 PROCESS IN ALL ASPECTS OF ITS BUSINESS. COMMON APPLICATIONS OF THE 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS INCLUDE:•SIMPLIFYING PRODUCT LINES BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS OFFERED BY COMBINING THE FEATURES OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS, OUTSOURCING PRODUCTS OR ELIMINATING LOW-VALUE PRODUCTS.•SEGMENTING THE CUSTOMER BASE BY FOCUSING ON THE 80/20 CUSTOMERS SEPARATELY AND FINDING ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO SERVE THE 20/80 CUSTOMERS.•SIMPLIFYING THE SUPPLIER BASE BY PARTNERING WITH 80/20 SUPPLIERS AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF 20/80 SUPPLIERS.•DESIGNING BUSINESS PROCESSES, SYSTEMS AND MEASUREMENTS AROUND THE 80/20 ACTIVITIES.THE RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS IS THAT THE COMPANY HAS OVER TIME IMPROVED ITS LONG-TERM OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THESE 80/20 EFFORTS CAN RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS THAT REDUCE COSTS, AND IMPROVE PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS.CUSTOMER-BACK INNOVATION - ITW’S CUSTOMER-BACK APPROACH TO INNOVATION BUILDS ON THE COMPANY’S 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS TO HELP ITW BUSINESSES FOCUS ON THE MOST PROFITABLE CUSTOMERS AND INVENT SOLUTIONS TO SOLVE THEIR SPECIFIC PROBLEMS. ITW BUSINESSES ARE FOCUSED ON BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE MAJOR CUSTOMERS TO DEVELOP DEEP KNOWLEDGE AND INSIGHT AROUND THEIR NEEDS. THESE CUSTOMER INSIGHTS AND LEARNINGS DRIVE INNOVATION AT ITW. DECENTRALIZED ENTREPRENEURIAL CULTURE - ITW BUSINESSES HAVE SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL TO CUSTOMIZE THEIR APPROACH IN ORDER TO BEST SERVE THEIR CUSTOMERS. THIS LEADS TO A FOCUSED AND SIMPLE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE THAT CAN DELIVER OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE ADAPTED TO THEIR CUSTOMERS AND END MARKETS.10KEY INITIATIVESITW’S ENTERPRISE STRATEGY IS CENTERED ON THREE KEY INITIATIVES - PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION, AND STRATEGIC SOURCING. THESE ENTERPRISE INITIATIVES ARE EXPECTED TO ENHANCE THE BUSINESS THROUGH 2017 AND ARE TARGETED AT EXPANDING ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH AND IMPROVING PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS.PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT - THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE AIMS TO CONSTRUCT A BUSINESS PORTFOLIO THAT LEVERAGES THE COMPANY’S DIFFERENTIATED BUSINESS MODEL AND GROWTH POTENTIAL. AS PART OF THIS INITIATIVE, THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS OPERATIONS FOR BUSINESSES THAT MAY NO LONGER BE ALIGNED WITH ITS LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY'S DIVESTITURE ACTIVITY INCREASED IN 2012, 2013 AND 2014. WITH THE SALE OF THE COMPANY'S FORMER INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENT ON MAY 1, 2014, THE DIVESTITURE ELEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE IS ESSENTIALLY COMPLETE. THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES WITH COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS WELL AS LARGER ACQUISITIONS THAT REPRESENT POTENTIAL NEW PLATFORMS. GOING FORWARD, THE COMPANY WILL EMPHASIZE ORGANIC GROWTH, WHILE ACQUISITIONS WILL BE TARGETED TO BOLT-ON ACQUISITIONS THAT SUPPORT AND ACCELERATE ORGANIC GROWTH IN EXISTING SEGMENTS, AND NEW PLATFORMS THAT EXPAND THE COMPANY’S LONG-TERM GROWTH AND EARNINGS POTENTIAL. REFER TO THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NOTE IN ITEM 1 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY’S DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.ANOTHER KEY ASPECT OF THE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE IS THE FOCUS ON PRODUCT LINE AND CUSTOMER BASE SIMPLIFICATION. PRODUCT LINE AND CUSTOMER BASE SIMPLIFICATION FOCUSES ON ELIMINATING THE COMPLEXITY AND OVERHEAD COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SMALLER PRODUCT LINES AND CUSTOMERS, AND FOCUSES BUSINESSES ON SUPPORTING AND GROWING THEIR LARGEST CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCT LINES. PRODUCT LINE AND CUSTOMER BASE SIMPLIFICATION IS A CORE ELEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS. IN THE SHORT-TERM, PRODUCT LINE AND CUSTOMER BASE SIMPLIFICATION MAY RESULT IN A DECREASE IN REVENUE AND OVERHEAD COSTS WHILE IMPROVING OPERATING MARGIN. OVER THE LONG-TERM, PRODUCT LINE AND CUSTOMER BASE SIMPLIFICATION RESULTS IN GROWTH IN REVENUE, PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS, AND IS KEY TO IMPROVING THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION - THE BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION INITIATIVE SIMPLIFIES THE COMPANY'S ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL AND ADDS SCALE TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATING DIVISIONS IN ORDER TO INCREASE ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH, ENHANCE GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS AND DRIVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES. THIS INITIATIVE FOCUSES ON REDUCING THE NUMBER OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING DIVISIONS AND INCREASING THE AVERAGE REVENUE SIZE OF EACH DIVISION, WHILE RETAINING THE POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES OF A DECENTRALIZED OPERATING MODEL. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO ENHANCE ITS PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF APPLYING ITS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS TO THE NEW DIVISIONS, MORE FOCUSED GROWTH INVESTMENTS AND REDUCED INFRASTRUCTURE.STRATEGIC SOURCING - THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC SOURCING INITIATIVE FOCUSES ON BUILDING SOURCING CAPABILITY IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE PURCHASING SCALE TO ENHANCE PROFITABILITY AND GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS. IT INCORPORATES BOTH ENTERPRISE-LEVEL AND SEGMENT-LEVEL PURCHASING THAT CROSS THE COMPANY'S MANY BUSINESSES.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSTHE COMPANY PERIODICALLY REVIEWS ITS OPERATIONS FOR BUSINESSES THAT MAY NO LONGER BE ALIGNED WITH ITS ENTERPRISE INITIATIVES AND LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY MAY COMMIT TO A PLAN TO EXIT OR DISPOSE OF CERTAIN BUSINESSES AND PRESENT THEM AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. REFER TO THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NOTE IN ITEM 1 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSTHE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015 AND 2014 WERE AS FOLLOWS:11IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015, THE CHANGES IN OPERATING REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGINS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31 % INCREASE (DECREASE) % POINT INCREASE (DECREASE) OPERATING REVENUES OPERATING INCOME OPERATING MARGINSORGANIC0.7 % 11.3% 2.0%ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES(0.3) (0.1) —RESTRUCTURING COSTS— 1.0 0.2TRANSLATION(6.8) (7.8) —TOTAL(6.4)% 4.4% 2.2%OPERATING REVENUESOPERATING REVENUES DECREASED 6.4% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015 VERSUS 2014 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ORGANIC REVENUES.

FOREIGN CURRENCYFOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015, THE WEAKENING OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR DECREASED OPERATING REVENUES BY APPROXIMATELY $243 MILLION (680 BASIS POINTS) AND DECREASED INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY $37 MILLION ($0.10 PER DILUTED SHARE) VERSUS THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014.INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSAS OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014, THE COMPANY HAD COMPLETED THE DIVESTITURE OF ALL THE BUSINESSES PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WAS $45 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2014. REFER TO THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NOTE IN ITEM 1 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS REGARDING THE COMPANY’S DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIN MAY 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ("FASB") ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE TO CHANGE THE CRITERIA FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION. THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF THE NEW STANDARD IS THAT REVENUE SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION DISCLOSURES WILL BE REQUIRED. THIS GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2017. IN APRIL 2015, THE FASB PROPOSED DELAYING THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS GUIDANCE BY ONE YEAR. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THE GUIDANCE WILL HAVE UPON ADOPTION.IN APRIL 2015, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE TO SIMPLIFY THE BALANCE SHEET PRESENTATION OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS WILL BE PRESENTED AS A REDUCTION OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE DEBT LIABILITY. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2016 AND WILL BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. AS OF MARCH 31, 2015, THE COMPANY HAD $39 MILLION OF DEFERRED DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESTHE COMPANY’S PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAD $2.7 BILLION OF CASH ON HAND AT MARCH 31, 2015 AND ALSO MAINTAINS STRONG ACCESS TO PUBLIC DEBT MARKETS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE SOURCES ARE SUFFICIENT TO SERVICE DEBT AND TO FINANCE THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL ALLOCATION PRIORITIES, WHICH INCLUDE:•INVESTMENT IN EXISTING BUSINESSES TO FUND INTERNAL GROWTH;•PAYMENT OF AN ATTRACTIVE DIVIDEND TO SHAREHOLDERS;•SHARE REPURCHASES; AND•ACQUISITIONS.THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT, BASED ON ITS REVENUES, OPERATING MARGINS, CURRENT FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW, AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY.CASH FLOWTHE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, ACQUISITIONS AND DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW REPRESENTS NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS ADDITIONS TO PLANT AND 22EQUIPMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015 AND 2014 WERE AS FOLLOWS:STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMSON AUGUST 2, 2013, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDED FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $6.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME (THE “2013 PROGRAM”). UNDER THE 2013 PROGRAM, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 18.5 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $80.94 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014, APPROXIMATELY 17.2 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $86.01 IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014, APPROXIMATELY 5.8 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $85.35 IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2014, APPROXIMATELY 8.9 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $90.81 IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014, AND APPROXIMATELY 14.9 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $96.84 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015. THE 2013 PROGRAM WAS COMPLETED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015.ON FEBRUARY 13, 2015, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $6.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME (THE “2015 PROGRAM”). UNDER THE 2015 PROGRAM, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 1.6 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $97.19 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015. AS OF MARCH 31, 2015, THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY $5.8 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THE 2015 PROGRAM.ADJUSTED RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITALTHE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL ("ADJUSTED ROIC") TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS’ USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ADJUSTED ROIC IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. ADJUSTED AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S NET INVESTMENT IN THE FORMER INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENT AND THE EQUITY INVESTMENT IN THE WILSONART BUSINESS (FORMERLY THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT). AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE PERIOD AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER.23ADJUSTED ROIC FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015 AND 2014 WAS AS FOLLOWS:THE ANNUALIZED ADJUSTED ROIC INCREASE OF 210 BASIS POINTS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2015 COMPARED TO 2014 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A 2.9% IMPROVEMENT IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME AND AN 8.4% DECREASE IN ADJUSTED AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL. WORKING CAPITALMANAGEMENT USES WORKING CAPITAL AS A MEASUREMENT OF THE SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY. NET WORKING CAPITAL AS OF MARCH 31, 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS:THE DECREASE IN NET WORKING CAPITAL AS OF MARCH 31, 2015 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AND HIGHER SHORT-TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS WHICH WERE USED TO FUND $1.5 BILLION OF CASH PAID FOR SHARE REPURCHASES IN THE FIRST QUARTER.24CASH AND EQUIVALENTS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $2.7 BILLION AS OF MARCH 31, 2015 AND $4.0 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, PRIMARILY ALL OF WHICH WAS HELD BY INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES. THE REDUCTION IN CASH ON HAND WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE SHARE REPURCHASES DISCUSSED ABOVE. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD INTERNATIONALLY MAY BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXES AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES IF REPATRIATED TO THE U.S. CASH BALANCES HELD INTERNATIONALLY ARE TYPICALLY USED FOR INTERNATIONAL OPERATING NEEDS, REINVESTED TO FUND EXPANSION OF EXISTING INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES, USED TO FUND NEW INTERNATIONAL ACQUISITIONS, OR USED TO REPAY DEBT HELD INTERNATIONALLY. IN THE U.S., THE COMPANY UTILIZES CASH FLOWS FROM DOMESTIC OPERATIONS TO FUND DOMESTIC CASH NEEDS WHICH PRIMARILY CONSIST OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, SHARE REPURCHASES, ACQUISITIONS, SERVICING OF DOMESTIC DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, WHICH IS BACKED BY LONG-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES, FOR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES CASH GENERATED DOMESTICALLY AND LIQUIDITY PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY'S COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND CASH REQUIREMENTS IN THE U.S.DEBTTOTAL DEBT AS OF MARCH 31, 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014 WAS AS FOLLOWS:SHORT-TERM DEBT AS OF MARCH 31, 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014 INCLUDED COMMERCIAL PAPER OF $1.7 BILLION AND $1.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDATHE COMPANY USES THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA TO MEASURE ITS ABILITY TO REPAY ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S LONG TERM FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA. EBITDA AND THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA REPRESENTS TOTAL DEBT DIVIDED BY INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ON A TRAILING TWELVE MONTH BASIS.TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING TWELVE MONTH PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014 WAS AS FOLLOWS:25STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITYTHE CHANGES TO STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY DURING 2015 WERE AS FOLLOWS:IN MILLIONS TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY, DECEMBER 31, 2014$6,824NET INCOME458CASH DIVIDENDS DECLARED(179)REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK(1,602)STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK ACTIVITY50CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS(577)OTHER8TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY, MARCH 31, 2015$4,982FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSTHIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.

BASED ON SUCH EVALUATION, THE COMPANY’S PRESIDENT & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT & CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER HAVE CONCLUDED THAT, AS OF MARCH 31, 2015, THE COMPANY’S DISCLOSURE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSINTRODUCTIONMANAGEMENT ANALYZES THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE RESULTS OF EACH SEGMENT BY IDENTIFYING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN THE RESULTS OF THE ORGANIC BUSINESS (BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR MORE THAN 12 MONTHS), NEWLY ACQUIRED AND RECENTLY DIVESTED COMPANIES, RESTRUCTURING COSTS, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AND CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON THE OPERATING REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME OF EACH SEGMENT. THE CHANGES TO OPERATING INCOME OF ORGANIC BUSINESSES INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF BOTH OPERATING LEVERAGE AND CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS. OPERATING LEVERAGE IS THE ESTIMATED EFFECT OF THE ORGANIC REVENUE VOLUME CHANGES ON ORGANIC OPERATING INCOME, ASSUMING VARIABLE MARGINS REMAIN THE SAME AS THE PRIOR PERIOD. AS MANUFACTURING AND ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD COSTS USUALLY DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE AS A RESULT OF REVENUES INCREASING OR DECREASING, THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN OPERATING INCOME DUE TO OPERATING LEVERAGE IS USUALLY MORE THAN THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE REVENUES. CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED EFFECT OF NON-VOLUME RELATED CHANGES IN THE OPERATING INCOME OF ORGANIC BUSINESSES AND MAY BE DRIVEN BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX, THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS, LABOR AND OVERHEAD, AND PRICING TO CUSTOMERS. SELLING PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED NET IMPACT OF INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THE COST OF MATERIALS USED IN THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS VERSUS CHANGES IN THE SELLING PRICE TO THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THESE PRICE VERSUS COST COMPARISONS BY ANALYZING THE NET IMPACT OF CHANGES TO EACH SEGMENT'S OPERATING MARGIN.ENTERPRISE STRATEGYIN 2012, THE COMPANY EMBARKED ON AN ENTERPRISE STRATEGY WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF FULLY LEVERAGING ITW’S CORE CAPABILITIES TO DELIVER STRONG FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. ITW’S ENTERPRISE STRATEGY IS CENTERED ON THREE KEY INITIATIVES - PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION, AND STRATEGIC SOURCING. THESE ENTERPRISE INITIATIVES ARE EXPECTED TO ENHANCE THE BUSINESS THROUGH 2017 AND ARE TARGETED AT EXPANDING ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH AND IMPROVING PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS.THE FOUNDATION OF THIS STRATEGY IS A SET OF BUSINESS PRACTICES REFERRED TO AS THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL CONSISTING OF THREE CORE ELEMENTS:80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS - THE CONCEPT OF THE 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS IS TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT (THE 20% OF THE ITEMS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 80% OF THE VALUE) AND TO SPEND LESS TIME AND RESOURCES ON THE LESS IMPORTANT (THE 80% OF THE ITEMS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 20% OF THE VALUE). THE COMPANY USES THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS TO SIMPLIFY AND FOCUS ON THE KEY DRIVERS OF BUSINESS PROFITABILITY, AND AS A RESULT, REDUCES COMPLEXITY THAT OFTEN CREATES UNNECESSARY EXPENSE AND DISGUISES WHAT IS TRULY IMPORTANT. THE COMPANY UTILIZES THE 80/20 PROCESS IN ALL ASPECTS OF ITS BUSINESS. COMMON APPLICATIONS OF THE 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS INCLUDE:•SIMPLIFYING PRODUCT LINES BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS OFFERED BY COMBINING THE FEATURES OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS, OUTSOURCING PRODUCTS OR ELIMINATING LOW-VALUE PRODUCTS.•SEGMENTING THE CUSTOMER BASE BY FOCUSING ON THE 80/20 CUSTOMERS SEPARATELY AND FINDING ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO SERVE THE 20/80 CUSTOMERS.•SIMPLIFYING THE SUPPLIER BASE BY PARTNERING WITH 80/20 SUPPLIERS AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF 20/80 SUPPLIERS.•DESIGNING BUSINESS PROCESSES, SYSTEMS AND MEASUREMENTS AROUND THE 80/20 ACTIVITIES.THE RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS IS THAT THE COMPANY HAS OVER TIME IMPROVED ITS LONG-TERM OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THESE 80/20 EFFORTS CAN RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS THAT REDUCE COSTS, AND IMPROVE PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS.CUSTOMER-BACK INNOVATION - ITW’S CUSTOMER-BACK APPROACH TO INNOVATION BUILDS ON THE COMPANY’S 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS TO HELP ITW BUSINESSES FOCUS ON THE MOST PROFITABLE CUSTOMERS AND INVENT SOLUTIONS TO SOLVE THEIR SPECIFIC PROBLEMS. ITW BUSINESSES ARE FOCUSED ON BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE MAJOR CUSTOMERS TO DEVELOP DEEP KNOWLEDGE AND INSIGHT AROUND THEIR NEEDS. THESE CUSTOMER INSIGHTS AND LEARNINGS DRIVE INNOVATION AT ITW. DECENTRALIZED ENTREPRENEURIAL CULTURE - ITW BUSINESSES HAVE SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL TO CUSTOMIZE THEIR APPROACH IN ORDER TO BEST SERVE THEIR CUSTOMERS. THIS LEADS TO A FOCUSED AND SIMPLE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE THAT CAN DELIVER OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE ADAPTED TO THEIR CUSTOMERS AND END MARKETS.10KEY INITIATIVESITW’S ENTERPRISE STRATEGY IS CENTERED ON THREE KEY INITIATIVES - PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION, AND STRATEGIC SOURCING. THESE ENTERPRISE INITIATIVES ARE EXPECTED TO ENHANCE THE BUSINESS THROUGH 2017 AND ARE TARGETED AT EXPANDING ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH AND IMPROVING PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS.PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT - THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE AIMS TO CONSTRUCT A BUSINESS PORTFOLIO THAT LEVERAGES THE COMPANY’S DIFFERENTIATED BUSINESS MODEL AND GROWTH POTENTIAL. AS PART OF THIS INITIATIVE, THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS OPERATIONS FOR BUSINESSES THAT MAY NO LONGER BE ALIGNED WITH ITS LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY'S DIVESTITURE ACTIVITY INCREASED IN 2012, 2013 AND 2014. WITH THE SALE OF THE COMPANY'S FORMER INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENT ON MAY 1, 2014, THE DIVESTITURE ELEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE IS ESSENTIALLY COMPLETE. THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES WITH COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS WELL AS LARGER ACQUISITIONS THAT REPRESENT POTENTIAL NEW PLATFORMS. GOING FORWARD, THE COMPANY WILL EMPHASIZE ORGANIC GROWTH, WHILE ACQUISITIONS WILL BE TARGETED TO BOLT-ON ACQUISITIONS THAT SUPPORT AND ACCELERATE ORGANIC GROWTH IN EXISTING SEGMENTS, AND NEW PLATFORMS THAT EXPAND THE COMPANY’S LONG-TERM GROWTH AND EARNINGS POTENTIAL. REFER TO THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NOTE IN ITEM 1 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY’S DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.ANOTHER KEY ASPECT OF THE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE IS THE FOCUS ON PRODUCT LINE AND CUSTOMER BASE SIMPLIFICATION. PRODUCT LINE AND CUSTOMER BASE SIMPLIFICATION FOCUSES ON ELIMINATING THE COMPLEXITY AND OVERHEAD COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SMALLER PRODUCT LINES AND CUSTOMERS, AND FOCUSES BUSINESSES ON SUPPORTING AND GROWING THEIR LARGEST CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCT LINES. PRODUCT LINE AND CUSTOMER BASE SIMPLIFICATION IS A CORE ELEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS. IN THE SHORT-TERM, PRODUCT LINE AND CUSTOMER BASE SIMPLIFICATION MAY RESULT IN A DECREASE IN REVENUE AND OVERHEAD COSTS WHILE IMPROVING OPERATING MARGIN. OVER THE LONG-TERM, PRODUCT LINE AND CUSTOMER BASE SIMPLIFICATION RESULTS IN GROWTH IN REVENUE, PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS, AND IS KEY TO IMPROVING THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION - THE BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION INITIATIVE SIMPLIFIES THE COMPANY'S ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL AND ADDS SCALE TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATING DIVISIONS IN ORDER TO INCREASE ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH, ENHANCE GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS AND DRIVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES. THIS INITIATIVE FOCUSES ON REDUCING THE NUMBER OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING DIVISIONS AND INCREASING THE AVERAGE REVENUE SIZE OF EACH DIVISION, WHILE RETAINING THE POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES OF A DECENTRALIZED OPERATING MODEL. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO ENHANCE ITS PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF APPLYING ITS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS TO THE NEW DIVISIONS, MORE FOCUSED GROWTH INVESTMENTS AND REDUCED INFRASTRUCTURE.STRATEGIC SOURCING - THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC SOURCING INITIATIVE FOCUSES ON BUILDING SOURCING CAPABILITY IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE PURCHASING SCALE TO ENHANCE PROFITABILITY AND GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS. IT INCORPORATES BOTH ENTERPRISE-LEVEL AND SEGMENT-LEVEL PURCHASING THAT CROSS THE COMPANY'S MANY BUSINESSES.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSTHE COMPANY PERIODICALLY REVIEWS ITS OPERATIONS FOR BUSINESSES THAT MAY NO LONGER BE ALIGNED WITH ITS ENTERPRISE INITIATIVES AND LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY MAY COMMIT TO A PLAN TO EXIT OR DISPOSE OF CERTAIN BUSINESSES AND PRESENT THEM AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. REFER TO THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NOTE IN ITEM 1 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSTHE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015 AND 2014 WERE AS FOLLOWS:11IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015, THE CHANGES IN OPERATING REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGINS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31 % INCREASE (DECREASE) % POINT INCREASE (DECREASE) OPERATING REVENUES OPERATING INCOME OPERATING MARGINSORGANIC0.7 % 11.3% 2.0%ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES(0.3) (0.1) —RESTRUCTURING COSTS— 1.0 0.2TRANSLATION(6.8) (7.8) —TOTAL(6.4)% 4.4% 2.2%OPERATING REVENUESOPERATING REVENUES DECREASED 6.4% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015 VERSUS 2014 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ORGANIC REVENUES.
