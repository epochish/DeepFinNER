WORLDWIDE APPLIANCE BASE REVENUE GROWTH WAS 3.2% AND 5.1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED CONSUMER DEMAND IN THE NORTH AMERICAN APPLIANCE SECTOR, AND NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES IN THE SECOND QUARTER. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 15.7% AND 7.6% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2012, RESPECTIVELY, VERSUS 2011 AS OPERATING EFFICIENCIES AND THE POSITIVE LEVERAGE FROM THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND, IN THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD, HIGHER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES IN THE FIRST QUARTER. CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS INCREASED BASE MARGINS BY 180 AND 140 BASIS POINTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO OPERATING EFFICIENCIES AND FAVORABLE SELLING PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS OF 60 AND 50 BASIS POINTS, RESPECTIVELY. THE TOTAL BASE MARGIN IMPROVEMENT OF 250 BASIS POINTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, WHILE THE YEAR-TO-DATE TOTAL BASE MARGIN IMPROVEMENT OF 190 BASIS POINTS WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS AND HIGHER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES. ACQUISITIONS DILUTED OPERATING MARGINS BY 120 AND 140 BASIS POINTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS FROM ACQUISITIONS MADE WITHIN THE PAST YEAR. HIGHER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES DECREASED OPERATING MARGINS IN THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD BY 60 BASIS POINTS DUE TO INCREASED COST REDUCTION ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMORTIZATION EXPENSE INCREASED TO $147 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2012 VERSUS $118 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2011 DUE TO INTANGIBLE ASSET AMORTIZATION RELATED TO NEWLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, MOST NOTABLY A THERMAL PROCESSING AND ENVIRONMENTAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER IN THE POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS SEGMENT, A MANUFACTURER OF SPECIALTY DEVICES USED TO MEASURE THE FLOW OF GASES AND FLUIDS IN THE ALL OTHER SEGMENT, AND A NORTH AMERICAN AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET BUSINESS IN THE TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT. INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $100 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2012, WHICH INCLUDED INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE 3.375% AND 4.875% NOTES ISSUED IN LATE AUGUST 2011, VERSUS $89 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2011. THE INCREASE WAS OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE 6.55% PREFERRED DEBT SECURITIES WHICH WERE FULLY PAID ON THE FIRST BUSINESS DAY IN 2012. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) WAS INCOME OF $31 MILLION FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2012 VERSUS INCOME OF $21 MILLION FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2011 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION LOSSES AND HIGHER INTEREST INCOME.

INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS INCREASED TO $369 MILLION ($0.77 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2012 VERSUS $32 MILLION ($0.06 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2011 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF THE FINISHING GROUP OF BUSINESSES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2012. SEE THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NOTE IN ITEM 1 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS REGARDING THE COMPANY’S DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE COMPANY’S PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT, TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS, AND TO FUND SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE PRIMARY USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE: • DIVIDNEND PAYMENTS - THE COMPANY'S DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINES ARE 30% TO 45% OF THE AVERAGE OF THE LAST TWO YEARS' FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW; • ACQUISITIONS; AND • SHARE REPURCHASES. CASH FLOW THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW REPRESENTS NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS ADDITIONS TO PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2012 AND 2011 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN MILLIONS) THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2012 2011 2012 2011 NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES $ 509 $ 312 $ 832 $ 457 ADDITIONS TO PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (100 ) (87 ) (184 ) (176 ) FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW $ 409 $ 225 $ 648 $ 281 CASH DIVIDENDS PAID $ (172 ) $ (170 ) $ (346 ) $ (339 ) ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES (EXCLUDING CASH AND EQUIVALENTS) (106 ) (205 ) (587 ) (748 ) NET PROCEEDS FROM SALE OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 626 — 626 — REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK (557 ) (550 ) (1,000 ) (550 ) NET PROCEEDS (REPAYMENTS) OF DEBT 191 695 926 1,113 OTHER 71 60 271 165 EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH AND EQUIVALENTS (74 ) 92 (24 ) 123 INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH AND EQUIVALENTS $ 388 $ 147 $ 514 $ 45 ON MAY 6, 2011, THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $4.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME (THE “2011 PROGRAM”). IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2012, THE COMPANY MADE REPURCHASES OF APPROXIMATELY 9.5 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $55.40 UNDER THE 2011 PROGRAM. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY $2.9 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THE 2011 PROGRAM. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (“ROIC”) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS’ USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ROIC IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE PERIOD AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2012 AND 2011, ROIC WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE ROIC INCREASE OF 70 BASIS POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2012 COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2011 WAS THE RESULT OF AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASING 3.9%, WHILE OPERATING INCOME AFTER TAXES INCREASED 8.3%. THE ROIC INCREASE OF 10 BASIS POINTS FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF 2012 COMPARED TO THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF 2011 WAS THE RESULT OF AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASING 7.0%, WHILE OPERATING INCOME AFTER TAXES INCREASED 7.6%. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, THE COMPANY RECORDED A FAVORABLE DISCRETE NON-CASH TAX BENEFIT OF $166 MILLION RELATED TO THE DECISION IN THE COMPANY’S FAVOR BY THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA, VICTORIA WITH RESPECT TO A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS THAT HAD BEEN CHALLENGED BY THE AUSTRALIAN TAX OFFICE. SEE THE INCOME TAXES NOTE IN ITEM 1 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THIS DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT. SINCE THE BENEFIT WAS UNUSUAL, THE ROIC CALCULATION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THIS ITEM TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY AND BETTER REFLECT THE RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED. A RECONCILIATION OF THE SECOND QUARTER 2011 TAX RATE, AS REPORTED, TO THE TAX RATE USED ABOVE IS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2011 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES INCOME TAXES TAX RATE AS REPORTED $ 1,302 $ 212 16.3 % DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENT — 166 12.7 % AS ADJUSTED $ 1,302 $ 378 29.0 % WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT USES WORKING CAPITAL AS A MEASUREMENT OF THE SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY. NET WORKING CAPITAL AT JUNE 30, 2012 AND DECEMBER 31, 2011 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: CASH AND EQUIVALENTS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, ALL OF WHICH WAS HELD BY INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXES AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES IF REPATRIATED TO THE UNITED STATES. CASH BALANCES HELD INTERNATIONALLY ARE TYPICALLY USED FOR INTERNATIONAL OPERATING NEEDS, REINVESTED TO FUND EXPANSION OF EXISTING INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES, OR USED TO FUND NEW INTERNATIONAL ACQUISITIONS. IN THE U.S., THE COMPANY UTILIZES CASH FLOWS FROM DOMESTIC OPERATIONS TO FUND DOMESTIC CASH NEEDS WHICH PRIMARILY CONSIST OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES, SERVICING OF DOMESTIC DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, WHICH IS BACKED BY SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES OF $2.5 BILLION, FOR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES CASH GENERATED DOMESTICALLY WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND CASH REQUIREMENTS IN THE U.S. DEBT TOTAL DEBT AND TOTAL DEBT TO CAPITALIZATION AT JUNE 30, 2012 AND DECEMBER 31, 2011 WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OF $1.3 BILLION AT JUNE 30, 2012 AND $192 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 WHICH IS INCLUDED IN SHORT-TERM DEBT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED ON ITS CURRENT FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW, DEBT-TO-CAPITALIZATION RATIOS AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY. TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA THE COMPANY USES THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA TO MEASURE ITS ABILITY TO REPAY ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S LONG TERM FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA. EBITDA AND THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA REPRESENTS TOTAL DEBT DIVIDED BY INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ON A TRAILING TWELVE MONTH BASIS. TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING TWELVE MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2012 AND DECEMBER 31, 2011 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) TWELVE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2012 TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 TOTAL DEBT $ 4,906 $ 3,990 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS $ 1,925 $ 2,017 ADD: INTEREST EXPENSE 203 192 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) (63 ) (54 ) INCOME TAXES 772 576 DEPRECIATION 332 336 AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 284 255 EBITDA $ 3,453 $ 3,322 TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO 1.4 1.2 STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY THE CHANGES TO STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY DURING 2012 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN MILLIONS) TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY, DECEMBER 31, 2011 $ 10,034 NET INCOME 1,367 STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK ACTIVITY 127 REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK (1,000 ) CASH DIVIDENDS DECLARED (340 ) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS (115 ) OTHER 28 TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY, JUNE 30, 2012 $ 10,101 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.

CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS INCREASED BASE MARGINS BY 180 AND 140 BASIS POINTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO OPERATING EFFICIENCIES AND FAVORABLE SELLING PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS OF 60 AND 50 BASIS POINTS, RESPECTIVELY. THE TOTAL BASE MARGIN IMPROVEMENT OF 250 BASIS POINTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, WHILE THE YEAR-TO-DATE TOTAL BASE MARGIN IMPROVEMENT OF 190 BASIS POINTS WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS AND HIGHER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES. ACQUISITIONS DILUTED OPERATING MARGINS BY 120 AND 140 BASIS POINTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS FROM ACQUISITIONS MADE WITHIN THE PAST YEAR.

SEE THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NOTE IN ITEM 1 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS REGARDING THE COMPANY’S DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE COMPANY’S PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT, TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS, AND TO FUND SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE PRIMARY USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE: • DIVIDNEND PAYMENTS - THE COMPANY'S DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINES ARE 30% TO 45% OF THE AVERAGE OF THE LAST TWO YEARS' FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW; • ACQUISITIONS; AND • SHARE REPURCHASES. CASH FLOW THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW REPRESENTS NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS ADDITIONS TO PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2012 AND 2011 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN MILLIONS) THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2012 2011 2012 2011 NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES $ 509 $ 312 $ 832 $ 457 ADDITIONS TO PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (100 ) (87 ) (184 ) (176 ) FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW $ 409 $ 225 $ 648 $ 281 CASH DIVIDENDS PAID $ (172 ) $ (170 ) $ (346 ) $ (339 ) ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES (EXCLUDING CASH AND EQUIVALENTS) (106 ) (205 ) (587 ) (748 ) NET PROCEEDS FROM SALE OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 626 — 626 — REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK (557 ) (550 ) (1,000 ) (550 ) NET PROCEEDS (REPAYMENTS) OF DEBT 191 695 926 1,113 OTHER 71 60 271 165 EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH AND EQUIVALENTS (74 ) 92 (24 ) 123 INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH AND EQUIVALENTS $ 388 $ 147 $ 514 $ 45 ON MAY 6, 2011, THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $4.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME (THE “2011 PROGRAM”). IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2012, THE COMPANY MADE REPURCHASES OF APPROXIMATELY 9.5 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $55.40 UNDER THE 2011 PROGRAM. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY $2.9 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THE 2011 PROGRAM. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (“ROIC”) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS’ USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ROIC IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE PERIOD AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2012 AND 2011, ROIC WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE ROIC INCREASE OF 70 BASIS POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2012 COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2011 WAS THE RESULT OF AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASING 3.9%, WHILE OPERATING INCOME AFTER TAXES INCREASED 8.3%. THE ROIC INCREASE OF 10 BASIS POINTS FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF 2012 COMPARED TO THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF 2011 WAS THE RESULT OF AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASING 7.0%, WHILE OPERATING INCOME AFTER TAXES INCREASED 7.6%. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, THE COMPANY RECORDED A FAVORABLE DISCRETE NON-CASH TAX BENEFIT OF $166 MILLION RELATED TO THE DECISION IN THE COMPANY’S FAVOR BY THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA, VICTORIA WITH RESPECT TO A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS THAT HAD BEEN CHALLENGED BY THE AUSTRALIAN TAX OFFICE. SEE THE INCOME TAXES NOTE IN ITEM 1 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THIS DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT. SINCE THE BENEFIT WAS UNUSUAL, THE ROIC CALCULATION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THIS ITEM TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY AND BETTER REFLECT THE RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED. A RECONCILIATION OF THE SECOND QUARTER 2011 TAX RATE, AS REPORTED, TO THE TAX RATE USED ABOVE IS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2011 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES INCOME TAXES TAX RATE AS REPORTED $ 1,302 $ 212 16.3 % DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENT — 166 12.7 % AS ADJUSTED $ 1,302 $ 378 29.0 % WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT USES WORKING CAPITAL AS A MEASUREMENT OF THE SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY. NET WORKING CAPITAL AT JUNE 30, 2012 AND DECEMBER 31, 2011 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: CASH AND EQUIVALENTS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, ALL OF WHICH WAS HELD BY INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXES AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES IF REPATRIATED TO THE UNITED STATES. CASH BALANCES HELD INTERNATIONALLY ARE TYPICALLY USED FOR INTERNATIONAL OPERATING NEEDS, REINVESTED TO FUND EXPANSION OF EXISTING INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES, OR USED TO FUND NEW INTERNATIONAL ACQUISITIONS. IN THE U.S., THE COMPANY UTILIZES CASH FLOWS FROM DOMESTIC OPERATIONS TO FUND DOMESTIC CASH NEEDS WHICH PRIMARILY CONSIST OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES, SERVICING OF DOMESTIC DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, WHICH IS BACKED BY SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES OF $2.5 BILLION, FOR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES CASH GENERATED DOMESTICALLY WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND CASH REQUIREMENTS IN THE U.S. DEBT TOTAL DEBT AND TOTAL DEBT TO CAPITALIZATION AT JUNE 30, 2012 AND DECEMBER 31, 2011 WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OF $1.3 BILLION AT JUNE 30, 2012 AND $192 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 WHICH IS INCLUDED IN SHORT-TERM DEBT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED ON ITS CURRENT FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW, DEBT-TO-CAPITALIZATION RATIOS AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY. TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA THE COMPANY USES THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA TO MEASURE ITS ABILITY TO REPAY ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S LONG TERM FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA. EBITDA AND THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA REPRESENTS TOTAL DEBT DIVIDED BY INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ON A TRAILING TWELVE MONTH BASIS. TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING TWELVE MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2012 AND DECEMBER 31, 2011 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) TWELVE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2012 TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 TOTAL DEBT $ 4,906 $ 3,990 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS $ 1,925 $ 2,017 ADD: INTEREST EXPENSE 203 192 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) (63 ) (54 ) INCOME TAXES 772 576 DEPRECIATION 332 336 AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 284 255 EBITDA $ 3,453 $ 3,322 TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO 1.4 1.2 STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY THE CHANGES TO STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY DURING 2012 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN MILLIONS) TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY, DECEMBER 31, 2011 $ 10,034 NET INCOME 1,367 STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK ACTIVITY 127 REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK (1,000 ) CASH DIVIDENDS DECLARED (340 ) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS (115 ) OTHER 28 TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY, JUNE 30, 2012 $ 10,101 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.
