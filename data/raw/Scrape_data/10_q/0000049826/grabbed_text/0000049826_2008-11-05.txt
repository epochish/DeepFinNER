ADDITIONALLY, IN AUGUST 2008, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE DIVESTITURE OF THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT AND CLICK COMMERCE INDUSTRIAL SOFTWARE BUSINESS WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN THE ALL OTHER SEGMENT. THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME FOR ALL PERIODS HAS BEEN RESTATED TO PRESENT THE RESULTS RELATED TO THESE BUSINESSES AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2008 AND 2007 WERE AS FOLLOWS: IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2008, THE CHANGES IN REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGINS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30 NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30 % INCREASE (DECREASE) % POINT INCREASE (DECREASE) % INCREASE (DECREASE) % POINT INCREASE (DECREASE) OPERATING REVENUES OPERATING INCOME OPERATING MARGINS OPERATING REVENUES OPERATING INCOME OPERATING MARGINS BASE MANUFACTURING BUSINESS: REVENUE CHANGE/OPERATING LEVERAGE (0.8 )% (1.9 )% (0.2 )% (0.1 )% (0.4 )%  % CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS  (6.1 ) (1.1 )  (1.5 ) (0.3 ) TOTAL (0.8 ) (8.0 ) (1.3 ) (0.1 ) (1.9 ) (0.3 ) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 6.9 1.9 (0.7 ) 6.0 1.8 (0.7 ) RESTRUCTURING COSTS  0.3 0.1  0.1  IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL & INTANGIBLES  0.1   0.1  TRANSLATION 4.7 4.1  5.4 5.0  OTHER    (0.1 )  0.1 TOTAL 10.8 % (1.6 )% (1.9 )% 11.2 % 5.1 % (0.9 )% OPERATING REVENUES REVENUES INCREASED 10.8% AND 11.2% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2008, RESPECTIVELY, VERSUS 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUES FROM ACQUISITIONS AND THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION. TOTAL BASE REVENUES DECLINED 0.8% AND 0.1% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, AS PRICE INCREASES WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY VOLUME DECREASES. INTERNATIONAL BASE REVENUES INCREASED 1.2% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND 2.7% YEAR-TO-DATE, OFFSET BY A 2.1% AND 2.4% DECLINE, RESPECTIVELY, IN NORTH AMERICAN BASE REVENUES. THE COMPANYS ASIA-PACIFIC END MARKETS CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE RELATIVELY STRONG GROWTH WHILE EUROPE SHOWED WEAKENING END MARKETS. NORTH AMERICAN REVENUES CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY DECLINES IN THE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND AUTOMOTIVE SECTORS AS WELL AS WEAK INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME IN THE THIRD QUARTER DECLINED 1.6% AND INCREASED 5.1% YEAR-TO-DATE VERSUS 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF LOWER SALES AND DECREASED VARIABLE MARGINS, OFFSET IN THE YEAR-TO-DATE-PERIOD BY THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND INCOME FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. TOTAL OPERATING MARGINS DECREASED 1.9% AND 0.9% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER MARGINS OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND BASE BUSINESSES. BASE MARGINS DECLINED 130 BASIS POINTS AND 30 BASIS POINTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, MAINLY DUE TO VOLUME DECREASES AND LOWER VARIABLE MARGINS ASSOCIATED WITH RAW MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER OVERHEAD EXPENSES AT BASE BUSINESSES DUE TO TIGHTER COST CONTROLS.

THE INCREASE IN ACQUISITION REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF A EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING BUSINESS, A EUROPEAN STRETCH PACKAGING BUSINESS AND A U.S. EQUIPMENT BUSINESS. TOTAL BASE REVENUES INCREASED FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS AS PRICE INCREASES AND STRONG GROWTH IN THE WORLDWIDE INSULATION BUSINESSES, DUE TO PENETRATION IN EMERGING MARKETS, WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY VOLUME DECLINES IN THE STRAPPING BUSINESSES. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 2.9% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008 AND INCREASED 6.9% YEAR-TO-DATE OVER THE SAME PERIODS OF 2007. IN THE THIRD QUARTER, THE POSITIVE LEVERAGE EFFECT OF THE REVENUE INCREASE, INCOME FROM ACQUISITIONS AND THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY DECREASED VARIABLE MARGINS AND HIGHER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES. VARIABLE MARGINS IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE WAS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY INCREASED RAW MATERIAL COSTS AND UNFAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX. YEAR-TO-DATE, LOWER OVERHEAD COSTS, AS A RESULT OF TIGHTER COST CONTROLS AND THE BENEFIT OF PRIOR YEAR RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE INCREASES.

BASE REVENUES GREW 3.1% AND 3.9% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS PRIMARILY DUE TO A 26.4% AND 23.3% INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL WELDING BUSINESSES IN THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO STRONGER ASIAN DEMAND IN ENERGY AND SHIP BUILDING END MARKETS. THE THIRD QUARTER DECLINE IN NORTH AMERICAN WELDING BASE REVENUES OF 0.9% IS A RESULT OF THE CONTINUED SLOWDOWN IN U.S. INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND RELATED END MARKETS. YEAR-TO-DATE NORTH AMERICAN WELDING REVENUES HAVE INCREASED 0.2%. THE ACQUISITION REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PURCHASE OF A PC BOARD FABRICATION BUSINESS AND A WELDING ACCESSORIES BUSINESS. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 6.7% AND 12.3% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2008, RESPECTIVELY, OVER THE SAME PERIODS OF 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE POSITIVE LEVERAGE EFFECT FROM THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES AND THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION. IN THE THIRD QUARTER, THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INCOME FROM ACQUISITIONS AND DECREASED VARIABLE MARGINS. BASE MARGINS INCREASED 40 BASIS POINTS AND 120 BASIS POINTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO LEVERAGE FROM THE INCREASE IN REVENUE. YEAR-TO-DATE MARGIN GAINS FROM LOWER OVERHEAD EXPENSES DUE TO IMPROVED PERFORMANCE IN THE PC BOARD BUSINESSES ARE A RESULT OF PRIOR YEAR RESTRUCTURINGS.

OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 0.3% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED RAW MATERIAL COSTS AND THE NEGATIVE LEVERAGE EFFECT FROM THE DECREASE IN BASE REVENUES DISCUSSED ABOVE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND INCOME FROM ACQUISITIONS. YEAR-TO-DATE OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 5.6% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION, INCOME FROM ACQUISITIONS AND LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES RESULTING FROM TIGHT COST CONTROL MEASURES. BASE MARGINS DECLINED IN THE THIRD QUARTER AS A RESULT OF LOWER REVENUES AND LOWER VARIABLE MARGINS DUE TO INCREASED RAW MATERIAL COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES. YEAR-TO-DATE BASE MARGINS WERE FLAT AS THE IMPACT OF REVENUE DECLINES WERE OFFSET BY LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES. INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $112.1 MILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2008 FROM $75.7 MILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEREST ON THE 5.25% EURO NOTES ISSUED IN OCTOBER 2007. OTHER INCOME OTHER INCOME DECREASED TO $20.1 MILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2008 VERSUS INCOME OF $53.6 MILLION IN 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO A FIRST QUARTER 2008 CHARGE FOR EUROPEAN TRANSFER TAXES RELATED TO LEGAL ENTITY STRUCTURING TRANSACTIONS AND LOWER INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2008. THESE AMOUNTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GAINS ON CURRENCY TRANSLATION IN 2008 VERSUS LOSSES IN 2007 AND HIGHER INTEREST INCOME IN 2008 EARNED ON SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. INCOME TAXES THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2008 WAS 28.5% COMPARED TO 29.8% FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2007. THE REDUCTION IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM A HIGHER PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF INCOME IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS WITH LOWER TAX RATES. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $1.31 BILLION ($2.49 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2008 WAS 3.3% HIGHER THAN THE 2007 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $1.27 BILLION ($2.27 PER DILUTED SHARE). FOREIGN CURRENCY THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2008 INCREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2008 BY APPROXIMATELY $576 MILLION AND INCREASED INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY 12 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2007 INCREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2007 BY APPROXIMATELY $315 MILLION AND INCREASED INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY 7 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WAS A LOSS OF $24.7 MILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2008 VERSUS INCOME OF $130.7 MILLION IN 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND LOWER GAINS ON SALES OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ON JANUARY 1, 2008, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 158, EMPLOYERS' ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS-AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND 132(R) ("SFAS 158"), WHICH REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO CHANGE ITS MEASUREMENT DATE TO CORRESPOND WITH THE COMPANY'S FISCAL YEAR END. THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY USED A SEPTEMBER 30 MEASUREMENT DATE. AS ALLOWED UNDER SFAS 158, THE COMPANY ELECTED TO REMEASURE ITS PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR. UPON ADOPTION, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $12.8 MILLION TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS AND AN AFTER-TAX GAIN TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF $3.6 MILLION, RELATED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE ITS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES, WHICH MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINE OF 25% TO 35% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS AVERAGE INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS USED TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2008 AND 2007 WAS AS FOLLOWS: ON AUGUST 20, 2007 THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME.

THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ROIC FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2008 AND 2007 WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE 230 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN ROIC IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008 WAS THE RESULT OF AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASING 13.2% WHILE AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 1.5%. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO ACQUISITIONS. OPERATING INCOME DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO NEGATIVE EFFECT OF LOWER SALES AND DECREASED VARIABLE MARGINS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND INCREASED INCOME FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. THE 70 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN ROIC FOR YEAR-TO-DATE 2008 WAS THE RESULT OF AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASING 11.6% WHILE AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME INCREASED ONLY 7.2%. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO ACQUISITIONS WHILE OPERATING INCOME ALSO INCREASED DUE TO THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF TRANSLATION AND INCOME FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY DECREASED BASE INCOME. WORKING CAPITAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: INVENTORIES INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF ACQUISITIONS. SHORT-TERM DEBT INCREASED DUE TO AN INCREASE IN COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FUND STOCK REPURCHASES, AS WELL AS THE 5.75% REDEEMABLE NOTES BECOMING CURRENT. DEBT TOTAL DEBT AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007 WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OF $1,493.7 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2008 AND $201.0 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. IN 1999, THE COMPANY ISSUED $500.0 MILLION OF 5.75% REDEEMABLE NOTES DUE MARCH 1, 2009. THE BALANCE RELATED TO THESE NOTES OUTSTANDING AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2008 WAS CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM DEBT.

THE ACQUIRED REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ACQUISITION OF A EUROPEAN FOOD EQUIPMENT BUSINESS AND TWO WORLDWIDE FOOD PROCESSING EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES. INTERNATIONAL BASE REVENUES DECLINED 3.2% IN THE THIRD QUARTER DUE TO WEAKENING EUROPEAN END MARKET DEMAND. FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD, INTERNATIONAL BASE REVENUES INCREASED 3.2% ON THE STRENGTH OF STRONG ASIAN DEMAND. NORTH AMERICAN BASE REVENUE DECLINED 1.2% IN THE THIRD QUARTER WHILE INCREASING 0.3% YEAR-TO-DATE PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SERVICE REVENUE OFFSET BY DECLINES IN THE INSTITUTIONAL/RESTAURANT END MARKET. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 1.6% AND INCREASED 4.3% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2008, RESPECTIVELY, OVER THE SAME PERIODS OF 2007. IN THE THIRD QUARTER, FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND INCOME FROM ACQUISITIONS WERE OFFSET BY INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES AND HIGHER RESTRUCTURING COSTS. THIRD QUARTER BASE INCOME DECREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF NORTH AMERICAN REVENUE DECLINES. DESPITE THE DECLINE IN INTERNATIONAL REVENUES FOR THE THIRD QUARTER, OPERATING INCOME WAS FLAT AS A RESULT OF TIGHT COST CONTROLS. BASE MARGINS DECLINED IN BOTH THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS DUE TO COMPETITIVE PRICE PRESSURE AND HIGHER WARRANTY EXPENSES IN THE FOOD PROCESSING EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES, INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE SERVICE BUSINESS AND NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTION COSTS.

ACQUISITION REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE PURCHASE OF THREE POLYMERS AND INDUSTRIAL ADHESIVES BUSINESSES, AN INTERNATIONAL FLUID PRODUCTS BUSINESS, AN AUSTRALIAN POLYMERS BUSINESS, TWO NORTH AMERICAN CONSTRUCTION ADHESIVES BUSINESSES AND A SOUTH AMERICAN SEALANT BUSINESS. BASE REVENUES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN NORTH AMERICAN POLYMERS BUSINESSES OF 15.4% AND 9.1% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, MAINLY IN SPECIALTY ADHESIVES AND EPOXY PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN DEMAND IN THE EUROPEAN FLUIDS AND CONSTRUCTION POLYMERS BUSINESSES. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 22.0% AND 24.0% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2008, RESPECTIVELY, OVER THE SAME PERIODS OF 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCOME FROM ACQUISITIONS, THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF LEVERAGE FROM THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES. TOTAL OPERATING MARGINS DECREASED FOR BOTH PERIODS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER MARGINS OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER BASE MARGINS.

THE INCREASE IN ACQUISITION REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PURCHASE OF THREE TEST AND MEASUREMENT BUSINESSES, TWO WORLDWIDE DECORATING AND GRAPHICS BUSINESSES AND A LABEL BUSINESS. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008, BASE REVENUES DECREASED 4.0% AND 2.4% FOR THE WORLDWIDE INDUSTRIAL AND APPLIANCE BUSINESSES AND CONSUMER PACKAGING BUSINESSES, RESPECTIVELY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF 11.2% AND 0.8% IN THE WORLDWIDE TEST AND MEASUREMENT AND FINISHING BUSINESSES, RESPECTIVELY. THE 1.0% DECLINE IN THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A 9.9% INCREASE IN THE TEST AND MEASUREMENT BUSINESSES, OFFSET BY DECLINES OF 5.6%, 1.7%, AND 1.0% IN THE INDUSTRIAL APPLIANCE, CONSUMER PACKAGING AND FINISHING BUSINESSES, RESPECTIVELY. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 0.3% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED RAW MATERIAL COSTS AND THE NEGATIVE LEVERAGE EFFECT FROM THE DECREASE IN BASE REVENUES DISCUSSED ABOVE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND INCOME FROM ACQUISITIONS. YEAR-TO-DATE OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 5.6% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION, INCOME FROM ACQUISITIONS AND LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES RESULTING FROM TIGHT COST CONTROL MEASURES. BASE MARGINS DECLINED IN THE THIRD QUARTER AS A RESULT OF LOWER REVENUES AND LOWER VARIABLE MARGINS DUE TO INCREASED RAW MATERIAL COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES. YEAR-TO-DATE BASE MARGINS WERE FLAT AS THE IMPACT OF REVENUE DECLINES WERE OFFSET BY LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES. INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $112.1 MILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2008 FROM $75.7 MILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEREST ON THE 5.25% EURO NOTES ISSUED IN OCTOBER 2007. OTHER INCOME OTHER INCOME DECREASED TO $20.1 MILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2008 VERSUS INCOME OF $53.6 MILLION IN 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO A FIRST QUARTER 2008 CHARGE FOR EUROPEAN TRANSFER TAXES RELATED TO LEGAL ENTITY STRUCTURING TRANSACTIONS AND LOWER INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2008. THESE AMOUNTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GAINS ON CURRENCY TRANSLATION IN 2008 VERSUS LOSSES IN 2007 AND HIGHER INTEREST INCOME IN 2008 EARNED ON SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. INCOME TAXES THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2008 WAS 28.5% COMPARED TO 29.8% FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2007. THE REDUCTION IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM A HIGHER PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF INCOME IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS WITH LOWER TAX RATES. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $1.31 BILLION ($2.49 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2008 WAS 3.3% HIGHER THAN THE 2007 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $1.27 BILLION ($2.27 PER DILUTED SHARE). FOREIGN CURRENCY THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2008 INCREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2008 BY APPROXIMATELY $576 MILLION AND INCREASED INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY 12 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2007 INCREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2007 BY APPROXIMATELY $315 MILLION AND INCREASED INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY 7 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WAS A LOSS OF $24.7 MILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2008 VERSUS INCOME OF $130.7 MILLION IN 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND LOWER GAINS ON SALES OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ON JANUARY 1, 2008, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 158, EMPLOYERS' ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS-AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND 132(R) ("SFAS 158"), WHICH REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO CHANGE ITS MEASUREMENT DATE TO CORRESPOND WITH THE COMPANY'S FISCAL YEAR END. THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY USED A SEPTEMBER 30 MEASUREMENT DATE. AS ALLOWED UNDER SFAS 158, THE COMPANY ELECTED TO REMEASURE ITS PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR. UPON ADOPTION, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $12.8 MILLION TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS AND AN AFTER-TAX GAIN TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF $3.6 MILLION, RELATED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE ITS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES, WHICH MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINE OF 25% TO 35% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS AVERAGE INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS USED TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2008 AND 2007 WAS AS FOLLOWS: ON AUGUST 20, 2007 THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME. IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2008, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 20.2 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $48.97 PER SHARE. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ROIC FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2008 AND 2007 WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE 230 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN ROIC IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008 WAS THE RESULT OF AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASING 13.2% WHILE AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 1.5%. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO ACQUISITIONS. OPERATING INCOME DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO NEGATIVE EFFECT OF LOWER SALES AND DECREASED VARIABLE MARGINS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND INCREASED INCOME FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. THE 70 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN ROIC FOR YEAR-TO-DATE 2008 WAS THE RESULT OF AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASING 11.6% WHILE AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME INCREASED ONLY 7.2%. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO ACQUISITIONS WHILE OPERATING INCOME ALSO INCREASED DUE TO THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF TRANSLATION AND INCOME FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY DECREASED BASE INCOME. WORKING CAPITAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: INVENTORIES INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF ACQUISITIONS. SHORT-TERM DEBT INCREASED DUE TO AN INCREASE IN COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FUND STOCK REPURCHASES, AS WELL AS THE 5.75% REDEEMABLE NOTES BECOMING CURRENT. DEBT TOTAL DEBT AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007 WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OF $1,493.7 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2008 AND $201.0 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007.
