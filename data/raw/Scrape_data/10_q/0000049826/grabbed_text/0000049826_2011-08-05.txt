SEE THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NOTE IN ITEM 1 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS REGARDING THE COMPANY’S DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE COMPANY’S PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT, TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS, TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH AND TO FUND SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE PRIMARY USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE: · DIVIDEND PAYMENTS – THE COMPANY’S DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINES ARE 30% TO 45% OF THE AVERAGE OF THE LAST TWO YEARS OF FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW; · ACQUISITIONS; AND · ANY EXCESS LIQUIDITY MAY BE USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES. CASH FLOW THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2011 AND 2010 WAS AS FOLLOWS: ON AUGUST 20, 2007, THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME (THE “2007 PROGRAM”). IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2011, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 9.6 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $57.01 PER SHARE UNDER THIS PROGRAM. AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY $321 MILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THE 2007 PROGRAM. ON MAY 6, 2011, THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $4.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME (THE “2011 PROGRAM”). AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, NO SHARES HAVE BEEN REPURCHASED UNDER THE 2011 PROGRAM. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (“ROIC”) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS’ USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ROIC IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE YEAR AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2011 AND 2010, ROIC WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE ROIC DECREASE OF 70 BASIS POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2011 WAS THE RESULT OF AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASING 23.4%, WHILE OPERATING INCOME AFTER TAXES INCREASED 18.1%. THE ROIC INCREASE OF 40 BASIS POINTS FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF 2011 WAS THE RESULT OF OPERATING INCOME AFTER TAXES INCREASING 21.7%, WHILE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASED 18.2%. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, THE COMPANY RECORDED A FAVORABLE DISCRETE NON-CASH TAX BENEFIT OF $165.9 MILLION RELATED TO THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA, VICTORIA DECISION IN THE COMPANY’S FAVOR WITH RESPECT TO A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS. SEE THE INCOME TAXES NOTE IN ITEM 1 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THIS DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENT. SINCE THE BENEFIT WAS UNUSUAL, THE ROIC CALCULATION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THIS ITEM TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY AND BETTER REFLECT THE RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED. A RECONCILIATION OF THE 2011 YEAR-TO-DATE TAX RATE AS REPORTED TO THE TAX RATE USED ABOVE IS AS FOLLOWS: SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2011 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES INCOME TAXES TAX RATE AS REPORTED $ 1,301,516 $ 211,750 16.3 % DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENT — 165,927 12.7 % AS ADJUSTED $ 1,301,516 $ 377,677 29.0 % IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, THE COMPANY RECORDED A DISCRETE TAX CHARGE OF $21.9 MILLION RELATED TO THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT. SEE THE INCOME TAXES NOTE IN ITEM 1 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THIS DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENT. SINCE THIS CHARGE WAS UNUSUAL, THE ROIC CALCULATION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THIS ITEM TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY AND BETTER REFLECT THE RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED. A RECONCILIATION OF THE 2010 YEAR-TO-DATE TAX RATE AS REPORTED TO THE TAX RATE USED ABOVE IS AS FOLLOWS: SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2010 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES INCOME TAXES TAX RATE AS REPORTED $ 1,070,231 $ 349,143 32.6 % DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENT — (21,881 ) (2.0 )% AS ADJUSTED $ 1,070,231 $ 327,262 30.6 % WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT USES WORKING CAPITAL AS A MEASUREMENT OF THE SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY. NET WORKING CAPITAL AT JUNE 30, 2011 AND DECEMBER 31, 2010 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: TRADE RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES AND ACQUISITIONS. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER TAX RECEIVABLES. SHORT-TERM DEBT INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO ISSUANCES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FUND ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER PURCHASE ACTIVITY, AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASE IN INCOME TAXES PAYABLE. DEBT THE COMPANY’S TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO IS 20% TO 30%, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ANY LARGER ACQUISITIONS. TOTAL DEBT AT JUNE 30, 2011 AND DECEMBER 31, 2010 WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OF APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION AT JUNE 30, 2011, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN SHORT-TERM DEBT, AND NO OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER AT DECEMBER 31, 2010.

THE INCREASE IN ACQUISITION REVENUE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PURCHASE OF TWO NORTH AMERICAN AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET BUSINESSES, ONE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010, AND ONE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011. NORTH AMERICAN AUTOMOTIVE BASE REVENUES INCREASED 6.6% AND 12.2% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NORTH AMERICAN AUTO BUILDS OF 1.0% AND 8.4% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY.

SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2011 AND 2010 WAS AS FOLLOWS: ON AUGUST 20, 2007, THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME (THE “2007 PROGRAM”).

AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY $321 MILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THE 2007 PROGRAM. ON MAY 6, 2011, THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $4.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME (THE “2011 PROGRAM”). AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, NO SHARES HAVE BEEN REPURCHASED UNDER THE 2011 PROGRAM. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (“ROIC”) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS’ USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ROIC IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE YEAR AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2011 AND 2010, ROIC WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE ROIC DECREASE OF 70 BASIS POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2011 WAS THE RESULT OF AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASING 23.4%, WHILE OPERATING INCOME AFTER TAXES INCREASED 18.1%. THE ROIC INCREASE OF 40 BASIS POINTS FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF 2011 WAS THE RESULT OF OPERATING INCOME AFTER TAXES INCREASING 21.7%, WHILE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASED 18.2%. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, THE COMPANY RECORDED A FAVORABLE DISCRETE NON-CASH TAX BENEFIT OF $165.9 MILLION RELATED TO THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA, VICTORIA DECISION IN THE COMPANY’S FAVOR WITH RESPECT TO A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS. SEE THE INCOME TAXES NOTE IN ITEM 1 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THIS DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENT. SINCE THE BENEFIT WAS UNUSUAL, THE ROIC CALCULATION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THIS ITEM TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY AND BETTER REFLECT THE RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED. A RECONCILIATION OF THE 2011 YEAR-TO-DATE TAX RATE AS REPORTED TO THE TAX RATE USED ABOVE IS AS FOLLOWS: SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2011 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES INCOME TAXES TAX RATE AS REPORTED $ 1,301,516 $ 211,750 16.3 % DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENT — 165,927 12.7 % AS ADJUSTED $ 1,301,516 $ 377,677 29.0 % IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, THE COMPANY RECORDED A DISCRETE TAX CHARGE OF $21.9 MILLION RELATED TO THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT. SEE THE INCOME TAXES NOTE IN ITEM 1 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THIS DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENT. SINCE THIS CHARGE WAS UNUSUAL, THE ROIC CALCULATION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THIS ITEM TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY AND BETTER REFLECT THE RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED.

NET WORKING CAPITAL AT JUNE 30, 2011 AND DECEMBER 31, 2010 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: TRADE RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES AND ACQUISITIONS. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER TAX RECEIVABLES. SHORT-TERM DEBT INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO ISSUANCES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FUND ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER PURCHASE ACTIVITY, AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASE IN INCOME TAXES PAYABLE. DEBT THE COMPANY’S TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO IS 20% TO 30%, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ANY LARGER ACQUISITIONS. TOTAL DEBT AT JUNE 30, 2011 AND DECEMBER 31, 2010 WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OF APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION AT JUNE 30, 2011, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN SHORT-TERM DEBT, AND NO OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER AT DECEMBER 31, 2010.
