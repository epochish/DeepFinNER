THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2009 AND 2008 WERE AS FOLLOWS: IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2009, THE CHANGES IN REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGINS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30 SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30 % INCREASE (DECREASE) % POINT INCREASE (DECREASE) % INCREASE (DECREASE) % POINT INCREASE (DECREASE) OPERATING REVENUES OPERATING INCOME OPERATING MARGINS OPERATING REVENUES OPERATING INCOME OPERATING MARGINS BASE MANUFACTURING BUSINESS: REVENUE CHANGE/OPERATING LEVERAGE (22.2 )% (55.3 )% (7.1 )% (22.5 )% (59.0 )% (7.5 )% CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS  14.6 3.1  10.8 2.2 TOTAL (22.2 ) (40.7 ) (4.0 ) (22.5 ) (48.2 ) (5.3 ) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 5.3 (0.2 ) (0.8 ) 5.7 (0.8 ) (0.7 ) RESTRUCTURING COSTS  (5.9 ) (1.3 )  (5.4 ) (1.1 ) IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES     (6.4 ) (1.3 ) TRANSLATION (8.8 ) (8.9 ) (0.7 ) (8.0 ) (8.2 ) (0.9 ) OTHER 0.2 (0.1 ) 0.1 0.1   TOTAL (25.5 )% (55.8 )% (6.7 )% (24.7 )% (69.0 )% (9.3 )% OPERATING REVENUES REVENUES DECREASED 25.5% AND 24.7% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2009, RESPECTIVELY, VERSUS 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER BASE REVENUES AND THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION, MAINLY DUE TO A WEAKER EURO VERSUS THE DOLLAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REVENUES FROM ACQUISITIONS. TOTAL BASE REVENUES DECLINED 22.2% AND 22.5% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. NORTH AMERICAN BASE REVENUE DECLINED 26.8% AND 26.5%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE INTERNATIONAL BASE REVENUES DECLINED 17.3% AND 18.1% IN THE SAME PERIODS. BOTH NORTH AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL BASE REVENUES WERE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ON-GOING AND SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN MACROECONOMIC TRENDS AND RELATED WEAK INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT THE CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT WILL CONTINUE THROUGH 2009 AND AS SUCH, EXPECTS THAT KEY END MARKETS WILL CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME DECLINED 55.8% AND 69.0% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2009, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES, THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND INCREASED RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009 THE COMPANY RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $78 MILLION AND $12 MILLION AGAINST THE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, RESPECTIVELY. THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE COMBINATION OF LOWER FORECASTS AND LOWER MARKET MULTIPLES BEING PAID FOR SIMILAR BUSINESSES. THE HIGHER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES REFLECT THE COMPANYS EFFORTS TO REDUCE COSTS IN RESPONSE TO CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IMPROVEMENTS IN BASE VARIABLE MARGINS AND LOWER OVERHEAD COSTS INCREASED MARGINS 3.1% AND 2.2% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, AS THE BENEFITS OF PAST RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS BEGAN TO BE REALIZED AND PRICE VERSUS COST COMPARISONS WERE FAVORABLE. TOTAL MARGINS DECLINED BY 6.7% AND 9.3% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2009, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINES IN BASE REVENUES, RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND THE FIRST QUARTER GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

NORTH AMERICAN LAMINATE BASE REVENUES DECLINED 20.0% AND 19.4% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, AS A RESULT OF THE CONTINUED DOWNTURN IN COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION. THESE DECLINES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED PRODUCT PENETRATION IN THE PREMIUM HIGH DEFINITION LAMINATE PRODUCT SEGMENT. INTERNATIONAL BASE REVENUES DECLINED 11.6% AND 12.3% IN THE SAME PERIODS DUE TO EUROPEAN VOLUME DECLINES. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 27.2% AND 23.5% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINE IN REVENUES DESCRIBED ABOVE, HIGHER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES AND THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION. IMPROVEMENTS IN BASE VARIABLE MARGINS AND LOWER OVERHEAD COSTS INCREASED MARGINS 5.3% AND 5.8% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, LARGELY DUE TO HIGHER PRICES ON PREMIUM PRODUCTS, LOWER RAW MATERIAL COSTS AND BENEFITS FROM PRIOR RESTRUCTURING EXPENSE.

THE INCREASE IN ACQUISITION REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PURCHASE OF TWO TEST AND MEASUREMENT BUSINESSES. BASE REVENUES DECLINED IN THE SECOND QUARTER 26.9%, 38.7%, 12.9% AND 15.3% FOR THE INDUSTRIAL PLASTICS AND METALS, FINISHING, CONSUMER PACKAGING AND TEST AND MEASUREMENT BUSINESSES, RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO THE EFFECT OF WEAK CAPITAL EXPENDITURE SPENDING AND A FALL-OFF IN END MARKET DEMAND ACROSS THE BROAD SPECTRUM OF INDUSTRIES THIS SEGMENT SERVES. YEAR-TO-DATE THESE DECLINES WERE 27.3%, 31.8%, 14.0% AND 14.2%, RESPECTIVELY. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME DECLINED 46.0% AND 46.8% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2009, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND HIGHER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES. TOTAL OPERATING MARGINS DECLINED BY 6.8% IN BOTH PERIODS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE LOWER MARGINS FOR BOTH BASE AND ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. BASE MARGINS DECLINED BY 3.0% AND 3.8% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE, RESPECTIVELY, AS FAVORABLE PRICE VERSUS COST COMPARISONS AND GAINS FROM TIGHT COST CONTROLS WERE OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF LOWER REVENUES. AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMORTIZATION EXPENSE INCREASED TO $102.5 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2009 VERSUS $82.4 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2008, DUE TO INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION RELATED TO NEWLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2008. TOTAL GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES BY SEGMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2009 AND 2008 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30 2009 2008 INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING $ 386 $  POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS 24,766 824 TRANSPORTATION 2,414 13 FOOD EQUIPMENT 46  POLYMERS & FLUIDS 60,416 251 ALL OTHER 1,969 350 $ 89,997 $ 1,438 SEE THE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS NOTE FOR FURTHER DETAILS OF THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $75.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2009 FROM $74.1 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2008 DUE TO INTEREST ON THE 5.15% AND 6.25% NOTES ISSUED ON MARCH 23, 2009, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE 6.875% NOTES AND 5.75% BONDS REPAID AT MATURITY ON NOVEMBER 17, 2008 AND MARCH 2, 2009, RESPECTIVELY, AND LOWER COMMERCIAL PAPER RATES AND BORROWINGS. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) WAS EXPENSE OF $24.2 MILLION FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2009 VERSUS INCOME OF $3.2 MILLION IN 2008, PRIMARILY DUE TO INVESTMENT AND CURRENCY TRANSLATION LOSSES IN 2009 VERSUS GAINS IN 2008 AND LOWER INTEREST INCOME IN 2009, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A CHARGE FOR GERMAN TAXES IN 2008. INCOME TAXES THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2009 WAS 47.67% COMPARED TO 29.19% FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2008. THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM THE IMPAIRMENT OF NON-DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL AND DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENTS IN 2009. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $170.9 MILLION ($0.34 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2009 WAS 81.5% LOWER THAN THE 2008 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $924.0 MILLION ($1.75 PER DILUTED SHARE). FOREIGN CURRENCY THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2009 DECREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2009 BY APPROXIMATELY $565 MILLION AND DECREASED INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY 7 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WAS $33.7 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2009 COMPARED TO $92.3 MILLION IN 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO 2008 IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL OF $97.2 MILLION VERSUS THE 2009 LOSS ON SALE OF THE CLICK COMMERCE INDUSTRIAL SOFTWARE BUSINESS OF $29.8 MILLION. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. THE COMPANYS TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO IS 20% TO 30%, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ANY LARGER ACQUISITIONS. THE PRIMARY USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE:  DIVIDEND PAYMENTS  THE COMPANYS DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINES ARE 25% TO 35% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS AVERAGE INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS;  ACQUISITIONS; AND  ANY EXCESS LIQUIDITY MAY BE USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES. THE COMPANYS OPEN-ENDED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ALLOWS IT FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING THE TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED ON ITS CURRENT FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW, DEBT-TO-CAPITALIZATION RATIOS AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY. CASH FLOW FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS USED BY MANAGEMENT TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009 AND 2008 WAS AS FOLLOWS: ON AUGUST 20, 2007 THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. WE BELIEVE THAT ROIC IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. ROIC FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009 AND 2008 WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE ROIC DECREASE OF 10.2% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009 WAS THE RESULT OF AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME DECREASING 58.9%, RESULTING FROM THE CURRENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, WHILE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL DECREASED 10.6%. THE ROIC DECREASE OF 10.5% FOR YEAR-TO-DATE 2009 WAS THE RESULT OF AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME DECREASING 63.9%, RESULTING FROM THE CURRENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, WHILE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL DECREASED 7.8%. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, THE COMPANY INCURRED SIGNIFICANT CHARGES FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $90.0 MILLION THAT WAS MOSTLY NON-DEDUCTIBLE AND DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENTS OF $28.0 MILLION. SINCE THESE CHARGES WERE UNUSUAL, THE ROIC CALCULATION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THESE ITEMS TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY AND BETTER REFLECT THE RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL FOR THE 2009 YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD PRESENTED ABOVE. A RECONCILIATION OF YEAR-TO-DATE OPERATING INCOME AND THE TAX RATE AS REPORTED TO OPERATING INCOME AFTER TAXES AND TAX RATE USED ABOVE IS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) OPERATING INCOME INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES INCOME TAXES TAX RATE AS REPORTED $ 426,129 $ 326,627 $ 155,700 47.7 % GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS 89,997 89,997 5,058 (7.3 )% DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENTS   (27,800 ) (8.5 )% AS ADJUSTED 516,126 $ 416,624 $ 132,958 31.9 % INCOME TAXES AT THE ADJUSTED RATE OF 31.9% (164,644 ) ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME AFTER TAXES $ 351,482 WORKING CAPITAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AT JUNE 30, 2009 AND DECEMBER 31, 2008 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: SHORT-TERM DEBT DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PAY DOWN OF COMMERCIAL PAPER RESULTING FROM THE ISSUANCE OF $1.5 BILLION OF LONG-TERM NOTES, CASH REPATRIATION TO THE U.S. FROM EUROPE AND EXCESS CASH FLOW. INVENTORIES DECREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF LOWER PURCHASE ACTIVITY. TRADE RECEIVABLES DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REVENUES. DEBT TOTAL DEBT AT JUNE 30, 2009 AND DECEMBER 31, 2008 WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OF $122.0 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2009 AND $1.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. IN 1999, THE COMPANY ISSUED $500.0 MILLION OF 5.75% REDEEMABLE NOTES DUE MARCH 1, 2009. THE BALANCE RELATED TO THESE NOTES OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 WAS REPAID AT MATURITY.

THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING WERE USED TO PAY DOWN THE COMPANYS COMMERCIAL PAPER BALANCE. IN JUNE 2008, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $1.5 BILLION LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 12, 2009. IN OCTOBER 2008, THE COMPANY AMENDED THE LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE LINE OF CREDIT TO $2.5 BILLION. THIS LINE OF CREDIT WAS REPLACED ON JUNE 12, 2009 BY A $2.0 BILLION LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 11, 2010.

ITEM 4  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE COMPANYS CHAIRMAN & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT & CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, HAS EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (AS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A15(E)) AS OF JUNE 30, 2009. BASED ON SUCH EVALUATION, THE COMPANYS CHAIRMAN & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT & CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, HAVE CONCLUDED THAT, AS OF JUNE 30, 2009, THE COMPANYS DISCLOSURE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FOR ALL PERIODS HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO PRESENT THE RESULTS RELATED TO THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT AS CONTINUING OPERATIONS. THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2009 AND 2008 WERE AS FOLLOWS: IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2009, THE CHANGES IN REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGINS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30 SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30 % INCREASE (DECREASE) % POINT INCREASE (DECREASE) % INCREASE (DECREASE) % POINT INCREASE (DECREASE) OPERATING REVENUES OPERATING INCOME OPERATING MARGINS OPERATING REVENUES OPERATING INCOME OPERATING MARGINS BASE MANUFACTURING BUSINESS: REVENUE CHANGE/OPERATING LEVERAGE (22.2 )% (55.3 )% (7.1 )% (22.5 )% (59.0 )% (7.5 )% CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS  14.6 3.1  10.8 2.2 TOTAL (22.2 ) (40.7 ) (4.0 ) (22.5 ) (48.2 ) (5.3 ) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 5.3 (0.2 ) (0.8 ) 5.7 (0.8 ) (0.7 ) RESTRUCTURING COSTS  (5.9 ) (1.3 )  (5.4 ) (1.1 ) IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES     (6.4 ) (1.3 ) TRANSLATION (8.8 ) (8.9 ) (0.7 ) (8.0 ) (8.2 ) (0.9 ) OTHER 0.2 (0.1 ) 0.1 0.1   TOTAL (25.5 )% (55.8 )% (6.7 )% (24.7 )% (69.0 )% (9.3 )% OPERATING REVENUES REVENUES DECREASED 25.5% AND 24.7% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2009, RESPECTIVELY, VERSUS 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER BASE REVENUES AND THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION, MAINLY DUE TO A WEAKER EURO VERSUS THE DOLLAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REVENUES FROM ACQUISITIONS. TOTAL BASE REVENUES DECLINED 22.2% AND 22.5% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. NORTH AMERICAN BASE REVENUE DECLINED 26.8% AND 26.5%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE INTERNATIONAL BASE REVENUES DECLINED 17.3% AND 18.1% IN THE SAME PERIODS. BOTH NORTH AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL BASE REVENUES WERE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ON-GOING AND SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN MACROECONOMIC TRENDS AND RELATED WEAK INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT THE CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT WILL CONTINUE THROUGH 2009 AND AS SUCH, EXPECTS THAT KEY END MARKETS WILL CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME DECLINED 55.8% AND 69.0% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2009, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES, THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND INCREASED RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009 THE COMPANY RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $78 MILLION AND $12 MILLION AGAINST THE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, RESPECTIVELY. THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE COMBINATION OF LOWER FORECASTS AND LOWER MARKET MULTIPLES BEING PAID FOR SIMILAR BUSINESSES. THE HIGHER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES REFLECT THE COMPANYS EFFORTS TO REDUCE COSTS IN RESPONSE TO CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IMPROVEMENTS IN BASE VARIABLE MARGINS AND LOWER OVERHEAD COSTS INCREASED MARGINS 3.1% AND 2.2% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, AS THE BENEFITS OF PAST RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS BEGAN TO BE REALIZED AND PRICE VERSUS COST COMPARISONS WERE FAVORABLE. TOTAL MARGINS DECLINED BY 6.7% AND 9.3% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2009, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINES IN BASE REVENUES, RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND THE FIRST QUARTER GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. THE RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES TO TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES IS AS FOLLOWS: INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT PRODUCE STEEL, PLASTIC AND PAPER PRODUCTS USED FOR BUNDLING, SHIPPING AND PROTECTING GOODS IN TRANSIT.

BASE REVENUES DECLINED 43.1% AND 40.6% FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN STRAPPING BUSINESSES IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, LARGELY DUE TO DECLINES IN CONSUMABLE AND EQUIPMENT VOLUME IN KEY END MARKETS SUCH AS PRIMARY METALS, CONSTRUCTION-RELATED MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING. THE INTERNATIONAL STRAPPING BUSINESSES DECLINED 28.9% AND 27.6%, RESPECTIVELY. BOTH WERE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE CONTINUED GLOBAL DECLINE IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES. THE WORLDWIDE STRETCH PACKAGING BUSINESSES EXPERIENCED DECLINES IN BASE REVENUES OF 22.9% AND 21.2% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE THE PROTECTIVE PACKAGING BUSINESS DECLINED 6.8% AND 11.4% FOR THE SAME PERIODS BOTH DUE TO CONTINUING WEAKNESS IN WORLDWIDE INDUSTRIAL-BASED END MARKETS. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 82.8% AND 91.7% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2009, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NEGATIVE LEVERAGE EFFECT OF THE DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND HIGHER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES. IMPROVEMENTS IN BASE VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS INCREASED MARGINS 3.4% AND 1.7% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, AS PRICE VERSUS COST COMPARISONS WERE FAVORABLE AND BENEFITS OF PAST RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS BEGAN TO BE REALIZED. TOTAL OPERATING MARGINS DECLINED BY 9.7% AND 10.6% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, MAINLY DUE TO THE DECLINES IN BASE REVENUES.

THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM THE IMPAIRMENT OF NON-DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL AND DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENTS IN 2009. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $170.9 MILLION ($0.34 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2009 WAS 81.5% LOWER THAN THE 2008 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $924.0 MILLION ($1.75 PER DILUTED SHARE). FOREIGN CURRENCY THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2009 DECREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2009 BY APPROXIMATELY $565 MILLION AND DECREASED INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY 7 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WAS $33.7 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2009 COMPARED TO $92.3 MILLION IN 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO 2008 IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL OF $97.2 MILLION VERSUS THE 2009 LOSS ON SALE OF THE CLICK COMMERCE INDUSTRIAL SOFTWARE BUSINESS OF $29.8 MILLION. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. THE COMPANYS TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO IS 20% TO 30%, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ANY LARGER ACQUISITIONS. THE PRIMARY USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE:  DIVIDEND PAYMENTS  THE COMPANYS DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINES ARE 25% TO 35% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS AVERAGE INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS;  ACQUISITIONS; AND  ANY EXCESS LIQUIDITY MAY BE USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES. THE COMPANYS OPEN-ENDED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ALLOWS IT FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING THE TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED ON ITS CURRENT FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW, DEBT-TO-CAPITALIZATION RATIOS AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY. CASH FLOW FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS USED BY MANAGEMENT TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009 AND 2008 WAS AS FOLLOWS: ON AUGUST 20, 2007 THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. WE BELIEVE THAT ROIC IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. ROIC FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009 AND 2008 WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE ROIC DECREASE OF 10.2% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009 WAS THE RESULT OF AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME DECREASING 58.9%, RESULTING FROM THE CURRENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, WHILE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL DECREASED 10.6%. THE ROIC DECREASE OF 10.5% FOR YEAR-TO-DATE 2009 WAS THE RESULT OF AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME DECREASING 63.9%, RESULTING FROM THE CURRENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, WHILE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL DECREASED 7.8%. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, THE COMPANY INCURRED SIGNIFICANT CHARGES FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $90.0 MILLION THAT WAS MOSTLY NON-DEDUCTIBLE AND DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENTS OF $28.0 MILLION. SINCE THESE CHARGES WERE UNUSUAL, THE ROIC CALCULATION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THESE ITEMS TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY AND BETTER REFLECT THE RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL FOR THE 2009 YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD PRESENTED ABOVE. A RECONCILIATION OF YEAR-TO-DATE OPERATING INCOME AND THE TAX RATE AS REPORTED TO OPERATING INCOME AFTER TAXES AND TAX RATE USED ABOVE IS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) OPERATING INCOME INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES INCOME TAXES TAX RATE AS REPORTED $ 426,129 $ 326,627 $ 155,700 47.7 % GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS 89,997 89,997 5,058 (7.3 )% DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENTS   (27,800 ) (8.5 )% AS ADJUSTED 516,126 $ 416,624 $ 132,958 31.9 % INCOME TAXES AT THE ADJUSTED RATE OF 31.9% (164,644 ) ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME AFTER TAXES $ 351,482 WORKING CAPITAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AT JUNE 30, 2009 AND DECEMBER 31, 2008 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: SHORT-TERM DEBT DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PAY DOWN OF COMMERCIAL PAPER RESULTING FROM THE ISSUANCE OF $1.5 BILLION OF LONG-TERM NOTES, CASH REPATRIATION TO THE U.S. FROM EUROPE AND EXCESS CASH FLOW. INVENTORIES DECREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF LOWER PURCHASE ACTIVITY. TRADE RECEIVABLES DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REVENUES.
