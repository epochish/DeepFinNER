FOOD EQUIPMENT BASE REVENUES INCREASED 3.3% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND 3.1% YEAR-TO-DATE, DUE PRIMARILY TO GROWTH IN EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONAL DEMAND. INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING BASE REVENUES WERE FLAT FOR THE SECOND QUARTER DUE TO SLOWER MACHINE SALES IN ASIA, BUT INCREASED 1.4% YEAR-TO-DATE. OTHER BASE BUSINESS REVENUES, INCLUDING THE WELDING AND FINISHING BUSINESSES, INCREASED 13.4% FOR THE QUARTER AND 11.3% YEAR-TO-DATE LED BY STRONG WELDING EQUIPMENT AND CONSUMABLE SALES IN ASIA. THE CONTRIBUTION FROM ACQUIRED REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF A MATERIALS AND STRUCTURAL TESTING BUSINESS AND AN AIRCRAFT GROUND POWER BUSINESS. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2006 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE REVENUE INCREASES DESCRIBED ABOVE AND REDUCED OPERATING COSTS. IN ADDITION, OPERATING INCOME WAS FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY LOWER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES AND INCOME FROM ACQUISITIONS. INCOME WAS ALSO POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY A NONRECURRING FIRST QUARTER 2005 CHARGE OF $8.7 MILLION TO RESOLVE ACCOUNTING ISSUES AT A EUROPEAN FOOD EQUIPMENT BUSINESS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION. OPERATING REVENUES THE RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES TO TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES IS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO APPROXIMATELY 375 OF ITS 700 REPORTING UNITS. WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE UNITS GOODWILL AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL. AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR THE PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2006 AND 2005 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30 SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30 2006 2005 2006 2005 GOODWILL: IMPAIRMENT $  $  $ 9,200 $ 6,206 INTANGIBLE ASSETS: AMORTIZATION 24,664 15,213 48,452 29,948 IMPAIRMENT   2,985 5,049 TOTAL $ 24,664 $ 15,213 $ 60,637 $ 41,203 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $12.2 MILLION. THE FIRST QUARTER 2006 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $9.2 MILLION WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO A U.S. JOIST BUSINESS, A U.S. HEAT TRANSFER BUSINESS, AND AN ASIAN CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS AND RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OF $3.0 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESS IN THE SPECIALTY SYSTEMS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT AND A U.S. CONTAMINATION CONTROL BUSINESS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $6.2 MILLION, WHICH WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO A CANADIAN STRETCH PACKAGING EQUIPMENT BUSINESS AND A U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESS, AND WHICH RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OF $5.0 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO A U.S. BUSINESS THAT MANUFACTURES CLEAN ROOM MATS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT. INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED TO $37.9 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2006 FROM $49.1 MILLION IN 2005 PRIMARILY DUE TO A LOWER AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2006 AND HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2005 DUE TO FORWARD CONTRACT DISCOUNT AMORTIZATION. INVESTMENT INCOME INVESTMENT INCOME INCREASED TO $36.6 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2006 FROM $29.4 MILLION IN 2005. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER GAINS ON VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN 2006 THAN IN 2005. THESE GAINS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INCOME FROM LEVERAGE LEASES IN 2006 DUE TO THE NORMAL SCHEDULED DECLINE IN LEVERAGE LEASE INCOME AND LOWER INCOME FROM PROPERTY DEVELOPMENTS AS FEWER HOMES WERE SOLD IN 2006 VERSUS 2005. MORTGAGE INVESTMENT INCOME FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2006 WAS VIRTUALLY FLAT COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2005. MORTGAGE INVESTMENT INCOME INCREASED DUE TO GAINS ON THE SALES OF PROPERTIES IN 2006 VERSUS LOSSES ON THE SALES OF PROPERTIES AND AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN 2005. HOWEVER, THIS INCREASE WAS MOSTLY OFFSET BY LOWER EQUITY INCOME IN 2006 AS COMPARED TO 2005, AS A RESULT OF THE LIQUIDATION OF THE FIRST MORTGAGE INVESTMENT IN DECEMBER 2005. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) WAS AN EXPENSE OF $0.7 MILLION FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2006 VERSUS INCOME OF $10.1 MILLION IN 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER CURRENCY TRANSLATION LOSSES AND LOSSES ON DIVESTITURES IN 2006. THIS IS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GAINS IN 2006 ON THE SALE OF FIXED ASSETS VERSUS LOSSES IN 2005. INCOME TAXES THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2006 WAS 30.5%, 1.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS LOWER THAN THE EFFECTIVE RATE FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2005. THE COMPANYS DECREASE IN EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IS A RESULT OF ADDITIONAL NONTAXABLE FOREIGN INTEREST INCOME AND THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF AN IRS TAX AUDIT. NET INCOME NET INCOME OF $832.4 MILLION ($1.46 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2006 WAS 21.3% HIGHER THAN THE 2005 NET INCOME OF $686.1 MILLION ($1.18 PER DILUTED SHARE). FOREIGN CURRENCY THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2006 DECREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2006 BY APPROXIMATELY $120.0 MILLION AND DECREASED EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY 2 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS IN JULY 2006, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION (FIN) NO. 48, ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES  AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109. THIS INTERPRETATION PRESCRIBES A RECOGNITION THRESHOLD AND MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF A TAX POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN, AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION, CLASSIFICATION, INTEREST AND PENALTIES, ACCOUNTING IN INTERIM PERIODS, DISCLOSURE, AND TRANSITION.

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE INTERPRETATION ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP) FAS 13-2, ACCOUNTING FOR A CHANGE OR PROJECTED CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES GENERATED BY A LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTION. FSP FAS 13-2 ADDRESSES HOW A CHANGE OR PROJECTED CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES GENERATED BY A LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTION AFFECTS THE ACCOUNTING BY A LESSOR FOR THAT LEASE. FSP FAS 13-2 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON JANUARY 1, 2007, WITH THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE RECORDED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF FSP FAS 13-2 ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE EXISTING DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT OBJECTIVE OF 25-35% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS AVERAGE NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH AND SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS AND DEBT REPAYMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2006 AND 2005 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) THE DECREASE IN FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2006 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCOME TAX PREPAYMENTS IN 2006 RELATED TO THE TREATMENT OF THE COMPANYS LEVERAGE LEASES. ON AUGUST 4, 2006 THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUY BACK OF UP TO 35 MILLION SHARES OVER AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ROIC FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2006 AND 2005 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) THE 210 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A 20% INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED OPERATING INCOME FROM BASE BUSINESS AND A DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO 30.1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006 FROM 31.6% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005. THE ABOVE POSITIVE IMPACT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN 8% INCREASE IN AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL PRIMARILY DUE TO ACQUISITIONS. THE 220 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC FOR YEAR-TO-DATE 2006 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A 20% INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED OPERATING INCOME FROM BASE BUSINESS AND A DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO 30.5% IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2006 FROM 32.0% IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2005. THE ABOVE POSITIVE IMPACT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 7% INCREASE IN AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL PRIMARILY DUE TO ACQUISITIONS. WORKING CAPITAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AT JUNE 30, 2006 AND DECEMBER 31, 2005 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) TRADE RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES INCREASED DUE TO INCREASED SALES, ACQUISITIONS AND TRANSLATION. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO A $145.0 MILLION INCREASE IN INCOME TAX REFUNDS RECEIVABLE. THIS INCREASE IS RELATED TO THE TIMING OF INCOME TAX PAYMENTS AND A FAVORABLE CONCLUSION OF AN IRS TAX AUDIT. SHORT-TERM DEBT DECREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF EXCESS CASH USED TO PAY OFF A PORTION OF THE DEBT. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO ACQUISITIONS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. DEBT TOTAL DEBT AT JUNE 30, 2006 AND DECEMBER 31, 2005 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OF $20.0 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2006 AND $94.5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005.

OTHER BASE BUSINESS REVENUES, INCLUDING THE WELDING AND FINISHING BUSINESSES, INCREASED 13.4% FOR THE QUARTER AND 11.3% YEAR-TO-DATE LED BY STRONG WELDING EQUIPMENT AND CONSUMABLE SALES IN ASIA. THE CONTRIBUTION FROM ACQUIRED REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF A MATERIALS AND STRUCTURAL TESTING BUSINESS AND AN AIRCRAFT GROUND POWER BUSINESS. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2006 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE REVENUE INCREASES DESCRIBED ABOVE AND REDUCED OPERATING COSTS. IN ADDITION, OPERATING INCOME WAS FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY LOWER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES AND INCOME FROM ACQUISITIONS. INCOME WAS ALSO POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY A NONRECURRING FIRST QUARTER 2005 CHARGE OF $8.7 MILLION TO RESOLVE ACCOUNTING ISSUES AT A EUROPEAN FOOD EQUIPMENT BUSINESS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION. OPERATING REVENUES THE RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES TO TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES IS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO APPROXIMATELY 375 OF ITS 700 REPORTING UNITS. WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE UNITS GOODWILL AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL. AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR THE PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2006 AND 2005 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30 SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30 2006 2005 2006 2005 GOODWILL: IMPAIRMENT $  $  $ 9,200 $ 6,206 INTANGIBLE ASSETS: AMORTIZATION 24,664 15,213 48,452 29,948 IMPAIRMENT   2,985 5,049 TOTAL $ 24,664 $ 15,213 $ 60,637 $ 41,203 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $12.2 MILLION. THE FIRST QUARTER 2006 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $9.2 MILLION WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO A U.S. JOIST BUSINESS, A U.S. HEAT TRANSFER BUSINESS, AND AN ASIAN CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS AND RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OF $3.0 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESS IN THE SPECIALTY SYSTEMS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT AND A U.S. CONTAMINATION CONTROL BUSINESS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $6.2 MILLION, WHICH WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO A CANADIAN STRETCH PACKAGING EQUIPMENT BUSINESS AND A U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESS, AND WHICH RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OF $5.0 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO A U.S. BUSINESS THAT MANUFACTURES CLEAN ROOM MATS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT. INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED TO $37.9 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2006 FROM $49.1 MILLION IN 2005 PRIMARILY DUE TO A LOWER AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2006 AND HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2005 DUE TO FORWARD CONTRACT DISCOUNT AMORTIZATION. INVESTMENT INCOME INVESTMENT INCOME INCREASED TO $36.6 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2006 FROM $29.4 MILLION IN 2005. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER GAINS ON VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN 2006 THAN IN 2005. THESE GAINS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INCOME FROM LEVERAGE LEASES IN 2006 DUE TO THE NORMAL SCHEDULED DECLINE IN LEVERAGE LEASE INCOME AND LOWER INCOME FROM PROPERTY DEVELOPMENTS AS FEWER HOMES WERE SOLD IN 2006 VERSUS 2005. MORTGAGE INVESTMENT INCOME FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2006 WAS VIRTUALLY FLAT COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2005. MORTGAGE INVESTMENT INCOME INCREASED DUE TO GAINS ON THE SALES OF PROPERTIES IN 2006 VERSUS LOSSES ON THE SALES OF PROPERTIES AND AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN 2005. HOWEVER, THIS INCREASE WAS MOSTLY OFFSET BY LOWER EQUITY INCOME IN 2006 AS COMPARED TO 2005, AS A RESULT OF THE LIQUIDATION OF THE FIRST MORTGAGE INVESTMENT IN DECEMBER 2005. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) WAS AN EXPENSE OF $0.7 MILLION FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2006 VERSUS INCOME OF $10.1 MILLION IN 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER CURRENCY TRANSLATION LOSSES AND LOSSES ON DIVESTITURES IN 2006. THIS IS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GAINS IN 2006 ON THE SALE OF FIXED ASSETS VERSUS LOSSES IN 2005. INCOME TAXES THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2006 WAS 30.5%, 1.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS LOWER THAN THE EFFECTIVE RATE FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2005. THE COMPANYS DECREASE IN EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IS A RESULT OF ADDITIONAL NONTAXABLE FOREIGN INTEREST INCOME AND THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF AN IRS TAX AUDIT. NET INCOME NET INCOME OF $832.4 MILLION ($1.46 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2006 WAS 21.3% HIGHER THAN THE 2005 NET INCOME OF $686.1 MILLION ($1.18 PER DILUTED SHARE). FOREIGN CURRENCY THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2006 DECREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2006 BY APPROXIMATELY $120.0 MILLION AND DECREASED EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY 2 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS IN JULY 2006, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION (FIN) NO. 48, ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES  AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109. THIS INTERPRETATION PRESCRIBES A RECOGNITION THRESHOLD AND MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF A TAX POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN, AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION, CLASSIFICATION, INTEREST AND PENALTIES, ACCOUNTING IN INTERIM PERIODS, DISCLOSURE, AND TRANSITION. THIS INTERPRETATION WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON JANUARY 1, 2007, WITH THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE RECORDED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE INTERPRETATION ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP) FAS 13-2, ACCOUNTING FOR A CHANGE OR PROJECTED CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES GENERATED BY A LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTION. FSP FAS 13-2 ADDRESSES HOW A CHANGE OR PROJECTED CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES GENERATED BY A LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTION AFFECTS THE ACCOUNTING BY A LESSOR FOR THAT LEASE. FSP FAS 13-2 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON JANUARY 1, 2007, WITH THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE RECORDED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF FSP FAS 13-2 ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE EXISTING DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT OBJECTIVE OF 25-35% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS AVERAGE NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH AND SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS AND DEBT REPAYMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2006 AND 2005 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) THE DECREASE IN FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2006 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCOME TAX PREPAYMENTS IN 2006 RELATED TO THE TREATMENT OF THE COMPANYS LEVERAGE LEASES. ON AUGUST 4, 2006 THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUY BACK OF UP TO 35 MILLION SHARES OVER AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ROIC FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2006 AND 2005 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) THE 210 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A 20% INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED OPERATING INCOME FROM BASE BUSINESS AND A DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO 30.1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006 FROM 31.6% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005. THE ABOVE POSITIVE IMPACT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN 8% INCREASE IN AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL PRIMARILY DUE TO ACQUISITIONS. THE 220 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC FOR YEAR-TO-DATE 2006 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A 20% INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED OPERATING INCOME FROM BASE BUSINESS AND A DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO 30.5% IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2006 FROM 32.0% IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2005. THE ABOVE POSITIVE IMPACT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 7% INCREASE IN AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL PRIMARILY DUE TO ACQUISITIONS. WORKING CAPITAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AT JUNE 30, 2006 AND DECEMBER 31, 2005 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) TRADE RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES INCREASED DUE TO INCREASED SALES, ACQUISITIONS AND TRANSLATION. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO A $145.0 MILLION INCREASE IN INCOME TAX REFUNDS RECEIVABLE. THIS INCREASE IS RELATED TO THE TIMING OF INCOME TAX PAYMENTS AND A FAVORABLE CONCLUSION OF AN IRS TAX AUDIT. SHORT-TERM DEBT DECREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF EXCESS CASH USED TO PAY OFF A PORTION OF THE DEBT. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO ACQUISITIONS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. DEBT TOTAL DEBT AT JUNE 30, 2006 AND DECEMBER 31, 2005 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OF $20.0 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2006 AND $94.5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005.
