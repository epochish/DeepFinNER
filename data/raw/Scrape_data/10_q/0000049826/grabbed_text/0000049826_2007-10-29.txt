RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES WERE LOWER THAN THE 2006 THIRD QUARTER AND HIGHER FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD. VARIABLE MARGINS WERE RELATIVELY FLAT IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS AS INCREASED RAW MATERIAL COSTS WERE OFFSET BY EFFICIENCY GAINS. OPERATING MARGINS WERE NEGATIVELY EFFECTED BY THE LOWER MARGINS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. OPERATING REVENUES THE RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES TO TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES IS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO APPROXIMATELY 440 OF ITS 750 REPORTING UNITS. WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE UNITS GOODWILL AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL. AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR THE PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 AND 2006 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30 NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30 2007 2006 2007 2006 GOODWILL: IMPAIRMENT $  $  $ 988 $ 9,200 INTANGIBLE ASSETS: AMORTIZATION 39,102 25,237 116,906 73,689 IMPAIRMENT   1,166 2,985 TOTAL $ 39,102 $ 25,237 $ 119,060 $ 85,874 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN TOTAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $2.2 MILLION. THE FIRST QUARTER 2007 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $1.0 MILLION WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO A FRENCH POLYMERS BUSINESS AND AN ASIAN CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT AND RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007, INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OF $1.2 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS AND CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A FRENCH POLYMERS BUSINESS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT AND A U.S. CONTAMINATION CONTROL BUSINESS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT.

THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE SPECIALTY SYSTEMS  INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2007 AND 2006 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2007, THE CHANGES IN REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGINS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30 NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30 % INCREASE (DECREASE) % POINT INCREASE (DECREASE) % INCREASE (DECREASE) % POINT INCREASE (DECREASE) OPERATING REVENUES OPERATING INCOME OPERATING MARGINS OPERATING REVENUES OPERATING INCOME OPERATING MARGINS BASE MANUFACTURING BUSINESS: REVENUE CHANGE/OPERATING LEVERAGE 3.6 % 9.6 % 0.9 % 7.1 % 20.3 % 1.7 % CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS  0.9 0.1  (2.7 ) (0.4 ) TOTAL 3.6 10.5 1.0 7.1 17.6 1.3 ACQUISITIONS 18.0 7.3 (1.5 ) 16.4 1.0 (1.9 ) DIVESTITURES (3.0 ) (3.5 ) (0.1 ) (2.3 ) (2.5 )  RESTRUCTURING COSTS  3.2 0.4  (2.2 ) (0.3 ) IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES     0.1  TRANSLATION/OTHER 7.7 7.8 0.1 7.8 8.1 0.1 TOTAL 26.3 % 25.3 % (0.1 )% 29.0 % 22.1 % (0.8 )% REVENUES INCREASED IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2007 VERSUS 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUES FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES, BASE BUSINESS REVENUE GROWTH AND THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION, OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF DIVESTITURES. THE REVENUE CONTRIBUTION FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF A EUROPEAN FOOD EQUIPMENT BUSINESS, TWO BUSINESSES SUPPLYING THE ELECTRONIC AND MICROELECTRONIC ASSEMBLY INDUSTRY, TWO EUROPEAN TEST AND MEASUREMENT BUSINESSES AND TWO DECORATING BUSINESSES. FOOD EQUIPMENT BASE REVENUES INCREASED 14.1% AND 10.2% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, DUE PRIMARILY TO GROWTH IN EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONAL DEMAND. TOTAL PACKAGING BASE REVENUE INCREASED 0.6% AND 4.7% DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, LED BY GROWTH IN THE INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SYSTEMS BUSINESSES. OTHER BASE BUSINESS REVENUES, INCLUDING THE WELDING AND FINISHING BUSINESSES, INCREASED 2.3% AND 8.4% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, LED BY HIGHER WELDING EQUIPMENT AND CONSUMABLE SALES IN EUROPE AND ASIA AND STRONG DEMAND FOR FINISHING PRODUCTS IN EUROPE AND ASIA. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2007 VERSUS 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO LEVERAGE FROM THE BASE REVENUE INCREASES DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND THE EFFECT OF ACQUISITIONS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF THE DIVESTITURE OF THE SLEEVE LABEL BUSINESS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007. RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES WERE LOWER THAN THE 2006 THIRD QUARTER AND HIGHER FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD. VARIABLE MARGINS WERE RELATIVELY FLAT IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS AS INCREASED RAW MATERIAL COSTS WERE OFFSET BY EFFICIENCY GAINS. OPERATING MARGINS WERE NEGATIVELY EFFECTED BY THE LOWER MARGINS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. OPERATING REVENUES THE RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES TO TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES IS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO APPROXIMATELY 440 OF ITS 750 REPORTING UNITS. WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE UNITS GOODWILL AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL. AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR THE PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 AND 2006 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30 NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30 2007 2006 2007 2006 GOODWILL: IMPAIRMENT $  $  $ 988 $ 9,200 INTANGIBLE ASSETS: AMORTIZATION 39,102 25,237 116,906 73,689 IMPAIRMENT   1,166 2,985 TOTAL $ 39,102 $ 25,237 $ 119,060 $ 85,874 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN TOTAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $2.2 MILLION. THE FIRST QUARTER 2007 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $1.0 MILLION WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO A FRENCH POLYMERS BUSINESS AND AN ASIAN CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT AND RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007, INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OF $1.2 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS AND CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A FRENCH POLYMERS BUSINESS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT AND A U.S. CONTAMINATION CONTROL BUSINESS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, THE COMPANY RECORDED GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $9.2 MILLION WHICH WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO A U.S. CONSTRUCTION JOIST BUSINESS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT, A U.S. THERMAL TRANSFER RIBBON BUSINESS IN THE SPECIALTY SYSTEMS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT, AND AN ASIAN CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT, AND RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OF $3.0 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESS IN THE SPECIALTY SYSTEMS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT AND A U.S. CONTAMINATION CONTROL BUSINESS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT. INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $75.8 MILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2007 FROM $58.7 MILLION IN 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2007. OTHER INCOME OTHER INCOME INCREASED TO $89.7 MILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2007 VERSUS INCOME OF $71.7 MILLION IN 2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO GAINS ON DIVESTITURES IN 2007 VERSUS LOSSES IN 2006. THESE AMOUNTS ARE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE LIQUIDATION OF THE COMPANYS MORTGAGE TRANSACTIONS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006. INCOME TAXES THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2007 WAS 29.25%, 125 BASIS POINTS LOWER THAN THE EFFECTIVE RATE FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2006. THE REDUCTION IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2007 RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN THE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING DEDUCTION AND A HIGHER PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF INCOME IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS WITH LOWER TAX RATES THAN THE U.S. NET INCOME NET INCOME OF $1.4 BILLION ($2.50 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2007 WAS 9.4% HIGHER THAN THE 2006 NET INCOME OF $1.3 BILLION ($2.24 PER DILUTED SHARE). FOREIGN CURRENCY THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2007 INCREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2007 BY APPROXIMATELY $348.8 MILLION AND INCREASED EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY 7 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2006 DECREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2006 BY APPROXIMATELY $77.8 MILLION AND DECREASED EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY 1 CENT PER DILUTED SHARE.

FIN 48 PRESCRIBES A RECOGNITION THRESHOLD AND MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF TAX POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN TAX RETURNS, AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION, CLASSIFICATION, AND INTEREST AND PENALTIES, RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. AS A RESULT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF FIN 48, THE COMPANY DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY CHANGE IN ITS LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. SEE THE INCOME TAXES NOTE FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

FAS 13-2, ACCOUNTING FOR A CHANGE OR PROJECTED CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES GENERATED BY A LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTION (FSP 13-2). FSP 13-2 ADDRESSES HOW A CHANGE OR PROJECTED CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES GENERATED BY A LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTION AFFECTS THE ACCOUNTING BY A LESSOR FOR THAT LEASE. UPON ADOPTION OF FSP 13-2, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE TO RETAINED EARNINGS OF $22.6 MILLION, RESULTING FROM A CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS RELATED TO INCOME TAX BENEFITS OF THE COMPANY'S LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTIONS. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINE OF 25% TO 35% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS AVERAGE NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

ROIC FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2007 AND 2006 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) THE 40 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2007 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A 13.8% INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME, MAINLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BASE BUSINESS OPERATING INCOME, TRANSLATION, ACQUISITIONS AND A DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. THE POSITIVE IMPACT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN 11.1% INCREASE IN AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL, PRIMARILY DUE TO ACQUISITIONS.
