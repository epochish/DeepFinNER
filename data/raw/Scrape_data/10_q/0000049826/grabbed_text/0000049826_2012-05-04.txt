SEE THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NOTE IN ITEM 1 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS REGARDING THE COMPANY’S DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE COMPANY’S PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT, TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS, TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH AND TO FUND SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE PRIMARY USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE: · DIVIDEND PAYMENTS – THE COMPANY’S DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINES ARE 30% TO 45% OF THE AVERAGE OF THE LAST TWO YEARS’ FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW; · ACQUISITIONS; AND · ANY EXCESS LIQUIDITY MAY BE USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES. CASH FLOW THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW REPRESENTS NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS ADDITIONS TO PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012 AND 2011 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN MILLIONS) THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31 2012 2011 NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES $ 323 $ 145 ADDITIONS TO PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (84 ) (89 ) FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW $ 239 $ 56 CASH DIVIDENDS PAID $ (174 ) $ (169 ) ACQUISITIONS (481 ) (543 ) REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK (443 ) — NET PROCEEDS FROM DEBT 735 418 OTHER 200 105 EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH AND EQUIVALENTS 50 31 NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH AND EQUIVALENTS $ 126 $ (102 ) ON MAY 6, 2011, THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $4.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME (THE “2011 PROGRAM”). IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012, THE COMPANY MADE REPURCHASES OF APPROXIMATELY 8.5 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $56.03 UNDER THE 2011 PROGRAM. AS OF MARCH 31, 2012, THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY $3.4 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THE 2011 PROGRAM. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (“ROIC”) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS’ USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ROIC IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE PERIOD AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012 AND 2011, ROIC WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31 2012 2011 OPERATING INCOME $ 705 $ 659 TAXES (29.0% FOR 2012, 29.0% AS ADJUSTED FOR 2011) (205 ) (191 ) OPERATING INCOME AFTER TAXES, AS ADJUSTED $ 500 $ 468 INVESTED CAPITAL: TRADE RECEIVABLES $ 3,134 $ 2,981 INVENTORIES 1,824 1,824 NET PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 2,100 2,122 INVESTMENTS 287 431 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 7,889 7,236 ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES (2,219 ) (2,258 ) NET ASSETS HELD FOR SALE 299 — OTHER, NET 282 307 TOTAL INVESTED CAPITAL $ 13,596 $ 12,643 AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL $ 13,221 $ 11,948 ANNUALIZED RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL 15.1 % 15.7 % THE ROIC DECREASE OF 60 BASIS POINTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012 COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011 WAS THE RESULT OF AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASING 10.7%, WHILE OPERATING INCOME AFTER TAXES INCREASED 6.8%. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, THE COMPANY RECORDED A FAVORABLE DISCRETE NON-CASH TAX BENEFIT OF $166 MILLION RELATED TO THE DECISION IN THE COMPANY’S FAVOR BY THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA, VICTORIA WITH RESPECT TO A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS THAT HAD BEEN CHALLENGED BY THE AUSTRALIAN TAX OFFICE. SEE THE INCOME TAXES NOTE IN ITEM 1 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THIS DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT. SINCE THE BENEFIT WAS UNUSUAL, THE ROIC CALCULATION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THIS ITEM TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY AND BETTER REFLECT THE RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED. A RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRST QUARTER 2011 TAX RATE, AS REPORTED, TO THE TAX RATE USED ABOVE IS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2011 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES INCOME TAXES TAX RATE AS REPORTED $ 621 $ 15 2.3 % DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENT — 166 26.7 % AS ADJUSTED $ 621 $ 181 29.0 % WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT USES WORKING CAPITAL AS A MEASUREMENT OF THE SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY. NET WORKING CAPITAL AT MARCH 31, 2012 AND DECEMBER 31, 2011 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: CASH AND EQUIVALENTS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION AS OF MARCH 31, 2012, PRIMARILY ALL OF WHICH WAS HELD BY INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXES AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES IF REPATRIATED TO THE UNITED STATES. CASH BALANCES HELD INTERNATIONALLY ARE TYPICALLY USED FOR INTERNATIONAL OPERATING NEEDS, REINVESTED TO FUND EXPANSION OF EXISTING INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES, OR USED TO FUND NEW INTERNATIONAL ACQUISITIONS. IN THE U.S., THE COMPANY UTILIZES CASH FLOWS FROM DOMESTIC OPERATIONS TO FUND DOMESTIC CASH NEEDS WHICH PRIMARILY CONSIST OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES, SERVICING OF DOMESTIC DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES OF $2.5 BILLION FOR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES CASH GENERATED DOMESTICALLY WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND CASH REQUIREMENTS IN THE U.S. DEBT TOTAL DEBT AND TOTAL DEBT TO CAPITALIZATION AT MARCH 31, 2012 AND DECEMBER 31, 2011 WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OF $1.1 BILLION AT MARCH 31, 2012 AND $192 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 WHICH IS INCLUDED IN SHORT-TERM DEBT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED ON ITS CURRENT FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW, DEBT-TO-CAPITALIZATION RATIOS AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY. THE COMPANY’S TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO IS 20% TO 30%, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ANY LARGER ACQUISITIONS. TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA THE COMPANY USES THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA TO MEASURE ITS ABILITY TO REPAY ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S LONG TERM FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA. EBITDA AND THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA REPRESENTS TOTAL DEBT DIVIDED BY INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ON A TRAILING TWELVE MONTH BASIS. TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA FOR THE TWELVE MONTH PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, 2012 AND DECEMBER 31, 2011 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) TWELVE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2012 TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 TOTAL DEBT $ 4,765 $ 3,990 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS $ 1,881 $ 2,017 ADD: INTEREST EXPENSE 198 192 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) (56 ) (54 ) INCOME TAXES 754 576 DEPRECIATION 335 336 AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 272 255 EBITDA $ 3,384 $ 3,322 TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO 1.4 1.2 STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY THE CHANGES TO STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY DURING 2012 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN MILLIONS) TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY, DECEMBER 31, 2011 $ 10,034 NET INCOME 486 STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK ACTIVITY 74 REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK (474 ) CASH DIVIDENDS DECLARED (172 ) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS 176 OTHER 11 TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY, MARCH 31, 2012 $ 10,135 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.

MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT, TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS, TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH AND TO FUND SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS.
