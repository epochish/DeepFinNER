DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA CONTAINED IN THE COMPANY’S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013.ENTERPRISE STRATEGYDURING 2012, THE COMPANY EMBARKED ON AN ENTERPRISE STRATEGY THAT INCLUDES THREE KEY INITIATIVES - PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION, AND STRATEGIC SOURCING. THESE ENTERPRISE INITIATIVES ARE EXPECTED TO ENHANCE THE BUSINESS THROUGH 2017 AND ARE TARGETED AT EXPANDING ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH AND IMPROVING PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS.PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT - THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE AIMS TO CONSTRUCT A BUSINESS PORTFOLIO THAT LEVERAGES THE COMPANY’S DIFFERENTIATED BUSINESS MODEL AND GROWTH POTENTIAL. AS PART OF THIS INITIATIVE, THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS OPERATIONS FOR BUSINESSES THAT MAY NO LONGER BE ALIGNED WITH ITS LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY'S DIVESTITURE ACTIVITY INCREASED IN 2012, 2013 AND 2014. WITH THE SALE OF THE COMPANY'S FORMER INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENT ON MAY 1, 2014, THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE IS ESSENTIALLY COMPLETE. THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES WITH COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS WELL AS LARGER ACQUISITIONS THAT REPRESENT POTENTIAL NEW PLATFORMS. GOING FORWARD, THE COMPANY WILL EMPHASIZE ORGANIC GROWTH AND FOCUS ON ACQUISITIONS WITH SUSTAINABLE DIFFERENTIATION AND GROWTH POTENTIAL. REFER TO THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NOTE IN ITEM 1 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY’S DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION - THE BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION INITIATIVE SIMPLIFIES THE COMPANY'S ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL AND ADDS SCALE TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATING DIVISIONS IN ORDER TO INCREASE ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH, ENHANCE GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS AND DRIVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES. THIS INITIATIVE FOCUSES ON REDUCING THE NUMBER OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING DIVISIONS AND INCREASING THE AVERAGE REVENUE SIZE OF EACH DIVISION, WHILE RETAINING THE POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES OF A DECENTRALIZED OPERATING MODEL. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO ENHANCE ITS PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF APPLYING ITS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS TO THE NEW DIVISIONS, MORE FOCUSED GROWTH INVESTMENTS AND REDUCED INFRASTRUCTURE.STRATEGIC SOURCING - THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC SOURCING INITIATIVE FOCUSES ON BUILDING SOURCING CAPABILITY IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE PURCHASING SCALE TO ENHANCE PROFITABILITY AND GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS. IT INCORPORATES BOTH ENTERPRISE-LEVEL AND SEGMENT-LEVEL PURCHASING THAT CROSS THE COMPANY'S MANY BUSINESSES. THIS INITIATIVE IS EXPECTED TO TRANSFORM SOURCING INTO A CORE STRATEGIC FUNCTION IN THE COMPANY.AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE COMPANY'S 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS AND ENTERPRISE STRATEGY IS THE FOCUS ON PRODUCT LINE AND CUSTOMER BASE SIMPLIFICATION, OR "PLS." PLS FOCUSES ON ELIMINATING THE COMPLEXITY AND OVERHEAD COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SMALLER PRODUCT LINES AND CUSTOMERS, AND FOCUSES BUSINESSES ON SUPPORTING AND GROWING THEIR LARGEST CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCT LINES. PLS IS A CORE ELEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS AND IS KEY TO IMPROVING THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.11DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSTHE COMPANY PERIODICALLY REVIEWS ITS OPERATIONS FOR BUSINESSES WHICH MAY NO LONGER BE ALIGNED WITH ITS ENTERPRISE INITIATIVES AND LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES.

THESE ENTERPRISE INITIATIVES ARE EXPECTED TO ENHANCE THE BUSINESS THROUGH 2017 AND ARE TARGETED AT EXPANDING ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH AND IMPROVING PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS.PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT - THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE AIMS TO CONSTRUCT A BUSINESS PORTFOLIO THAT LEVERAGES THE COMPANY’S DIFFERENTIATED BUSINESS MODEL AND GROWTH POTENTIAL. AS PART OF THIS INITIATIVE, THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS OPERATIONS FOR BUSINESSES THAT MAY NO LONGER BE ALIGNED WITH ITS LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY'S DIVESTITURE ACTIVITY INCREASED IN 2012, 2013 AND 2014. WITH THE SALE OF THE COMPANY'S FORMER INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENT ON MAY 1, 2014, THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE IS ESSENTIALLY COMPLETE. THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES WITH COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS WELL AS LARGER ACQUISITIONS THAT REPRESENT POTENTIAL NEW PLATFORMS. GOING FORWARD, THE COMPANY WILL EMPHASIZE ORGANIC GROWTH AND FOCUS ON ACQUISITIONS WITH SUSTAINABLE DIFFERENTIATION AND GROWTH POTENTIAL. REFER TO THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NOTE IN ITEM 1 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY’S DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION - THE BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION INITIATIVE SIMPLIFIES THE COMPANY'S ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL AND ADDS SCALE TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATING DIVISIONS IN ORDER TO INCREASE ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH, ENHANCE GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS AND DRIVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES. THIS INITIATIVE FOCUSES ON REDUCING THE NUMBER OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING DIVISIONS AND INCREASING THE AVERAGE REVENUE SIZE OF EACH DIVISION, WHILE RETAINING THE POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES OF A DECENTRALIZED OPERATING MODEL. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO ENHANCE ITS PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF APPLYING ITS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS TO THE NEW DIVISIONS, MORE FOCUSED GROWTH INVESTMENTS AND REDUCED INFRASTRUCTURE.STRATEGIC SOURCING - THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC SOURCING INITIATIVE FOCUSES ON BUILDING SOURCING CAPABILITY IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE PURCHASING SCALE TO ENHANCE PROFITABILITY AND GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS.
