ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE UNITS GOODWILL AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL. AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR THE PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, 2005 AND 2004 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $11.3 MILLION.

INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $18.7 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2005 FROM $15.9 MILLION IN 2004 PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004 AND THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005. OTHER INCOME OTHER INCOME DECREASED TO $3.4 MILLION FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2005 FROM $7.7 MILLION IN 2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INTEREST INCOME AND HIGHER LOSSES ON THE SALE OF FIXED ASSETS IN 2005 VERSUS 2004, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GAINS IN 2005 ON THE SALE OF INVESTMENTS. THE DECREASE IN INTEREST INCOME RESULTED MAINLY FROM INTEREST RELATED TO A TAX REIMBURSEMENT IN GERMANY IN 2004 AND LOWER CASH BALANCES IN THE U.S. IN 2005. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $312.3 MILLION ($1.06 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2005 WAS 7.7% HIGHER THAN THE 2004 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $290.0 MILLION ($0.93 PER DILUTED SHARE).

MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE EXISTING DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT OBJECTIVE OF 25-30% OF THE LAST THREE YEARS AVERAGE NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZED ACQUISITIONS AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. ASSUMING SUCCESSFUL PASSAGE OF THE TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2004 RELATED TO THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO REPATRIATE AT LEAST $750 MILLION IN FOREIGN DIVIDENDS IN 2005 TO REDUCE COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS. THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, DEBT REPAYMENT AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS.

ROIC FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005 AND 2004 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) THE 80 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN ROIC IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER NET DEBT, AS A RESULT OF SHORT TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS AND THE ISSUANCE OF 4.88% SENIOR NOTES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, AND DECREASED CASH AS A RESULT OF THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH BEGAN IN APRIL 2004. THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE ABOVE FACTORS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 9.2% INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED BASE BUSINESS OPERATING INCOME AND A DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. WORKING CAPITAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AT MARCH 31, 2005 AND DECEMBER 31, 2004 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) CASH AND EQUIVALENTS INCREASED AT THE COMPANYS INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES AS A RESULT OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE UNITS GOODWILL AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL. AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR THE PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, 2005 AND 2004 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $11.3 MILLION. THE FIRST QUARTER 2005 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $6.2 MILLION WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO A CANADIAN STRETCH PACKAGING EQUIPMENT BUSINESS AND A U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESS AND RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OF $5.1 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO A U.S. BUSINESS THAT MANUFACTURES CLEAN ROOM MATS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004, THE COMPANY RECORDED GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $11.5 MILLION, WHICH WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO A EUROPEAN AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS BUSINESS AND A U.S. ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS BUSINESS AND RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED.

INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $18.7 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2005 FROM $15.9 MILLION IN 2004 PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004 AND THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005. OTHER INCOME OTHER INCOME DECREASED TO $3.4 MILLION FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2005 FROM $7.7 MILLION IN 2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INTEREST INCOME AND HIGHER LOSSES ON THE SALE OF FIXED ASSETS IN 2005 VERSUS 2004, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GAINS IN 2005 ON THE SALE OF INVESTMENTS. THE DECREASE IN INTEREST INCOME RESULTED MAINLY FROM INTEREST RELATED TO A TAX REIMBURSEMENT IN GERMANY IN 2004 AND LOWER CASH BALANCES IN THE U.S. IN 2005. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $312.3 MILLION ($1.06 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2005 WAS 7.7% HIGHER THAN THE 2004 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $290.0 MILLION ($0.93 PER DILUTED SHARE).

MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE EXISTING DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT OBJECTIVE OF 25-30% OF THE LAST THREE YEARS AVERAGE NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZED ACQUISITIONS AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. ASSUMING SUCCESSFUL PASSAGE OF THE TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2004 RELATED TO THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO REPATRIATE AT LEAST $750 MILLION IN FOREIGN DIVIDENDS IN 2005 TO REDUCE COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS. THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, DEBT REPAYMENT AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

ROIC FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005 AND 2004 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) THE 80 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN ROIC IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER NET DEBT, AS A RESULT OF SHORT TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS AND THE ISSUANCE OF 4.88% SENIOR NOTES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, AND DECREASED CASH AS A RESULT OF THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH BEGAN IN APRIL 2004. THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE ABOVE FACTORS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 9.2% INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED BASE BUSINESS OPERATING INCOME AND A DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. WORKING CAPITAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AT MARCH 31, 2005 AND DECEMBER 31, 2004 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) CASH AND EQUIVALENTS INCREASED AT THE COMPANYS INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES AS A RESULT OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.
