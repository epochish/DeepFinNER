INTERNATIONALLY, BASE BUSINESS REVENUES INCREASED 2% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND 3% YEAR-TO-DATE. THE GROWTH IN NORTH AMERICAN REVENUES IN BOTH PERIODS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CONTINUING IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES IMPLEMENTED TO OFFSET RAW MATERIAL COST INCREASES, MODEST GROWTH IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND INCREASED DEMAND IN CERTAIN CAPITAL EQUIPMENT MARKETS. SLOWING ECONOMIC GROWTH IN EUROPE CONTINUES TO HAMPER INTERNATIONAL REVENUE GROWTH. OPERATING INCOME FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005 AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD IMPROVED DUE TO LEVERAGE FROM THE GROWTH IN BASE BUSINESS REVENUE, INCOME FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND FAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET IN BOTH PERIODS BY INCREASED RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES. VARIABLE MARGINS IMPROVED MODESTLY IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005 DUE TO PRICE INCREASES TO RECOVER HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS. HOWEVER, YEAR-TO-DATE VARIABLE MARGINS HAVE REMAINED BELOW LAST YEARS LEVELS FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD DUE TO RAW MATERIAL COST INCREASES. LOWER OVERHEAD COST IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005 ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN INCOME. LEASING AND INVESTMENTS INCOME INCREASED IN THE THIRD QUARTER DUE TO GAINS ON SALES IN THE COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO BUT DECREASED YEAR-TO-DATE DUE TO LOWER YEAR-TO-DATE GAINS ON SALES OF MORTGAGE PROPERTIES AND LOWER INCOME FROM LEASES OF EQUIPMENT. IN ADDITION, OPERATING INCOME IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY PRETAX CHARGES TO EXPENSE STOCK OPTIONS OF $6.5 MILLION AND $19.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. A 2005 FIRST QUARTER CHARGE OF $8.7 MILLION TO RESOLVE ACCOUNTING ISSUES AT A EUROPEAN FOOD EQUIPMENT BUSINESS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED INCOME IN THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD. AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANYS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $11.3 MILLION WERE INCURRED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005. THE IMPAIRED ASSETS REFLECTED DIMINISHED EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND PRIMARILY RELATED TO A CANADIAN STRETCH PACKAGING EQUIPMENT BUSINESS, A U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESS AND A U.S. BUSINESS THAT MANUFACTURES CLEAN ROOM MATS.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE EXISTING DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT OBJECTIVE OF 25-30% OF THE LAST THREE YEARS AVERAGE NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZED ACQUISITIONS AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, DEBT REPAYMENT AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. ON APRIL 19, 2004 THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUY BACK OF UP TO 31 MILLION SHARES. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 5,527,805 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $84.86 PER SHARE. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM, THE COMPANY HAS REPURCHASED 31,000,000 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR $2.8 BILLION AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $89.41 PER SHARE. THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2005 AND 2004 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ROIC FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2005 AND 2004 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) THE 280 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A 25% INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED OPERATING INCOME FROM BASE BUSINESS AND LEASING AND INVESTMENTS AND A DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO 32% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005 FROM 34% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004. THE POSITIVE IMPACT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL FROM ACQUISITIONS. THE 30 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC FOR YEAR-TO-DATE 2005 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A 13% INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED OPERATING INCOME FROM BASE BUSINESS AND A DECREASE IN THE YEAR-TO-DATE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO 32% IN 2005 FROM 34% IN 2004. THE POSITIVE IMPACT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL FROM ACQUISITIONS. WORKING CAPITAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2005 AND DECEMBER 31, 2004 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) CASH AND EQUIVALENTS DECREASED DUE TO THE REPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK AND CASH PAID FOR ACQUISITIONS AND DIVIDENDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. TRADE RECEIVABLES INCREASED DUE TO INCREASED SALES. THE INCREASE IN DOMESTIC SHORT-TERM DEBT IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FUND THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, ACQUISITIONS AND DIVIDENDS. IN MAY 2005, THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE ISSUED A NOTICE THAT PROVIDES DETAILED TAX GUIDANCE FOR U.S. COMPANIES THAT ELECT TO REPATRIATE EARNINGS FROM FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES SUBJECT TO THE TEMPORARY TAX RATE AVAILABLE UNDER THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004.

ITEM 4  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE COMPANYS PRESIDENT & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND VICE PRESIDENT & CONTROLLER, FINANCIAL REPORTING, HAS EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (AS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A15(E)) AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2005. BASED ON SUCH EVALUATION, THE COMPANYS PRESIDENT & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND VICE PRESIDENT & CONTROLLER, FINANCIAL REPORTING, HAVE CONCLUDED THAT, AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2005, THE COMPANYS DISCLOSURE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2005 AND 2004 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2005, THE CHANGES IN REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGINS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30 NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30 % INCREASE (DECREASE) % POINT INCREASE (DECREASE) % INCREASE (DECREASE) % POINT INCREASE (DECREASE) OPERATING REVENUES OPERATING INCOME OPERATING MARGINS OPERATING REVENUES OPERATING INCOME OPERATING MARGINS BASE MANUFACTURING BUSINESS: REVENUE CHANGE/OPERATING LEVERAGE 4.1 % 9.5 % 0.9 % 4.7 % 10.9 % 1.0 % CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS  4.0 0.7  (3.5 ) (0.6 ) TOTAL 4.1 13.5 1.6 4.7 7.4 0.4 RESTRUCTURING COSTS  (2.7 ) (0.5 )  (1.5 ) (0.2 ) IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES     0.7 0.1 ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 3.9 2.4 (0.3 ) 4.8 2.5 (0.4 ) TRANSLATION 0.8 1.2 0.1 2.0 2.0  LEASING AND INVESTMENTS 1.1 6.5 0.8 (0.3 ) (1.7 ) (0.2 ) INTERCOMPANY (0.1 )   (0.3 )  0.1 TOTAL 9.8 % 20.9 % 1.7 % 10.9 % 9.4 % (0.2 )% NORTH AMERICA BASE BUSINESS REVENUES INCREASED 5% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005 AND 6% YEAR-TO-DATE. INTERNATIONALLY, BASE BUSINESS REVENUES INCREASED 2% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND 3% YEAR-TO-DATE. THE GROWTH IN NORTH AMERICAN REVENUES IN BOTH PERIODS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CONTINUING IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES IMPLEMENTED TO OFFSET RAW MATERIAL COST INCREASES, MODEST GROWTH IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND INCREASED DEMAND IN CERTAIN CAPITAL EQUIPMENT MARKETS. SLOWING ECONOMIC GROWTH IN EUROPE CONTINUES TO HAMPER INTERNATIONAL REVENUE GROWTH. OPERATING INCOME FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005 AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD IMPROVED DUE TO LEVERAGE FROM THE GROWTH IN BASE BUSINESS REVENUE, INCOME FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND FAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET IN BOTH PERIODS BY INCREASED RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES. VARIABLE MARGINS IMPROVED MODESTLY IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005 DUE TO PRICE INCREASES TO RECOVER HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS. HOWEVER, YEAR-TO-DATE VARIABLE MARGINS HAVE REMAINED BELOW LAST YEARS LEVELS FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD DUE TO RAW MATERIAL COST INCREASES. LOWER OVERHEAD COST IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005 ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN INCOME. LEASING AND INVESTMENTS INCOME INCREASED IN THE THIRD QUARTER DUE TO GAINS ON SALES IN THE COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO BUT DECREASED YEAR-TO-DATE DUE TO LOWER YEAR-TO-DATE GAINS ON SALES OF MORTGAGE PROPERTIES AND LOWER INCOME FROM LEASES OF EQUIPMENT. IN ADDITION, OPERATING INCOME IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY PRETAX CHARGES TO EXPENSE STOCK OPTIONS OF $6.5 MILLION AND $19.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. A 2005 FIRST QUARTER CHARGE OF $8.7 MILLION TO RESOLVE ACCOUNTING ISSUES AT A EUROPEAN FOOD EQUIPMENT BUSINESS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED INCOME IN THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD. AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANYS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $11.3 MILLION WERE INCURRED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005. THE IMPAIRED ASSETS REFLECTED DIMINISHED EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND PRIMARILY RELATED TO A CANADIAN STRETCH PACKAGING EQUIPMENT BUSINESS, A U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESS AND A U.S. BUSINESS THAT MANUFACTURES CLEAN ROOM MATS.

ADDITIONALLY, IN THE YEAR-TO-DATE 2005 PERIOD, INCOME FROM LEASES OF EQUIPMENT WAS $9.6 MILLION LOWER THAN 2004 DUE TO THE NORMAL DECLINE IN LEVERAGED LEASE INCOME. OPERATING REVENUES THE RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES TO TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES IS AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO APPROXIMATELY 340 OF ITS 650 REPORTING UNITS. WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE UNITS GOODWILL AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL.

THE FIRST QUARTER 2005 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $6.2 MILLION WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO A CANADIAN STRETCH PACKAGING EQUIPMENT BUSINESS AND A U.S. WELDING COMPONENTS BUSINESS AND RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OF $5.1 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO A U.S. BUSINESS THAT MANUFACTURES CLEAN ROOM MATS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT.

INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $64.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2005 FROM $53.4 MILLION IN 2004 PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004 AND THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF 2005 OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE AT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. OTHER INCOME OTHER INCOME DECREASED TO $9.5 MILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2005 FROM $17.5 MILLION IN 2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN ESTIMATED LOSS ON A PROPOSED DIVESTITURE IN 2005, LOWER INTEREST INCOME IN 2005 VERSUS 2004 AND LOSSES IN 2005 ON THE SALE OF FIXED ASSETS VERSUS GAINS IN 2004. THIS IS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CURRENCY TRANSLATION GAINS IN 2005 VERSUS LOSSES IN 2004 AND LOWER MINORITY INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2005. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $1,094.3 MILLION ($3.78 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2005 WAS 11.6% HIGHER THAN THE 2004 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $980.4 MILLION ($3.19 PER DILUTED SHARE).

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE EXISTING DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT OBJECTIVE OF 25-30% OF THE LAST THREE YEARS AVERAGE NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZED ACQUISITIONS AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, DEBT REPAYMENT AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

THE POSITIVE IMPACT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL FROM ACQUISITIONS. THE 30 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC FOR YEAR-TO-DATE 2005 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A 13% INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED OPERATING INCOME FROM BASE BUSINESS AND A DECREASE IN THE YEAR-TO-DATE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO 32% IN 2005 FROM 34% IN 2004. THE POSITIVE IMPACT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL FROM ACQUISITIONS. WORKING CAPITAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2005 AND DECEMBER 31, 2004 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) CASH AND EQUIVALENTS DECREASED DUE TO THE REPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK AND CASH PAID FOR ACQUISITIONS AND DIVIDENDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. TRADE RECEIVABLES INCREASED DUE TO INCREASED SALES. THE INCREASE IN DOMESTIC SHORT-TERM DEBT IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FUND THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, ACQUISITIONS AND DIVIDENDS. IN MAY 2005, THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE ISSUED A NOTICE THAT PROVIDES DETAILED TAX GUIDANCE FOR U.S. COMPANIES THAT ELECT TO REPATRIATE EARNINGS FROM FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES SUBJECT TO THE TEMPORARY TAX RATE AVAILABLE UNDER THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004.
