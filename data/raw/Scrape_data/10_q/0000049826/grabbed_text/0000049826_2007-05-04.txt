IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO APPROXIMATELY 440 OF ITS 750 REPORTING UNITS. WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE UNITS GOODWILL AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL. AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR THE PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, 2007 AND 2006 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31 2007 2006 GOODWILL: IMPAIRMENT $ 988 $ 9,200 INTANGIBLE ASSETS: AMORTIZATION 38,025 23,788 IMPAIRMENT 1,166 2,985 TOTAL $ 40,179 $ 35,973 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN TOTAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $2.2 MILLION. THE FIRST QUARTER 2007 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $1.0 MILLION WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO A FRENCH FLUID AND POLYMER BUSINESS AND AN ASIAN CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT AND RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007, INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OF $1.2 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS AND CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A FRENCH FLUID AND POLYMER BUSINESS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT AND A U.S. CONTAMINATION CONTROL BUSINESS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT.

INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $24.4 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2007 FROM $18.9 MILLION IN 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007. OTHER INCOME OTHER INCOME INCREASED TO $26.6 MILLION FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2007 FROM $10.2 MILLION IN 2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO GAINS ON DIVESTITURES VERSUS LOSSES IN 2006. THESE AMOUNTS ARE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE LIQUIDATION OF THE COMPANY'S MORTGAGE TRANSACTIONS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006. INCOME TAXES THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST RATE THREE MONTHS OF 2007 WAS 29.5%, 1.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS LOWER THAN THE EFFECTIVE RATE FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2006. THE REDUCTION IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASED DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING DEDUCTION AND AN INCREASED MIX OF INCOME FROM FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS WITH LOWER TAX RATES. NET INCOME NET INCOME OF $402.4 MILLION ($0.71 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2007 WAS 9.8% HIGHER THAN THE 2006 NET INCOME OF $366.5 MILLION ($0.65 PER DILUTED SHARE).

FAS 13-2, ACCOUNTING FOR A CHANGE OR PROJECTED CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES GENERATED BY A LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTION (FSP 13-2). FSP 13-2 ADDRESSES HOW A CHANGE OR PROJECTED CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES GENERATED BY A LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTION AFFECTS THE ACCOUNTING BY A LESSOR FOR THAT LEASE. UPON ADOPTION OF FSP 13-2, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE TO RETAINED EARNINGS OF $22.6 MILLION, RESULTING FROM A CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS RELATED TO INCOME TAX BENEFITS OF THE COMPANY'S LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTIONS. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE EXISTING DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINE OF 25% TO 35% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS AVERAGE NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD ASSIGNED ITS RECORDED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO APPROXIMATELY 440 OF ITS 750 REPORTING UNITS. WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10%. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT OPERATING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OPERATING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE UNITS GOODWILL AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL. AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR THE PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, 2007 AND 2006 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31 2007 2006 GOODWILL: IMPAIRMENT $ 988 $ 9,200 INTANGIBLE ASSETS: AMORTIZATION 38,025 23,788 IMPAIRMENT 1,166 2,985 TOTAL $ 40,179 $ 35,973 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN TOTAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $2.2 MILLION. THE FIRST QUARTER 2007 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $1.0 MILLION WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO A FRENCH FLUID AND POLYMER BUSINESS AND AN ASIAN CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT AND RESULTED FROM LOWER ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. ALSO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007, INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OF $1.2 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF TRADEMARKS AND CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A FRENCH FLUID AND POLYMER BUSINESS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT AND A U.S. CONTAMINATION CONTROL BUSINESS IN THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS  NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT.

INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $24.4 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2007 FROM $18.9 MILLION IN 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007. OTHER INCOME OTHER INCOME INCREASED TO $26.6 MILLION FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2007 FROM $10.2 MILLION IN 2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO GAINS ON DIVESTITURES VERSUS LOSSES IN 2006. THESE AMOUNTS ARE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE LIQUIDATION OF THE COMPANY'S MORTGAGE TRANSACTIONS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006. INCOME TAXES THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST RATE THREE MONTHS OF 2007 WAS 29.5%, 1.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS LOWER THAN THE EFFECTIVE RATE FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2006. THE REDUCTION IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASED DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING DEDUCTION AND AN INCREASED MIX OF INCOME FROM FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS WITH LOWER TAX RATES. NET INCOME NET INCOME OF $402.4 MILLION ($0.71 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2007 WAS 9.8% HIGHER THAN THE 2006 NET INCOME OF $366.5 MILLION ($0.65 PER DILUTED SHARE). FOREIGN CURRENCY THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2007 INCREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2007 BY APPROXIMATELY $100.0 MILLION AND INCREASED EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY 2 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ON JANUARY 1, 2007, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD BOARD (FASB) INTERPRETATION NO. 48, ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES  AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 PRESCRIBES A RECOGNITION THRESHOLD AND MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF TAX POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN TAX RETURNS, AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION, CLASSIFICATION, AND INTEREST AND PENALTIES, RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. AS A RESULT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF FIN 48, THE COMPANY DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY CHANGE IN ITS LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. SEE THE INCOME TAXES NOTE FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

FAS 13-2, ACCOUNTING FOR A CHANGE OR PROJECTED CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES GENERATED BY A LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTION (FSP 13-2). FSP 13-2 ADDRESSES HOW A CHANGE OR PROJECTED CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES GENERATED BY A LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTION AFFECTS THE ACCOUNTING BY A LESSOR FOR THAT LEASE. UPON ADOPTION OF FSP 13-2, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE TO RETAINED EARNINGS OF $22.6 MILLION, RESULTING FROM A CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS RELATED TO INCOME TAX BENEFITS OF THE COMPANY'S LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTIONS. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE EXISTING DEBT AND TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS THAT MEET ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINE OF 25% TO 35% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS AVERAGE NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. ON AUGUST 4, 2006, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO 35.0 MILLION SHARES.
