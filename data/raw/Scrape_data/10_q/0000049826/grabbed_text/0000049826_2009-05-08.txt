INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED TO $31.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2009 FROM $37.4 MILLION IN 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 6.875% NOTES AND 5.75% BONDS REPAID AT MATURITY ON NOVEMBER 17, 2008 AND MARCH 2, 2009, RESPECTIVELY, AND LOWER COMMERCIAL PAPER RATES. OTHER EXPENSE OTHER EXPENSE OF $3.7 MILLION FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2009 WAS LOWER THAN THE $20.7 MILLION IN 2008, PRIMARILY DUE TO A CHARGE FOR GERMAN TRANSFER TAXES IN 2008, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF INVESTMENT LOSSES IN 2009 VERSUS INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2008. INCOME TAXES THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2009 WAS 230.37% COMPARED TO 29.05% FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2008. THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM THE IMPAIRMENT OF NON-DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL AND DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009. INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WAS $29.4 MILLION ($0.06 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2009 COMPARED TO THE 2008 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $369.9 MILLION ($0.70 PER DILUTED SHARE). FOREIGN CURRENCY THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2009 DECREASED OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2009 BY APPROXIMATELY $227 MILLION AND DECREASED EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY 2 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WAS $9.9 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2009 COMPARED TO $66.2 MILLION IN 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO 2008 IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL OF $97.2 MILLION VERSUS THE 2009 LOSS ON ANTICIPATED SALE OF $30.0 MILLION. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. THE COMPANYS TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO IS 20% TO 30%, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ANY LARGER ACQUISITIONS. THE PRIMARY USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE:  DIVIDEND PAYMENTS  THE COMPANYS DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINES ARE 25% TO 35% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS AVERAGE INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS;  ACQUISITIONS; AND  ANY EXCESS LIQUIDITY MAY BE USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES. THE COMPANYS OPEN-ENDED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ALLOWS IT FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING THE TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED ON ITS CURRENT FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW, DEBT-TO-CAPITALIZATION RATIOS AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY. CASH FLOW FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS USED TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. WE BELIEVE THAT ROIC IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009 AND 2008, ROIC WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE ROIC DECREASE OF 10.8% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009 WAS THE RESULT OF OPERATING INCOME AFTER TAX DECREASING 73.4%, RESULTING FROM THE CURRENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN WHILE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, THE COMPANY INCURRED SIGNIFICANT CHARGES FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $90.0 MILLION THAT WAS MOSTLY NON-DEDUCTIBLE AND DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENTS OF $28.0 MILLION. SINCE THESE CHARGES WERE UNUSUAL THE ROIC CALCULATION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THESE ITEMS TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY AND BETTER REFLECT THE RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED .
