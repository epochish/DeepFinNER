SEE THE INCOME TAX NOTE FOR FURTHER DETAILS REGARDING THIS MATTER. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WAS $1.1 BILLION ($2.25 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2010 COMPARED TO THE 2009 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $473.9 MILLION ($0.95 PER DILUTED SHARE).

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WAS $34.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE LOSS ON SALE OF THE CLICK COMMERCE INDUSTRIAL SOFTWARE BUSINESS OF $29.6 MILLION. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE COMPANY’S PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT, CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS, TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH AND TO FUND SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE PRIMARY USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE: · DIVIDEND PAYMENTS – THE COMPANY’S DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINES WERE REVISED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010 FROM 25% TO 35% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS’ AVERAGE INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS TO 30% TO 45% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS’ AVERAGE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW; · ACQUISITIONS; AND · ANY EXCESS LIQUIDITY MAY BE USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES. THE COMPANY’S OPEN-ENDED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ALLOWS IT FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING THE TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO. CASH FLOW THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010 AND 2009 WAS AS FOLLOWS: ON AUGUST 20, 2007 THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME. IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2010, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 8.1 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $43.29 PER SHARE. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2010 THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY $871.0 MILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (“ROIC”) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS’ USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ROIC IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE YEAR AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2010 AND 2009, ROIC WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE 390 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010 WAS THE RESULT OF AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME INCREASING 34.3%, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BASE BUSINESS, WHILE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASED SLIGHTLY. THE 680 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC FOR YEAR-TO-DATE 2010 WAS THE RESULT OF AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME INCREASING 81.2%, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BASE BUSINESS, WHILE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASED SLIGHTLY. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, THE COMPANY RECORDED A DISCRETE TAX CHARGE OF $21.9 MILLION. THE ROIC CALCULATION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THIS ITEM TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY AND BETTER REFLECT THE RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED.

THE ROIC CALCULATION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THESE ITEMS TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY AND BETTER REFLECT THE RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL FOR THE 2009 YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD PRESENTED ABOVE.

NET WORKING CAPITAL AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2010 AND DECEMBER 31, 2009 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: SHORT-TERM DEBT INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO ISSUANCES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FUND STOCK REPURCHASES, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, AND GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EXCESS CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS USED TO PAY DOWN COMMERCIAL PAPER. INVENTORIES AND TRADE RECEIVABLES INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED SALES AND ACQUISITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. DEBT TOTAL DEBT AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2010 AND DECEMBER 31, 2009 WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OF $552.5 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2010 AND $135.5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009.

NO AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE FACILITIES AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2010. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED ON ITS CURRENT FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW, DEBT-TO-CAPITALIZATION RATIOS AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WAS $34.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE LOSS ON SALE OF THE CLICK COMMERCE INDUSTRIAL SOFTWARE BUSINESS OF $29.6 MILLION. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE COMPANY’S PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT, CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS, TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH AND TO FUND SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE PRIMARY USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE: · DIVIDEND PAYMENTS – THE COMPANY’S DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINES WERE REVISED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010 FROM 25% TO 35% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS’ AVERAGE INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS TO 30% TO 45% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS’ AVERAGE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW; · ACQUISITIONS; AND · ANY EXCESS LIQUIDITY MAY BE USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES. THE COMPANY’S OPEN-ENDED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ALLOWS IT FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING THE TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO. CASH FLOW THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE NORMAL CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2010, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 8.1 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $43.29 PER SHARE. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2010 THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY $871.0 MILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (“ROIC”) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS’ USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ROIC IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE YEAR AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2010 AND 2009, ROIC WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE 390 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010 WAS THE RESULT OF AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME INCREASING 34.3%, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BASE BUSINESS, WHILE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASED SLIGHTLY. THE 680 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC FOR YEAR-TO-DATE 2010 WAS THE RESULT OF AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME INCREASING 81.2%, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BASE BUSINESS, WHILE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASED SLIGHTLY. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, THE COMPANY RECORDED A DISCRETE TAX CHARGE OF $21.9 MILLION. THE ROIC CALCULATION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THIS ITEM TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY AND BETTER REFLECT THE RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED.
