FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF 2012 VERSUS 2011, REVENUES INCREASED 1.7% DUE TO REVENUES FROM ACQUISITIONS (NET OF DIVESTITURES) AND AN INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION. WORLDWIDE BASE REVENUES INCREASED 0.9% AND 2.1% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, AS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN NORTH AMERICA WERE MODESTLY POSITIVE WHILE THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT REMAINED WEAK, AND ASIA PACIFIC FURTHER SOFTENED.

SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS INCLUDED A MANUFACTURER OF SPECIALTY DEVICES USED TO MEASURE THE FLOW OF GASES AND FLUIDS PURCHASED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012, A THERMAL PROCESSING AND ENVIRONMENTAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER PURCHASED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011, AND A NORTH AMERICAN AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET BUSINESS PURCHASED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011. CURRENCY TRANSLATION RESULTED IN A 4.1% AND 3.4% DECLINE IN REVENUES IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO A WEAKER EURO VERSUS THE YEAR AGO PERIOD. OPERATING INCOMEOPERATING INCOME INCREASED 6.8% AND 7.4% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2012, RESPECTIVELY, VERSUS 2011 PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED VARIABLE MARGINS AND THE POSITIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE EFFECTS OF THE BASE REVENUE INCREASE NOTED ABOVE, AND LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE THIRD QUARTER. CURRENCY TRANSLATION RESULTED IN A 4.1% AND 3.1% DECLINE IN OPERATING INCOME IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO A WEAKER EURO VERSUS THE YEAR AGO PERIOD.

BASE MARGINS INCREASED 200 AND 160 BASIS POINTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS, AND THE POSITIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE EFFECT OF THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES OF 20 AND 50 BASIS POINTS, RESPECTIVELY. THE 180 AND 110 BASIS POINT IMPROVEMENTS IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF SELLING PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS OF 80 AND 60 BASIS POINTS, RESPECTIVELY, AND LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE THIRD QUARTER. THE INCREASE IN BASE MARGINS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 30 AND 40 BASIS POINT DECLINE RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS (NET OF DIVESTITURES) IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH INTANGIBLE ASSETS FROM ACQUISITIONS MADE WITHIN THE PAST YEAR. RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES DILUTED OPERATING MARGINS BY 30 BASIS POINTS IN BOTH THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS DUE TO THE HIGHER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES NOTED ABOVE. 12RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENTTHE RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES TO TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES IS AS FOLLOWS:TRANSPORTATIONBUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT PRODUCE COMPONENTS, FASTENERS, FLUIDS AND POLYMERS, AS WELL AS TRUCK REMANUFACTURING AND RELATED PARTS AND SERVICE.IN THE TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDE:• PLASTIC AND METAL COMPONENTS, FASTENERS AND ASSEMBLIES FOR AUTOMOBILES, LIGHT TRUCKS, AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL USES;• FLUIDS, POLYMERS AND OTHER SUPPLIES FOR AUTO AFTERMARKET MAINTENANCE AND APPEARANCE;• FILLERS AND PUTTIES FOR AUTO BODY REPAIR;• POLYESTER COATINGS AND PATCH AND REPAIR PRODUCTS FOR THE MARINE INDUSTRY; AND• TRUCK REMANUFACTURING AND RELATED PARTS AND SERVICE.THIS SEGMENT PRIMARILY SERVES THE AUTOMOTIVE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS AND TIERS, AND AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET MARKETS.THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2012 AND 2011 WERE AS FOLLOWS:13IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2012, THE CHANGES IN REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGINS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: THREE MONTHS ENDED NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30 SEPTEMBER 30 % INCREASE (DECREASE) % INCREASE (DECREASE) % POINT INCREASE (DECREASE) % INCREASE (DECREASE) % INCREASE (DECREASE) % POINT INCREASE (DECREASE) OPERATING REVENUES OPERATING INCOME OPERATING MARGINS OPERATING REVENUES OPERATING INCOME OPERATING MARGINSBASE BUSINESS: REVENUE CHANGE/OPERATING LEVERAGE1.4 % 3.2 % 0.3% 3.3% 7.5% 0.6%CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS & OVERHEAD COSTS— 5.4 0.8 — 2.2 0.4TOTAL1.4 8.6 1.1 3.3 9.7 1.0ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES0.5 0.3 — 2.7 1.8 (0.1)RESTRUCTURING COSTS— (5.8) (0.9) — (3.1) (0.5)IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL & INTANGIBLES— — — — — —TRANSLATION(4.1) (4.9) (0.1) (3.5) (4.1) (0.1)OTHER— — — — — —TOTAL(2.2)% (1.8)% 0.1% 2.5% 4.3% 0.3% OPERATING REVENUESREVENUES DECREASED 2.2% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2012 VERSUS 2011 DUE TO THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES AND REVENUES FROM ACQUISITIONS. FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF 2012 VERSUS 2011, REVENUES INCREASED 2.5% DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES AND REVENUES FROM ACQUISITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION. THE INCREASE IN ACQUISITION REVENUE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PURCHASE OF A NORTH AMERICAN AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET BUSINESS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011 AND A EUROPEAN AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET BUSINESS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011. NORTH AMERICAN AUTOMOTIVE BASE REVENUES INCREASED 9.2% AND 11.0% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN US AUTOMAKERS’ AUTO BUILDS OF APPROXIMATELY 14% AND 20% FOR THE RESPECTIVE PERIODS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN UNFAVORABLE CUSTOMER MIX.

INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE PERIOD AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S LONG TERM FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA. EBITDA AND THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.

ROIC IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE PERIOD AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER.
