SEE THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NOTE IN ITEM 1 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS REGARDING THE COMPANY’S DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE COMPANY’S PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT, TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS, TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH AND TO FUND SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE PRIMARY USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE: · DIVIDEND PAYMENTS – THE COMPANY’S DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINES ARE 30% TO 45% OF THE AVERAGE OF THE LAST TWO YEARS OF FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW; · ACQUISITIONS; AND · ANY EXCESS LIQUIDITY MAY BE USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES. CASH FLOW THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2011, THERE WERE NO AUTHORIZED PURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THE 2007 PROGRAM. ON MAY 6, 2011, THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $4.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME (THE “2011 PROGRAM”). IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011, THE COMPANY MADE REPURCHASES OF APPROXIMATELY 1.8 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $43.20. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2011, THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY $3.9 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THE 2011 PROGRAM. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (“ROIC”) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS’ USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ROIC IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE YEAR AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2011 AND 2010, ROIC WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE ROIC DECREASE OF 70 BASIS POINTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011 COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010 WAS THE RESULT OF AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASING 22.5%, WHILE OPERATING INCOME AFTER TAXES INCREASED 17.2%. THE ROIC INCREASE OF 20 BASIS POINTS FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 WAS THE RESULT OF OPERATING INCOME AFTER TAXES INCREASING 20.0%, WHILE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASED 18.5%. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, THE COMPANY RECORDED A FAVORABLE DISCRETE NON-CASH TAX BENEFIT OF $165.9 MILLION RELATED TO THE DECISION IN THE COMPANY’S FAVOR BY THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA, VICTORIA WITH RESPECT TO A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS THAT HAD BEEN CHALLENGED BY THE AUSTRALIAN TAX OFFICE. SEE THE INCOME TAXES NOTE IN ITEM 1 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THIS DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENT. SINCE THE BENEFIT WAS UNUSUAL, THE ROIC CALCULATION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THIS ITEM TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY AND BETTER REFLECT THE RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED. A RECONCILIATION OF THE 2011 YEAR-TO-DATE TAX RATE, AS REPORTED, TO THE TAX RATE USED ABOVE IS AS FOLLOWS: NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2011 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES INCOME TAXES TAX RATE AS REPORTED $ 1,991,899 $ 412,000 20.7 % DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENT — 165,927 8.3 % AS ADJUSTED $ 1,991,899 $ 577,927 29.0 % IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, THE COMPANY RECORDED A DISCRETE TAX CHARGE OF $21.9 MILLION RELATED TO THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT. SEE THE INCOME TAXES NOTE IN ITEM 1 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THIS DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENT. SINCE THIS CHARGE WAS UNUSUAL, THE ROIC CALCULATION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THIS ITEM TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY AND BETTER REFLECT THE RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED. A RECONCILIATION OF THE 2010 YEAR-TO-DATE TAX RATE, AS REPORTED, TO THE TAX RATE USED ABOVE IS AS FOLLOWS: NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2010 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES INCOME TAXES TAX RATE AS REPORTED $ 1,647,427 $ 523,285 31.8 % DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENT — (21,881 ) (1.4 )% AS ADJUSTED $ 1,647,427 $ 501,404 30.4 % WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT USES WORKING CAPITAL AS A MEASUREMENT OF THE SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY. NET WORKING CAPITAL AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2011 AND DECEMBER 31, 2010 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: TRADE RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES AND ACQUISITIONS. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER TAX RECEIVABLES. SHORT-TERM DEBT INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO ISSUANCES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FUND ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER PURCHASE ACTIVITY, AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASE IN INCOME TAXES PAYABLE. THE COMPANY’S CASH AND EQUIVALENTS BALANCE AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2011 WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION, MOST OF WHICH WAS HELD INTERNATIONALLY. DEBT THE COMPANY’S TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO IS 20% TO 30%, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ANY LARGER ACQUISITIONS. TOTAL DEBT AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2011 AND DECEMBER 31, 2010 WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OF APPROXIMATELY $712.0 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2011, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN SHORT-TERM DEBT, AND NO OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. IN JUNE 2010, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $1.0 BILLION LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 10, 2011. THIS LINE OF CREDIT WAS REPLACED ON JUNE 10, 2011 BY A $1.0 BILLION LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 10, 2016. NO AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THIS FACILITY AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2011. IN AUGUST 2011, THE COMPANY ISSUED $350.0 MILLION OF 3.375% NOTES DUE SEPTEMBER 15, 2021 AT 99.552% OF FACE VALUE AND $650.0 MILLION OF 4.875% NOTES DUE SEPTEMBER 15, 2041 AT 98.539% OF FACE VALUE. THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE WERE USED TO PAY DOWN THE COMPANY’S COMMERCIAL PAPER BALANCE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED ON ITS CURRENT FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW, DEBT-TO-CAPITALIZATION RATIOS AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY THE CHANGES TO STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY DURING 2011 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY, DECEMBER 31, 2010 $ 9,571,999 NET INCOME 1,629,187 STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK ACTIVITY 194,644 PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT ADJUSTMENTS, NET OF TAX 25,113 REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK (950,000 ) NONCONTROLLING INTEREST 3,174 CASH DIVIDENDS DECLARED (511,047 ) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS (111,061 ) TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2011 $ 9,852,009 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995, THAT MAY BE IDENTIFIED BY THE USE OF WORDS SUCH AS “BELIEVE,” “EXPECT,” “PLANS,” “INTENDS,” “STRATEGY,” “PROSPECTS,” “ESTIMATE,” “PROJECT,” “TARGET,” “ANTICIPATE,” “GUIDANCE,” AND OTHER SIMILAR WORDS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, STATEMENTS REGARDING THE ADEQUACY OF INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS AND CREDIT FACILITIES, THE MEETING OF DIVIDEND PAYOUT OBJECTIVES, THE ABILITY TO FUND DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS, EXPECTED CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMPANY’S PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL FINANCING, AND THE ESTIMATED TIMING AND AMOUNT RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF TAX MATTERS.

BASE REVENUES INCREASED 11.2% AND 15.7% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE WORLDWIDE TEST AND MEASUREMENT BUSINESSES DUE TO INCREASED EQUIPMENT ORDERS IN BOTH NORTH AMERICA AND INTERNATIONALLY.

FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD, BASE REVENUES INCREASED 4.1% FOR THE CONSUMER PACKAGING BUSINESSES DUE TO GROWTH IN THE BEVERAGE PACKAGING SOLUTIONS, DECORATING EQUIPMENT AND MARKING AND LABELS BUSINESSES. BASE REVENUES IN THE WORLDWIDE INDUSTRIAL FASTENERS AND APPLIANCE BUSINESSES DECREASED 4.9% AND 0.2% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2011, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO WEAKNESS IN THE APPLIANCE END MARKET. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 14.2% AND 20.4% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2011, RESPECTIVELY, VERSUS 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN BASE REVENUES, THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION, AND INCOME FROM ACQUISITIONS. BASE MARGINS INCREASED 70 AND 140 BASIS POINTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE POSITIVE LEVERAGE EFFECT OF THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF SELLING PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES IMPROVED TOTAL OPERATING MARGINS BY 10 BASIS POINTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND DILUTED MARGINS BY 30 BASIS POINTS IN THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF 2011.

SEE THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NOTE IN ITEM 1 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS REGARDING THE COMPANY’S DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE COMPANY’S PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT, TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS, TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH AND TO FUND SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE PRIMARY USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE: · DIVIDEND PAYMENTS – THE COMPANY’S DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINES ARE 30% TO 45% OF THE AVERAGE OF THE LAST TWO YEARS OF FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW; · ACQUISITIONS; AND · ANY EXCESS LIQUIDITY MAY BE USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES. CASH FLOW THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2011 AND 2010 WAS AS FOLLOWS: ON AUGUST 20, 2007, THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME (THE “2007 PROGRAM”). UNDER THE 2007 PROGRAM, THE COMPANY MADE REPURCHASES OF APPROXIMATELY 9.6 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $57.01 PER SHARE DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2011 AND APPROXIMATELY 6.6 MILLION SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $48.41 DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2011, THERE WERE NO AUTHORIZED PURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THE 2007 PROGRAM. ON MAY 6, 2011, THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $4.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME (THE “2011 PROGRAM”). IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011, THE COMPANY MADE REPURCHASES OF APPROXIMATELY 1.8 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $43.20. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2011, THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY $3.9 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THE 2011 PROGRAM. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (“ROIC”) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS’ USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ROIC IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE YEAR AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF 2011 AND 2010, ROIC WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE ROIC DECREASE OF 70 BASIS POINTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011 COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010 WAS THE RESULT OF AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASING 22.5%, WHILE OPERATING INCOME AFTER TAXES INCREASED 17.2%. THE ROIC INCREASE OF 20 BASIS POINTS FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 WAS THE RESULT OF OPERATING INCOME AFTER TAXES INCREASING 20.0%, WHILE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASED 18.5%. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, THE COMPANY RECORDED A FAVORABLE DISCRETE NON-CASH TAX BENEFIT OF $165.9 MILLION RELATED TO THE DECISION IN THE COMPANY’S FAVOR BY THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA, VICTORIA WITH RESPECT TO A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS THAT HAD BEEN CHALLENGED BY THE AUSTRALIAN TAX OFFICE. SEE THE INCOME TAXES NOTE IN ITEM 1 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THIS DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENT. SINCE THE BENEFIT WAS UNUSUAL, THE ROIC CALCULATION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THIS ITEM TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY AND BETTER REFLECT THE RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED. A RECONCILIATION OF THE 2011 YEAR-TO-DATE TAX RATE, AS REPORTED, TO THE TAX RATE USED ABOVE IS AS FOLLOWS: NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2011 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES INCOME TAXES TAX RATE AS REPORTED $ 1,991,899 $ 412,000 20.7 % DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENT — 165,927 8.3 % AS ADJUSTED $ 1,991,899 $ 577,927 29.0 % IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, THE COMPANY RECORDED A DISCRETE TAX CHARGE OF $21.9 MILLION RELATED TO THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT. SEE THE INCOME TAXES NOTE IN ITEM 1 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THIS DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENT. SINCE THIS CHARGE WAS UNUSUAL, THE ROIC CALCULATION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THIS ITEM TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY AND BETTER REFLECT THE RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED.

NET WORKING CAPITAL AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2011 AND DECEMBER 31, 2010 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: TRADE RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES AND ACQUISITIONS. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER TAX RECEIVABLES. SHORT-TERM DEBT INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO ISSUANCES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FUND ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER PURCHASE ACTIVITY, AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASE IN INCOME TAXES PAYABLE. THE COMPANY’S CASH AND EQUIVALENTS BALANCE AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2011 WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION, MOST OF WHICH WAS HELD INTERNATIONALLY. DEBT THE COMPANY’S TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO IS 20% TO 30%, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ANY LARGER ACQUISITIONS.

IN AUGUST 2011, THE COMPANY ISSUED $350.0 MILLION OF 3.375% NOTES DUE SEPTEMBER 15, 2021 AT 99.552% OF FACE VALUE AND $650.0 MILLION OF 4.875% NOTES DUE SEPTEMBER 15, 2041 AT 98.539% OF FACE VALUE. THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE WERE USED TO PAY DOWN THE COMPANY’S COMMERCIAL PAPER BALANCE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED ON ITS CURRENT FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW, DEBT-TO-CAPITALIZATION RATIOS AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY THE CHANGES TO STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY DURING 2011 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (IN THOUSANDS) TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY, DECEMBER 31, 2010 $ 9,571,999 NET INCOME 1,629,187 STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK ACTIVITY 194,644 PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT ADJUSTMENTS, NET OF TAX 25,113 REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK (950,000 ) NONCONTROLLING INTEREST 3,174 CASH DIVIDENDS DECLARED (511,047 ) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS (111,061 ) TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2011 $ 9,852,009 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995, THAT MAY BE IDENTIFIED BY THE USE OF WORDS SUCH AS “BELIEVE,” “EXPECT,” “PLANS,” “INTENDS,” “STRATEGY,” “PROSPECTS,” “ESTIMATE,” “PROJECT,” “TARGET,” “ANTICIPATE,” “GUIDANCE,” AND OTHER SIMILAR WORDS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, STATEMENTS REGARDING THE ADEQUACY OF INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS AND CREDIT FACILITIES, THE MEETING OF DIVIDEND PAYOUT OBJECTIVES, THE ABILITY TO FUND DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS, EXPECTED CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMPANY’S PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL FINANCING, AND THE ESTIMATED TIMING AND AMOUNT RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF TAX MATTERS.
