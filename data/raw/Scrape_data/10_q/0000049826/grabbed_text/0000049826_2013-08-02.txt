THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S LONG TERM FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA. ADJUSTED EBITDA AND THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.
