In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in the Company’s 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform with current year reporting.(2)    Discontinued OperationsThe Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term objectives. As such, the Company may commit to a plan to exit or dispose of certain businesses and present them as discontinued operations. The following summarizes the Company's discontinued operations.The Company has restated the statement of income and the notes to financial statements to present the operating results of businesses discussed below as discontinued operations.Third Quarter 2013 Discontinued Operations - In February 2013, the Company announced that it was initiating a review process to explore strategic alternatives for its Industrial Packaging segment. In September 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the Industrial Packaging segment. The Company classified the Industrial Packaging segment as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013.On February 6, 2014, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell its Industrial Packaging segment to The Carlyle Group for $3.2 billion. The transaction was completed on May 1, 2014, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $1.7 billion ($1.1 billion after-tax) in the second quarter of 2014, subject to customary post-close adjustments. In the third quarter of 2013, the Company also committed to plans for the divestiture of a construction distribution business previously included in the Construction Products segment and a specialty coatings business previously included in the Polymers & Fluids segment. These businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013. The specialty coatings business was sold in the fourth quarter of 2013. The construction distribution business was sold in the second quarter of 2014.First Quarter 2013 Discontinued Operations - In the first quarter of 2013, the Company committed to plans for the divestiture of two transportation related businesses and a machine components business previously included in the Specialty Products segment, two construction distribution businesses previously included in the Construction Products segment, and a chemical manufacturing business previously included in the Polymers & Fluids segment. These businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the first quarter of 2013.The Company also reclassified certain previously divested businesses as discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2013. These included a consumer packaging business that was previously included in the Specialty Products segment, a packaging distribution business which was previously included in the former Industrial Packaging segment, and a welding manufacturing business previously included in the Welding segment.In the second quarter of 2013, the Company divested one of the held for sale transportation related businesses, the machine components business, and the chemical manufacturing business. In the third quarter of 2013, the Company divested the second held for sale transportation related business. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company divested one construction distribution business and the remaining construction distribution business was sold in the second quarter of 2014.6Results of the discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:Income before income taxes from discontinued operations was income of $1.8 billion and $107 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The income in the first nine months of 2014 included the pre-tax gain of $1.7 billion ($1.1 billion after-tax) on the sale of the Industrial Packaging segment recorded in the second quarter of 2014. Income tax expense in the first nine months of 2014 includes $175 million of U.S. income tax expense related to the repatriation of approximately $1.3 billion of international proceeds from the sale of the Industrial Packaging segment. The income in the first nine months of 2013 included a $42 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in connection with the anticipated sale of one of the transportation related businesses discussed above and loss reserves on assets held for sale of $74 million.There were no businesses classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2014. As of December 31, 2013, the assets and liabilities of the Industrial Packaging business and the two construction distribution businesses discussed above were included in assets and liabilities held for sale in the statement of financial position, as follows:(In millions) December 31, 2013Trade receivables$352Inventories244Net plant and equipment305Goodwill and intangible assets844Other91Total assets held for sale$1,836  Accounts payable$87Accrued expenses139Other91Total liabilities held for sale$317(3)    Gain on Acquisition of Controlling Interest in Equity InvestmentOn January 31, 2013, the Company acquired the controlling interest of an existing consumer packaging business in the Specialty Products segment previously accounted for under the equity method. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $30 million in Other income (expense) in the first quarter of 2013 as a result of remeasuring the Company's existing equity interest to fair value by determining the implied equity value using a Level 3 valuation method.(4)    Income TaxesIn the third quarter of 2013, the Company recorded a discrete tax charge of $40 million related to the tax treatment of intercompany financing transactions that impact the taxability of foreign earnings. The components of the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:7The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions including the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, German Fiscal Authority, French Fiscal Authority, and Australian Tax Office, and a number of these audits are currently ongoing, which may increase the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits in future periods. The Company has recorded its best estimate of the potential exposure for these issues. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that the amount of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits will not change materially within the next twelve months.On February 18, 2014, the Company received a Notice of Deficiency (“NOD”) from the IRS asserting that a non-taxable return of capital received from a subsidiary was a taxable dividend distribution. The NOD assesses additional taxes of $70 million for the 2006 tax year, plus interest and penalties. In May 2014, the Company petitioned the United States Tax Court to challenge the NOD. The Company's petition was subsequently denied and the case will proceed to court. Although the outcome of this process cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes it will be successful in defending its position.(5)    InventoriesInventories as of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were as follows: (6)    Goodwill and Intangible AssetsGoodwill represents the excess cost over fair value of the net assets of purchased businesses. The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. The Company performs an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives based on the estimated fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company evaluates the goodwill assigned to each of its reporting units for potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the relevant reporting unit to the carrying value. The Company uses various valuation techniques to determine the fair value of its reporting units, including discounting estimated future cash flows based on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant reporting unit and market multiples of relevant public companies. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill.The Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trademarks and brands. The estimated fair values of these intangible assets are determined based on a Level 3 valuation method using a relief-of-royalty income approach derived from internally forecasted revenues of the related products. If the fair value of the trademark or brand is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the intangible asset. The Company performed its annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter of 2014 and 2013, which resulted in no goodwill impairment charges and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $3 million and $2 million, respectively. The charges in the third quarter of 2014 related to certain brands in the Polymers & Fluids and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments. The charges in the third quarter of 2013 related to a brand in the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment.8A summary of indefinite-lived intangible assets that were adjusted to fair value and the related impairment charges included in the statement of income in the third quarter of 2014 and 2013 is as follows:(7)    Retirement Plans and Postretirement BenefitsPension and other postretirement benefit costs related to both continuing and discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, were as follows:The Company recognized settlement charges of $34 million in the second quarter of 2013 and $8 million in the third quarter of 2013 primarily due to higher lump sum pension payments related to the exit of employees of the former Decorative Surfaces segment from the Company's U.S. primary pension plan. The settlement charges were included in Income from Continuing Operations. In addition, the Company recognized a $9 million curtailment gain on the U.S. primary postretirement plan in the second quarter of 2014 and a $2 million curtailment charge on the U.S. primary pension plan in the third quarter of 2013 related to the Company's sale of the Industrial Packaging business and the reclassification of the Industrial Packaging business to discontinued operations. These curtailment charges were included in Income from Discontinued Operations.The Company expects to contribute approximately $136 million to its pension plans and $7 million to its other postretirement plans in 2014. As of September 30, 2014, contributions of $117 million to pension plans and $5 million to other postretirement plans have been made.(8)    DebtShort-term debt represents obligations with a maturity date of one year or less and are stated at cost which approximates fair value. Short-term debt also includes current maturities of long-term debt. Short-term debt as of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 included €750 million of 5.25% Euro notes due October 1, 2014, which were repaid on the due date, and 9commercial paper of $503 million and $1.7 billion, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2013, short-term debt included $800 million of 5.15% redeemable notes due April 1, 2014, which were repaid on the due date.Long-term debt represents obligations with a maturity date greater than one year, and excludes current maturities that have been reclassified to short-term debt. In February 2014, the Company issued $650 million of 0.9% notes due February 25, 2017 at 99.861% of face value, $650 million of 1.95% notes due March 1, 2019 at 99.871% of face value, and $700 million of 3.5% notes due March 1, 2024 at 99.648% of face value. Net proceeds from the February 2014 debt issuance were used to repay commercial paper. In May 2014, the Company issued €500 million of 1.75% Euro notes due May 20, 2022 at 99.16% of face value and €500 million of 3.0% Euro notes due May 19, 2034 at 98.089% of face value. The carrying values of the Euro notes were $626 million and $620 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2014. Net proceeds from the May 2014 debt issuances were used for general corporate purposes. The Company designated the €1.0 billion of Euro notes as a hedge of a portion of its net investment in Euro-denominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations. Changes in the value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate have been recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive income. The unrealized gain recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income related to the net investment hedge was $105 million and $106 million for the three and nine months end September 30, 2014, respectively.The Company has committed lines of credit of $2.5 billion in the U.S. to support its commercial paper program. In May 2014, the Company amended its financial covenants within these agreements. The previous financial covenant, limiting total debt to total capitalization, was replaced with a minimum interest coverage ratio. As of September 30, 2014, the Company was in compliance with this covenant and there were no amounts outstanding under these credit agreements.The approximate fair value and related carrying value of the Company's total long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt presented as short-term debt, as of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were as follows: The approximate fair values of the Company's long-term debt, including current maturities, were based on a Level 2 valuation model, using observable inputs which included market rates for comparable instruments for the respective periods.(9)    Accumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeThe following table summarizes changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013:10 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended(In millions)September 30, September 30, 2014 2013 2014 2013Beginning balance$359 $12 $384 $293        Foreign currency translation adjustments during the period(514) 241 (404) (166)Foreign currency translation adjustments reclassified to income(1) 1 (133) 7Total foreign currency translation adjustments(515) 242 (537) (159)        Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments during the period(2) 36 (43) 147Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income13 22 42 99Income taxes(3) (20) 6 (88)Total pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments8 38 5 158        Ending balance$(148) $292 $(148) $292Foreign currency translation adjustments reclassified to income are primarily related to the disposal of certain discontinued operations. Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income primarily relate to the amortization of actuarial (gain) loss and prior service cost, and recognition of deferred actuarial losses related to plan settlements in net periodic benefit cost. Additionally, $6 million and $4 million of deferred actuarial losses were reclassified to income in the second quarter of 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to the disposal of certain discontinued operations. Refer to the Retirement Plans and Postretirement Benefits, and the Discontinued Operations notes for additional information. The ending balance of accumulated other comprehensive income as of September 30, 2014 and 2013 consisted of cumulative translation adjustment income of $137 million and $708 million, respectively, and unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefits costs, net of tax, of $285 million and $416 million, respectively.(10)    Segment InformationThe Company has seven reportable segments: Automotive OEM; Test & Measurement and Electronics; Food Equipment; Polymers & Fluids; Welding; Construction Products; and Specialty Products. See Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information regarding operating revenues and operating income for the Company's segments.11Item 2 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsIntroductionManagement analyzes the Company’s consolidated results of operations and the results of each segment by identifying the effects of changes in the results of the base businesses, newly acquired and recently divested companies, restructuring costs, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, and currency translation on the operating revenues and operating income of each segment. Base businesses are those businesses that have been included in the Company’s results of operations for more than 12 months. The changes to base business operating income include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and changes in variable margins and overhead costs. Operating leverage is the estimated effect of the base business revenue volume changes on operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period. As manufacturing and administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing, the percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage is usually more than the percentage change in the base business revenues. Changes in variable margins and overhead costs represent the estimated effect of non-volume related changes in base business operating income and may be driven by a number of factors, including changes in product mix, the cost of raw materials, labor and overhead, and pricing to customers. Selling price versus material cost comparisons represent the estimated net impact of increases or decreases in the cost of materials used in the Company’s products versus changes in the selling price to the Company’s customers. Management reviews these price versus cost comparisons by analyzing the net impact of changes to each segment’s operating margin.The discussion of operating results should be read in conjunction with Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.Enterprise StrategyDuring 2012, the Company embarked on an Enterprise Strategy that includes three key initiatives - portfolio management, business structure simplification, and strategic sourcing. These enterprise initiatives are expected to enhance the business through 2017 and are targeted at expanding organic revenue growth and improving profitability and returns.Portfolio Management - The Company's portfolio management initiative aims to construct a business portfolio that leverages the Company’s differentiated business model and growth potential. As part of this initiative, the Company reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its long-term objectives. As a result, the Company's divestiture activity increased in 2012, 2013 and 2014. With the sale of the Company's former Industrial Packaging segment on May 1, 2014, the divestiture element of the Company's portfolio management initiative is essentially complete. The Company has historically acquired businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms. Going forward, the Company will emphasize organic growth and focus on acquisitions with sustainable differentiation and growth potential. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for discussion of the Company’s discontinued operations.Another integral aspect of the Company's 80/20 business process and portfolio management initiative is the focus on product line and customer base simplification.  Product line and customer base simplification focuses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines. Product line and customer base simplification is a core element of the Company's 80/20 business process and is key to improving the Company's long-term operating and financial performance.Business Structure Simplification - The business structure simplification initiative simplifies the Company's organizational model and adds scale to the Company's operating divisions in order to increase organic revenue growth, enhance global competitiveness and drive operational efficiencies. This initiative focuses on reducing the number of the Company's operating divisions and increasing the average revenue size of each division, while retaining the positive attributes of a decentralized operating model. The Company expects to enhance its profitability and returns through a combination of applying its 80/20 business process to the new divisions, more focused growth investments and reduced infrastructure.Strategic Sourcing - The Company's strategic sourcing initiative focuses on building sourcing capability in order to leverage purchasing scale to enhance profitability and global competitiveness. It incorporates both enterprise-level and segment-level purchasing that cross the Company's many businesses. This initiative is transforming sourcing into a core strategic function in the Company.12Discontinued OperationsThe Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term objectives. As such, the Company may commit to a plan to exit or dispose of certain businesses and present them as discontinued operations. In February 2013, the Company announced that it was initiating a review process to explore strategic alternatives for the Industrial Packaging segment. In September 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the Industrial Packaging segment. The Company classified the Industrial Packaging segment as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013.On February 6, 2014, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell the Industrial Packaging segment to The Carlyle Group for $3.2 billion. The transaction was completed on May 1, 2014, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $1.7 billion ($1.1 billion after-tax) in the second quarter of 2014, subject to customary post-close adjustments. In the third quarter of 2013, the Company also committed to plans for the divestiture of a construction distribution business previously included in the Construction Products segment and a specialty coatings business previously included in the Polymers & Fluids segment. The construction distribution and specialty coatings businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013.In the first quarter of 2013, the Company committed to plans for the divestiture of two transportation related businesses and a machine components business previously included in the Specialty Products segment, two construction distribution businesses previously included in the Construction Products segment, and a chemical manufacturing business previously included in the Polymers & Fluids segment. These businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the first quarter of 2013. The businesses discussed above, as well as certain previously divested businesses, are reported as discontinued operations in the statement of income. As of the second quarter of 2014, the Company has completed the divestiture of all of the businesses previously classified as discontinued operations. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for discussion of the Company’s discontinued operations.Consolidated Results of OperationsThe Company’s consolidated results of operations for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2014 and 2013 were as follows:13In the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2014, the changes in operating revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30 September 30 % Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Point          Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Point          Increase (Decrease) Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating Margins Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating MarginsBase business (organic):           Revenue change/Operating leverage3.5 % 7.9 % 0.8% 2.7% 6.6% 0.7 %Changes in variable margins & overhead costs— % 5.9 % 1.1% —% 8.7% 1.5 % 3.5 % 13.8 % 1.9% 2.7% 15.3% 2.2 %Acquisitions and divestitures(0.2)% (0.1)% —% 0.8% 0.2% (0.1)%Restructuring costs— % — % —% —% 0.9% 0.2 %Impairment of goodwill & intangibles— % (0.1)% —% —% —% — %Translation0.2 % 0.2 % —% 0.3% 0.4% — %Total3.5 % 13.8 % 1.9% 3.8% 16.8% 2.3 %Operating RevenuesOperating revenues increased 3.5% and 3.8% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2014, respectively, versus 2013 primarily due to an increase in organic revenues. Total organic revenues increased 3.5% and 2.7% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively. Product line and customer base simplification activities associated with the portfolio managment component of the Company's enterprise strategy reduced organic revenue growth by approximately one percentage point. North American organic revenues increased 3.7% and 2.0% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, as growth in the Automotive OEM, Food Equipment and Welding segments was partially offset by a decline in revenues in Polymers & Fluids due to ongoing product line and customer base simplification for each of the respective periods. International organic revenues grew 3.4% and 3.8% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods. European organic revenues increased 3.1% and 2.8% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily driven by the Automotive OEM, Food Equipment and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments, partially offset by Welding and Polymers & Fluids. Asia Pacific organic revenues increased 4.7% and 6.1% in the respective periods, primarily due to growth in Automotive OEM in China and Construction Products in Australia. Acquisitions included the purchase of a European consumer packaging equipment business and a Chinese food equipment business in the third quarter of 2013. Operating IncomeOperating income increased 13.8% and 16.8% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2014, respectively, versus 2013 primarily due to higher organic revenues and changes in variable margins and overhead costs. Total base operating margins increased 190 and 220 basis points in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, due to changes in variable margins and overhead costs and the positive operating leverage effect of the increase in organic revenues. The changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased base margins by 110 and 150 basis points in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively.

See the Income Taxes note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for further details on income taxes.INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSIncome from discontinued operations was $1.1 billion for the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2014, primarily due to the $1.1 billion after-tax gain on the sale of the Industrial Packaging segment in the second quarter of 2014, versus income of $48 million for the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2013. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 1 – Financial Statements for further details regarding the Company’s discontinued operations.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIn March 2013, new accounting guidance was issued which clarifies that an entity should release cumulative translation adjustments into net income when the entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business within a foreign entity, which is consistent with the Company's prior accounting policy. The new guidance became effective for the Company on January 1, 2014 and did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.In April 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for reporting discontinued operations. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in a company's operations and financial results should be reported as discontinued operations, with expanded disclosures. In addition, disclosure of the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of an organization that does not qualify as a discontinued operation is required. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2015. The guidance applies prospectively to new disposals and new classifications of disposal groups held for sale after the effective date. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, the guidance will have upon adoption.In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for revenue recognition. The core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, several new revenue recognition disclosures will be required. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact the guidance will have upon adoption.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe Company’s primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and short-term credit facilities. In addition, the Company had $4.8 billion of cash on hand at September 30, 2014 and also maintains strong access to public debt markets. Management believes that these sources are sufficient to service debt and to finance the Company's capital allocation priorities, which include:26•investment in existing businesses to fund internal growth;•payment of an attractive dividend to shareholders;•share repurchases; and•acquisitions.In September 2013, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the Industrial Packaging segment. The Company classified the Industrial Packaging segment as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013 and no longer presented this segment as part of its continuing operations. As to the impact of this divestiture on the Company’s income per share from continuing operations and capital structure going forward, the Company also indicated that it intended to repurchase approximately 50 million shares through a program utilizing its existing share repurchase authorization to offset the full amount of divestiture-related dilution of income per share from continuing operations through a combination of sale proceeds, free operating cash flow and additional leverage. The Company completed this program in the second quarter of 2014. Under this program, the Company repurchased approximately 14.0 million shares of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2013, approximately 18.5 million shares of its common stock in the first quarter of 2014, and  approximately 17.2 million shares of its common stock in the second quarter of 2014.On February 6, 2014, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell the Industrial Packaging segment to The Carlyle Group for $3.2 billion. The transaction was completed on May 1, 2014, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $1.7 billion ($1.1 billion after-tax) in the second quarter of 2014, subject to customary post-close adjustments. A portion of the proceeds were used to fund share repurchases under the program noted above. The Company believes that, based on its revenues, operating margins, current free operating cash flow, and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary.Cash FlowThe Company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.Summarized cash flow information for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2014 and 2013 were as follows:27Stock Repurchase ProgramsOn May 6, 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provided for the buyback of up to $4.0 billion of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2011 Program”). Under the 2011 Program, the Company repurchased approximately 5.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $62.86 in the first quarter of 2013, approximately 4.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $66.91 in the second quarter of 2013, and approximately 5.2 million shares at an average price of $72.51 in the third quarter of 2013. The 2011 Program was fully utilized in the fourth quarter of 2013. On August 2, 2013, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to an additional $6.0 billion of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2013 Program”). Under the 2013 Program, the Company repurchased approximately 18.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $80.94 in the first quarter of 2014, approximately 17.2 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $86.01 in the second quarter of 2014, and approximately 5.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $85.35 in the third quarter of 2014. As of September 30, 2014, there was approximately $2.3 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2013 Program. Adjusted Return on Average Invested CapitalThe Company uses adjusted return on average invested capital (“adjusted ROIC”) to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. Adjusted ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. Adjusted average invested capital also excludes the Company's net investment in the former Industrial Packaging segment and the equity investment in the Wilsonart business (formerly the Decorative Surfaces segment). Adjusted average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. For the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2014 and 2013, adjusted ROIC was as follows:The annualized adjusted ROIC increase of 250 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily the result of a 12.0% improvement in after-tax operating income and a 1.7% decrease in adjusted average invested capital. Additionally, the annualized adjusted ROIC increase of 270 basis points for the year-to-date period ended 28September 30, 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily the result of a 14.7% improvement in after-tax operating income and a 1.8% decrease in adjusted average invested capital.The 2013 effective tax rate included a discrete tax charge of $40 million recorded in the third quarter related to the tax treatment of intercompany financing transactions that impact the taxability of foreign earnings. A reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the adjusted tax rate excluding this discrete tax charge is as follows: (Dollars in millions)Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 September 30, 2013Income Taxes - As reported$222 $551Discrete tax charge related to foreign earnings(40) (40)Income Taxes - As adjusted182 511Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes628 1,774Tax rate (as adjusted for discrete tax charge in 2013)29.0% 28.8%Working CapitalManagement uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the Company. Net working capital as of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 is summarized as follows:The increase in net working capital as of September 30, 2014 is primarily due to lower short-term debt resulting from $1.1 billion net repayments of commercial paper and repayment of $800 million of 5.15% redeemable notes in April 2014.Cash and equivalents totaled approximately $4.8 billion as of September 30, 2014 and $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2013, primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries and may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the U.S. Cash balances held internationally are typically used for international operating needs, reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses, used to fund new international acquisitions, or used to repay debt held internationally, including the €750 million of 5.25% Euro notes which matured on October 1, 2014. In the U.S., the Company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs which primarily consist of dividend payments, share repurchases, acquisitions, servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs. The Company also uses its commercial paper program, which is backed by long-term credit facilities, for short-term liquidity needs. The Company believes cash generated domestically and liquidity provided by the Company's commercial paper program will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the U.S.29DebtTotal debt as of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was as follows:Short-term debt as of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 included €750 million of 5.25% Euro notes due October 1, 2014, which were paid on the due date, and commercial paper of $503 million and $1.7 billion, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2013, short-term debt included $800 million of 5.15% redeemable notes due April 1, 2014, which were repaid on the due date. In February 2014, the Company issued $650 million of 0.9% notes due February 25, 2017 at 99.861% of face value, $650 million of 1.95% notes due March 1, 2019 at 99.871% of face value, and $700 million of 3.5% notes due March 1, 2024 at 99.648% of face value. Net proceeds from the February 2014 debt issuances were used to repay commercial paper.In May 2014, the Company issued €500 million of 1.75% Euro notes due May 20, 2022 at 99.16% of face value and €500 million of 3.0% Euro notes due May 19, 2034 at 98.089% of face value. The carrying value of the Euro notes were $626 million and $620 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2014. Net proceeds from the May 2014 debt issuances were used for general corporate purposes.Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDAThe Company uses the ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. The Company believes that total debt to adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA and the ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. The ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA represents total debt divided by income from continuing operations before interest expense, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis.Total debt to adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve month periods ended September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was as follows:30Stockholders’ EquityThe changes to stockholders’ equity during 2014 were as follows:(In millions) Total stockholders’ equity, December 31, 2013$9,709Net income2,496Cash dividends declared(530)Repurchases of common stock(3,475)Stock option and restricted stock activity132Foreign currency translation adjustments(537)Other6Total stockholders’ equity, September 30, 2014$7,801FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
