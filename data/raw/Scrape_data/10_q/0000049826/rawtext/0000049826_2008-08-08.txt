Assets of $144,700,000 and liabilities of $5,100,000 related to the two businesses held for sale as of June 30, 2008 have been classified as prepaids and other current assets and accrued expenses, respectively.

The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. In the first quarter of each year, the Company performs an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives based on the fair value of the related operating segment or intangible asset.      As of January 1, 2008, the Company had assigned its recorded goodwill and intangible assets to 59 of its 60 operating segments. When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company compares the fair value of each operating segment to its carrying value. Fair values are determined primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows at an estimated cost of capital of 10%. Estimated future cash flows are based either on current operating cash flows or on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant operating segment. When the discounted cash flow method is not solely representative of fair value, the Company may also employ additional valuation techniques, such as market comparables. If the fair value of an operating segment is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value of the operating segments goodwill and the carrying value of the goodwill.   In the first quarter of 2008, the Company performed its annual impairment testing of its goodwill and intangible assets, which resulted in total impairment charges of $98,590,000. The first quarter 2008 goodwill impairment charge of $97,152,000 related to the Companys worldwide software business in the All Other segment. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by the combination of lower forecasts for this business and lower market driven multiples that were being paid for similar businesses.        (5)   RETIREMENT PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS      On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted the measurement date provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) ("SFAS 158"), which required the Company to change its measurement date to correspond with the Company's fiscal year end. The Company previously used a September 30 measurement date. As allowed under SFAS 158, the Company elected to remeasure its plan assets and benefit obligations as of the beginning of the fiscal year. Upon adoption, the Company recorded an after-tax charge of $12,788,000 to beginning retained earnings and an after-tax gain to accumulated other comprehensive income of $3,573,000 related to the three months ended December 31, 2007.   Pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the periods ended June 30, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:       (In thousands)       Three Months Ended June 30       Six Months Ended June 30                 Pension       Other Postretirement Benefits       Pension       Other Postretirement Benefits                 2008       2007       2008       2007       2008       2007       2008       2007         Components of net periodic benefit cost:                                                                                                         Service cost       $   28,060       $   28,698       $   3,585       $   3,782       $   56,009       $   57,365       $   7,170       $   7,564         Interest cost           30,223           26,548           8,217           8,058           60,319           52,962           16,433           16,116         Expected return on plan assets           (42,283   )       (38,856   )       (3,848   )       (2,899   )       (84,536   )       (77,575   )       (7,696   )       (5,797   )     Amortization of actuarial (gain)                                                                                                          loss           651           5,086           (252   )       506           1,289           9,983           (504   )       1,011         Amortization of prior service                                                                                                         (income) cost           (600   )       (586   )       1,565           1,565           (1,202   )       (1,174   )       3,130           3,130         Amortization of net transition                                                                                                         amount           24           4                                 45           10                               Settlement (gain)  loss                      262           (1,929   )       (1,562   )                  6,000           (1,929   )       (1,562   )     Net periodic benefit cost       $   16,075       $   21,156       $   7,338       $   9,450       $   31,924       $   47,571       $   16,604       $   20,462          The Company expects to contribute $44,400,000 to its pension plans and $60,100,000 to its other postretirement plans in 2008. As of June 30, 2008, contributions of $21,100,000 to pension plans and $33,100,000 to other postretirement plans have been made.       (6)   SHORT-TERM DEBT      In June 2007, the Company entered into a $1,000,000,000 Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 13, 2008. This line of credit was replaced on June 13, 2008 by a $1,500,000,000 Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 12, 2009. No amounts were outstanding under this facility at June 30, 2008.   The Company had outstanding commercial paper of $733,436,000 at June 30, 2008 and $200,977,000 at December 31, 2007.   In 1999, the Company issued $500,000,000 of 5.75% redeemable notes due March 1, 2009. The balance related to these notes outstanding at June 30, 2008 has been classified as short-term debt. The balance outstanding at December 31, 2007 was classified as long-term debt.

In the first six months of 2008, the Company repurchased 11,780,202 shares of its common stock at an average price of $49.71 per share. In February 2008, the Company retired 32,425,297 shares of common stock held in treasury.       (8)   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES      The Company has an estimated potential liability for European transfer taxes of up to approximately $57,000,000 related to legal entity reorganizations. The ultimate resolution of this liability will be dependent upon the determination of whether or not such transfers are deemed to have occurred and whether such taxes are applicable to transfers that occurred outside of Europe. A reserve of $32,000,000 has been recorded for this matter as of June 30, 2008.       (9)   INCOME TAXES      The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. and in various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions and a number of these audits are currently ongoing.   As part of the Australia audit for 2003, the Australian Tax Office is reviewing an intercompany financing transaction between the U.S. and Australia. In the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service has completed its audits for the years 2001-2005 and has proposed several adjustments which the Company is protesting, the most significant of which is related to leveraged leases. The Company has recorded its best estimate of the exposure for these two audits; however, it is reasonably possible that the Company will resolve the Australian financing and leveraged lease issues within the next 12 months and that the amount of the Companys unrecognized tax benefits may change by a range of approximately a $131 million decrease to a $90 million increase.

Item 2 - Managements Discussion and Analysis   CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   The Companys consolidated results of operations for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2008 and 2007 were as follows:          In the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:               Three Months Ended June 30       Six Months Ended June 30             % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)       % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)                 Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins       Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins         Base manufacturing business:                                                         Revenue change/Operating                                                         leverage          %   0.1   %      %   0.2   %   0.5   %      %     Changes in variable margins and                                                         overhead costs              1.4       0.3              0.9       0.2         Total              1.5       0.3       0.2       1.4       0.2                                                                   Acquisitions and divestitures       4.2       2.5       (0.3   )   5.2       1.6       (0.5   )     Restructuring costs              (1.3   )   (0.2   )                          Impairment of goodwill and                                                          intangibles                                   (7.6   )   (1.2   )     Translation       6.4       6.1              5.6       5.6       0.1         Other       (0.1   )                 (0.1   )                   Total       10.5   %   8.8   %   (0.2   )%   10.9   %   1.0   %   (1.4   )%      Operating Revenues Revenues increased 10.5% and 10.9% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2008, respectively, versus 2007 primarily due to the favorable effect of currency translation from the weakening dollar and revenues from acquisitions. Total base revenues were flat in the second quarter and increased 0.2% year-to-date. International base revenues increased 2.6% in the second quarter and 3.4% year-to-date periods, partially offset by a 1.8% and 2.3% decline, respectively, in North American base revenues. The Companys Asia Pacific end markets continue to experience strong growth while Europe showed moderate growth. North American revenues continue to be negatively impacted by declines in the residential construction and automotive sectors as well as weak industrial production.    Operating Income Operating income in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2008 increased 8.8% and 1.0%, respectively, versus the same periods of 2007 primarily due to the positive effect of currency translation and income from acquired businesses. Year-to-date income was negatively impacted by a first quarter 2008 impairment charge of $97.2 million related to the goodwill of a worldwide software business. Total operating margins decreased 0.2% and 1.4% for the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to the first quarter impairment charge and lower margins of acquired companies partially offset by lower overhead expense at base businesses due to tighter cost controls.       The reconciliation of segment operating revenues to total operating revenues is as follows:        INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING   Businesses in this segment produce steel, plastic and paper products used for bundling, shipping and protecting transported goods.       In the Industrial Packaging segment, products include:        steel and plastic strapping and related tools and equipment;        plastic stretch film and related equipment;        paper and plastic products that protect goods in transit; and        metal jacketing and other insulation products.      This segment primarily serves the primary metals, general industrial, construction, and food and beverage markets.   The results of operations for the Industrial Packaging segment for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2008 and 2007 were as follows:             In the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:               Three Months Ended June 30       Six Months Ended June 30             % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)       % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)                 Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins       Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins         Base manufacturing business:                                                         Revenue change/Operating                                                         leverage       0.7   %   2.0   %   0.2   %   0.7   %   2.3   %   0.2   %     Changes in variable margins and                                                         overhead costs              5.1       0.7              (0.3   )            Total       0.7       7.1       0.9       0.7       2.0       0.2                                                                   Acquisitions and divestitures       5.5       0.5       (0.7   )   5.3       1.0       (0.5   )     Restructuring costs              0.7       0.1              1.0       0.1         Translation       8.4       9.0              7.6       8.3       0.1         Other                                                   Total       14.6   %   17.3   %   0.3   %   13.6   %   12.3   %   (0.1   )%      Operating Revenues Revenues increased 14.6% and 13.6% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2008, respectively, over the same periods of 2007 primarily due to the favorable effect of currency translation and revenues from acquired companies. The increase in acquisition revenue was primarily related to the purchase of a European industrial packaging business and a European stretch packaging business. Total base revenues increased modestly for the current quarter and year-to-date periods as declines in the strapping and equipment businesses were offset with strong growth in the worldwide insulation businesses due to penetration in emerging markets.   Operating Income Operating income increased 17.3% and 12.3% for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2008 versus 2007 primarily due to the favorable effect of currency translation, lower overhead costs and the positive leverage effect of the increase in base revenues. Operating margins in the second quarter were favorably impacted by lower overhead costs as a result of tighter cost controls and the benefits of prior year restructuring projects partially offset by raw material price increases.   POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS   Businesses in this segment produce equipment and consumables associated with specialty power conversion, metallurgy and electronics.       In the Power Systems & Electronics segment, products include:        arc welding equipment;        metal arc welding consumables and related accessories;        metal solder materials for PC board fabrication;        equipment and services for microelectronics assembly;        electronic components and component packaging; and        airport ground support equipment.           This segment primarily serves the general industrial, electronics and construction markets.   The results of operations for the Power Systems & Electronics segment for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2008 and 2007 were as follows:        In the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:               Three Months Ended June 30       Six Months Ended June 30             % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)       % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)                 Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins       Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins         Base manufacturing business:                                                         Revenue change/Operating                                                         leverage       7.7   %   14.4   %   1.3   %   4.3   %   7.9   %   0.7   %     Changes in variable margins and                                                         overhead costs              3.9       0.8              4.0       0.8         Total       7.7       18.3       2.1       4.3       11.9       1.5                                                                   Acquisitions and divestitures       3.7       1.0       (0.6   )   2.8       1.1       (0.4   )     Restructuring costs              0.3       0.1                              Impairment of goodwill and                                                         intangibles                                   (0.4   )   (0.1   )     Translation       3.4       2.8       (0.1   )   2.8       2.3       (0.1   )     Other                     (0.1   )   0.1       0.1       0.1         Total       14.8   %   22.4   %   1.4   %   10.0   %   15.0   %   1.0   %      Operating Revenues Revenues increased 14.8% and 10.0% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2008, respectively, over the same periods of 2007 primarily due to an increase in base revenues, revenues from acquired companies and the positive effect of currency translation.  Base revenues grew 7.7% and 4.3% for the second quarter and year-to-date periods primarily due to a 25.2% and 21.8% increase in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, in international welding businesses due to stronger demand in energy and shipping end markets. North American base revenues increased 3.3% and 0.8% during the same periods. Base revenues for the PC board fabrication businesses increased 6.9% and 1.2 % in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to the ability to implement price increases. The growth in acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a PC board fabrication business and a welding accessories business.   Operating Income Operating income increased 22.4% and 15.0% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2008, respectively, over the same periods of 2007 primarily due to the positive leverage effect from the increase in base revenues, reduced operating expenses, the favorable effect of currency translation, and income from acquired companies. Total operating margins increased 1.4% and 1.0% for the quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to leverage from the increase in revenue, improved margins at the PC board fabrication businesses resulting from prior year restructuring and improved variable margins.

Acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchases of a worldwide components business and an automotive aftermarket business. Base revenues for the North American automotive businesses declined 12.8% and 8.9% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, due to a 21.4% and 17.4% decline in automotive production at the Detroit 3 automotive manufacturers in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively. International automotive base revenues were flat in the second quarter and increased 2.6% year-to-date primarily due to increased European automotive production. Base revenues for the automotive aftermarket businesses increased 5.7% and 4.9% for the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to growth in sales to Asian end markets.      Operating Income Operating income decreased 6.9% and was flat for the second quarter and year to-date periods, respectively, over the same periods of 2007 primarily due to the negative leverage effect of the decrease in base revenues described above, higher restructuring costs and increased operating expenses, partially offset by the favorable effect of currency translation and income from acquired businesses. Base margins declined in the second quarter and year-to-date periods due to the decline in revenue, higher raw material costs and price pressure, and unfavorable product mix issues in the automotive aftermarket businesses.

Base revenues for the North American construction businesses decreased 12.4% and 15.0% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, due to the ongoing weakness in the North American residential construction market. Notably, housing starts declined an annualized 30.4% and commercial construction fell 19.6% year-to-date. Internationally, base revenue increased 1.7% and 2.7% for the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to strong residential and commercial demand in the Australasian region, offset by weaker European demand.   Operating Income Operating income decreased 3.5% and 3.8% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2008, respectively, over the same periods of 2007 primarily due to the negative leverage effect from the decline in base revenues described above in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, partially offset by the favorable effect of currency translation and lower restructuring expenses. Base margins declined in both periods primarily due to the revenue decreases and an increase in European selling expenses, partially offset by the benefit of prior year North American restructuring projects.

The acquired revenues were primarily attributable to the acquisition of two worldwide food processing equipment businesses and a European food equipment business. International base revenues grew 3.8% and 7.1% for the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to strong European and Asian end market demand. North American base revenue increased 2.0% and 2.1% during the same periods primarily due to higher service revenues and increased demand in the institutional and restaurant sectors.   Operating Income Operating income increased 11.1% and 6.7% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2008, respectively, over the same periods of 2007 as a result of the positive effect of leverage from the revenue increases described above, income from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by increased operating expenses and higher restructuring costs. Base business margins declined due to competitive price pressure and higher warranty expenses in the food processing equipment businesses, and increased operating expenses in the service businesses.

North American laminate base revenue increased 0.7% and 0.4% for the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to product penetration in the premium high definition laminate product line. These increases were offset by second quarter and year-to-date double digit base revenue declines in the flooring businesses primarily due to declines in the residential construction market. International base revenues grew 0.3% and 2.2% for the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to strong demand in the Asian end markets.   Operating Income Operating income decreased 0.5% in the second quarter of 2008 and increased 6.2% for the year-to-date period over the same periods of 2007. For the second quarter, the decrease in income and operating margin is primarily due to the negative leverage effect from the decrease in revenues described above. For the year-to-date period, income increased primarily due to favorable currency translation, lower overhead expense and leverage from the increase in base revenues and lower overhead expense due to 2007 selling expenses related to a new product launch.

The results of operations for the All Other segment for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2008 and 2007 were as follows:          In the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:               Three Months Ended June 30       Six Months Ended June 30             % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)       % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)                 Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins       Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins         Base manufacturing business:                                                         Revenue change/Operating                                                         Leverage       (0.9   )%   (2.2   )%   (0.3   )%   (1.2   )%   (3.2   )%   (0.4   )%     Changes in variable margins and                                                         overhead costs              3.8       0.7              6.7       1.2         Total       (0.9   )   1.6       0.4       (1.2   )   3.5       0.8                                                                   Acquisitions and divestitures       1.1       (0.2   )   (0.3   )   3.5       1.1       (0.2   )     Restructuring costs              (0.2   )                 0.2                Impairment of goodwill and                                                         intangibles                                   (34.7   )   (6.3   )     Translation       4.8       5.3       0.1       4.3       4.9       0.3         Other       0.1       (0.1   )                        0.1         Total       5.1   %   6.4   %   0.2   %   6.6   %   (25.0   )%   (5.3   )%           Operating Revenues Revenues increased 5.1% and 6.6% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2008, respectively, versus the same periods of 2007 primarily due to the favorable effect of currency translation and revenues from acquired companies. The increase in acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of two test and measurement businesses, two decorating and graphics businesses, an industrial software business, and a label business. Total base revenues declined 0.9% in the second quarter, primarily due to a 4.6% and 1.5% decline in the industrial and appliance businesses and consumer packaging businesses, respectively, partially offset by an increase of 9.0% in the test and measurement businesses. The 1.2% decline in the year-to-date period was primarily due to a 9.2% increase in the test and measurement businesses, offset by a 6.4% and 1.3% decline in the industrial appliance finishing businesses and consumer packaging businesses, respectively. The test and measurement businesses benefited from a strong backlog at the end of 2007 and new product introductions.   Operating Income Operating income increased 6.4% in the second quarter of 2008 primarily due to currency translation, partially offset by the negative effect of leverage from the decrease in base revenue discussed above. Operating income decreased 25.0% for the year-to-date period primarily due to the first quarter 2008 goodwill impairment charge related to a worldwide software business. In addition, lower operating expenses, as a result of tighter cost controls and the benefits of prior year restructuring projects, and the favorable effect of currency translation partially offset the declines.   AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS   The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. In the first quarter of each year, the Company performs an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives based on the fair value of the related operating segment or intangible asset.   As of January 1, 2008, the Company had assigned its recorded goodwill and intangible assets to 59 of its 60 operating segments. When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company compares the fair value of each operating segment to its carrying value. Fair values are determined primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows at an estimated cost of capital of 10%. Estimated future cash flows are based either on current operating cash flows or on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant operating segment. When the discounted cash flow method is not solely representative of fair value, the Company may also employ additional valuation techniques, such as market comparables. If the fair value of an operating segment is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value of the operating segments goodwill and the carrying value of the goodwill.   In the first quarter of 2008, the Company performed its annual impairment testing of its goodwill and intangible assets, which resulted in total impairment charges of $98.6 million. The first quarter 2008 goodwill impairment charge of $97.2 million related to the Companys worldwide software business in the All Other segment. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by the combination of lower forecasts for this business and lower market driven multiples that were being paid for similar businesses.    INTEREST EXPENSE   Interest expense increased to $74.1 million in the first six months of 2008 from $50.0 million in the first six months of 2007 primarily due to interest on the 5.25% Euro notes issued in October 2007.   OTHER INCOME   Other income decreased to $2.8 million for the first six months of 2008 versus income of $37.1 million in 2007, primarily due to a first quarter 2008 charge for European transfer taxes related to legal entity structuring transactions and lower investment income. These amounts were partially offset by higher interest income in 2008 earned on short-term investments, and lower currency translation losses in 2008 versus 2007.    INCOME TAXES   The effective tax rate for the first six months of 2008 was 31.16% compared to 30.83% for the first six months of 2007. The increase in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from the impairment of non-deductible goodwill in the first quarter of 2008. Excluding the impairment, the Companys effective tax rate for the first six months was 29.01%. The reduction in the effective tax rate, excluding the impairment, resulted primarily from a higher proportionate share of income in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates.   INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS   Income from continuing operations of $829.8 million ($1.57 per diluted share) in the first six months of 2008 was 4.1% lower than the 2007 income from continuing operations of $865.4 million ($1.54 per diluted share).       FOREIGN CURRENCY   The weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in 2008 increased operating revenues for the first six months of 2008 by approximately $450 million and increased earnings by approximately 9 cents per diluted share. The weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in 2007 increased operating revenues for the first six months of 2007 by approximately $228 million and increased earnings by approximately 5 cents per diluted share.   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS   In the first six months of 2007, the Company completed the divestitures of a consumer packaging business and an automotive machinery business which resulted in an after-tax gain of $41.2 million. As of June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, the Company also classified a separate consumer packaging business and an automotive components business as held for sale. The operating results of these businesses, along with the gains realized, net of tax, have been presented as discontinued operations. Assets of $144.7 million and liabilities of $5.1 million related to the two businesses held for sale as of June 30, 2008, have been classified as prepaids and other current assets and accrued expenses, respectively.   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted the measurement date provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans-an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) ("SFAS 158"), which required the Company to change its measurement date to correspond with the Company's fiscal year end. The Company previously used a September 30 measurement date. As allowed under SFAS 158, the Company elected to remeasure its plan assets and benefit obligations as of the beginning of the fiscal year. Upon adoption, the Company recorded an after-tax charge of $12.8 million to beginning retained earnings and an after-tax gain to accumulated other comprehensive income of $3.6 million, related to the three months ended December 31, 2007.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   Cash Flow   The Companys primary source of liquidity is free operating cash flow. Management continues to believe that such internally generated cash flow will be adequate to service debt and to continue to pay dividends that meet its dividend payout guideline of 25% to 35% of the last two years average income from continuing operations. In addition, free operating cash flow is expected to be adequate to finance internal growth, acquisitions and share repurchases.   Free operating cash flow is used to measure normal cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.   Summarized cash flow information for the second quarter of 2008 and 2007 was as follows:            On August 20, 2007 the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, which provides for the buyback of up to $3.0 billion of the Companys common stock over an open-ended period of time. In the first six months of 2008, the Company repurchased 11.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $49.71 per share. There are approximately $2.0 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under this program.   Return on Average Invested Capital   The Company uses return on average invested capital (ROIC) to measure the effectiveness of its operations use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC for the second quarter of 2008 and 2007 was as follows:        The 170 basis point decrease in ROIC for year-to-date 2008 was the result of average invested capital increasing 11.0% while after-tax operating income increased only 0.5%, primarily due to the $97.2 million impairment of mostly non-tax deductible goodwill in the first quarter of 2008.   Working Capital   Net working capital at June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007 is summarized as follows:        Trade receivables and inventories increased primarily as a result of increased sales, acquisitions and foreign currency translation. Short-term debt increased due to the 5.75% redeemable notes becoming current, as well as an increase in commercial paper to fund stock repurchases and dividend payments in excess of operating cash flows. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased primarily as a result of acquisitions and foreign currency translation.       Debt   Total debt at June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007 was as follows:        The Company had outstanding commercial paper of $733.4 million at June 30, 2008 and $201.0 million at December 31, 2007.   In 1999, the Company issued $500.0 million of 5.75% redeemable notes due March 1, 2009. The balance related to these notes outstanding at June 30, 2008 was classified as short-term debt. The balance outstanding at December 31, 2007 was classified as long-term debt.   In June 2007, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 13, 2008. This line of credit was replaced on June 13, 2008 by a $1.5 billion Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 12, 2009. No amounts were outstanding under this facility at June 30, 2008.
