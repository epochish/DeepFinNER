In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in the Company’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform with current year reporting.Operating Revenue— Prior to 2018, the Company recognized revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed, product had shipped and the risks and rewards of ownership had transferred or services had been rendered, the price to the customer was fixed or determinable, and collectibility was reasonably assured, which generally occurred at the time of product shipment. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted new revenue recognition guidance. Under this new guidance, operating revenue is recognized at the time a good or service is transferred to a customer and the customer obtains control of that good or receives the service performed. The Company's sales arrangements with customers are predominantly short-term in nature involving a single performance obligation related to the delivery of products and generally provide for transfer of control at the time of shipment. In limited circumstances, arrangements may include service performed over time, or there may be significant obligations to the customer that are unfulfilled at the time of shipment, typically involving installation of equipment and customer acceptance. In these circumstances, operating revenue may be recognized over time as the service is provided to the customer or deferred until all significant obligations have been completed. The amount of operating revenue recorded reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for goods or services and may include adjustments for customer allowances and rebates. Customer allowances and rebates consist primarily of volume discounts and other short-term incentive programs, which are estimated at the time of sale based on historical experience and anticipated trends. Shipping and handling charges billed to customers are included in revenue and are recognized along with the related product revenue as they are considered a fulfillment cost. Sales commissions are expensed when incurred, which is generally at the time of revenue recognition. Contract liabilities associated with sales arrangements primarily relate to deferred revenue on equipment sales and prepaid service contracts. Total deferred revenue was $254 million and $205 million as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and is short-term in nature. For additional information regarding the Company's operating revenue, see New Accounting Pronouncements below and Note 2. Operating Revenue.New Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for revenue recognition. The core principle of the new guidance is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, expanded revenue disclosures are required. The Company's sales arrangements with customers are predominantly short-term in nature and generally provide for transfer of control and risks and rewards of ownership at the time of product shipment or delivery of service. As such, the timing of revenue recognition under both the prior and new guidance is the same for the majority of the Company’s transactions. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue guidance under the modified retrospective method and recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment reducing retained earnings by $9 million as of January 1, 2018. Under the modified retrospective method of adoption, prior periods are not restated and the new guidance is applied prospectively to revenue transactions completed on or after January 1, 2018. Given the nature of the Company’s revenue transactions, the new guidance had an immaterial impact on the Company's operating revenue, results of operations, and financial position for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The Company updated its revenue recognition accounting policy to reflect the requirements of the new guidance and included additional disclosures regarding the Company's revenue transactions.  Refer to the Company’s operating revenue accounting policy above and Note 2. Operating Revenue for additional information.In October 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance requiring the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs rather than when transferred to a third party as required under the prior guidance. The provisions of the new guidance will be applied prospectively to intra-entity asset transfers on or after January 1, 2018 and may result in future tax rate volatility. Upon adoption of the new guidance on January 1, 2018, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment reducing deferred tax assets and retained earnings by $406 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the impact of the new guidance on the Company's effective income tax rate was not material.7In March 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which changes the income statement presentation of net periodic benefit cost related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The primary change under the new guidance is that only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost should be included in operating income and is eligible for capitalization as an asset. The other components of net periodic benefit cost ("other net periodic benefit cost"), including interest cost, expected return on assets, settlements, curtailments, and amortization of actuarial gains and losses and prior service cost, should be presented below operating income. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new presentation of other net periodic benefit cost and restated the prior year statement of income and related disclosures for comparability, as required under the new guidance. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, other net periodic benefit cost was income of $5 million and $2 million, respectively, and was presented in Other income (expense) in both periods. Refer to Note 5. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits for additional information.In February 2018, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which allows for an optional one-time reclassification of the stranded tax effects resulting from the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate under the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (the "Act") from accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") to retained earnings. The guidance is effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to early adopt this guidance as of January 1, 2018 and to reclassify the stranded tax effects related to the Act, which resulted in an increase of $45 million to both retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive loss. Refer to Note 7. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for additional information.In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for recognizing leasing transactions. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize a lease liability and right-of-use lease asset for all leases with a lease term greater than twelve months, including operating leases, in the statement of financial position. Subsequent measurement, including presentation of expenses and cash flows, will depend on the classification of the lease as either a financing or operating lease. In addition, expanded disclosures will be required. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. While the Company has not yet completed its evaluation of the impact the new lease accounting guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, the Company expects to recognize right-of-use assets and liabilities for its operating leases in the statement of financial position upon adoption.(2)    Operating RevenueThe Company's 85 diversified operating divisions are organized and managed based on similar product offerings and end markets, and are reported to senior management as the following seven segments: Automotive OEM; Food Equipment; Test & Measurement and Electronics; Welding; Polymers & Fluids; Construction Products; and Specialty Products. Operating revenue by product category, which is consistent with the Company's segment presentation, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows:8Prior to 2018, the Company recognized revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed, product had shipped and the risks and rewards of ownership had transferred or services had been rendered, the price to the customer was fixed or determinable, and collectibility was reasonably assured, which generally occurred at the time of product shipment. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted new revenue recognition guidance. Under this new guidance, operating revenue is recognized at the time a good or service is transferred to a customer and the customer obtains control of that good or receives the service performed. Given the nature of the Company’s revenue transactions, the new guidance had an immaterial impact on the Company's operating revenue, results of operations, and financial position for the three months ended March 31, 2018. See Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies for additional information. The following is a description of the product offerings, end markets and typical revenue transactions for each of the Company's seven segments:Automotive OEM— This segment is a global, niche supplier to top tier OEMs, providing unique innovation to address pain points for sophisticated customers with complex problems. Businesses in this segment produce components and fasteners for automotive-related applications. This segment primarily serves the automotive original equipment manufacturers and tiers market. Products in this segment include:•plastic and metal components, fasteners and assemblies for automobiles, light trucks and other industrial uses.Products sold in this segment are primarily manufactured to the customer's specifications and are sold under long-term supply agreements with OEM auto manufacturers and other top tier auto parts suppliers. The Company typically recognizes revenue for products in this segment at the time of shipment. Certain products may be produced utilizing tooling that is owned by the customer that the Company developed and is reimbursed by the customer for the associated cost. In these arrangements, the Company typically retains a contractual right to use the customer-owned tooling for the purpose of fulfilling its obligations under the supply agreement. The Company records reimbursements for the cost of customer-owned tooling as a cost offset rather than operating revenue as tooling is not considered a product offering central to the Company's operations.Food Equipment— This segment is a highly focused and branded industry-leader in commercial food equipment differentiated by innovation and integrated service offerings. This segment primarily serves the food service, food institutional/restaurant and food retail markets. Products in this segment include:•warewashing equipment;•cooking equipment, including ovens, ranges and broilers;•refrigeration equipment, including refrigerators, freezers and prep tables;•food processing equipment, including slicers, mixers and scales;•kitchen exhaust, ventilation and pollution control systems; and•food equipment service, maintenance and repair.Revenue for equipment sold in this segment is typically recognized at the time of product shipment. In limited circumstances involving installation of equipment and customer acceptance, the Company may recognize revenue upon completion of installation and acceptance by the customer. Annual service contracts are typically sold separate from equipment and the related revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the annual service period. Operating revenue for on-demand service repairs and parts is recorded upon completion and customer acceptance of the work performed.Test & Measurement and Electronics— This segment is a branded and innovative producer of test and measurement and electronic manufacturing and maintenance, repair, and operations, or "MRO" solutions that improve efficiency and quality for customers in diverse end markets. Businesses in this segment produce equipment, consumables, and related software for testing and measuring of materials and structures, as well as equipment and consumables used in the production of electronic subassemblies and microelectronics.

This segment primarily serves the automotive aftermarket, general industrial, MRO and construction markets. Products in this segment include:•adhesives for industrial, construction and consumer purposes; •chemical fluids which clean or add lubrication to machines;•epoxy and resin-based coating products for industrial applications;•hand wipes and cleaners for industrial applications;•fluids, polymers and other supplies for auto aftermarket maintenance and appearance;•fillers and putties for auto body repair; and•polyester coatings and patch and repair products for the marine industry.Products in this segment are primarily manufactured to meet anticipated customer demand. The Company typically recognizes revenue for these products at the time of product shipment.Construction Products— This segment is a branded supplier of innovative engineered fastening systems and solutions. This segment primarily serves the residential construction, renovation/remodel and commercial construction markets. Products in this segment include:•fasteners and related fastening tools for wood and metal applications;•anchors, fasteners and related tools for concrete applications; •metal plate truss components and related equipment and software; and•packaged hardware, fasteners, anchors and other products for retail.Products in this segment are primarily manufactured to meet anticipated customer demand. The Company typically recognizes revenue for these products at the time of product shipment.Specialty Products— This segment is focused on diversified niche market opportunities with substantial patent protection producing beverage packaging equipment and consumables, product coding and marking equipment and consumables, and appliance components and fasteners. This segment primarily serves the food and beverage, consumer durables, general industrial, printing and publishing and industrial capital goods markets. Products in this segment include: •line integration, conveyor systems and line automation for the food and beverage industries;•plastic consumables that multi-pack cans and bottles and related equipment;•foil, film and related equipment used to decorate consumer products;•product coding and marking equipment and related consumables;•plastic and metal fasteners and components for appliances;•airport ground support equipment; and•components for medical devices.Products in this segment are primarily manufactured to meet anticipated customer demand. The Company typically recognizes revenue for these products at the time of product shipment. In limited circumstances where significant obligations to the customer are unfulfilled at the time of shipment, typically involving installation of equipment and customer acceptance, revenue is recognized when such obligations have been completed.(3)    Income TaxesThe Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was 23.2% and 28.3%, respectively. The first quarter 2018 effective tax rate was lower primarily as a result of the lower U.S. corporate federal tax rate and a discrete income tax benefit of $14 million related to foreign tax credits. Additionally, the effective tax rate for both respective periods included discrete income tax benefits of $6 million and $12 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.On December 22, 2017, the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (the “Act”) was enacted in the United States. The provisions of the Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax rules. At December 31, 2017, the Company had not completed the accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Act; however, the Company made a reasonable estimate of the effects on the existing deferred tax balances and one-time transition tax. The Company continues to analyze certain aspects of the Act and may refine its calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of the amounts recorded at December 31, 2017. The provisional amounts recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017, and unchanged at March 31, 2018, reflect the Company’s best estimate based on information currently available and are subject to future changes due to subsequent clarification of the tax law and refinement of estimated amounts. The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions, including the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, German Fiscal Authority, French Fiscal Authority, and Australian Tax Office, and a number of these audits are currently ongoing, which may increase the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits in future periods. Due to the ongoing audits, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the amount of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits may be decreased by approximately $33 million related predominantly to various intercompany transactions. The Company has recorded its best estimate of the potential exposure for these issues.On February 18, 2014, the Company received a Notice of Deficiency (“NOD”) from the IRS asserting that a non-taxable return of capital received from a subsidiary was a taxable dividend distribution. The NOD assesses additional taxes of $70 million for the 2006 tax year, plus interest and penalties. In May 2014, the Company petitioned the United States Tax Court to challenge the NOD. The Company's petition was subsequently denied and the case proceeded to court with the trial taking place in the third quarter of 2016. Final decision by the tax court is expected in 2018. Although the court's final decision cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes its position continues to be supportable. Accordingly, no reserve has been recorded related to this matter.(4)    InventoriesInventories as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were as follows:10(5)    Pension and Other Postretirement BenefitsPension and other postretirement benefit costs for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, Pension Other Postretirement BenefitsIn millions2018 2017 2018 2017Components of net periodic benefit cost:       Service cost$15 $16 $2 $2Interest cost18 18 5 5Expected return on plan assets(32) (33) (6) (6)Amortization of actuarial loss (gain)11 14 (1) —Total net periodic benefit cost$12 $15 $— $1The service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented within Cost of revenue and Selling, administrative, and research and development expenses in the statement of income while the other components of net periodic benefit cost are  presented within Other income (expense).The Company expects to contribute approximately $26 million to its pension plans and $5 million to its other postretirement benefit plans in 2018. As of March 31, 2018, contributions of $12 million to pension plans and $2 million to other postretirement benefit plans have been made.(6)    DebtShort-term debt included commercial paper of $10 million and $849 million as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. In addition, in the first quarter of 2018, the Company reclassified $649 million related to the 1.95% notes due March 1, 2019 from Long-term debt to Short-term debt.The approximate fair value and related carrying value of the Company's total long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt presented as short-term debt, as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were as follows:The approximate fair values of the Company's long-term debt, including current maturities, were based on a valuation model using Level 2 observable inputs which included market rates for comparable instruments for the respective periods.11(7)    Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)The following table summarizes changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017: Three Months Ended March 31,In millions20182017Beginning balance$(1,287) $(1,807)    Adoption of new accounting guidance related to reclassification of certain tax effects(45) —    Foreign currency translation adjustments during the period69 144Income taxes14 10Total foreign currency translation adjustments, net of tax83 154    Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments during the period1 —Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income10 14Income taxes(2) (4)Total pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments, net of tax9 10    Ending balance$(1,240) $(1,643)Effective January 1, 2018, the Company elected to early adopt new accounting guidance related to the stranded tax effects resulting from the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate under the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (the "Act") and reclassified $45 million of stranded income tax effects from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Retained earnings. Refer to Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies for additional information.Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income relate primarily to the amortization of actuarial losses. Refer to Note 5. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits for additional information.The Company designated the €1.0 billion of Euro notes issued in May 2015 and the €1.0 billion of Euro notes issued in May 2014 as hedges of a portion of its net investment in Euro-denominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations. The carrying values of the 2015 and 2014 Euro notes were $1.2 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, as of March 31, 2018. Changes in the value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate have been recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The unrealized pre-tax gain recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the net investment hedge was $22 million and $81 million as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.The ending balance of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of March 31, 2018 and 2017 consisted of cumulative translation adjustment losses, net of tax, of $902 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, and unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefits costs, net of tax, of $338 million and $395 million, respectively.(8)    Segment InformationThe Company's operations are organized and managed based on similar product offerings and end markets, and are reported to senior management as the following seven segments: Automotive OEM; Food Equipment; Test & Measurement and Electronics; Welding; Polymers & Fluids; Construction Products; and Specialty Products. Refer to Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information regarding operating revenue and operating income for the Company's segments.12ITEM 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsINTRODUCTIONIllinois Tool Works Inc. (the "Company" or "ITW") is a global manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with 85 divisions in 55 countries. As of December 31, 2017, the Company employed approximately 50,000 people.The Company's operations are organized and managed based on similar product offerings and end markets, and are reported to senior management as the following seven segments: Automotive OEM; Food Equipment; Test & Measurement and Electronics; Welding; Polymers & Fluids; Construction Products; and Specialty Products.Due to the large number of diverse businesses and the Company's decentralized operating structure, the Company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results. Instead, the Company's corporate management collects data on several key measurements: operating revenue, operating income, operating margin, overhead costs, number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested capital. These key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management.THE ITW BUSINESS MODELThe powerful and highly differentiated ITW Business Model is the Company’s core source of value creation. This business model is the Company’s competitive advantage and defines how ITW creates value for its shareholders and comprises three unique elements:•ITW’s 80/20 front to back process is the operating system that is applied in every ITW business. Initially introduced as a manufacturing efficiency tool in the 1980s, ITW has continually refined, improved and expanded 80/20 into a proprietary, holistic business management process that generates significant value for the Company and its customers. Through the application of data-driven insights generated by 80/20 practice, ITW focuses on its largest and best opportunities (the “80”) and eliminates cost, complexity and distractions associated with the less profitable opportunities (the “20”). 80/20 enables ITW businesses to consistently achieve world-class operational excellence in product availability, quality, and innovation, while generating superior financial performance;•Customer-back innovation has fueled decades of profitable growth at ITW. The Company’s unique innovation approach is built on insight gathered from the 80/20 front to back process. Working from the customer back, ITW businesses position themselves as the go-to problem solver for their “80” customers. ITW’s innovation efforts are focused on understanding customer needs, particularly those in “80” markets with solid long-term growth fundamentals, and subsequently creating unique solutions to address those needs. These customer insights and learnings drive innovation at ITW and have contributed to a portfolio of more than 17,000 granted and pending patents;•ITW’s decentralized, entrepreneurial culture enables ITW businesses to be fast, focused, and responsive. ITW businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the ITW Business Model to customize their approach in order to best serve their specific customers' needs. ITW colleagues recognize their unique responsibilities to execute the Company's strategy and values. As a result, the Company maintains a focused and simple organizational structure that, combined with outstanding execution, delivers best-in-class services adapted to each business' customers and end markets.ENTERPRISE STRATEGYIn late 2012, ITW began the first phase of its strategic framework, transitioning the Company on its current strategic path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the ITW Business Model. Since then, ITW has made considerable progress, as evidenced by the Company’s strong financial performance over the past five years.The roots of ITW’s Enterprise Strategy began in late 2011 / early 2012, when the Company undertook a complete review of its performance. Focusing on its businesses delivering consistent above-market growth with best-in-class margins and returns, ITW developed a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations.13Based on this rigorous evaluation, ITW determined that solid and consistent above-market organic growth must be the core growth engine to deliver world-class financial performance and compelling long-term returns for its shareholders. To shift its primary growth engine to organic, the Company began executing a multi-step approach.•The first step was to narrow the focus and improve the quality of ITW’s business portfolio. As part of the Portfolio Management initiative, ITW exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a must-have requirement for all ITW businesses. This process included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated ITW divisions.As a result of this work, ITW’s business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential. ITW segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve operating margins and generate price/cost increases. The Company achieved this through product line simplification, or eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, while supporting and growing the businesses’ largest / most profitable customers and product lines. With the initiative nearly complete and ITW businesses demonstrating notably improved financial performance, the Company believes that the product line simplification work is returning to more normalized levels.•Step two, Business Structure Simplification, was implemented to simplify and scale-up ITW’s operating structure to support increased engineering, marketing, and sales resources, and, at the same time, improve global reach and competitiveness, all of which were critical to driving accelerated organic growth. ITW now has 85 scaled-up divisions with significantly enhanced focus on growth investments, core customers and products, and customer-back innovation.•The Strategic Sourcing initiative established sourcing as a core strategic and operational capability at ITW. The Company’s 80/20-enabled sourcing organization has delivered an average of one percent reduction in spend each year from 2013 through 2017 and is on track to do the same in 2018.•With the portfolio realignment and scale-up work largely complete, the Company shifted its focus to preparing for and accelerating, organic growth, reapplying 80/20 to optimize its newly scaled-up divisions for growth, first, to build a foundation of operational excellence, and second, to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth.ITW has clearly demonstrated superior 80/20 management, resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the Company’s operating margin and after-tax return on invested capital. At the same time, these 80/20 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns. With this first phase of the strategy nearing completion, the Company will look ahead to the next five years and delivering differentiated performance on a sustained basis.SUSTAINED DIFFERENTIATED PERFORMANCEWhile the Company has made considerable progress and ITW’s performance is nearing best-in-class levels, the Company has significant opportunity for further improvement. The second phase of the strategic framework is focused on delivering differentiated performance on a sustained basis, with consistent above market organic growth. Moving forward, the Company remains committed to the four strategic principles that have served as the foundation of its progress over the past five years and that the Company believes best positions ITW to deliver continued differentiated performance over the next five years:•The ITW Business Model is the Company's competitive advantage•Focus on quality growth•"Do what we say" execution is a critical differentiator•Invest only where ITW has a competitive advantageThe ITW Business Model is the Company's Competitive AdvantageThe ITW Business Model is the combination of a set of strategic, operational, and cultural approaches and practices that is applied to every ITW business. The Business Model has existed inside the Company for over 30 years and is truly ITW's differentiating competitive advantage. The ITW Business Model is comprised of three elements:•80/20 Front to Back Process = How the Company Operates•Customer-Back Innovation Approach = How the Company Innovates•Decentralized Entrepreneurial Culture = How the Company Executes14Focus on Quality GrowthITW prioritizes high-quality revenue growth and, as such, the Company’s primary growth focus is organic.Leveraging the Business Model and the 80/20 front to back process provides a clear view of where to focus for high- quality growth. The Company targets differentiated end-markets and customers with critical needs and challenging pain points. ITW generates high-quality growth through consistent customer-back innovation and customer service excellence. The Company only invests and operates in industries and businesses that have the right “raw material” to generate high quality organic growth through the application of the ITW Business Model. ITW’s current portfolio of seven segments offers solid growth potential and a high degree of diversification in terms of geographic and end market exposures, enabling the Company to deliver consistent high-quality growth in an increasingly volatile and competitive global market environment."Do What We Say" Execution is a Critical DifferentiatorITW’s commitment to execution is a key differentiator for ITW. Living up to the Company’s commitments - “do what we say” execution - is a deeply embedded core element of the culture. The culture is the engine that translates ITW's strategy into action, and action into results.All divisions function within a “framework” that defines how the culture operates and defines the Company’s values, business model and strategy to ensure all divisions are working toward our common set of goals. Business leaders have the flexibility to define the actions and customize their approach to meet those goals. This “flexibility within the framework” establishes an entrepreneurial environment where decisions are made “bottom up” by those with the greatest knowledge, capability and proximity to the customer, which enables our businesses to be nimble and react quickly to market conditions and customer requirements.ITW is simple, straightforward and transparent in everything it does. The Company sets clear performance expectations and financial targets, executes against these at the appropriate pace, and establishes the freedom to define how to achieve results within the construct of the Business Model.Invest Only Where ITW Has a Competitive AdvantageThe Company is highly focused and disciplined in its approach to invest only where it can leverage the ITW Business Model into compelling and sustainable competitive advantage.Investments to support organic growth and sustain its highly differentiated core businesses, such as new product innovation, marketing programs, simplification projects, and capital investments, are ITW’s number one investment priority.TERMS USED BY ITWManagement uses the following terms to describe the financial results of operations of the Company:•Organic business - acquired businesses that have been included in the Company's results of operations for more than 12 months on a constant currency basis.•Operating leverage - the estimated effect of the organic revenue volume changes on organic operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period.•Price/cost - represents the estimated net impact of increases or decreases in the cost of materials used in the Company's products versus changes in the selling price to the Company's customers.•Product line simplification (PLS) - focuses businesses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines; in the short-term, PLS may result in a decrease in revenue and overhead costs while improving operating margin. In the long-term, PLS is expected to result in growth in revenue, profitability, and returns.Unless otherwise stated, the changes in financial results in the consolidated results of operations and the results of operations by segment represent the current year period versus the comparable period in the prior year. The following discussion of operating results should be read in conjunction with Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.15CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe Company's strong first quarter financial performance reflected continued focus on leveraging the business portfolio and the highly differentiated Business Model to its full potential. All segments achieved worldwide organic revenue growth and had operating margin above 20% in the first quarter of 2018.The Company’s consolidated results of operations for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 were as follows:•Operating revenue grew in the first quarter due the favorable effect of foreign currency translation and an increase in organic revenue.•Organic revenue increased 2.6% as all segments had worldwide organic revenue growth primarily due to penetration gains, higher end market demand and product innovation. ◦North American organic revenue increased 3.2% as growth in five segments was partially offset by a decline in the Specialty Products and Polymers & Fluids segments. ◦Asia Pacific organic revenue increased 3.3% as growth in six segments was partially offset by a decline in the Specialty Products segment.◦Europe, Middle East and Africa organic revenue increased 1.1% as growth in the Test & Measurement and Electronics, Specialty Products and Automotive OEM segments was partially offset by a decline in the Construction Products, Food Equipment, Welding and Polymers & Fluids segments. •Operating income of $903 million increased 11.9% as compared to the prior year. Operating margin of 24.1% increased 90 basis points primarily driven by the benefits of the Company's enterprise initiatives of 110 basis points and lower restructuring expenses, partially offset by unfavorable price/cost of 50 basis points.•The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 23.2% compared to 28.3% in 2017. The first quarter 2018 effective tax rate was lower primarily as a result of the lower U.S. corporate federal tax rate and a discrete income tax benefit of $14 million related to foreign tax credits. Additionally, the effective tax rate for both respective periods included discrete income tax benefits of $6 million and $12 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Excluding these discrete tax benefits, the Company's effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 would have been 25.5% and 30.0%, respectively. The estimated effective tax rate for the full year of 2018 is approximately 25%. Refer to Note 3. Income Taxes in Item 1 - Financial Statements for further information.•Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.90 increased 23.4% in 2018. •Free cash flow was $444 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 11.3%. Refer to the Cash Flow section of Liquidity and Capital Resources for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure.•The Company repurchased approximately 3.0 million shares of its common stock in the first quarter of 2018 for approximately $500 million. •Total cash dividends of $266 million were paid in the first quarter of 2018.•After-tax return on average invested capital in the first quarter of 2018 was 27.7%, an increase of 400 basis points, of which 350 basis points related to the new U.S. tax rules and regulations. Refer to the After-Tax Return on Average Invested Capital section of Liquidity and Capital Resources for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure.16RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENTTotal operating revenue and operating income for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 were as follows:Segments are allocated a fixed overhead charge based on the segment's revenue.

The core principle of the new guidance is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, expanded revenue disclosures are required. The Company's sales arrangements with customers are predominantly short-term in nature and generally provide for transfer of control and risks and rewards of ownership at the time of product shipment or delivery of service. As such, the timing of revenue recognition under both the prior and new guidance is the same for the majority of the Company’s transactions. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue guidance under the modified retrospective method and recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment reducing retained earnings by $9 million as of January 1, 2018. Under the modified retrospective method of adoption, prior periods are not restated and the new guidance is applied prospectively to revenue transactions completed on or after January 1, 2018. Given the nature of the Company’s revenue transactions, the new guidance had an immaterial impact on the Company's operating revenue, results of operations, and financial position for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The Company updated its revenue recognition accounting policy to reflect the requirements of the new guidance and included additional disclosures regarding the Company's revenue transactions. Refer to Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies and Note 2. Operating Revenue in Item 1. Financial Statements for additional information.In October 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance requiring the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs rather than when transferred to a third party as required under the prior guidance. The provisions of the new guidance will be applied prospectively to intra-entity asset transfers on or after January 1, 2018 and may result in future tax rate volatility. Upon adoption of the new guidance on January 1, 2018, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment reducing deferred tax assets and retained earnings by $406 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the impact of the new guidance on the Company's effective income tax rate was not material.In March 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which changes the income statement presentation of net periodic benefit cost related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The primary change under the new guidance is that only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost should be included in operating income and is eligible for capitalization as an asset. The other components of net periodic benefit cost ("other net periodic benefit cost"), including interest cost, expected return on assets, settlements, curtailments, and amortization of actuarial gains and losses and prior service cost, should be presented below operating income. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new presentation of other net periodic benefit cost and restated the prior year statement of income and related disclosures for comparability, as required under the new guidance. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, other net periodic benefit cost was income of $5 million and $2 million, respectively, and was presented in Other income (expense) in both periods. Refer to Note 5. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits in Item 1. Financial Statements for additional information.In February 2018, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which allows for an optional one-time reclassification of the stranded tax effects resulting from the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate under the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (the "Act") from accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") to retained earnings. The guidance is effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to early adopt this guidance as of January 1, 2018 and to reclassify the stranded tax effects related to the Act, which resulted in an increase of $45 million to both retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive loss. Refer to Note 7. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in Item 1. Financial Statements for additional information.In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for recognizing leasing transactions. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize a lease liability and right-of-use lease asset for all leases with a lease term 22greater than twelve months, including operating leases, in the statement of financial position. Subsequent measurement, including presentation of expenses and cash flows, will depend on the classification of the lease as either a financing or operating lease. In addition, expanded disclosures will be required. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. While the Company has not yet completed its evaluation of the impact the new lease accounting guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, the Company expects to recognize right-of-use assets and liabilities for its operating leases in the statement of financial position upon adoption. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe Company’s primary sources of liquidity are free cash flow and short-term credit facilities. In addition, the Company had $1.9 billion of cash and equivalents on hand at March 31, 2018 and also maintains strong access to public debt markets. Management believes that these sources are sufficient to service debt and to finance the Company's capital allocation priorities, which include:•internal investments to support organic growth and sustain core businesses;•payment of an attractive dividend to shareholders; and•external investments in selective strategic acquisitions that support the Company's organic growth focus, and an active share repurchase program.The Company believes that, based on its revenue, operating margin, current free cash flow, and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary.Cash FlowThe Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. Summarized cash flow information for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 was as follows: Three Months Ended March 31,In millions2018 2017Net cash provided by operating activities$538 $463Additions to plant and equipment(94)(64)Free cash flow$444 $399    Cash dividends paid$(266) $(226)Repurchases of common stock(500) (250)Acquisition of businesses (excluding cash and equivalents) and additional interest in affiliates— (3)Net proceeds from (repayments of) debt with original maturities of three months or less(840) 671Repayments of debt with original maturities of more than three months— (652)Other3 17Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and equivalents5 65Net increase (decrease) in cash and equivalents$(1,154) $2123Stock Repurchase ProgramOn February 13, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to $6.0 billion of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2015 Program”). Under the 2015 Program, the Company repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $128.47 in the first quarter of 2017, approximately 1.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $136.81 in the second quarter of 2017, approximately 1.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $142.54 in the third quarter of 2017, approximately 1.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $157.51 in the fourth quarter of 2017, and approximately 3.0 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $164.04 in the first quarter of 2018. As of March 31, 2018, there were approximately $1.9 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2015 Program.After-Tax Return on Average Invested CapitalThe Company uses after-tax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. ROIC for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 was as follows:(1) The tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 represents the estimated effective tax rate for the full year of 2018.ROIC for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 27.7 percent, an improvement of 400 basis points, of which 350 basis points related to the new U.S. tax rules and regulations.24Working CapitalManagement uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the Company. Net working capital as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 is summarized as follows:Cash and equivalents totaled approximately $1.9 billion as of March 31, 2018 and $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2017, primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries. Cash and equivalents held internationally may be subject to foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the U.S. A portion of the cash and equivalents balances held internationally is typically used for international operating needs, reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses, used to fund new international acquisitions, or used to repay debt held internationally. In the U.S., the Company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs, which primarily consist of dividend payments, share repurchases, acquisitions, servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs. The Company also uses its commercial paper program, which is backed by long-term credit facilities, for short-term liquidity needs. The Company believes cash generated domestically and liquidity provided by the Company's commercial paper program will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the U.S.On December 22, 2017, the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (the "Act") was enacted in the United States. The provisions of the Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax rules, including a one-time repatriation tax on the deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the one-time repatriation provisions of the Act, the Company provided for substantially all U.S. taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company repatriated approximately $1.5 billion of cash and equivalents held by its international subsidiaries, which was primarily used to repay outstanding commercial paper and to fund share repurchases in the quarter.DebtTotal debt as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was as follows:Short-term debt included commercial paper of $10 million and $849 million as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. In addition, in the first quarter of 2018, the Company reclassified $649 million related to the 1.95% notes due March 1, 2019 from Long-term debt to Short-term debt.25Total Debt to EBITDAThe Company uses the ratio of total debt to EBITDA as a measure of its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. The Company believes that total debt to EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to EBITDA.
