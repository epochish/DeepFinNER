In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in the Company’s 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform with current year reporting.On January 1, 2012, the Company adopted new accounting guidance that requires the presentation of net income and comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements.  The Company is reporting comprehensive income in a separate consecutive financial statement for interim and annual reporting periods.(2)    PENDING DIVESTITURE OF MAJORITY INTEREST IN DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENTOn August 15, 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) to divest a 51 percent majority interest in its Decorative Surfaces segment to certain funds managed by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”).  Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, the Company will contribute the assets and stock of the Decorative Surfaces segment to a newly formed joint venture, Wilsonart International Holdings LLC (“Wilsonart”).  Through a combination of CD&R’s equity investment in Wilsonart and new third party borrowings by a subsidiary of Wilsonart, the Company and its subsidiaries will receive payments of approximately $1.05 billion from Wilsonart and its subsidiaries and hold common units (the “Common Units”) initially representing approximately 49% (on an as-converted basis) of the total outstanding equity of Wilsonart immediately following the closing of the transaction.  CD&R will contribute $395 million to Wilsonart in exchange for newly issued cumulative convertible participating preferred units (the “Preferred Units”) of Wilsonart initially representing approximately 51% (on an as-converted basis) of the total outstanding equity immediately following the closing of the transaction.  The Preferred Units will rank senior to the Common Units as to dividends and liquidation preference.  The Preferred Units will have an initial liquidation preference of $395 million and will accrue dividends at a rate of 10.00% per annum payable in cash or in additional Preferred Units at the option of Wilsonart.  In the event the amount of dividends paid in additional Preferred Units exceeds certain thresholds, the dividends may accumulate as cash dividends to be paid at a later date, in which case the dividend rate will increase to 12.00% per annum.  Dividend payments on the Preferred Units may be eliminated if Wilsonart achieves certain performance targets for three consecutive twelve-month periods.  Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, it is anticipated that Wilsonart will incur new third party indebtedness of approximately $725 million.Closing of the transaction is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2012 following the completion of a marketing period in connection with the new third-party financing arranged by CD&R and is subject to certain customary conditions, including no occurrence of a “Material Adverse Effect” on the business since August 15, 2012, and obtaining regulatory approvals.  The Company expects to recognize a gain in the fourth quarter as a result of the transaction.  As of the close of the transaction, the Company expects to cease to consolidate the results of the Decorative Surfaces segment and anticipates it will report its ownership interest in Wilsonart using the equity method of accounting.(3)           DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSIn April 2011, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its finishing group of businesses included within the All Other segment to Graco Inc. in a $650 million cash transaction. The sale of the finishing business to Graco was completed on April 2, 2012, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $454 million which was included in income from discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2012.In the second quarter of 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors approved plans to divest a consumer packaging business in the All Other segment and an electronic components business in the Power Systems & Electronics segment. The consumer packaging and electronics components businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the second quarter of 2011. The electronic components business was sold in the fourth quarter of 2011. The consumer packaging business was sold in the third quarter of 2012, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $17 million which was included in income from discontinued operations. The Company also exited a flooring business in the Decorative Surfaces segment in early 2011.6The consolidated statement of income and the notes to financial statements for all periods have been restated to present the operating results of the divested or exited businesses discussed above as discontinued operations.Results of the discontinued operations for the third quarter and year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 were as follows:The assets and liabilities of the divested businesses discussed above were presented as assets and liabilities held for sale in the statement of financial position.  There were no businesses classified as held for sale at September 30, 2012.  Assets and liabilities held for sale at December 31, 2011 included both the consumer packaging and finishing businesses discussed above.  The following table summarizes the classes of assets and liabilities held for sale at December 31, 2011:(In millions)  December 31, 2011Trade receivables $72Inventories 56Net plant and equipment 44Goodwill and intangible assets 201Other 13Total assets held for sale $386Accounts payable $22Accrued expenses 55Other 30Total liabilities held for sale $107(4)           INCOME TAXESThe components of the effective tax rate for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 were as follows:The Company litigated a dispute with the Australian Tax Office over the tax treatment of an intercompany financing transaction between the U.S. and Australia. The case was heard before the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria, in September 2010. The proceedings resulted from the Company’s appeal of a decision by the Australian Tax Commissioner to disallow income tax deductions for the income tax years 2002 through 2005 and the assessment of withholding taxes for income tax year 2003. The Company also contested the Commissioner’s similar determination for income tax years 2006 and 2007; however, the parties agreed to follow the Court’s decision made on the earlier years. On February 4, 2011, the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria, decided in the Company’s favor with respect to a significant portion of the income tax deductions. The Court issued the final orders on February 18, 2011. Based on this decision, the Company decreased its unrecognized tax benefits related to this matter by approximately $197 million and recorded a favorable discrete non-cash tax benefit to reduce tax expense by $166 million in 7the first quarter of 2011. Subsequent to the 2011 ruling, the Australian Tax Office appealed the timing of certain of the deductions. In March 2012, the Court ruled in favor of the Australian Tax Office regarding the timing of the deductions, which did not have a material impact on the Company.During the first quarter of 2011, the Company resolved an issue with the Internal Revenue Service in the United States related to a deduction for foreign exchange losses on an intercompany loan that resulted in a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $179 million.The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions and a number of these audits are currently ongoing, including the Internal Revenue Service, German Fiscal Authority, and French Fiscal Authority, which may increase the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits in future periods.  In the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service has completed its audit for the years 2008-2009 and has proposed certain adjustments which the Company is protesting.  Due to the ongoing audits, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the amount of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits may be increased or decreased by approximately $150 million related predominantly to intercompany financing and global legal structure reorganization transactions. The Company has recorded its best estimate of the potential exposure for these issues.(5)           INVENTORIESInventories at September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011 were as follows:  (6)    GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETSGoodwill represents the excess cost over fair value of the net assets of purchased businesses. The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. The Company performs an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives based on the estimated fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset. When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company evaluates the goodwill assigned to each of its 43 reporting units for potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the relevant reporting unit to the carrying value. The Company uses various valuation techniques to determine the fair value of its reporting units, including discounting estimated future cash flows based on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant reporting unit, market multiples from similar transactions and quoted market prices of relevant public companies. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill.The Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trademarks and brands. The estimated fair values of these intangible assets are determined based on a relief-of-royalty income approach derived from internally forecasted revenues of the related products. If the fair value of the trademark or brand is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the intangible asset.The Company performed its annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter of 2012 and 2011. In the third quarter of 2012, these assessments resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $1 million related to the pressure sensitive adhesives reporting unit in the Power Systems & Electronics segment and an intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $1 million  related to the international reporting unit in the Food Equipment segment.  There were no impairment charges in 2011.  8A summary of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that were adjusted to fair value and the related impairment charges included in earnings in the third quarter of 2012 is as follows:(In millions)        Book Value Fair Value Total Impairment ChargesGoodwill $146 $145 $1Indefinite-lived intangible assets 5 4 1On January 1, 2012, the Company adopted new accounting guidance which provides the option to first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step test for goodwill impairment.  Under the new guidance, further testing using the two-step test would only be required when, based on the qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  The adoption of the new accounting guidance did not impact the Company's consolidated financial statements.(7)          RETIREMENT PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITSPension and other postretirement benefit costs related to both continuing and discontinued operations for the third quarter and year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, were as follows:  The Company expects to contribute approximately $180 million to its pension plans and $39 million to its other postretirement plans in 2012. As of September 30, 2012, contributions of $162 million to pension plans and $23 million to other postretirement plans have been made.(8)           SHORT-TERM DEBTThe Company had outstanding commercial paper of $357 million at September 30, 2012 and $192 million at December 31, 2011. Commercial paper is stated at cost, which approximates fair value.9(9)           LONG-TERM DEBTBased on rates for comparable instruments, which are classified as Level 2 inputs, the approximate fair value and related carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt, including current maturities, were as follows: On June 8, 2012, the Company entered into a $1.5 billion line of credit agreement with a termination date of June 8, 2017. In connection with the new line of credit, the Company terminated its $500 million line of credit agreement with a termination date of June 15, 2012 and its $1.0 billion line of credit agreement with a termination date of June 11, 2013. No amounts were outstanding under this facility at September 30, 2012.In August 2012, the Company issued $1.1 billion of 3.9% notes due September 1, 2042 at 99.038% of face value. The effective interest rate of the notes is 3.955%.  These notes are senior unsecured obligations, ranking equal in right of payment with all other senior unsecured indebtedness of the Company.(10)           COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESAmong the toxic tort cases in which the Company is a defendant, the Company and its subsidiaries Hobart Brothers Company and Miller Electric Mfg. Co. have been named, along with numerous other defendants, in lawsuits alleging injury from exposure to welding consumables. The plaintiffs in these suits claim unspecified damages for injuries resulting from the plaintiffs’ alleged exposure to asbestos, manganese and/or toxic fumes in connection with the welding process. In the first quarter of 2012, the Company entered into an agreement resolving substantially all of the manganese-related claims for an immaterial amount. As of September 30, 2012, a majority of the cases against the Company, Hobart Brothers and Miller Electric have been dismissed. The Company believes that the remaining claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results, financial position or cash flows.  (11)           SEGMENT INFORMATIONThe Company periodically makes changes to its management reporting structure to better align its businesses with Company objectives and operating strategies.  In the first quarter of 2012, the Company made certain changes in its management reporting structure that resulted in changes in some of the reportable segments.  These changes primarily related to the industrial fasteners reporting unit, formerly in the All Other segment, moving to the Transportation segment; certain businesses in a Latin American reporting unit, formerly in the Polymers & Fluids segment, moving to the Transportation segment; and a worldwide insulation reporting unit, formerly in the Industrial Packaging segment, moving to the Power Systems & Electronics segment. The changes in the reportable segments and underlying reporting units did not result in any goodwill impairment charges in the first quarter of 2012. The prior period segment results have been restated to conform to the current year reporting of these businesses. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information regarding operating revenues and operating income for the Company’s segments.10Item 2 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsINTRODUCTIONManagement analyzes the Company’s consolidated results of operations and the results of each segment by identifying the effects of changes in the results of the base businesses, newly acquired companies, restructuring costs, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, and currency translation on the operating revenues and operating income of each segment. Base businesses are those businesses that have been included in the Company’s results of operations for more than 12 months. The changes to base business operating income include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and changes in variable margins and overhead costs. Operating leverage is the estimated effect of the base business revenue volume changes on operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period. As manufacturing and administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing, the percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage is usually more than the percentage change in the base business revenues. Changes in variable margins and overhead costs represent the estimated effect of non-volume related changes in base business operating income and may be driven by a number of factors, including changes in product mix, the cost of raw materials, labor and overhead, and pricing to customers. Selling price versus material cost comparisons represent the estimated net impact of increases or decreases in the cost of materials used in the Company’s products versus changes in the selling price to the Company’s customers. Management reviews these price versus cost comparisons by analyzing the net impact of changes to each segment’s operating margin.The Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its long-term objectives. For businesses reported as discontinued operations in the statement of income, all related prior period income statement information has been restated to conform to the current year reporting of these businesses. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for discussion of the Company’s discontinued operations.The Company periodically makes changes to its management reporting structure to better align its businesses with Company objectives and operating strategies. In the first quarter of 2012, the Company made certain changes in its management reporting structure that resulted in changes in some of the reportable segments. These changes primarily related to the industrial fasteners reporting unit, formerly in the All Other segment, moving to the Transportation segment; certain businesses in a Latin American reporting unit, formerly in the Polymers & Fluids segment, moving to the Transportation segment; and a worldwide insulation reporting unit, formerly in the Industrial Packaging segment, moving to the Power Systems & Electronics segment. The changes in the reportable segments and underlying reporting units did not result in any goodwill impairment charges in the first quarter of 2012. The prior period segment results have been restated to conform to the current year reporting of these businesses.The following discussion of operating results should be read in conjunction with Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe Company’s consolidated results of operations for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2012 and 2011 were as follows:11In the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2012, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, % Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Point Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Point Increase (Decrease) Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating Margins Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating MarginsBase business:           Revenue change/Operating leverage0.9 % 2.2% 0.2% 2.1% 5.5% 0.5%Changes in variable margins & overhead costs— 11.3 1.8 — 6.8 1.1Total0.9 13.5 2.0 2.1 12.3 1.6Acquisitions and divestitures1.4 (0.2) (0.3) 2.9 0.4 (0.4)Restructuring costs— (2.2) (0.3) — (2.1) (0.3)Impairment of goodwill & intangibles— (0.2) — — (0.1) —Translation(4.1) (4.1) (0.1) (3.4) (3.1) (0.1)Other0.1 — — 0.1 — —Total(1.7)% 6.8% 1.3% 1.7% 7.4% 0.8%Operating RevenuesRevenues decreased 1.7% for the third quarter of 2012 versus 2011 due to the negative effect of currency translation, partially offset by revenues from acquisitions (net of divestitures) and an increase in base revenues. For the year-to-date period of 2012 versus 2011, revenues increased 1.7% due to revenues from acquisitions (net of divestitures) and an increase in base revenues, partially offset by the negative effect of currency translation.  Worldwide base revenues increased 0.9% and 2.1% for the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, as economic conditions in North America were modestly positive while the European economic environment remained weak, and Asia Pacific further softened. North American base revenues increased 3.9% and 5.2% for the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively.  International base revenues declined 2.7% and 1.4%, respectively, as Europe decreased 3.7% and 2.1%, respectively, and Asia Pacific base business decreased 1.5% in the third quarter and was flat for the year-to-date period. Acquisitions (net of divestitures) contributed 1.4% and 2.9% to revenues in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively. Significant acquisitions included a manufacturer of specialty devices used to measure the flow of gases and fluids purchased in the first quarter of 2012, a thermal processing and environmental equipment manufacturer purchased in the third quarter of 2011, and a North American automotive aftermarket business purchased in the first quarter of 2011. Currency translation resulted in a 4.1% and 3.4% decline in revenues in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to a weaker Euro versus the year ago period. Operating IncomeOperating income increased 6.8% and 7.4% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2012, respectively, versus 2011 primarily due to improved variable margins and the positive operating leverage effects of the base revenue increase noted above, and lower operating expenses in the third quarter. Currency translation resulted in a 4.1% and 3.1% decline in operating income in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to a weaker Euro versus the year ago period.  Higher restructuring expenses due to increased cost reduction activities negatively impacted operating income by 2.2% and 2.1% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively. Base margins increased 200 and 160 basis points in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to improvements in variable margins and overhead costs, and the positive operating leverage effect of the increase in base revenues of 20 and 50 basis points, respectively.  The 180 and 110 basis point improvements in variable margins and overhead costs in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, were primarily due to the favorable effect of selling price versus material cost comparisons of 80 and 60 basis points, respectively, and lower operating expenses in the third quarter. The increase in base margins was partially offset by a 30 and 40 basis point decline related to acquisitions (net of divestitures) in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to amortization expense associated with intangible assets from acquisitions made within the past year.  Restructuring expenses diluted operating margins by 30 basis points in both the third quarter and year-to-date periods due to the higher restructuring expenses noted above. 12RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENTThe reconciliation of segment operating revenues to total operating revenues is as follows:TRANSPORTATIONBusinesses in this segment produce components, fasteners, fluids and polymers, as well as truck remanufacturing and related parts and service.In the Transportation segment, products and services include:•      plastic and metal components, fasteners and assemblies for automobiles, light trucks, and other industrial uses;•      fluids, polymers and other supplies for auto aftermarket maintenance and appearance;•      fillers and putties for auto body repair;•      polyester coatings and patch and repair products for the marine industry; and•      truck remanufacturing and related parts and service.This segment primarily serves the automotive original equipment manufacturers and tiers, and automotive aftermarket markets.The results of operations for the Transportation segment for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2012 and 2011 were as follows:13In the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2012, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30 September 30 % Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Point Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Point Increase (Decrease) Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating Margins Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating MarginsBase business:           Revenue change/Operating leverage1.4 % 3.2 % 0.3% 3.3% 7.5% 0.6%Changes in variable margins & overhead costs— 5.4 0.8 — 2.2 0.4Total1.4 8.6 1.1 3.3 9.7 1.0Acquisitions and divestitures0.5 0.3 — 2.7 1.8 (0.1)Restructuring costs— (5.8) (0.9) — (3.1) (0.5)Impairment of goodwill & intangibles— — — — — —Translation(4.1) (4.9) (0.1) (3.5) (4.1) (0.1)Other— — — — — —Total(2.2)% (1.8)% 0.1% 2.5% 4.3% 0.3% Operating RevenuesRevenues decreased 2.2% in the third quarter of 2012 versus 2011 due to the negative effect of currency translation, partially offset by an increase in base revenues and revenues from acquisitions.  For the year-to-date period of 2012 versus 2011, revenues increased 2.5% due to an increase in base revenues and revenues from acquisitions, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation. The increase in acquisition revenue for the third quarter and year-to-date periods was primarily due to the purchase of a North American automotive aftermarket business in the first quarter of 2011 and a European automotive aftermarket business in the third quarter of 2011. North American automotive base revenues increased 9.2% and 11.0% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to increases in US automakers’ auto builds of approximately 14% and 20% for the respective periods, partially offset by an unfavorable customer mix. International automotive base revenues increased 8.8% and 7.2% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively.  European base revenues increased 3.8% and 3.5% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, due to favorable customer mix and product penetration gains, as European car builds decreased approximately 6% and 4% in each respective period. Asia Pacific base revenues grew 23.0% and 24.7% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, driven by the Company’s growing product penetration with automotive original equipment manufacturers and increased auto builds in China.

The acquisition revenue was primarily due to the first quarter 2012 purchase of a manufacturer of specialty devices used to measure the flow of gases and fluids. Base revenues increased 12.3% and 8.6% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, for the worldwide test and measurement businesses primarily due to increased equipment orders in North America, Europe, and China, and a one-time sale of equipment to a consumer electronics customer. For the consumer packaging businesses, base revenues decreased 0.4% and 0.9% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, due to weaker demand in the worldwide graphics businesses in Europe and lower equipment sales in the product coding and marking businesses, partially offset by growth in beverage related products in the global packaging solutions businesses.   The decline in base revenues for the year-to-date period was also driven by decreased sales in the reclosable packaging business in the first half of 2012.  Worldwide appliance base revenue growth was 11.7% and 7.2% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to improved consumer demand in North America. Operating IncomeOperating income increased 7.8% and 7.7% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2012, respectively, versus 2011 primarily due to the increase in base revenues and improved variable margins, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation, lower income from acquisitions (net of divestitures), and higher restructuring expenses. Total base margins increased 250 and 210 basis points for the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to changes in variable margins and overhead costs of 130 and 140 basis points, respectively, and the increase in base revenues noted above. The positive impact from changes in variable margins and overhead costs in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, was primarily due to operating expense efficiencies and favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons of 70 and 60 basis points, respectively.  Acquisitions (net of divestitures) diluted total operating margins by 130 and 150 basis points for the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to amortization expense related to intangible assets from acquisitions made within the past year. Higher restructuring expenses decreased operating margins in the third quarter and year-to-date periods by 50 and 60 basis points, respectively, due to increased cost reduction activities in 2012.AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETSAmortization expense increased to $217 million in the first nine months of 2012 versus $186 million in the first nine months of 2011 due to intangible asset amortization related to newly acquired businesses, most notably a manufacturer of specialty devices used to measure the flow of gases and fluids in the All Other segment, a thermal processing and environmental equipment manufacturer in the Power Systems & Electronics segment and a North American automotive aftermarket business in the Transportation segment.24IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETSThe Company performed its annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter of 2012 and 2011. In the third quarter of 2012, these assessments resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $1 million related to the pressure sensitive adhesives reporting unit in the Power Systems & Electronics segment and an intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $1 million related to the international reporting unit in the Food Equipment segment. There were no impairment charges in 2011. See the Goodwill and Intangible Assets note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company's annual impairment assessment. INTEREST EXPENSEInterest expense increased to $153 million in the first nine months of 2012, which included interest expense on the 3.375% and 4.875% notes issued in late August 2011 and interest expense on the 3.9% notes issued in late August 2012, versus $138 million in the first nine months of 2011.  The increase was offset by lower interest expense on the 6.55% preferred debt securities which were fully paid on the first business day in 2012.OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)Other income (expense) was income of $60 million for the first nine months of 2012 versus income of $46 million for the first nine months of 2011 primarily due to pre-tax gains on the sale of operations and affiliates of approximately $23 million in the third quarter of 2012, partially offset by lower investment income.INCOME TAXESThe effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2012 was 29.0% versus 20.7% for the first nine months of 2011. The 2011 effective tax rate included the favorable discrete non-cash tax benefit of $166 million in the first quarter of 2011 related to the decision in the Company’s favor by the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria with respect to a significant portion of the income tax deductions that had been challenged by the Australian Tax Office. See the Income Taxes note in Item 1 – Financial Statements for further details on income taxes.INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONSIncome from continuing operations of $1.5 billion ($3.20 per diluted share) in the first nine months of 2012 was 3.6% lower than the 2011 income from continuing operations of $1.6 billion ($3.17 per diluted share).  As noted above, the 2011 income from continuing operations includes the discrete tax benefit of $166 million related to the Australian tax matter.FOREIGN CURRENCYThe weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar decreased operating revenues for the first nine months of 2012 by approximately $442 million and decreased income from continuing operations by approximately $46 million ($0.10 per diluted share) versus 2011.INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSIncome from discontinued operations increased to $368 million ($0.77 per diluted share) in the first nine months of 2012 versus $49 million ($0.10 per diluted share) in the first nine months of 2011 primarily as a result of the gain on the sale of the finishing group of businesses in the second quarter of 2012. See the Discontinued Operations note in Item 1 – Financial Statements for further details regarding the Company’s discontinued operations.PENDING DIVESTITURE OF MAJORITY INTEREST IN DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENTOn August 15, 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) to divest a 51 percent majority interest in its Decorative Surfaces segment to certain funds managed by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”).  Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, the Company will contribute the assets and stock of the Decorative Surfaces segment to a newly formed joint venture, Wilsonart International Holdings LLC (“Wilsonart”).  Through a combination of CD&R’s equity investment in Wilsonart and new third party borrowings by a subsidiary of Wilsonart, the Company and its subsidiaries will receive payments of approximately $1.05 billion from Wilsonart and its subsidiaries and hold common units (the “Common Units”) initially representing approximately 49% (on an as-converted basis) of the total outstanding equity of Wilsonart immediately following the closing of the transaction.  CD&R will contribute $395 million to Wilsonart in exchange for newly issued cumulative convertible participating preferred units (the “Preferred Units”) of Wilsonart initially representing approximately 51% (on an as-converted basis) of the total outstanding equity immediately following the closing of the 25transaction.  The Preferred Units will rank senior to the Common Units as to dividends and liquidation preference.  The Preferred Units will have an initial liquidation preference of $395 million and will accrue dividends at a rate of 10.00% per annum payable in cash or in additional Preferred Units at the option of Wilsonart.  In the event the amount of dividends paid in additional Preferred Units exceeds certain thresholds, the dividends may accumulate as cash dividends to be paid at a later date, in which case the dividend rate will increase to 12.00% per annum.  Dividend payments on the Preferred Units may be eliminated if Wilsonart achieves certain performance targets for three consecutive twelve-month periods.  Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, it is anticipated that Wilsonart will incur new third party indebtedness of approximately $725 million.Closing of the transaction is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2012 following the completion of a marketing period in connection with the new third-party financing arranged by CD&R and is subject to certain customary conditions, including no occurrence of a “Material Adverse Effect” on the business since August 15, 2012, and obtaining regulatory approvals.  The Company expects to recognize a gain in the fourth quarter as a result of the transaction.  As of the close of the transaction, the Company expects to cease to consolidate the results of the Decorative Surfaces segment and anticipates it will report its ownership interest in Wilsonart using the equity method of accounting.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe Company’s primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and short-term credit facilities. Management continues to believe that internally generated cash flows will be adequate to service debt, to finance internal growth, to continue to pay dividends, and to fund small to medium-sized acquisitions.The primary uses of liquidity are: •      dividend payments - the Company's dividend payout guidelines are 30% to 45% of the average of the last two years' free operating cash flow;•      acquisitions; and•      share repurchases.Cash FlowThe Company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment.  Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.26Summarized cash flow information for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2012 and 2011 was as follows: On May 6, 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to $4.0 billion of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2011 Program”). In the third quarter of 2012, the Company made repurchases of approximately 7.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $54.68 under the 2011 Program. As of September 30, 2012, there was approximately $2.5 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2011 Program.Return on Average Invested CapitalThe Company uses return on average invested capital (“ROIC”) to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company’s operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. For the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2012 and 2011, ROIC was as follows:27The ROIC increase of 90 basis points in the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2011 was the result of average invested capital increasing 0.6%, while operating income after taxes increased 6.9%.The ROIC increase of 30 basis points for the year-to-date period of 2012 compared to the year-to-date period of 2011 was the result of average invested capital increasing 5.4%, while operating income after taxes increased 7.4%. In the first quarter of 2011, the Company recorded a favorable discrete non-cash tax benefit of $166 million related to the decision in the Company’s favor by the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria with respect to a significant portion of the income tax deductions that had been challenged by the Australian Tax Office. See the Income Taxes note in Item 1 – Financial Statements for further details on this discrete tax benefit. Since the benefit was unusual, the ROIC calculation has been adjusted to exclude this item to improve comparability and better reflect the return on average invested capital for the periods presented. A reconciliation of the third quarter 2011 tax rate, as reported, to the tax rate used above is as follows:(Dollars in millions)Nine Months Ended September 30, 2011 Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes Income Taxes Tax RateAs reported$1,992 $412 20.7%Discrete tax adjustment— 166 8.3%As adjusted$1,992 $578 29.0%28Working CapitalManagement uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the Company. Net working capital at September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011 is summarized as follows: Cash and equivalents totaled approximately $2.1 billion as of September 30, 2012, all of which was held by international subsidiaries and may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the United States. Cash balances held internationally are typically used for international operating needs, reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses, or used to fund new international acquisitions. In the U.S., the Company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs which primarily consist of dividend payments, acquisitions, share repurchases, servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs. The Company also uses its commercial paper program, which is backed by long-term credit facilities of $2.5 billion, for short-term liquidity needs. The Company believes cash generated domestically will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the U.S. DebtTotal debt and total debt to capitalization at September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011 were as follows:The Company had outstanding commercial paper of $357 million at September 30, 2012 and $192 million at December 31, 2011, which was included in short-term debt. On June 8, 2012, the Company entered into a $1.5 billion line of credit agreement with a termination date of June 8, 2017. In connection with the new line of credit, the Company terminated its $500 million line of credit agreement with a termination date of June 15, 2012 and its $1.0 billion line of credit agreement with a termination date of June 11, 2013. No amounts were outstanding under this facility at September 30, 2012.In August 2012, the Company issued $1.1 billion of 3.9% notes due September 1, 2042 at 99.038% of face value.  The effective interest rate of the notes is 3.955%.  These notes are senior unsecured obligations, ranking equal in right of payment with all 29other senior unsecured indebtedness of the Company. The net proceeds from this issuance were used to repay outstanding commercial paper in the third quarter of 2012. The Company believes that, based on its current free operating cash flow, debt-to-capitalization ratios and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary.Total Debt to EBITDAThe Company uses the ratio of total debt to EBITDA to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. The Company believes that total debt to EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to EBITDA. EBITDA and the ratio of total debt to EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. The ratio of total debt to EBITDA represents total debt divided by income from continuing operations before interest expense, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis.Total debt to EBITDA for the trailing twelve month periods ended September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011 was as follows:  Stockholders’ EquityThe changes to stockholders’ equity during 2012 were as follows:(In millions)Total stockholders’ equity, December 31, 2011$10,034Net income1,891Stock option and restricted stock activity243Repurchases of common stock(1,416)Cash dividends declared(517)Foreign currency translation adjustments18Other9Total stockholders’ equity, September 30, 2012$10,26230FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

If the Company is unable to retain its key employees, successfully integrate acquisitions, maintain productivity or otherwise implement these initiatives without material disruption to its businesses, financial results could be adversely impacted. Item 2 – Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of ProceedsOn May 6, 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to $4.0 billion of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2011 Program”). Initial buybacks under that program of $79 million were made in the third quarter of 2011. Buybacks resumed with an additional $474 million of repurchases made in the first quarter of 2012, $526 million in the second quarter of 2012 and an additional $416 million in the third quarter of 2012 as summarized in the table below.
