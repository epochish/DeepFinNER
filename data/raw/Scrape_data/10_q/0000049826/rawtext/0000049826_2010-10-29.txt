ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. and SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)   (1)           FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   The unaudited financial statements included herein have been prepared by Illinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”). In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in the Company’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform to current year reporting.   (2)           COMPREHENSIVE INCOME   The components of comprehensive income in the periods presented were:        (3)           DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS   The Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with its long-term objectives. In August 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the divestiture of the Click Commerce industrial software business which was previously reported in the All Other segment. In the second quarter of 2009, the Company completed the sale of the Click Commerce business.   In 2007, the Company classified an automotive components business as held for sale which was sold in the third quarter of 2009.   Results of the discontinued operations for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009 were as follows:       (In thousands)      Three Months Ended      Nine Months Ended             September 30, 2009      September 30, 2009       Operating revenues      $   2,794      $   25,963                                Loss before taxes      $   (1,043   )   $   (36,107   )    Income tax benefit         497         1,825       Loss from discontinued operations      $   (546   )   $   (34,282   )      In the first nine months of 2009, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss on the disposal of the Click Commerce business of $29,626,000.   (4)           INCOME TAXES   In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act were signed into law. As a result, future tax deductions for retiree prescription drug coverage will be reduced by the amount of subsidies received starting in 2013. In the first quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a discrete charge of $21,881,000 for the impact of the health care reform legislation.   In the third quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a discrete charge of $7,308,000 related to the gain on a sale of a business that had non-deductible goodwill.   In the first nine months of 2009, the Company incurred charges related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $101,997,000 that were mostly non-deductible and discrete tax items of $46,849,000 to record reserves on net operating loss carryforwards no longer expected to be utilized and other tax adjustments.                       The components of the effective tax rate for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:          September 30, 2010         September 30, 2009       Estimated annual effective tax rate   30.5   %      29.6   %    Discrete tax adjustments   1.7         6.0       Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges   —         3.3       Effective tax rate   32.2   %      38.9   %      The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions and a number of these audits are currently ongoing.   The Company is litigating its dispute with the Australian Tax Office over the treatment of an intercompany financing transaction between the U.S. and Australia. This case was heard before the Federal Court of Australia in September 2010. The proceedings result from the Company’s appeal of a decision by the Australian Tax Commissioner to disallow income tax deductions for income tax years 2002 through 2005 and the assessment of withholding taxes for income tax year 2003. The Company also contested the Commissioner’s similar determination for income tax years 2006 and 2007; however, the parties have agreed to defer the appeal of that determination until a decision is made on the earlier years. The Company expects a judgment by the end of 2010. The Company has recorded its best estimate of the exposure for this audit; however, it is reasonably possible that the Company will resolve the Australian financing issue within the next 12 months and that the amount of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately $173,150,000.   (5)           INVENTORIES   Inventories at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 were as follows:   (In thousands)      (6)           GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS   Goodwill represents the excess cost over fair value of the net assets of purchased businesses. The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. The Company performs an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives based on the estimated fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset.   When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company compares the estimated fair value of each of its 60 reporting units to its carrying value. Fair values are determined primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows based either on current operating cash flows or on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant reporting unit. The Company also considers additional valuation techniques, such as market multiples from similar transactions and quoted market prices of relevant public companies. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill.   The Company’s indefinite-lived intangibles consist of trademarks and brands. The estimated fair values of these intangibles are determined based on a relief-of-royalty income approach derived from internally forecasted revenues of the related products. If the fair value of the trademark or brand is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the intangible asset.   In the third quarter of 2010, the Company performed its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment which resulted in immaterial intangible asset impairment charges.   In the first quarter of 2009, the Company performed a goodwill impairment assessment which resulted in impairment charges of $60,000,000 related to the pressure sensitive adhesives reporting unit in the Polymers & Fluids segment and $18,000,000 related to the PC board fabrication reporting unit in the Power Systems & Electronics segment. During 2009, the Company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment assessment from the first quarter to the third quarter. In the third quarter of 2009, the Company performed a goodwill impairment assessment which resulted in an impairment charge of $12,000,000 related to the truck remanufacturing reporting unit in the Transportation segment.                     Also in the first quarter of 2009, intangible asset impairments of $11,997,000 were recorded to reduce to the estimated fair value the carrying value of certain trademarks and brands. Approximately $5,800,000 of this total charge related to the PC board fabrication reporting unit and the remainder to various trademarks and brands of other reporting units.   The impairments during 2009 were primarily related to new reporting units which had been acquired before the recent economic downturn. These charges were driven primarily by lower current forecasts compared to the expected forecasts at the time the reporting units were acquired.   A summary of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that were adjusted to fair value and the related impairment charges included in earnings for 2009 is as follows:       (In thousands)         Book Value        Fair Value       Total Impairment Charges        First quarter 2009:                                  Goodwill      $   353,000      $   275,000      $   78,000       Indefinite-lived intangible assets         94,973         82,976         11,997                                         Third quarter 2009:                                  Goodwill      $   96,000      $   84,000      $   12,000         (7)   RETIREMENT PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS   Pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the periods ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:        The Company expects to contribute $70,500,000 to its pension plans and $37,900,000 to its other postretirement plans in 2010. As of September 30, 2010, contributions of $64,800,000 to pension plans and $26,900,000 to other postretirement plans have been made.   (8)   SHORT-TERM DEBT   In June 2009, the Company entered into a $2,000,000,000 Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 11, 2010. This line of credit was replaced on June 11, 2010 by a $1,000,000,000 Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 10, 2011. No amounts were outstanding under this facility at September 30, 2010.   The Company had outstanding commercial paper of $552,463,000 at September 30, 2010 and $135,498,000 at December 31, 2009.                         (9)           LONG-TERM DEBT   Based on rates for comparable instruments the approximate fair value and related carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt, including current maturities, were as follows:   (In thousands)      On June 11, 2010, the Company entered into a $1,000,000,000 Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 11, 2013. No amounts were outstanding under this facility at September 30, 2010.   (10)           SEGMENT INFORMATION   See Management’s Discussion and Analysis for information regarding operating revenues and operating income for the Company’s segments.                       Item 2 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis   CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   The Company’s consolidated results of operations for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010 and 2009 were as follows:        In the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, the changes in revenues and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:           Three Months Ended September 30       Nine Months Ended September 30           % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)       % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)           Operating Revenues       Operating Margins       Operating Revenues       Operating Margins      Base business:                            Revenue change/Operating leverage      11.2  %     2.9  %     11.4  %     3.3  %   Changes in variable margins and overhead costs      —       (1.3  )     —       1.4     Total      11.2       1.6       11.4       4.7                                         Acquisitions and divestitures      3.5       (0.3  )     2.8       (0.2  )   Restructuring costs      —       0.6       —       0.8     Impairment of goodwill and intangibles      —       0.3       —       0.9     Translation      (2.4  )     0.2       1.6       —     Other      (0.1  )     —       (0.2  )     —     Total      12.2  %     2.4  %     15.6  %     6.2  %     Operating Revenues Revenues increased 12.2% and 15.6% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, respectively, versus 2009 primarily due to higher base revenues and revenues from acquisitions. The effect of currency translation was unfavorable for the quarter but remained favorable for the year-to-date period. Base revenues increased 11.2% and 11.4% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, respectively, versus 2009 as the Company saw improvement in macroeconomic data across many worldwide end markets. North American base revenues increased 11.5% and 11.6% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, while international base revenues increased 10.8% and 11.0% in the same periods. End markets associated with transportation, industrial packaging, welding and PC board/electronics showed strength in the quarter and year-to-date periods.   Operating Income Operating income increased $156.9 million and $867.5 million in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, respectively, versus 2009 primarily due to the increase in base revenues, lower restructuring expenses, income from acquisitions and lower goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. Base margins increased 160 basis points in the third quarter primarily due to the positive leverage effect of the increase in base revenues partially offset by unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons. For the year-to-date period, base margins increased 470 basis points primarily due to the positive leverage effect from the increase in base revenues and the cumulative benefits of restructuring projects, partially offset by unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons. In the prior year, the Company recorded a $12 million goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $90 million.                         The reconciliation of segment operating revenues to total operating revenues is as follows:        TRANSPORTATION   Businesses in this segment produce components, fasteners, fluids and polymers, as well as truck remanufacturing and related parts and service.       In the Transportation segment, products and services include:    •   metal and plastic components, fasteners and assemblies for automobiles and light trucks;    •   fluids and polymers for auto aftermarket maintenance and appearance;    •   fillers and putties for auto body repair;    •   polyester coatings and patch and repair products for the marine industry; and    •   truck remanufacturing and related parts and service.      This segment primarily serves the automotive original equipment manufacturers and tiers and automotive aftermarket markets.   The results of operations for the Transportation segment for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010 and 2009 were as follows:                                In the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, the changes in revenues and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:           Three Months Ended September 30       Nine Months Ended September 30           % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)       % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)           Operating Revenues       Operating Margins       Operating Revenues       Operating Margins      Base business:                            Revenue change/Operating leverage      15.8  %     3.7  %     25.1  %     6.2  %   Changes in variable margins and overhead costs      —       (1.4  )     —       2.8     Total      15.8       2.3       25.1       9.0                                         Acquisitions and divestitures      3.2       0.2       2.2       0.2     Restructuring costs      —       0.3       —       1.4     Impairment of goodwill and intangibles      —       1.9       —       0.8     Translation      (2.6  )     —       0.8       (0.2  )   Other      (0.1  )     0.1       (0.1  )     (0.1  )   Total      16.3  %     4.8  %     28.0  %     11.1  %     Operating Revenues Revenues increased 16.3% and 28.0% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, respectively, versus 2009 primarily due to the increase in base revenues and revenues from acquisitions, partially offset by a year-to-date decline in revenue for the truck remanufacturing business. In addition, the effect of currency translation was unfavorable for the quarter, but remained favorable for the year-to-date period. The increase in acquisition revenue is primarily due to the purchase of a North American automotive aftermarket business in the second quarter of 2010. North American automotive base revenues increased 28.5% and 49.3% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, respectively, due to a year-to-date increase in car builds. International automotive base revenues increased 15.5% and 33.6%, respectively, due to a year-to-date increase in European car builds. The automotive aftermarket businesses, which were less impacted in 2009 by the economic downturn, decreased in the third quarter by 2.5% and were virtually flat for the year-to-date period.   Operating Income Operating income increased $38.5 million and $225.6 million in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, respectively, primarily due to the increase in base revenues, lower operating costs and 2009 goodwill impairment charges. During the third quarter of 2009, a $12.0 million goodwill impairment charge was recorded in the truck remanufacturing business. Base margins increased 230 basis points in the third quarter primarily as a result of positive leverage from the increase in base revenues partially offset by unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons and higher overhead costs. For the year-to-date period, base margins increased 900 basis points primarily due to the positive leverage effect of increased base revenues, restructuring benefits, and favorable inventory obsolescence expense comparisons, partially offset by unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons.

The results of operations for the Food Equipment segment for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010 and 2009 were as follows:        In the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, the changes in revenues and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:           Three Months Ended September 30       Nine Months Ended September 30           % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)       % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)           Operating Revenues       Operating Margins       Operating Revenues       Operating Margins      Base business:                            Revenue change/Operating leverage      1.4  %     0.4  %     (1.2  )%     (0.4  )%   Changes in variable margins and overhead costs      —       0.2       —       0.3     Total      1.4       0.6       (1.2  )     (0.1  )                                       Restructuring costs      —       (0.4  )     —       0.7     Translation      (3.6  )     0.3       0.5       0.1     Other      (0.1  )     (0.1  )     —       0.1     Total      (2.3  )%     0.4  %     (0.7  )%     0.8  %     Operating Revenues Revenues decreased 2.3% in the third quarter of 2010 versus 2009, primarily due to the unfavorable effect of currency translation partially offset by a 1.4% increase in base revenues. Revenues decreased 0.7% in the year-to-date period of 2010, primarily due to a 1.2% decrease in base revenues partially offset by the favorable effect of currency translation. North American base revenues were virtually flat in the third quarter and declined 2.1% for the year-to date period, primarily due to declines in the lodging and casino markets. Base revenues in the service portion of the business increased 3.6% and 2.5% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively. International base revenues increased 2.7% in the third quarter while declining 0.2% for the year-to date period largely due to strong Asian revenue offset in the year-to-date period by lower European equipment sales in 2010 versus 2009.                         Operating Income Operating income increased $0.3 million and $8.9 million in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, respectively, versus 2009. In the third quarter, the positive leverage effect of increased revenues was partially offset by higher restructuring costs. For the year-to-date period, lower restructuring and operating expenses were partially offset by the negative leverage effect of lower revenues. Base margins remained relatively flat in the third quarter and year-to-date periods as operating margin improvements in the International businesses were offset by higher North American overhead spend.

Revenues increased 1.3% in the year-to-date period primarily due to a modest increase in base revenues and a year-to-date favorable effect of currency translation. Base revenues increased 5.0% and 2.2% for the North American laminate businesses in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to improvement in the office equipment end market. Base revenues for the flooring business declined 57.4% and 25.4% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, as the Company is in the process of closing its flooring business. International base revenues increased 4.9% and 0.7% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to improvements in Asian markets.   Operating Income Operating income decreased $0.7 million and $8.5 million in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, respectively, versus 2009 primarily due to higher operating costs and increased restructuring costs. Base margins were flat in the third quarter as the positive leverage effect of the increase in base revenues was offset by higher operating expenses. For the year-to-date period, base margins decreased as a second quarter fixed asset impairment, unfavorable depreciation comparisons, and unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons offset the benefits of restructuring projects and the positive leverage of the increase in base revenues.

The results of operations for the All Other segment for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010 and 2009 were as follows:        In the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, the changes in revenues and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:           Three Months Ended September 30       Nine Months Ended September 30           % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)       % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)           Operating Revenues       Operating Margins       Operating Revenues       Operating Margins      Base business:                            Revenue change/Operating leverage      13.7  %     3.8  %     10.3  %     3.1  %   Changes in variable margins and overhead costs      —       (2.7  )     —       0.6     Total      13.7       1.1       10.3       3.7                                         Acquisitions and divestitures      7.5       (0.6  )     6.7       (0.7  )   Restructuring costs      —       1.4       —       1.3     Impairment of goodwill and intangibles      —       (0.1  )     —       —     Translation      (2.7  )     0.1       0.4       —     Other      0.1       (0.1  )     —       —     Total      18.6  %     1.8  %     17.4  %     4.3  %                           Operating Revenues Revenues increased 18.6% and 17.4% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, respectively, versus 2009 primarily due to an increase in base revenues and revenues from acquisitions, partially offset in the third quarter by the unfavorable effect of currency translation. The acquisition revenue is primarily due to the purchase of two consumer packaging businesses and a marking business. Base revenues increased 9.9% and 7.3% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, for the consumer packaging business largely as a result of increased revenues in the graphics and decorating end markets. Base revenues for the industrial plastics and metals businesses improved 18.6% and 17.8% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, due to increased demand for domestic appliances. Base revenues increased 8.9% and 3.8% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, for the test and measurement businesses due to increased demand for capital equipment. Base revenues increased 31.0% and 16.1%, respectively, for the finishing businesses due to improved international end market demand.   Operating Income Operating income increased $36.7 million and $152.2 million in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, respectively, versus 2009 primarily due to growth in base revenues. Base margins increased 110 basis points in the third quarter as the positive leverage effect of the increase in base revenues was partially offset by unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons and higher operating expenses. For the year-to-date period, base margins increased by 370 basis points as benefits from past restructuring projects offset the unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons. In addition, lower restructuring costs increased total operating margins 140 and 130 basis points in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively. Acquisitions diluted total operating margins 60 and 70 basis points in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively.   AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS   Amortization expense increased to $159.1 million in the first nine months of 2010 versus $152.1 million in the first nine months of 2009, due to intangible amortization related to newly acquired businesses.   IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS   During 2009, the Company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment assessment from the first quarter to the third quarter. The Company performed an impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter of 2010 which resulted in immaterial intangible asset impairment charges. Total goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges by segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 were as follows:       (In thousands)      Nine Months Ended               September 30, 2009       Transportation      $   14,414       Industrial Packaging         386       Food Equipment         46       Power Systems & Electronics         24,766       Polymers & Fluids         60,416       All Other         1,969             $   101,997         Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets was $102.0 million in the first nine months of 2009, primarily due to goodwill impairment charges in the first quarter of 2009 related to the pressure sensitive adhesives reporting unit of $60.0 million and the PC board fabrication reporting unit of $18.0 million. A goodwill impairment charge of $12.0 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to the truck remanufacturing reporting unit.   See the Goodwill and Intangible Assets note for further details of the impairment charges.   INTEREST EXPENSE   Interest expense increased to $131.4 million in the first nine months of 2010 from $121.0 million in the first nine months of 2009 primarily due to interest on the 6.25% and 5.15% notes issued in March 2009, partially offset by lower interest related to the 5.75% notes repaid at maturity in March 2009 and lower commercial paper borrowings and rates.   OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)   Other income (expense) was income of $27.6 million for the first nine months of 2010 versus expense of $13.0 million in 2009, primarily due to gains on disposal of operating affiliates and gains on investments in 2010 versus losses in 2009.                     INCOME TAXES   The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2010 was 32.2% which included the discrete tax charges of $21.9 million in the first quarter of 2010 related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2010 decreased compared to 38.9% for the first nine months of 2009. The decrease in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from the impairment of non-deductible goodwill and discrete tax adjustments recorded in the first nine months of 2009.   The Company is litigating its dispute with the Australian Tax Office over the treatment of an intercompany financing transaction between the U.S. and Australia. The Company’s dispute was heard before the Federal Court of Australia in September 2010. The Company expects a judgment by the end of 2010. The Company has recorded its best estimate of the exposure for this audit; however, depending upon the outcome, the Company could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on its tax provision of approximately $173.2 million. See the Income Tax note for further details regarding this matter.   INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS   Income from continuing operations was $1.1 billion ($2.25 per diluted share) in the first nine months of 2010 compared to the 2009 income from continuing operations of $473.9 million ($0.95 per diluted share).   FOREIGN CURRENCY   The weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in 2010 increased operating revenues for the first nine months of 2010 by approximately $202 million and increased net income by approximately 6 cents per diluted share.   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS   Loss from discontinued operations was $34.3 million in the first nine months of 2009 primarily due to the loss on sale of the Click Commerce industrial software business of $29.6 million.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and short-term credit facilities. Management continues to believe that internally generated cash flows will be adequate to service debt, continue to pay dividends, to finance internal growth and to fund small to medium-sized acquisitions.   The primary uses of liquidity are:     ·     dividend payments – the Company’s dividend payout guidelines were revised in the third quarter of 2010 from 25% to 35% of the last two years’ average income from continuing operations to 30% to 45% of the last two years’ average free operating cash flow;        ·     acquisitions; and        ·     any excess liquidity may be used for share repurchases. The Company’s open-ended share repurchase program allows it flexibility in achieving the targeted debt-to-capital ratio.      Cash Flow   The Company uses free operating cash flow to measure normal cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.                         Summarized cash flow information for the third quarter of 2010 and 2009 was as follows:        On August 20, 2007 the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, which provides for the buyback of up to $3.0 billion of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time. In the first nine months of 2010, the Company repurchased approximately 8.1 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $43.29 per share. As of September 30, 2010 there are approximately $871.0 million of authorized repurchases remaining under this program.   Return on Average Invested Capital   The Company uses return on average invested capital (“ROIC”) to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. The Company believes that ROIC is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company’s operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the year and at the end of each quarter. For the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010 and 2009, ROIC was as follows:        The 390 basis point increase in ROIC in the third quarter of 2010 was the result of after-tax operating income increasing 34.3%, primarily due to an increase in base business, while average invested capital increased slightly.                       The 680 basis point increase in ROIC for year-to-date 2010 was the result of after-tax operating income increasing 81.2%, primarily due to an increase in base business, while average invested capital increased slightly.   In the first quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a discrete tax charge of $21.9 million. The ROIC calculation has been adjusted to exclude this item to improve comparability and better reflect the return on invested capital for the periods presented. A reconciliation of the tax rate as reported to the tax rate used above is as follows:       (Dollars in thousands)         Operating Income         Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes            Income Taxes            Tax Rate       As reported      $   1,777,190      $   1,673,399         $   539,000            32.2   %    Discrete tax adjustments         —         —            (21,881   )         (1.3   )%    As adjusted      $   1,777,190      $   1,673,399         $   517,119            30.9   %      In the first quarter of 2009, the Company incurred significant charges for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $90.0 million that was mostly non-deductible and discrete tax items of $27.8 million. The ROIC calculation has been adjusted to exclude these items to improve comparability and better reflect the return on invested capital for the 2009 year-to-date period presented above. A reconciliation of 2009 year-to-date operating income and the tax rate as reported to operating income after taxes and tax rate used above is as follows:       (Dollars in thousands)         Operating Income         Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes            Income Taxes            Tax Rate       As reported      $   909,724      $   775,691         $   301,800            38.9   %    Goodwill and intangible asset impairments         89,997         89,997            5,058            (3.1   )%    Discrete tax adjustments         —         —            (27,800   )         (3.6   )%    As adjusted      $   999,721      $   865,688         $   279,058            32.2   %      Working Capital   Management uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the Company. Net working capital at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 is summarized as follows:        Short-term debt increased primarily due to issuances of commercial paper to fund stock repurchases, dividend payments, and general corporate purposes partially offset by excess cash flows generated from operations used to pay down commercial paper. Inventories and trade receivables increased primarily as a result of increased sales and acquisitions, partially offset by foreign currency translation. Other current liabilities decreased primarily due to lower income taxes payable and foreign currency translation.                       Debt   Total debt at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 was as follows:        The Company had outstanding commercial paper of $552.5 million at September 30, 2010 and $135.5 million at December 31, 2009.   In June 2009, the Company entered into a $2.0 billion Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 11, 2010. This line of credit was replaced on June 11, 2010 by a $1.0 billion Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 10, 2011 and a $1.0 billion Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 11, 2013. No amounts were outstanding under these facilities at September 30, 2010.   The Company believes that based on its current free operating cash flow, debt-to-capitalization ratios and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary. The Company's targeted debt-to-capital ratio is 20% to 30%, excluding the impact of any larger acquisitions.   Stockholders’ Equity   The changes to stockholders’ equity during 2010 were as follows:   (In thousands)     Total stockholders’ equity, December 31, 2009      $   8,817,876       Net income         1,134,399       Stock option and restricted stock activity         106,643       Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments, net of tax         17,945       Noncontrolling interest         376       Cash dividends declared         (480,476   )    Repurchases of common stock         (350,000   )    Currency translation adjustments         (356,001   )    Total stockholders’ equity, September 30, 2010      $   8,890,762         FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that may be identified by the use of words such as “believe,” “expect,” “plans,” “strategy,” “prospects,” “estimate,” “project,” “target,” “anticipate,” “guidance,” and other similar words, including, without limitation, the adequacy of internally generated funds and credit facilities, the meeting of dividend payout objectives, the ability to fund debt service obligations, the availability of additional financing, expected contributions to the Company’s pension and postretirement plans and the estimated timing and amount related to the resolution of tax matters.

Part II – Other Information   Item 2 – Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds   On August 20, 2007, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, which provides for the buyback of up to $3.0 billion of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time.
