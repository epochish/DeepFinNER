In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in the Company’s 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform with current year reporting.(2)    Discontinued OperationsThe Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term objectives. As a result, the Company may commit to a plan to exit or dispose of certain businesses and present them as discontinued operations. The following summarizes the Company’s discontinued operations.Third Quarter 2013 Discontinued Operations - In the third quarter of 2013, the Company committed to a plan to sell the Industrial Packaging business and began classifying this business as held for sale. The Industrial Packaging business was sold in the second quarter of 2014.In the third quarter of 2013, the Company also committed to a plan for the divestiture of a construction business previously included in the Construction Products segment. This business was classified as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013 and was sold in the second quarter of 2014.First Quarter 2013 Discontinued Operations - In the first quarter of 2013, the Company committed to a plan for the divestiture of a construction distribution business previously included in the Construction Products segment. This business was classified as held for sale beginning in the first quarter of 2013 and was sold in the second quarter of 2014.As of the second quarter of 2014, the Company had completed the divestiture of all of the businesses previously reported as discontinued operations.Results of the discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2014 were as follows:In millionsThree Months Ended March 31, 2014Operating revenues$586  Income before income taxes$72Income tax expense(27)Income from discontinued operations$45In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for reporting discontinued operations. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in a company's operations and financial results should be reported as discontinued operations, with expanded disclosures. In addition, disclosure of the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of an organization that does not qualify as a discontinued operation is required. The Company adopted this new guidance effective January 1, 2015. The new guidance applies prospectively to new disposals and new classifications of disposal groups held for sale after such date. As a result, this guidance did not have any impact on the Company's financial statements or related disclosures upon adoption. (3)    Income TaxesThe Company files tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions including the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, German Fiscal Authority, French Fiscal Authority, and Australian Tax Office, and a number of these audits are currently ongoing, which may increase the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits in future periods. The Company has 6recorded its best estimate of the potential exposure for these issues. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the amount of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits may be decreased by approximately $68 million related predominantly to various intercompany transactions. The Company has recorded its best estimate of the potential exposure for these issues.On February 18, 2014, the Company received a Notice of Deficiency (“NOD”) from the IRS asserting that a non-taxable return of capital received from a subsidiary was a taxable dividend distribution. The NOD assesses additional taxes of $70 million for the 2006 tax year, plus interest and penalties. In May 2014, the Company petitioned the United States Tax Court to challenge the NOD. The Company's petition was subsequently denied and the case will proceed to court. Although the outcome of this process cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes it will be successful in defending its positions. Accordingly, no reserve has been recorded related to this matter.(4)    InventoriesInventories as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were as follows: (5)    Retirement Plans and Postretirement BenefitsPension and other postretirement benefit costs related to both continuing and discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, were as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, In millionsPension Other Postretirement Benefits 2015 2014 2015 2014Components of net periodic benefit cost:       Service cost$18 $20 $3 $3Interest cost23 26 6 6Expected return on plan assets(38) (40) (6) (6)Amortization of actuarial (gain) loss15 12 — (2)Net periodic benefit cost$18 $18 $3 $1Amounts were included in the statement of income as follows:       Continuing operations$18 $16 $3 $1Discontinued operations— 2 — —Net periodic benefit cost$18 $18 $3 $1The Company expects to contribute approximately $100 million to its pension plans and $5 million to its other postretirement plans in 2015. As of March 31, 2015, contributions of $27 million to pension plans and $1 million to other postretirement plans have been made.7(6)    DebtShort-term debt as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 included commercial paper of $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.  The approximate fair value and related carrying value of the Company's total long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt presented as short-term debt, as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were as follows: The approximate fair values of the Company's long-term debt, including current maturities, were based on a Level 2 valuation model, using observable inputs which included market rates for comparable instruments for the respective periods.(7)    Accumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeThe following table summarizes changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014: Three Months EndedIn millionsMarch 31, 2015 2014Beginning balance$(658) $384    Foreign currency translation adjustments during the period(527) 28Foreign currency translation adjustments reclassified to income— —Income taxes(50) —Total foreign currency translation adjustments(577) 28    Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments during the period(2) —Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income15 10Income taxes(4) (2)Total pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments9 8    Ending balance$(1,226) $420Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income primarily relate to the amortization of actuarial (gain) loss and prior service cost. Refer to the Retirement Plans and Postretirement Benefits note for additional information. The Company designated the €1.0 billion of Euro notes issued in May 2014 as a hedge of a portion of its net investment in Euro-denominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations. Changes in the value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate have been recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive income. The unrealized gain recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income related to the net investment hedge was $293 million and $158 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.The ending balance of Accumulated other comprehensive income as of March 31, 2015 and 2014 consisted of cumulative translation adjustment expense of $842 million and income of $702 million, respectively, and unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefits costs, net of tax, of $384 million and $282 million, respectively.8(8)    Segment InformationThe Company has seven reportable segments: Automotive OEM; Test & Measurement and Electronics; Food Equipment; Polymers & Fluids; Welding; Construction Products; and Specialty Products. See Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information regarding operating revenues and operating income for the Company's segments.9Item 2 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsINTRODUCTIONManagement analyzes the Company's consolidated results of operations and the results of each segment by identifying the effects of changes in the results of the organic business (businesses that have been included in the Company's results of operations for more than 12 months), newly acquired and recently divested companies, restructuring costs, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, and currency translation on the operating revenues and operating income of each segment. The changes to operating income of organic businesses include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and changes in variable margins and overhead costs. Operating leverage is the estimated effect of the organic revenue volume changes on organic operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period. As manufacturing and administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing, the percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage is usually more than the percentage change in the revenues. Changes in variable margins and overhead costs represent the estimated effect of non-volume related changes in the operating income of organic businesses and may be driven by a number of factors, including changes in product mix, the cost of raw materials, labor and overhead, and pricing to customers. Selling price versus material cost comparisons represent the estimated net impact of increases or decreases in the cost of materials used in the Company's products versus changes in the selling price to the Company's customers. Management reviews these price versus cost comparisons by analyzing the net impact of changes to each segment's operating margin.ENTERPRISE STRATEGYIn 2012, the Company embarked on an Enterprise Strategy with the objective of fully leveraging ITW’s core capabilities to deliver strong financial performance. ITW’s Enterprise Strategy is centered on three key initiatives - portfolio management, business structure simplification, and strategic sourcing. These enterprise initiatives are expected to enhance the business through 2017 and are targeted at expanding organic revenue growth and improving profitability and returns.The foundation of this strategy is a set of business practices referred to as the ITW Business Model consisting of three core elements:80/20 Business Process - The concept of the 80/20 business process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value). The Company uses this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key drivers of business profitability, and as a result, reduces complexity that often creates unnecessary expense and disguises what is truly important. The Company utilizes the 80/20 process in all aspects of its business. Common applications of the 80/20 business process include:•Simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products offered by combining the features of similar products, outsourcing products or eliminating low-value products.•Segmenting the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers separately and finding alternative ways to serve the 20/80 customers.•Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.•Designing business processes, systems and measurements around the 80/20 activities.The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is that the Company has over time improved its long-term operating and financial performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs, and improve profitability and returns.Customer-Back Innovation - ITW’s customer-back approach to innovation builds on the Company’s 80/20 business process to help ITW businesses focus on the most profitable customers and invent solutions to solve their specific problems. ITW businesses are focused on building relationships with these major customers to develop deep knowledge and insight around their needs. These customer insights and learnings drive innovation at ITW. Decentralized Entrepreneurial Culture - ITW businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the ITW Business Model to customize their approach in order to best serve their customers. This leads to a focused and simple organizational structure that can deliver operational excellence adapted to their customers and end markets.10KEY INITIATIVESITW’s Enterprise Strategy is centered on three key initiatives - portfolio management, business structure simplification, and strategic sourcing. These enterprise initiatives are expected to enhance the business through 2017 and are targeted at expanding organic revenue growth and improving profitability and returns.Portfolio Management - The Company's portfolio management initiative aims to construct a business portfolio that leverages the Company’s differentiated business model and growth potential. As part of this initiative, the Company reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its long-term objectives. As a result, the Company's divestiture activity increased in 2012, 2013 and 2014. With the sale of the Company's former Industrial Packaging segment on May 1, 2014, the divestiture element of the Company's portfolio management initiative is essentially complete. The Company has historically acquired businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms. Going forward, the Company will emphasize organic growth, while acquisitions will be targeted to bolt-on acquisitions that support and accelerate organic growth in existing segments, and new platforms that expand the Company’s long-term growth and earnings potential. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 1 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the Company’s discontinued operations.Another key aspect of the portfolio management initiative is the focus on product line and customer base simplification. Product line and customer base simplification focuses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines. Product line and customer base simplification is a core element of the Company's 80/20 business process.  In the short-term, product line and customer base simplification may result in a decrease in revenue and overhead costs while improving operating margin. Over the long-term, product line and customer base simplification results in growth in revenue, profitability and returns, and is key to improving the Company's long-term operating and financial performance.Business Structure Simplification - The business structure simplification initiative simplifies the Company's organizational model and adds scale to the Company's operating divisions in order to increase organic revenue growth, enhance global competitiveness and drive operational efficiencies. This initiative focuses on reducing the number of the Company's operating divisions and increasing the average revenue size of each division, while retaining the positive attributes of a decentralized operating model. The Company expects to enhance its profitability and returns through a combination of applying its 80/20 business process to the new divisions, more focused growth investments and reduced infrastructure.Strategic Sourcing - The Company's strategic sourcing initiative focuses on building sourcing capability in order to leverage purchasing scale to enhance profitability and global competitiveness. It incorporates both enterprise-level and segment-level purchasing that cross the Company's many businesses.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSThe Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term objectives. As a result, the Company may commit to a plan to exit or dispose of certain businesses and present them as discontinued operations. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for discussion of the Company's discontinued operations.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe Company’s consolidated results of operations for the first quarter of 2015 and 2014 were as follows:11In the first quarter of 2015, the changes in operating revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: Three Months Ended March 31 % Increase (Decrease) % Point          Increase (Decrease) Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating MarginsOrganic0.7 % 11.3% 2.0%Acquisitions and divestitures(0.3) (0.1) —Restructuring costs— 1.0 0.2Translation(6.8) (7.8) —Total(6.4)% 4.4% 2.2%Operating RevenuesOperating revenues decreased 6.4% in the first quarter of 2015 versus 2014 primarily due to the unfavorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by an increase in organic revenues. The unfavorable effect of currency translation decreased operating revenues by 680 basis points due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, negatively impacting all segments. Total organic revenues increased 0.7% primarily due to growth in the Automotive OEM and Food Equipment segments, partially offset by declines in the Specialty Products and Welding segments. Organic revenue growth was impacted by weaker demand in some of the Company's equipment related businesses. Product line and customer base simplification activities associated with the portfolio management component of the Company's enterprise strategy reduced organic revenue growth by approximately one percentage point. North American organic revenues increased 0.8% primarily due to growth in the Food Equipment and Automotive OEM segments, partially offset by a decline in the Specialty Products segment. International organic revenues increased 0.5% versus the prior year. European organic revenues increased 1.3% primarily due to growth in the Automotive OEM segment, partially offset by declines in the Specialty Products, Polymers & Fluids and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments. Asia Pacific organic revenues increased 1.1% primarily due to growth in China in the Automotive OEM segment and Australia and New Zealand in the Construction Products segment, partially offset by declines in the Welding and Polymers & Fluids segments. South American organic revenues declined 10.8% primarily due to weaker end market demand in Brazil. Operating IncomeOperating income increased 4.4% in the first quarter of 2015 versus 2014 primarily due to the favorable net impact of changes in variable margins and overhead costs, an increase in organic revenues and lower restructuring expenses, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation of 780 basis points. Operating margins in the first quarter of 2015 were 20.9%, an increase of 220 basis points. Total organic business margins increased 200 basis points primarily due to the benefits of the Company's enterprise initiatives related to strategic sourcing and business structure simplification, which contributed 100 basis points of margin improvement, as well as cost management and the benefits of product line and customer base simplification of 60 basis points, the positive operating leverage effect of the increase in organic revenues of 20 basis points and favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons of 20 basis points. Lower restructuring expenses increased total operating margins by 20 basis points. 12RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENTTotal operating revenues were as follows:Total operating income was as follows:AUTOMOTIVE OEMBusinesses in this segment produce components and fasteners for automotive-related applications.In the Automotive OEM segment, products and services include:•plastic and metal components, fasteners and assemblies for automobiles, light trucks, and other industrial uses.This segment primarily serves the automotive original equipment manufacturers and tiers market. 13The results of operations for the Automotive OEM segment for the first quarter of 2015 and 2014 were as follows:In the first quarter of 2015, the changes in operating revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: Three Months Ended March 31 % Increase (Decrease) % Point          Increase (Decrease) Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating MarginsOrganic6.7 % 13.9% 1.6%Acquisitions and divestitures(0.4) (0.1) —Restructuring costs— 0.5 0.1Translation(8.4) (9.2) —Total(2.1)% 5.1% 1.7%Operating RevenuesOperating revenues decreased 2.1% in the first quarter of 2015 versus 2014 primarily due to the unfavorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by an increase in organic revenues.

Higher restructuring expenses diluted total operating margins by 50 basis points.  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETSAmortization expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 decreased to $59 million versus $62 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2014 primarily due to fully amortized intangible assets.INTEREST EXPENSEInterest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 decreased to $54 million versus $64 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2014 due to debt repayments, partially offset by 2014 debt issuances at lower interest rates. 21OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)Other income (expense) was income of $21 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 versus income of $9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million gain on the sale of a business, partially offset by an $8 million increase in an equity investment loss in the first quarter of 2015.INCOME TAXESThe effective tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 was 31.0% and 30.0%, respectively. FOREIGN CURRENCYFor the first quarter of 2015, the weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar decreased operating revenues by approximately $243 million (680 basis points) and decreased Income from continuing operations by approximately $37 million ($0.10 per diluted share) versus the first quarter of 2014.INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSAs of the second quarter of 2014, the Company had completed the divestiture of all the businesses previously classified as discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations was $45 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 1 – Financial Statements for further details regarding the Company’s discontinued operations.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for revenue recognition. The core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, several new revenue recognition disclosures will be required. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017. In April 2015, the FASB proposed delaying the effective date of this guidance by one year. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact the guidance will have upon adoption.In April 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to simplify the balance sheet presentation of debt issuance costs. Under the new guidance, debt issuance costs will be presented as a reduction of the carrying amount of the debt liability. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016 and will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. As of March 31, 2015, the Company had $39 million of deferred debt issuance costs. The Company does not expect adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe Company’s primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and short-term credit facilities. In addition, the Company had $2.7 billion of cash on hand at March 31, 2015 and also maintains strong access to public debt markets. Management believes that these sources are sufficient to service debt and to finance the Company's capital allocation priorities, which include:•investment in existing businesses to fund internal growth;•payment of an attractive dividend to shareholders;•share repurchases; and•acquisitions.The Company believes that, based on its revenues, operating margins, current free operating cash flow, and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary.Cash FlowThe Company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and 22equipment. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.Summarized cash flow information for the first quarter of 2015 and 2014 were as follows:Stock Repurchase ProgramsOn August 2, 2013, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provided for the buyback of up to $6.0 billion of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2013 Program”). Under the 2013 Program, the Company repurchased approximately 18.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $80.94 in the first quarter of 2014, approximately 17.2 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $86.01 in the second quarter of 2014, approximately 5.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $85.35 in the third quarter of 2014, approximately 8.9 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $90.81 in the fourth quarter of 2014, and approximately 14.9 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $96.84 in the first quarter of 2015. The 2013 Program was completed in the first quarter of 2015.On February 13, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to $6.0 billion of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2015 Program”). Under the 2015 Program, the Company repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $97.19 in the first quarter of 2015. As of March 31, 2015, there was approximately $5.8 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2015 Program.Adjusted Return on Average Invested CapitalThe Company uses adjusted return on average invested capital ("adjusted ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. Adjusted ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations, as well as the Company's net investment in the former Industrial Packaging segment and the equity investment in the Wilsonart business (formerly the Decorative Surfaces segment). Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter.23Adjusted ROIC for the first quarter of 2015 and 2014 was as follows:The annualized adjusted ROIC increase of 210 basis points for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of a 2.9% improvement in after-tax operating income and an 8.4% decrease in adjusted average invested capital. Working CapitalManagement uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the Company. Net working capital as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 is summarized as follows:The decrease in net working capital as of March 31, 2015 was primarily driven by lower cash and equivalents and higher short-term commercial paper borrowings which were used to fund $1.5 billion of cash paid for share repurchases in the first quarter.24Cash and equivalents totaled approximately $2.7 billion as of March 31, 2015 and $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2014, primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries. The reduction in cash on hand was primarily driven by the share repurchases discussed above. Cash and cash equivalents held internationally may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the U.S. Cash balances held internationally are typically used for international operating needs, reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses, used to fund new international acquisitions, or used to repay debt held internationally. In the U.S., the Company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs which primarily consist of dividend payments, share repurchases, acquisitions, servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs. The Company also uses its commercial paper program, which is backed by long-term credit facilities, for short-term liquidity needs. The Company believes cash generated domestically and liquidity provided by the Company's commercial paper program will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the U.S.DebtTotal debt as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was as follows:Short-term debt as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 included commercial paper of $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Total Debt to EBITDAThe Company uses the ratio of total debt to EBITDA to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. The Company believes that total debt to EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to EBITDA. EBITDA and the ratio of total debt to EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. The ratio of total debt to EBITDA represents total debt divided by income from continuing operations before interest expense, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis.Total debt to EBITDA for the trailing twelve month periods ended March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was as follows:25Stockholders’ EquityThe changes to stockholders’ equity during 2015 were as follows:In millions   Total stockholders’ equity, December 31, 2014$6,824Net income458Cash dividends declared(179)Repurchases of common stock(1,602)Stock option and restricted stock activity50Currency translation adjustments(577)Other8Total stockholders’ equity, March 31, 2015$4,982FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
