In August 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the divestiture of the Click Commerce industrial software business which was previously reported in the All Other segment. In the second quarter of 2009, the Company completed the sale of the Click Commerce business.  In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company classified an automotive components business and a consumer packaging business as held for sale. The consumer packaging business was sold in the second quarter of 2008. The Company sold the automotive components business in the third quarter of 2009.  In May 2009, the Company’s Board of Directors rescinded a resolution from August 2008 to divest the Decorative Surfaces segment. The consolidated financial statements and related notes for all periods have been restated to present the results related to the Decorative Surfaces segment as continuing operations.  Results of the discontinued operations were as follows:      (In       thousands)            Three       Months Ended September       30            Nine       Months Ended September       30                               2009            2008            2009            2008             Operating       revenues            $   2,794            $   25,420            $   25,963            $   98,861                                                                                                                                            Loss       before taxes                     (1,043   )            (10,218   )            (36,107   )            (103,439   )    Income       tax (expense) benefit                     497                     (850   )            1,825                     40             Loss       from discontinued operations            $   (546   )   $   (11,068   )   $   (34,282   )   $   (103,399   )     In 2009, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss on the disposal of the Click Commerce business of $29,626,000. Loss before taxes in 2008 includes goodwill impairment charges of $132,700,000 related to the Click Commerce business and a pre-tax gain on the disposal of the consumer packaging business of $25,062,000.                      (4)           INCOME TAXES  In the first nine months of 2009, the Company incurred significant charges related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $101,997,000 that were mostly non-deductible, and discrete tax items of $46,849,000 to record reserves for tax contingencies related to audits and valuation allowances on net operating loss carryforwards no longer expected to be utilized. The components of the effective tax rate for the nine month period ended September 30, 2009 were as follows:      Effective       tax rate excluding discrete items   29.6   %    Discrete       tax adjustments   6.0             Goodwill       and intangible asset impairment charges   3.3             Effective       tax rate   38.9   %     The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions and a number of these audits are currently ongoing.  As part of the Australia, Germany and U.S. tax audits, the tax authorities are reviewing several items, the most significant of which are related to financing transactions, leveraged leases and mortgage-backed securities. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that it will resolve the matters currently under consideration within the next 12 months, and that the amount of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by a range of approximately $270 million up to $580 million. The Company has recorded its best estimate of the exposure for these issues.  (5)           INVENTORIES  Inventories at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 were as follows:  (In thousands)                          (6)           GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  Goodwill represents the excess cost over fair value of the net assets of purchased businesses. The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. The Company performs an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives based on the fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset.  In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new accounting guidance on fair value measurements. The Company adopted these provisions on January 1, 2009 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The new accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants and provides guidance for measuring fair value and the necessary disclosures.  When performing its annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company compares the estimated fair value of each of its 62 reporting units to the carrying value. Fair values are determined primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows based either on current operating cash flows or on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant reporting unit. The Company also considers additional valuation techniques, such as market multiples from similar transactions and quoted market prices of relevant public companies. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill.  The Company’s indefinite-lived intangibles consist of trademarks and brands. The fair values of these intangibles are determined based on a relief-of-royalty income approach derived from internally forecasted revenues of the related products. If the fair value of the trademark or brand is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the intangible.  In the first quarter of 2009, the Company performed its annual impairment testing of its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in compliance with the newly adopted fair value measurement provisions which resulted in goodwill impairment charges of $60,000,000 related to the pressure sensitive adhesive reporting unit in the Polymers & Fluids segment and $18,000,000 related to the PC board fabrication reporting unit in the Power Systems & Electronics segment.  Also in the first quarter of 2009, intangible asset impairments of $11,997,000 were recorded to reduce to the estimated fair value the carrying value of certain trademarks and brands with indefinite lives. Approximately $5,800,000 of this charge related to the PC board fabrication reporting unit and the remainder to various trademarks and brands of other reporting units.  In the third quarter of 2009, the Company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment assessment from the first quarter to the third quarter. This constitutes a change in the method of applying an accounting principle that the Company believes is preferable.  The change was made to better align the timing of the Company’s goodwill impairment assessment with the Company’s annual business planning and forecasting process. The Company performed an impairment assessment of its goodwill in the third quarter which resulted in an impairment charge of $12,000,000 related to the truck remanufacturing and parts/service reporting unit in the Transportation segment.    The goodwill impairments in the first and third quarters were related to new reporting units which were acquired over the last few years before the recent economic downturn. These charges were driven by lower current forecasts compared to the expected forecasts at the time the reporting units were acquired.  A summary of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that were adjusted to fair value and the related impairment charges included in earnings for 2009 is as follows:      (In       thousands)                     Book       Value                       Fair       Value                     Total       Impairment Charges             First       quarter 2009:                                                                                              Goodwill                     $353,000                     $275,000                     $78,000             Indefinite-lived       intangible assets                     94,973                     82,976                     11,997                                                                                                                 Third       quarter 2009:                                                                                              Goodwill                     $96,000                     $84,000                     $12,000                                                                                                                                       (7)RETIREMENT PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS  Pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:      (In       thousands)            Three       Months Ended September       30            Nine       Months Ended September       30                               Pension            Other       Postretirement Benefits            Pension            Other       Postretirement Benefits                               2009            2008            2009            2008            2009            2008            2009            2008             Components       of net periodic benefit cost:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Service       cost            $   24,724            $   28,144            $   3,142            $   3,585            $   73,157            $   84,153            $   9,426            $   10,755             Interest       cost                     30,350                     30,042                     7,718                     8,091                     89,280                     90,361                     23,154                     24,524             Expected       return on plan assets                     (39,078   )            (42,045   )            (3,403   )            (3,848   )            (114,963   )            (126,581   )            (10,209   )            (11,544   )    Amortization       of actuarial                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       (gain)       loss                     2,093                     649                     64                     (204   )            6,230                     1,938                     192                     (708   )    Amortization       of prior service                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       (income)       cost                     (391   )            (602   )            1,606                     1,565                     (1,191   )            (1,804   )            4,818                     4,695             Amortization       of net transition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       amount                     34                     25                     —                     —                     110                     70                     —                     —             Settlement/curtailment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       (income)       loss                     —                     12,900                     —                     —                     (12,345   )            12,900                     —                     (1,929   )    Net       periodic benefit cost            $   17,732            $   29,113            $   9,127            $   9,189            $   40,278            $   61,037            $   27,381            $   25,793              The Company expects to contribute approximately $218,000,000 to its pension plans and $38,000,000 to its other postretirement plans in 2009.

Item 2 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  In 2007, the Company classified an automotive components business and a consumer packaging business as discontinued operations. Additionally, in 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the divestiture of the Click Commerce industrial software business which was previously reported in the All Other segment. The consolidated statements of income, statements of financial position, the notes to financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis for all periods have been restated to present the results related to all of these businesses as discontinued operations. See the Discontinued Operations note for further information on the Company’s discontinued operations.  In May 2009, the Company’s Board of Directors rescinded a resolution from August 2008 to divest the Decorative Surfaces segment. The consolidated financial statements, the notes to financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis for all periods have been restated to present the results related to the Decorative Surfaces segment as continuing operations.  The Company’s consolidated results of operations for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009 and 2008 were as follows:      (Dollars       in thousands)            Three       Months Ended September       30            Nine       Months Ended September       30                               2009            2008            2009            2008             Operating       revenues            $   3,580,354            $   4,464,621            $   10,119,639            $   13,146,312             Operating       income                     483,595                     670,998                     909,724                     2,046,788             Margin       %                     13.5   %            15.0   %            9.0   %            15.6   %     In the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:          Three       Months Ended September 30       Nine       Months Ended September 30                 %       Increase (Decrease)       %       Point Increase (Decrease)       %       Increase (Decrease)       %       Point Increase (Decrease)                 Operating       Revenues       Operating       Income       Operating       Margins       Operating       Revenues       Operating       Income       Operating       Margins      Base       manufacturing business:                                        Revenue       change/Operating                                        leverage      (17.9        )%     (48.4        )%     (5.6        )%     (20.9        )%     (55.5        )%     (6.8        )%   Changes       in variable margins                                                    and       overhead costs      —       31.7       5.8       —       17.6       3.5     Total      (17.9        )     (16.7        )     0.2       (20.9        )     (37.9        )     (3.3        )                                                             Acquisitions       and divestitures      3.6       1.4       (0.4        )     5.0       (0.1        )     (0.6        )   Restructuring       costs      —       (4.0        )     (0.7        )     —       (4.9        )     (1.0        )   Impairment       of goodwill                                                    and       intangibles      —       (1.8        )     (0.3        )     —       (4.9        )     (1.0        )   Translation      (5.6        )     (6.8        )     (0.3        )     (7.2        )     (7.7        )     (0.7        )   Other      0.1       —       —       0.1       (0.1        )     —     Total      (19.8        )%     (27.9        )%     (1.5        )%     (23.0        )%     (55.6        )%     (6.6        )%    Operating Revenues Revenues decreased 19.8% and 23.0% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009, respectively, primarily due to lower base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, mainly due to the strengthening of the Dollar, partially offset by revenues from acquisitions. Total base revenues declined 17.9% and 20.9% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, but showed improvement as compared to the second quarter 2009. North American base revenue declined 21.6% and 24.8%, in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, while international base revenues declined 13.8% and 16.7% in the same periods. Both North American and international base revenues were adversely affected by weak, but improving macroeconomic and industrial production trends as compared to the second quarter 2009. The Company anticipates that the current weak global economic environment will continue through 2009 and as such, expects that key end markets will continue to be negatively impacted.                      Operating Income Operating income declined 27.9% and 55.6% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009, respectively, primarily due to the decline in base revenues, the negative effect of currency translation, increased restructuring charges and increased goodwill and intangible impairment charges. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company recorded impairment charges of $78 million and $12 million against goodwill and intangibles, respectively, and in the third quarter recorded a $12 million goodwill impairment charge. The goodwill and intangible impairments were primarily related to new reporting units which were acquired over the last few years. These charges were driven by lower current forecasts compared to the expected forecasts at the time the reporting units were acquired. The higher restructuring charges reflect the Company’s efforts to reduce costs in response to current economic conditions. Improvements in base variable margins and lower overhead costs increased base margins 5.8% and 3.5% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, as the cumulative benefits of past restructuring projects began to be more fully realized and price versus raw material cost comparisons were favorable. Total margins declined by 1.5% and 6.6% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009, respectively, primarily due to the declines in base revenues, restructuring charges and the goodwill and intangible impairment charges.  The reconciliation of segment operating revenues to total operating revenues is as follows:      INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING  Businesses in this segment produce steel, plastic and paper products used for bundling, shipping and protecting goods in transit.      In       the Industrial Packaging segment, products include:    •   steel       and plastic strapping and related tools and equipment;    •   plastic       stretch film and related equipment;    •   paper       and plastic products that protect goods in transit; and    •   metal       jacketing and other insulation products.     This segment primarily serves the primary metals, general industrial, construction, and food and beverage markets.  The results of operations for the Industrial Packaging segment for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009 and 2008 were as follows:      (Dollars       in thousands)            Three       Months Ended September       30            Nine       Months Ended September       30                               2009            2008            2009            2008             Operating       revenues            $   489,506            $   694,322            $   1,375,987            $   2,042,058             Operating       income                     37,193                     77,422                     50,856                     241,122             Margin       %                     7.6   %            11.2   %            3.7   %            11.8   %                         In the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:          Three       Months Ended September 30       Nine       Months Ended September 30                 %       Increase (Decrease)       %       Point Increase (Decrease)       %       Increase (Decrease)       %       Point Increase (Decrease)                 Operating       Revenues       Operating       Income       Operating       Margins       Operating       Revenues       Operating       Income       Operating       Margins      Base       manufacturing business:                                        Revenue       change/Operating                                        leverage      (23.3        )%     (83.6        )%     (8.8        )%     (24.7        )%     (86.6        )%     (9.7        )%   Changes       in variable margins                                                    and       overhead costs      —       45.9       6.7       —       21.8       3.4     Total      (23.3        )     (37.7        )     (2.1        )     (24.7        )     (64.8        )     (6.3        )                                                             Acquisitions      0.9       0.8       —       0.8       (0.4        )     (0.1        )   Restructuring       costs      —       (5.2        )     (0.8        )     —       (3.5        )     (0.6        )   Translation      (7.1        )     (9.8        )     (0.7        )     (8.8        )     (10.2        )     (1.2        )   Other      —       (0.1        )     —       0.1       —       0.1     Total      (29.5        )%     (52.0        )%     (3.6        )%     (32.6        )%     (78.9        )%     (8.1        )%    Operating Revenues Revenues decreased 29.5% and 32.6% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009, respectively, primarily due to lower base revenues and the unfavorable impact of currency translation. Base revenues declined 27.0% and 29.7% for the North American industrial packaging businesses in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, largely due to declines in consumable and equipment volume in key end markets such as primary metals, construction-related materials and manufacturing. The international industrial packaging businesses declined 25.0% and 25.6%, respectively, in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, as both were adversely affected by the continued global decline in industrial production and construction industries.  Operating Income Operating income decreased 52.0% and 78.9% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009, respectively, primarily due to the negative leverage effect of the decline in base revenues described above, the negative effect of currency translation and higher restructuring charges. Improvements in base variable margins and overhead costs increased margins 6.7% and 3.4% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, as price versus raw material cost comparisons were favorable and benefits of past restructuring projects began to be realized.  Total operating margins declined by 3.6% and 8.1% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, mainly due to the declines in base revenues.  POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS  Businesses in this segment produce equipment and consumables associated with specialty power conversion, metallurgy and electronics.      In       the Power Systems & Electronics segment, products     include:    •   arc       welding equipment;    •   metal       arc welding consumables and related accessories;    •   metal       solder materials for PC board fabrication;    •   equipment       and services for microelectronics assembly;    •   electronic       components and component packaging; and    •   airport       ground support equipment.                         This segment primarily serves the general industrial, electronics and construction markets.  The results of operations for the Power Systems & Electronics segment for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009 and 2008 were as follows:      (Dollars       in thousands)            Three       Months Ended September       30            Nine       Months Ended September       30                               2009            2008            2009            2008             Operating       revenues            $   405,764            $   620,743            $   1,199,681            $   1,851,919             Operating       income                     69,954                     118,910                     156,474                     385,797             Margin       %                     17.2   %            19.2   %            13.0   %            20.8   %     In the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:          Three       Months Ended September 30       Nine       Months Ended September 30                 %       Increase (Decrease)       %       Point Increase (Decrease)       %       Increase (Decrease)       %       Point Increase (Decrease)                 Operating       Revenues       Operating       Income       Operating       Margins       Operating       Revenues       Operating       Income       Operating       Margins      Base       manufacturing business:                                        Revenue       change/Operating                                        leverage      (34.2        )%     (64.8        )%     (8.9        )%     (34.3        )%     (61.8        )%     (8.7        )%   Changes       in variable margins                                                    and       overhead costs      —       25.8       7.5       —       16.0       5.1     Total      (34.2        )     (39.0        )     (1.4        )     (34.3        )     (45.8        )     (3.6        )                                                             Acquisitions      2.4       1.2       (0.3        )     2.5       (1.1        )     (0.8        )   Restructuring       costs      —       (0.6        )     (0.2        )     —       (3.5        )     (1.1        )   Impairment       of goodwill                                                    and       intangibles      —       —       —       —       (6.2        )     (2.0        )   Translation      (2.8        )     (2.8        )     (0.1        )     (3.4        )     (2.9        )     (0.2        )   Other      —       —       —       —       0.1       (0.1        )   Total      (34.6        )%     (41.2        )%     (2.0        )%     (35.2        )%     (59.4        )%     (7.8        )%    Operating Revenues Revenues declined 34.6% and 35.2% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009, respectively, mainly due to declines in base revenues and the negative effect of currency translation. Revenues fell as end market demand continued to decline across the broad spectrum of industries that this segment serves, including key end markets such as commercial construction and manufacturing. The revenue decrease was partially offset by 2008 acquisitions, including a welding equipment business and a PC board fabrication business. Worldwide base welding revenues declined 36.2% in the third quarter and 34.9% year-to-date. North American welding businesses declined 40.0% and 39.1% while international base businesses declined 26.7% and 23.5%, in the respective periods. Base revenues for the electronics businesses fell 32.6% and 36.6% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, while base revenues in the PC board fabrication businesses fell 42.3% and 52.1% in the same periods, both largely due to the decline in consumer demand for electronics.  Operating Income Operating income decreased 41.2% and 59.4% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009, respectively, primarily due to the declines in base revenues described above, first quarter 2009 impairment charges, higher restructuring charges and the negative effect of currency translation. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $18.0 million and $6.7 million, respectively, were incurred in the PC board fabrication and welding accessories businesses in the first quarter of 2009. Total operating margins declined by 2.0% and 7.8% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to the declines in base revenues and higher year-to-date impairment and restructuring charges. Improvements in variable margins and overhead expenses, including favorable price versus raw material cost comparisons and benefits of prior restructuring projects, increased operating margins by 7.5% and 5.1% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively.                     TRANSPORTATION  Businesses in this segment produce components, fasteners, fluids and polymers, as well as truck remanufacturing and related parts and service.

Acquisition revenue partially mitigated the base revenue decrease and was primarily related to the purchase of a North American truck remanufacturing and parts/service business in the third quarter of 2008. Worldwide automotive base revenues declined 9.7% and 28.9% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, as automotive production continued to be lower than last year, but better than the first and second quarters of 2009. North American automotive base revenues declined 14.3% and 33.6% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, on declines of 21% and 41% in North American auto builds in the same periods. Despite the year-over-year declines, the third quarter improved as compared to the second quarter 2009 due to the “cash for clunkers” program. International automotive base revenues declined 4.7% and 24.3% for the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, on declines in car builds of 7% and 21%. The automotive aftermarket businesses declined 4.5% in the third quarter and 9.2% year-to-date as a result of a continued decline in discretionary consumer spending.  Operating Income Operating income decreased 17.0% and 75.1% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009, respectively, primarily due to the decline in base revenues described above, higher restructuring costs and the unfavorable effect of currency translation. In addition, a $12 million goodwill impairment charge was recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to the North American truck remanufacturing and parts/service business. The increase in restructuring charges is primarily due to continued efforts to reduce costs in response to current economic conditions and the decline in worldwide automotive production. Total operating margins declined by 1.3% and 10.0% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to the decline in base revenues described above. Improvements in variable margins and overhead expenses, including favorable price versus raw material cost comparisons and benefits of prior restructuring projects, increased operating margins by 5.4% and 1.5% in the same periods.  FOOD EQUIPMENT  Businesses in this segment produce commercial food equipment and related service.      In       the Food Equipment segment, products include:    •   warewashing       equipment;    •   cooking       equipment, including ovens, ranges and broilers;    •   refrigeration       equipment, including refrigerators, freezers and prep     tables;    •   food       processing equipment, including slicers, mixers and scales;       and    •   kitchen       exhaust, ventilation and pollution control   systems.     This segment primarily serves the food institutional/restaurant, service and food retail markets.  The results of operations for the Food Equipment segment for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009 and 2008 were as follows:      (Dollars       in thousands)            Three       Months Ended September       30            Nine       Months Ended September       30                               2009            2008            2009            2008             Operating       revenues            $   487,325            $   542,687            $   1,369,878            $   1,590,905             Operating       income                     83,661                     88,193                     186,492                     232,184             Margin       %                     17.2   %            16.3   %            13.6   %            14.6   %                          In the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:          Three       Months Ended September 30       Nine       Months Ended September 30                 %       Increase (Decrease)       %       Point Increase (Decrease)       %       Increase (Decrease)       %       Point Increase (Decrease)                 Operating       Revenues       Operating       Income       Operating       Margins       Operating       Revenues       Operating       Income       Operating       Margins      Base       manufacturing business:                                        Revenue       change/Operating                                        leverage      (6.3        )%     (16.0        )%     (1.7        )%     (8.0        )%     (22.6        )%     (2.3        )%   Changes       in variable margins                                                    and       overhead costs      —       19.5       3.4       —       13.5       2.1     Total      (6.3        )     3.5       1.7       (8.0        )     (9.1        )     (0.2        )                                                             Acquisitions      1.6       1.0       (0.1        )     1.5       (0.1        )     (0.2        )   Restructuring       costs      —       (3.6        )     (0.6        )     —       (2.5        )     (0.4        )   Translation      (5.5        )     (6.0        )     (0.1        )     (7.4        )     (7.9        )     (0.2        )   Other      —       —       —       —       (0.1        )     —     Total      (10.2        )%     (5.1        )%     0.9        %     (13.9        )%     (19.7        )%     (1.0        )%    Operating Revenues Revenues decreased 10.2% and 13.9% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009, respectively, primarily due to the decline in base business and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by revenues from acquisitions. The acquired revenues were attributable to the acquisition of a European food equipment business. North American food equipment base revenues declined 8.0% and 10.0%, respectively, for the third quarter and year-to-date periods, while international food equipment base revenues declined 4.9% and 6.9% in the same periods. Base revenues for the North American institutional/restaurant businesses declined 7.9% and 13.0% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, as customers delayed equipment purchases. Base service revenues were flat in the third quarter and declined 1.4% for the year-to-date period as customers continued to maintain existing equipment.  Operating Income Operating income declined 5.1% and 19.7% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to the decrease in base revenues described above and the unfavorable effect of currency translation and restructuring. Total operating margins increased 0.9% in the third quarter and decreased 1.0% year-to-date primarily due to the decline in base revenues offset in the third quarter by margin gains due to favorable price versus raw material cost comparisons, favorable product mix and benefits from restructuring. For the year-to-date period, lower operating costs did not fully offset the effect of lower base revenues.  CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS  Businesses in this segment produce tools, fasteners and other products for construction applications.      In       the Construction Products segment, products include:    •   fasteners       and related fastening tools for wood applications;    •   anchors,       fasteners and related tools for concrete applications;    •   metal       plate truss components and related equipment and software;     and    •   packaged       hardware, fasteners, anchors and other products for   retail.     This segment primarily serves the residential construction, renovation construction and commercial construction markets.                      The results of operations for the Construction Products segment for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009 and 2008 were as follows:      (Dollars       in thousands)            Three       Months Ended September       30            Nine       Months Ended September       30                               2009            2008            2009            2008             Operating       revenues            $   402,459            $   525,005            $   1,097,191            $   1,575,211             Operating       income                     43,712                     75,040                     55,230                     207,263             Margin       %                     10.9   %            14.3   %            5.0   %            13.2   %     In the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:          Three       Months Ended September 30       Nine       Months Ended September 30                 %       Increase (Decrease)       %       Point Increase (Decrease)       %       Increase (Decrease)       %       Point Increase (Decrease)                 Operating       Revenues       Operating       Income       Operating       Margins       Operating       Revenues       Operating       Income       Operating       Margins      Base       manufacturing business:                                        Revenue       change/Operating                                        leverage      (16.5        )%     (50.7        )%     (5.9        )%     (19.9        )%     (64.4        )%     (7.3        )%   Changes       in variable margins                                                    and       overhead costs      —       22.6       3.9       —       10.4       1.7     Total      (16.5        )     (28.1        )     (2.0        )     (19.9        )     (54.0        )     (5.6        )                                                             Acquisitions      0.9       (0.4        )     (0.2        )     0.7       (0.9        )     (0.2        )   Restructuring       costs      —       (2.9        )     (0.5        )     —       (3.6        )     (0.6        )   Translation      (7.8        )     (10.4        )     (0.8        )     (11.1        )     (14.9        )     (1.7        )   Other      0.1       0.1       0.1       —       —       (0.1        )   Total      (23.3        )%     (41.7        )%     (3.4        )%     (30.3        )%     (73.4        )%     (8.2        )%    Operating Revenues Revenues declined 23.3% and 30.3% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009, respectively, primarily as a result of the decline in base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Base revenues for the North American, European and Asia-Pacific regions decreased 27.3%, 22.0% and 0.1%, respectively, during the third quarter while declining 30.8%, 27.3% and 2.3% year-to-date. These declines in base revenues were the result of ongoing weakness in the residential and commercial construction markets in North America and Europe. North American housing starts declined 32% on an annualized basis in the third quarter. In addition, U.S. commercial construction activity fell 48% year-to-date. The European and Asia-Pacific regions continued to show weakening demand, primarily in the commercial construction category.  Operating Income Operating income decreased 41.7% and 73.4%, respectively, in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009, primarily due to the base revenue decline described above. In addition, the unfavorable effect of currency translation and higher restructuring charges contributed to the lower income and margins. Total margins declined 3.4% and 8.2% as reduced operating expenses, including favorable price versus raw material cost comparisons and benefits from past restructuring projects, were more than offset by the effect of lower base revenues.

Acquisition revenue was primarily the result of the purchase of a pressure sensitive adhesives business and two construction adhesives businesses in 2008. Total base revenues declined 13.9% and 15.1% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to continued weakness in worldwide industrial production and slow recovery in MRO market demand. Worldwide base revenue for the fluids businesses declined 11.9% and 15.8% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, while base revenues for the polymers businesses declined 16.8% and 17.3% in the same periods.                      Operating Income Operating income decreased 9.7% and 81.3% in the third quarter  and year-to-date periods of 2009, respectively, primarily due to the decline in base revenues, the unfavorable effect of currency translation and a $60.0 million goodwill impairment charge against the pressure sensitive adhesive business in the first quarter of 2009. Base operating margins increased 1.8% in the third quarter and declined 0.9% year-to-date as the third quarter benefited from savings from prior period restructuring projects and favorable price versus raw material cost comparisons. The first quarter 2009 goodwill impairment charge reduced year-to-date margins by 7.7%. Additionally, acquisitions had no margin affect in the third quarter and diluted margins 1.2% year-to-date.

North American laminate base revenues declined 20.6% and 19.8% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, as a result of the continued downturn in North American commercial and residential construction. These declines were partially offset by product penetration in the premium high-definition laminate product market. International base revenues declined 10.7% and 11.8% in the same periods due to European volume declines.  Operating Income Operating income increased 1.9% in the third quarter of 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the 5.2% increase in base operating income resulting from favorable price versus raw material cost comparisons, restructuring benefits and lower pension expense. Year-to-date operating income decreased 17.1% primarily due to the decline in year-to-date revenues and the negative effect of currency translation.

The acquisition revenue was primarily related to the purchase of two test and measurement businesses in 2008. Third quarter base revenues declined 21.8%, 36.6%, 11.7% and 21.8% for the industrial plastics and metals, finishing, consumer packaging and test and measurement businesses, respectively, due to negative, but improved as compared to the second quarter 2009, industrial production trends and the related impact of weak end market demand across the broad spectrum of industries this segment serves. Year-to-date base revenue declines for the previously mentioned businesses were 24.5%, 33.4%, 13.2% and 17.0%, respectively.  Operating Income Operating income declined 28.4% and 40.4% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009, respectively, primarily due to the decline in base revenues described above, higher restructuring charges and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by increased income from acquisitions. Total operating margins declined by 3.1% and 5.5% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to the negative margin effect of lower revenues, higher restructuring charges and lower margins for acquired businesses. Base margins were flat in the third quarter and declined 2.5% year-to-date as favorable price versus raw material cost comparisons and benefits from past restructuring projects were offset by the impact of lower base revenues.  AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  Amortization expense increased to $152.1 million in the first nine months of 2009 versus $132.9 million in the first nine months of 2008 due to intangible amortization related to newly acquired businesses in the second half of 2008.                     In the third quarter of 2009, the Company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment assessment from the first quarter to the third quarter. The Company performed an impairment assessment of its goodwill in the third quarter which resulted in an impairment charge of $12 million related to the truck remanufacturing and parts/service reporting unit in the Transportation segment. Total goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges by segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:      (In       thousands)            Nine       Months Ended September       30                               2009            2008             Industrial       Packaging            $   386            $   —             Power       Systems & Electronics                     24,766                     824             Transportation                     14,414                     13             Food       Equipment                     46                     —             Polymers       & Fluids                     60,416                     251             All       Other                     1,969                     350                               $   101,997            $   1,438              See the Goodwill and Intangible Assets note for further details of the impairment charges.  INTEREST EXPENSE  Interest expense increased to $121.0 million in the first nine months of 2009 from $112.3 million in the first nine months of 2008 due to interest on the 5.15% and 6.25% notes which were issued on March 23, 2009, partially offset by lower interest related to the 6.875% notes and 5.75% bonds repaid at maturity on November 17, 2008 and March 2, 2009, respectively, and lower commercial paper rates.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  Other income (expense) was expense of $13.0 million for the first nine months of 2009 versus income of $19.9 million in 2008, primarily due to investment and currency translation losses in 2009 versus gains in 2008, and lower interest income in 2009, partially offset by a charge for German transfer taxes in 2008.  INCOME TAXES  The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2009 was 38.9% compared to 28.9% for the first nine months of 2008. The increase in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from the impairment of non-deductible goodwill and discrete tax adjustments in 2009. See the Income Taxes note for further details.  INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  Income from continuing operations of $473.9 million ($0.95 per diluted share) in the first nine months of 2009 was 65.9% lower than the 2008 income from continuing operations of $1.4 billion ($2.64 per diluted share).  FOREIGN CURRENCY  The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in 2009 decreased operating revenues for the first nine months of 2009 by approximately $766 million and decreased income from continuing operations by approximately 11 cents per diluted share.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  Loss from discontinued operations was $34.3 million in the first nine months of 2009 compared to $103.4 million in 2008. In 2009, the Company incurred a loss on the sale of the Click Commerce industrial software business of $29.6 million. The Company incurred higher losses in 2008 due to impairment of Click Commerce goodwill of $132.7 million partially offset by the gain on the disposal of the consumer packaging business of $25.1 million.                      LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and short-term credit facilities. The Company’s targeted debt-to-capital ratio is 20% to 30%, excluding the impact of any larger acquisitions.   The primary uses of liquidity are:     ·     dividend       payments – the Company’s dividend payout guidelines are 25% to 35% of the       last two years’ average income from continuing   operations;        ·     acquisitions;       and        ·     any       excess liquidity may be used for share repurchases. The Company’s       open-ended share repurchase program allows it flexibility in achieving the       targeted debt-to-capital ratio.     The Company believes that based on its current free operating cash flow, debt-to-capitalization ratios and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary.  Cash Flow  Free operating cash flow is used by management to measure normal cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.  Summarized cash flow information for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009 and 2008 was as follows:      (In       thousands)            Three       Months Ended September       30            Nine       Months Ended September       30                               2009            2008            2009            2008             Net       cash provided by operating activities            $   569,196            $   688,759            $   1,640,279            $   1,632,787             Additions       to plant and equipment                     (53,015   )            (89,308   )            (174,353   )            (274,295   )    Free       operating cash flow            $   516,181            $   599,451            $   1,465,926            $   1,358,492                                                                                                                                            Acquisition       of businesses            $   (4,702   )   $   (646,045   )   $   (118,342   )   $   (1,324,239   )    Purchase       of investments                     (5,802   )            (641   )            (36,676   )            (3,109   )    Proceeds       from sale of operations and affiliates                     631                     105,358                     16,316                     106,364             Cash       dividends paid                     (154,892   )            (145,423   )            (464,399   )            (440,229   )    Issuance       of common stock                     39,373                     10,138                     55,328                     45,333             Repurchases       of common stock                     —                     (406,009   )            —                     (991,583   )    Net       proceeds (repayments) of debt                     (104,832   )            737,040                     (874,438   )            1,272,616             Other                     40,495                     (26,425   )            156,191                     16,449             Net       increase in cash and equivalents            $   326,452            $   227,444            $   199,906            $   40,094              On August 20, 2007 the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, which provides for the buyback of up to $3.0 billion of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time. There are approximately $1.2 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under this program.                      Return on Average Invested Capital  The Company uses return on average invested capital (“ROIC”) to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. We believe that ROIC is a meaningful metric to investors and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC.  ROIC for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009 and 2008 was as follows:      (Dollars       in thousands)            Three       Months Ended September       30            Nine       Months Ended September       30                               2009            2008            2009            2008                                                                                                                                            Operating       revenues            $   3,580,354            $   4,464,621            $   10,119,639            $   13,146,312             Tax       rate                     32.53   %            28.47   %            32.20   %            28.95   %    Operating       income after taxes            $   326,282            $   479,965            $   677,811            $   1,454,243             Invested       capital:                                                                                                                         Trade       receivables            $   2,410,667            $   3,157,344            $   2,410,667            $   3,157,344             Inventories                     1,361,201                     1,953,335                     1,361,201                     1,953,335             Net       plant and equipment                     2,107,103                     2,255,284                     2,107,103                     2,255,284             Investments                     456,450                     498,348                     456,450                     498,348             Goodwill       and intangible assets                     6,374,069                     6,492,799                     6,374,069                     6,492,799             Accounts       payable and accrued expenses                     (2,018,138   )            (2,363,267   )            (2,018,138   )            (2,363,267   )    Net       assets held for sale                     —                     114,634                     —                     114,634             Other,       net                     (455,078   )            (272,547   )            (455,078   )            (272,547   )    Total       invested capital            $   10,236,274            $   11,835,930            $   10,236,274            $   11,835,930             Average       invested capital            $   10,291,159            $   11,815,490            $   10,331,115            $   11,391,032             Annualized       return on average invested capital                     12.7   %            16.2   %            8.7   %            17.0   %     The ROIC decrease of 3.5% in the third quarter of 2009 was the result of after-tax operating income decreasing 32.0%, resulting from the current economic downturn, while average invested capital decreased 12.9%.  The ROIC decrease of 8.3% for year-to-date 2009 was the result of after-tax operating income decreasing 53.4%, resulting from the current economic downturn, while average invested capital decreased 9.3%.  In the first quarter of 2009, the Company incurred significant charges for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $90.0 million that was mostly non-deductible and discrete tax adjustments of $28.0 million. Since these charges were unusual, the ROIC calculation above has been adjusted to exclude these items to improve comparability and better reflect the return on invested capital for the 2009 year-to-date period presented above.

Debt  Total debt at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 was as follows:       (Dollars       in thousands)                     September       30, 2009                     December       31, 2008             Short-term       debt            $   67,460            $   2,433,973             Long-term       debt                     2,869,377                     1,247,883               Total       debt            $   2,936,837            $   3,681,856               Total       debt to capitalization                     26.3   %            32.4   %     The Company had no outstanding commercial paper at September 30, 2009 compared to $1.8 billion at December 31, 2008.  In 1999, the Company issued $500.0 million of 5.75% redeemable notes due March 1, 2009. These notes outstanding at December 31, 2008 were repaid at maturity.  On March 23, 2009, the Company issued $800.0 million of 5.15% redeemable notes due April 1, 2014 at 99.92% of face value and $700.0 million of 6.25% redeemable notes due April 1, 2019 at 99.98% of face value. The net proceeds from the offering were used to pay down the Company’s commercial paper balance.  On June 12, 2009 the Company entered into a $2.0 billion Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 11, 2010 which replaced the prior line of credit. No amounts were outstanding under this facility at September 30, 2009.

Further information about our critical accounting policies can be found in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated by our Current Report on Form 8-K filed August 7, 2009. There have not been any significant changes in these policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2009, except during the third quarter of 2009, the Company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment assessment from the first quarter to the third quarter. This change constitutes a change in the method of applying an accounting principle. For more information on this accounting change, see Note 6 in the Notes to Financial Statements.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that may be identified by the use of words such as “believe,” “expect,” “plans,” “strategy,” “prospects,” “estimate,” “project,” “target,” “anticipate,” “guidance,” and other similar words, including, without limitation, the ability to obtain additional financing, the adequacy of internally generated funds and credit facilities, the meeting of dividend payout objectives, the ability to fund debt service obligations and expected contributions to the Company’s pension and postretirement plans. These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Important risks that may influence future results include (1) a further downturn in the construction, general industrial, automotive or food institutional/restaurant and service markets, (2) changes or deterioration in international and domestic business and economic conditions, particularly in North America, Europe, Asia or Australia, (3) the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations and costs of raw materials, (4) decreases in credit availability, (5) an interruption in, or reduction in, introducing new products into the Company’s product lines, (6) an unfavorable environment for making acquisitions, domestic and international, including adverse accounting or regulatory requirements and market values of candidates, and (7) unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings. The risks covered here are not all inclusive and given these and other possible risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. A more detailed description of these risks is set forth in the Company’s Form 10-K for 2008, as updated by our Current Report on Form 8-K filed August 7, 2009.  The Company practices fair disclosure for all interested parties. Investors should be aware that while the Company regularly communicates with securities analysts and other investment professionals, it is against the Company’s policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Shareholders should not assume that the Company agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report.                      Item 3 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  INTEREST RATE RISK  The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's debt.  On March 23, 2009, the Company issued $800.0 million of 5.15% redeemable notes due April 1, 2014 at 99.92% of face value and $700.0 million of 6.25% redeemable notes due April 1, 2019 at 99.98% of face value. The estimated fair value of the 5.15% and 6.25% notes exceeded the carrying value by approximately $61.4 million and $90.7 million, respectively, at September 30, 2009.  Item 4 – Controls and Procedures  The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a–15(e)) as of September 30, 2009. Based on such evaluation, the Company’s Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2009, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  In connection with the evaluation by management, including the Company’s Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the quarter ended September 30, 2009 were identified that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
