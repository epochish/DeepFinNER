In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in the Company’s 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform with current year reporting.(2)    Discontinued OperationsThe Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term objectives. As such, the Company may commit to a plan to exit or dispose of certain businesses and present them as discontinued operations. The following summarizes the Company's discontinued operations.The Company has restated the statement of income and the notes to financial statements to present the operating results of the held for sale and previously divested businesses discussed below as discontinued operations.Third Quarter 2013 Discontinued Operations - In February 2013, the Company announced that it was initiating a review process to explore strategic alternatives for its Industrial Packaging segment. In September 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the Industrial Packaging segment. The Company classified the Industrial Packaging segment as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013.On February 6, 2014, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell its Industrial Packaging segment to The Carlyle Group for $3.2 billion. The transaction was completed on May 1, 2014, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $1.7 billion ($1.1 billion after tax) in the second quarter of 2014, and is subject to customary post-close adjustments. In the third quarter of 2013, the Company also committed to plans for the divestiture of a construction distribution business previously included in the Construction Products segment and a specialty coatings business previously included in the Polymers & Fluids segment. These businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013. The specialty coatings business was sold in the fourth quarter of 2013. The construction distribution business was sold in the second quarter of 2014.First Quarter 2013 Discontinued Operations - In the first quarter of 2013, the Company committed to plans for the divestiture of two transportation related businesses and a machine components business previously included in the Specialty Products segment, two construction distribution businesses previously included in the Construction Products segment, and a chemical manufacturing business previously included in the Polymers & Fluids segment. These businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the first quarter of 2013.The Company also reclassified certain previously divested businesses as discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2013. These included a consumer packaging business that was previously included in the Specialty Products segment, a packaging distribution business which was previously included in the former Industrial Packaging segment, and a welding manufacturing business previously included in the Welding segment.In the second quarter of 2013, the Company divested one of the held for sale transportation related businesses, the machine components business, and the chemical manufacturing business. In the third quarter of 2013, the Company divested the second held for sale transportation related business. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company divested one construction distribution business and the remaining construction distribution business was sold in the second quarter of 2014.6Results of the discontinued operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:Income before income taxes from discontinued operations was income of $1.8 billion and $50 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The income in the first six months of 2014 included the pre-tax gain of $1.7 billion ($1.1 billion after tax) on the sale of the Industrial Packaging segment recorded in the second quarter of 2014. Income tax expense in the first six months of 2014 includes $175 million of U.S. income tax expense related to the repatriation of approximately $1.3 billion of international proceeds from the sale of the Industrial Packaging segment. The income in the first six months of 2013 included a $42 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in connection with the anticipated sale of one of the transportation related businesses discussed above and loss reserves on assets held for sale of $67 million.There were no businesses classified as held for sale as of June 30, 2014. As of December 31, 2013, the assets and liabilities of the Industrial Packaging business and the two construction distribution businesses discussed above were included in assets and liabilities held for sale in the statement of financial position, as follows:(In millions) December 31, 2013Trade receivables$352Inventories244Net plant and equipment305Goodwill and intangible assets844Other91Total assets held for sale$1,836  Accounts payable$87Accrued expenses139Other91Total liabilities held for sale$317(3)    Gain on Acquisition of Controlling Interest in Equity InvestmentOn January 31, 2013, the Company acquired the controlling interest of an existing consumer packaging business in the Specialty Products segment previously accounted for under the equity method. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $30 million in Other income (expense) in the first quarter of 2013 as a result of remeasuring the Company's existing equity interest to fair value by determining the implied equity value using a Level 3 valuation method.(4)    Income TaxesThe Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions including the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, German Fiscal Authority, French Fiscal Authority, and Australian Tax Office and a number of these audits are currently ongoing, which may increase the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits in future periods. Due to the ongoing audits, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the amount of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits may be decreased by approximately $8 million related predominantly to various intercompany transactions. The Company has recorded its best estimate of the potential exposure for these issues.7On February 18, 2014, the Company received a Notice of Deficiency (“NOD”) from the IRS asserting that a non-taxable return of capital received from a subsidiary was a taxable dividend distribution. The NOD assesses additional taxes of $70 million for the 2006 tax year, plus interest and penalties. In May 2014, the Company petitioned the United States Tax Court to challenge the NOD. The Company's petition was subsequently denied and the case will proceed to court. Although the outcome of this process cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes it will be successful in defending its position.(5)    InventoriesInventories as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were as follows: (6)    Retirement Plans and Postretirement BenefitsPension and other postretirement benefit costs related to both continuing and discontinued operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, were as follows:In the second quarter of 2013, the Company recognized a $34 million pre-tax settlement charge tied primarily to higher lump sum pension payments related to the exit of Decorative Services employees from the Company's U.S. primary pension plan. The Company expects to contribute approximately $136 million to its pension plans and $7 million to its other postretirement plans in 2014. As of June 30, 2014, contributions of $111 million to pension plans and $3 million to other postretirement plans have been made.(7)    DebtShort-term debt represents obligations with a maturity date of one year or less and are stated at cost which approximates fair value. Short-term debt also includes current maturities of long-term debt. Short-term debt as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 included €750 million of 5.25% Euro notes which mature on October 1, 2014. In addition, at December 31, 2013, short-term debt included $800 million of 5.15% redeemable notes due April 1, 2014, which were repaid on the due date, and commercial paper of $1.7 billion. No commercial paper was outstanding as of June 30, 2014. 8On January 22, 2014, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion short-term line of credit agreement with a term of up to 364 days to provide additional liquidity under the Company's commercial paper program in order to fund short-term capital allocation needs. This short-term line of credit agreement was terminated on May 15, 2014.Long-term debt represents obligations with a maturity date greater than one year, and excludes current maturities that have been reclassified to short-term debt. In February 2014, the Company issued $650 million of 0.9% notes due February 25, 2017 at 99.861% of face value, $650 million of 1.95% notes due March 1, 2019 at 99.871% of face value, and $700 million of 3.5% notes due March 1, 2024 at 99.648% of face value. Net proceeds from the February 2014 debt issuance were used to repay commercial paper. In May 2014, the Company issued €500 million of 1.75% Euro notes due May 20, 2022 at 99.16% of face value and €500 million of 3.0% Euro notes due May 19, 2034 at 98.089% of face value. The carrying values of the Euro notes were $679 million and $672 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2014. Net proceeds from the May 2014 debt issuances were used for general corporate purposes. The Company designated the €1.0 billion of Euro notes as a hedge of a portion of its net investment in Euro-denominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations. Changes in the value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate have been recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive income. The unrealized gain recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income related to the net investment hedge was $1 million as of June 30, 2014.The Company has committed lines of credit of $2.5 billion in the U.S. to support its commercial paper program. In May 2014, the Company amended its financial covenants within these agreements. The previous financial covenant, limiting total debt to total capitalization, was replaced with a minimum interest coverage ratio. As of June 30, 2014, the Company was in compliance with this covenant and there were no amounts outstanding under these credit agreements.The approximate fair value and related carrying value of the Company's total long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt presented as short-term debt, as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were as follows: The approximate fair values of the Company's long-term debt, including current maturities, were based on a Level 2 valuation model, using observable inputs which included market rates for comparable instruments for the respective periods.(8)    Accumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeThe following table summarizes changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013:9Foreign currency translation adjustments reclassified to income are primarily related to the disposal of certain discontinued operations. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note for additional information. Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income represent the amortization of actuarial losses and prior service cost, and settlement loss/curtailment gain recognized in net periodic benefit cost. Refer to the Retirement Plans and Postretirement Benefits note for the amounts included in net periodic benefit cost. The ending balance of accumulated other comprehensive income as of June 30, 2014 and 2013 consisted of cumulative translation adjustment income of $652 million and $466 million, respectively, and unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefits costs, net of tax, of $293 million and $454 million, respectively.(9)    Segment InformationThe Company has seven reportable segments: Automotive OEM; Test & Measurement and Electronics; Food Equipment; Polymers & Fluids; Welding; Construction Products; and Specialty Products. See Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information regarding operating revenues and operating income for the Company's segments.10Item 2 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsIntroductionManagement analyzes the Company’s consolidated results of operations and the results of each segment by identifying the effects of changes in the results of the base businesses, newly acquired and recently divested companies, restructuring costs, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, and currency translation on the operating revenues and operating income of each segment. Base businesses are those businesses that have been included in the Company’s results of operations for more than 12 months. The changes to base business operating income include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and changes in variable margins and overhead costs. Operating leverage is the estimated effect of the base business revenue volume changes on operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period. As manufacturing and administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing, the percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage is usually more than the percentage change in the base business revenues. Changes in variable margins and overhead costs represent the estimated effect of non-volume related changes in base business operating income and may be driven by a number of factors, including changes in product mix, the cost of raw materials, labor and overhead, and pricing to customers. Selling price versus material cost comparisons represent the estimated net impact of increases or decreases in the cost of materials used in the Company’s products versus changes in the selling price to the Company’s customers. Management reviews these price versus cost comparisons by analyzing the net impact of changes to each segment’s operating margin.The discussion of operating results should be read in conjunction with Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.Enterprise StrategyDuring 2012, the Company embarked on an Enterprise Strategy that includes three key initiatives - portfolio management, business structure simplification, and strategic sourcing. These enterprise initiatives are expected to enhance the business through 2017 and are targeted at expanding organic revenue growth and improving profitability and returns.Portfolio Management - The Company's portfolio management initiative aims to construct a business portfolio that leverages the Company’s differentiated business model and growth potential. As part of this initiative, the Company reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its long-term objectives. As a result, the Company's divestiture activity increased in 2012, 2013 and 2014. With the sale of the Company's former Industrial Packaging segment on May 1, 2014, the Company's portfolio management initiative is essentially complete. The Company has historically acquired businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms. Going forward, the Company will emphasize organic growth and focus on acquisitions with sustainable differentiation and growth potential. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for discussion of the Company’s discontinued operations.Business Structure Simplification - The business structure simplification initiative simplifies the Company's organizational model and adds scale to the Company's operating divisions in order to increase organic revenue growth, enhance global competitiveness and drive operational efficiencies. This initiative focuses on reducing the number of the Company's operating divisions and increasing the average revenue size of each division, while retaining the positive attributes of a decentralized operating model. The Company expects to enhance its profitability and returns through a combination of applying its 80/20 business process to the new divisions, more focused growth investments and reduced infrastructure.Strategic Sourcing - The Company's strategic sourcing initiative focuses on building sourcing capability in order to leverage purchasing scale to enhance profitability and global competitiveness. It incorporates both enterprise-level and segment-level purchasing that cross the Company's many businesses. This initiative is expected to transform sourcing into a core strategic function in the Company.An integral part of the Company's 80/20 business process and enterprise strategy is the focus on product line and customer base simplification, or "PLS." PLS focuses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines. PLS is a core element of the Company's 80/20 business process and is key to improving the Company's long-term operating and financial performance.11Discontinued OperationsThe Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term objectives. As such, the Company may commit to a plan to exit or dispose of certain businesses and present them as discontinued operations. In February 2013, the Company announced that it was initiating a review process to explore strategic alternatives for the Industrial Packaging segment.

In the third quarter of 2013, the Company also committed to plans for the divestiture of a construction distribution business previously included in the Construction Products segment and a specialty coatings business previously included in the Polymers & Fluids segment. The construction distribution and specialty coatings businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013.In the first quarter of 2013, the Company committed to plans for the divestiture of two transportation related businesses and a machine components business previously included in the Specialty Products segment, two construction distribution businesses previously included in the Construction Products segment, and a chemical manufacturing business previously included in the Polymers & Fluids segment. These businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the first quarter of 2013. These held for sale businesses discussed above, as well as certain previously divested businesses, are reported as discontinued operations in the statement of income. All related prior period income statement information has been restated to conform to the current year reporting of these businesses. The Company has completed the divestiture of all of the businesses previously classified as discontinued operations. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for discussion of the Company’s discontinued operations.Consolidated Results of OperationsThe Company’s consolidated results of operations for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2014 and 2013 were as follows:12In the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2014, the changes in operating revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30 June 30 % Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Point          Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Point          Increase (Decrease) Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating Margins Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating MarginsBase business (organic):           Revenue change/Operating leverage1.4% 3.4% 0.4 % 2.3% 5.9% 0.6 %Changes in variable margins & overhead costs—% 13.7% 2.3 % —% 10.2% 1.7 % 1.4% 17.1% 2.7 % 2.3% 16.1% 2.3 %Acquisitions and divestitures1.2% 0.7% (0.1)% 1.3% 0.6% (0.2)%Restructuring costs—% 2.3% 0.4 % —% 1.4% 0.2 %Translation0.9% 1.1% — % 0.3% 0.4% 0.1 %Total3.5% 21.2% 3.0 % 3.9% 18.5% 2.4 %Operating RevenuesOperating revenues increased 3.5% and 3.9% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2014, respectively, versus 2013 primarily due to an increase in organic revenues, revenues from acquisitions and the favorable impact of currency translation. Total organic revenues increased 1.4% and 2.3% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, as worldwide demand was mixed. International organic revenues grew 1.8% and 4.0% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods. Asia Pacific organic revenues increased 6.5% and 6.8% in the respective periods, primarily due to growth in Automotive OEM in China and Construction Products in Australia. European organic revenues increased 0.6% and 2.6% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily driven by the Automotive OEM and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments, partially offset by Welding. North American organic revenues increased 1.2% and 1.1% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, as growth in the Automotive OEM, Food Equipment and Welding segments was partially offset by a decline in revenues in Polymers & Fluids due to ongoing product line and customer base simplification ("PLS") for each of the respective periods. The acquisitions of a European consumer packaging equipment business and a Chinese food equipment business completed in 2013 contributed 1.3% and 1.4% to revenues in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively. Operating IncomeOperating income increased 21.2% and 18.5% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2014, respectively, versus 2013 primarily due to changes in variable margins and overhead costs, higher organic revenues and lower restructuring expenses. In the second quarter of 2013, the Company recognized a $34 million pre-tax pension settlement charge tied primarily to higher lump-sum pension payments related to the exit of Decorative Surfaces employees. Total base operating margins increased 270 and 230 basis points in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, due to changes in variable margins and overhead costs and the positive operating leverage effect of the increase in organic revenues. The changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased base margins by 230 and 170 basis points in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively. The benefits of the Company's enterprise initiatives, business structure simplification and strategic sourcing, contributed 120 basis points of improvement in each respective period, and base margins were favorably impacted by 90 and 50 basis points in the respective periods due to the prior year pension settlement charge mentioned above. Lower restructuring expenses in the second quarter and year-to-date periods favorably impacted total operating margins by 40 and 20 basis points, respectively.13Results of Operations by SegmentTotal operating revenues are as follows:Total operating income is as follows:AUTOMOTIVE OEMBusinesses in this segment produce components and fasteners for automotive-related applications.In the Automotive OEM segment, products and services include:•plastic and metal components, fasteners and assemblies for automobiles, light trucks, and other industrial uses.This segment primarily serves the automotive original equipment manufacturers and tiers, and automotive aftermarket markets.The results of operations for the Automotive OEM segment for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2014 and 2013 were as follows:14In the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2014, the changes in operating revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30 June 30 % Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Point          Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Point          Increase (Decrease) Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating Margins Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating MarginsBase business (organic):           Revenue change/Operating leverage7.8% 14.2% 1.2% 10.3% 19.0% 1.6%Changes in variable margins & overhead costs—% 6.9% 1.3% —% 6.2% 1.1% 7.8% 21.1% 2.5% 10.3% 25.2% 2.7%Acquisitions and divestitures—% —% —% —% —% —%Restructuring costs—% 2.7% 0.5% —% 2.7% 0.5%Translation1.4% 1.9% 0.1% 1.0% 1.5% 0.1%Total9.2% 25.7% 3.1% 11.3% 29.4% 3.3%Operating RevenuesOperating revenues increased 9.2% and 11.3% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2014, respectively, versus 2013 due to the increase in organic revenues and the favorable effect of currency translation. As a result of product penetration gains, worldwide automotive organic revenue grew 7.8% and 10.3% for the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, exceeding worldwide auto builds, which grew 2% and 4% over the respective periods. North American automotive organic revenues grew 7.7% and 9.2% for the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, as North American auto builds increased 4% versus each of the respective prior year periods.

The income from discontinued operations in 2013 included a $42 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in connection with the anticipated sale of one of the transportation related businesses and loss reserves on assets held for sale of $67 million. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 1 – Financial Statements for further details regarding the Company’s discontinued operations.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIn March 2013, new accounting guidance was issued which clarifies that an entity should release cumulative translation adjustments into net income when the entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business within a foreign entity, which is consistent with the Company's prior accounting policy. The new guidance became effective for the Company on January 1, 2014 and did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.In April 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for reporting discontinued operations. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in a company's operations and financial results should be reported as discontinued operations, with expanded disclosures. In addition, disclosure of the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of an organization that does not qualify as a discontinued operation is required. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2015. The guidance applies prospectively to new disposals and new classifications of disposal groups held for sale after the effective date. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, the guidance will have upon adoption.In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for revenue recognition. The core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, several new revenue recognition disclosures will be required. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact the guidance will have upon adoption.24LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe Company’s primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and short-term credit facilities. In addition, the Company had $5.3 billion of cash on hand at June 30, 2014 and also maintains strong access to public debt markets. Management believes that these sources are sufficient to service debt and to finance the Company's capital allocation priorities, which include:•investment in existing businesses to fund internal growth;•payment of an attractive dividend to shareholders;•share repurchases; and•acquisitions.In September 2013, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the Industrial Packaging segment. The Company classified the Industrial Packaging segment as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013 and no longer presented this segment as part of its continuing operations. As to the impact of this divestiture on the Company’s income per share from continuing operations and capital structure going forward, the Company also indicated that it intended to repurchase approximately 50 million shares through a program utilizing its existing share repurchase authorization to offset the full amount of divestiture-related dilution of income per share from continuing operations through a combination of sale proceeds, free operating cash flow and additional leverage. The Company completed this program in the second quarter of 2014. Under this program, the Company repurchased approximately 14.0 million shares of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2013, approximately 18.5 million shares of its common stock in the first quarter of 2014, and approximately 17.2 million shares of its common stock in the second quarter of 2014.On February 6, 2014, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell the Industrial Packaging segment to The Carlyle Group for $3.2 billion. The transaction was completed on May 1, 2014, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $1.7 billion ($1.1 billion after tax) in the second quarter of 2014, and is subject to customary post-close adjustments. A portion of the proceeds were used to fund share repurchases under the program noted above. The Company believes that, based on its revenues, operating margins, current free operating cash flow, and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary.Cash FlowThe Company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.25Summarized cash flow information for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2014 and 2013 were as follows:Stock Repurchase ProgramsOn May 6, 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provided for the buyback of up to $4.0 billion of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2011 Program”). Under the 2011 Program, the Company repurchased approximately 5.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $62.86 in the first quarter of 2013 and approximately 4.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $66.91 in the second quarter of 2013. The 2011 Program was fully utilized in the fourth quarter of 2013. On August 2, 2013, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to an additional $6.0 billion of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2013 Program”). Under the 2013 Program, the Company repurchased approximately 18.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $80.94 in the first quarter of 2014 and approximately 17.2 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $86.01 in the second quarter of 2014. As of June 30, 2014, there was approximately $2.8 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2013 Program.Adjusted Return on Average Invested CapitalThe Company uses adjusted return on average invested capital (“adjusted ROIC”) to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. Adjusted ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. Adjusted average invested capital also excludes the Company's net investment in the former Industrial Packaging segment and the equity investment in the Wilsonart business (formerly Decorative Surfaces). Adjusted average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. For the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2014 and 2013, adjusted ROIC was as follows:26The annualized adjusted ROIC increase of 300 basis points for the quarter ended June 30, 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily the result of an 18.5% improvement in after-tax operating income. Additionally, the annualized adjusted ROIC increase of 280 basis points for the year-to-date period ended June 30, 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily the result of a 16.3% improvement in after-tax operating income.Working CapitalManagement uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the Company. Net working capital as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 is summarized as follows:27The increase in net working capital as of June 30, 2014 is primarily due to lower short-term debt resulting from $1.7 billion net repayments of commercial paper and repayment of $800 million of 5.15% redeemable notes in April 2014.Cash and equivalents totaled approximately $5.3 billion as of June 30, 2014 and $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2013, primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries and may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the U.S. Cash balances held internationally are typically used for international operating needs, reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses, used to fund new international acquisitions, or used to repay debt held internationally, including the €750 million of 5.25% Euro notes which mature on October 1, 2014. In the U.S., the Company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs which primarily consist of dividend payments, share repurchases, acquisitions, servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs. The Company also uses its commercial paper program, which is backed by long-term credit facilities, for short-term liquidity needs. The Company believes cash generated domestically and liquidity provided by the Company's commercial paper program will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the U.S.DebtTotal debt as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was as follows:Short-term debt as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 included €750 million of 5.25% Euro notes which mature on October 1, 2014. The Company intends to repay the Euro notes with available cash. In addition, at December 31, 2013, short-term debt included $800 million of 5.15% redeemable notes due April 1, 2014, which were repaid on the due date, and commercial paper of $1.7 billion. No commercial paper was outstanding as of June 30, 2014.On January 22, 2014, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion short-term line of credit agreement with a term of up to 364 days to provide additional liquidity under the Company's commercial paper program in order to fund short-term capital allocation needs. This short-term line of credit agreement was terminated on May 15, 2014.In February 2014, the Company issued $650 million of 0.9% notes due February 25, 2017 at 99.861% of face value, $650 million of 1.95% notes due March 1, 2019 at 99.871% of face value, and $700 million of 3.5% notes due March 1, 2024 at 99.648% of face value. Net proceeds from the February 2014 debt issuances were used to repay commercial paper.In May 2014, the Company issued €500 million of 1.75% Euro notes due May 20, 2022 at 99.16% of face value and €500 million of 3.0% Euro notes due May 19, 2034 at 98.089% of face value. The carrying value of the Euro notes were $679 million and $672 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2014. Net proceeds from the May 2014 debt issuances were used for general corporate purposes.Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDAThe Company uses the ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. The Company believes that total debt to adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA and the ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. The ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA represents total debt divided by income from continuing operations before interest expense, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis.28Total debt to adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve month periods ended June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was as follows:Stockholders’ EquityThe changes to stockholders’ equity during 2014 were as follows:(In millions) Total stockholders’ equity, December 31, 2013$9,709Net income1,965Cash dividends declared(340)Repurchases of common stock(2,977)Stock option and restricted stock activity108Foreign currency translation adjustments(22)Other(3)Total stockholders’ equity, June 30, 2014$8,440FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Based on such evaluation, the Company’s President & Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of June 30, 2014, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.In connection with the evaluation by management, including the Company's President & Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the quarter ended June 30, 2014 were identified that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting.Part II – Other InformationItem 1A - Risk FactorsThe Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. This description includes any material changes to and supersedes the description of the risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The Company's results are impacted by global economic conditions. Weakness or downturns in the markets served by the Company could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.The Company's businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe. Slower economic growth, credit market instability, high unemployment, government deficit reduction, sequestration and other austerity measures impacting the markets we serve can adversely affect the Company’s businesses by reducing demand for the Company's products and services, limiting financing available to the Company's customers, increasing order cancellations and the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, increasing price competition, and increasing the risk that counterparties to the Company's contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations.The global nature of the Company's operations subjects it to political and economic risks that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.The Company currently operates in 56 countries. The risks inherent in the Company's global operations include:•fluctuation in currency exchange rates;•limitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises;•price controls, exchange controls and limitations on repatriation of earnings;•transportation delays and interruptions;•political, social and economic instability and disruptions;•acts of terrorism;•government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions;•the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;•import and export controls;•labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;•the potential for expropriation or nationalization of enterprises;•difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;•limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and•potentially adverse tax consequences.If the Company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.30The timing and amount of benefits from the Company’s 2013 - 2017 enterprise initiatives may not be as expected and the Company's financial results could be adversely impacted. The Company’s 2013 - 2017 enterprise strategy and associated initiatives include portfolio management, business structure simplification and strategic sourcing. The portfolio management initiative, which included divesting businesses no longer aligned with the Company’s long-term objectives, is essentially complete. The Company has made significant progress on its business structure simplification and strategic sourcing initiatives, but scaling up of smaller businesses into larger businesses and leveraging purchase power across businesses involves a significant amount of execution risk. If the Company is unable to achieve the expected benefits from these initiatives or is unable to complete these initiatives without material disruption to its businesses, the timing and amount of benefits from these initiatives may not be as expected and the Company's financial results could be adversely impacted.The timing and amount of the Company’s share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties.Share repurchases constitute a significant component of the Company’s capital allocation strategy. The Company funds its share repurchases with free operating cash flow and short-term borrowings. The amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors. Important factors that could cause the Company to limit, suspend or delay its share repurchases include unfavorable trading market conditions, the price of the Company's common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities presented to us from time to time, the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates and the availability of U.S. cash. If we delay, limit or suspend the Company's stock repurchase program, the Company's stock price may be negatively affected. The Company may incur fines or penalties, damage to its reputation or other adverse consequences if its employees, agents or business partners violate anti-bribery, competition, export and import, environmental or other laws.The Company has a decentralized operating structure under which its individual businesses are allowed significant decision-making autonomy within the Company’s strategic framework and internal financial and compliance controls. The Company cannot provide assurance that its internal controls will always protect it from reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including anti-bribery, competition, export and import, and environmental laws. Any such improper actions could subject the Company to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and non-monetary penalties against the Company or its subsidiaries, or could damage its reputation.A significant fluctuation between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the Company's operating income.Although the Company's financial results are reported in U.S. Dollars, a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies, with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in Europe. The Company's profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses. Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular an increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies, could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition.If the Company is unable to successfully introduce new products or adequately protect its intellectual property, its future growth may be adversely affected.The Company's ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and sometimes requires the investment of significant time and resources. Difficulties or delays in research, development, production or commercialization of new products and services may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the Company's competitive position. If the Company is unable to create sustainable product differentiation, its organic growth may be adversely affected.  Protecting the Company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. The Company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses related to its products, and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights under patents owned by others. The Company's intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected, or the Company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. Unauthorized use of the Company's intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the Company's competitive position and results of operations.31Recent divestitures pose the risk of retained liabilities that could adversely affect the Company's financial results. The Company's divestiture activity increased in 2012, 2013 and 2014 in accordance with its portfolio management initiative. Though its portfolio management initiative is essentially complete, the Company has retained certain liabilities directly or thorough indemnifications made to the buyer against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims and environmental matters. The Company has significant goodwill and other intangible assets and future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.In the past the Company has recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet as a result of acquisitions. A number of factors may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets, including significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, increased competition and significant changes in the use of the assets. Impairment charges could result that adversely affect the Company's financial condition or results of operations in the periods recognized.Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets or changes in our credit ratings could increase our funding costs or reduce the availability of credit.  Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the financial markets. The Company’s continued ability to meet its cash requirements requires substantial liquidity and access to the financial markets. In addition, the Company’s borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. If conditions in the financial markets decline or the Company’s credit ratings are negatively impacted, its funding costs could be increased or the availability of credit could be diminished.  Raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results.The supply of raw materials to the Company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. Prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and profit margins. Due to pricing pressure or other factors, the Company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed. Consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.Unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results.The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions. The Company's effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments.The Company's defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows.The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.Potential adverse outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect results.The Company's businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors. The Company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self-insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses. In addition, the Company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future. Even if it maintains 32adequate insurance programs, claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future.Item 2 – Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of ProceedsOn May 6, 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provided for the buyback of up to $4.0 billion of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2011 Program”). Under the 2011 Program, the Company repurchased approximately 5.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $62.86 in the first quarter of 2013 and approximately 4.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $66.91 in the second quarter of 2013. The 2011 Program was fully utilized in the fourth quarter of 2013. On August 2, 2013, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to an additional $6.0 billion of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2013 Program”). Under the 2013 Program, the Company repurchased approximately 18.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $80.94 in the first quarter of 2014 and approximately 17.2 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $86.01 in the second quarter of 2014.
