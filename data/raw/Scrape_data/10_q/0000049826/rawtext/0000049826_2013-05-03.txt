In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in the Company’s 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform with current year reporting.On January 1, 2013, the Company adopted new accounting guidance which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test of an indefinite-lived intangible asset. The entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset unless, based on the qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. The Company performs its annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test in the third quarter and does not expect the adoption of this new accounting guidance to have a significant impact on its financial statements.(2)    DIVESTITURE OF MAJORITY INTEREST IN DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENTOn August 15, 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) to divest a 51% majority interest in its Decorative Surfaces segment to certain funds managed by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”).  The transaction closed on October 31, 2012, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $933 million ($632 million after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2012.Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, the Company contributed the assets and stock of the Decorative Surfaces segment to a newly formed entity, Wilsonart International Holdings LLC (“Wilsonart”). Through a combination of CD&R's equity investment in Wilsonart and new third party borrowings by a subsidiary of Wilsonart, the Company and its subsidiaries received payments of approximately $1.05 billion from Wilsonart and its subsidiaries as well as common units (the “Common Units”) initially representing approximately 49% (on an as-converted basis) of the total outstanding equity of Wilsonart immediately following the closing of the transaction. CD&R contributed $395 million to Wilsonart in exchange for newly issued cumulative convertible participating preferred units (the “Preferred Units”) of Wilsonart initially representing approximately 51% (on an as-converted basis) of the total outstanding equity immediately following the closing of the transaction. The Preferred Units rank senior to the Common Units as to dividends and liquidation preference, and accrue dividends at a rate of 10.00% per annum. As of October 31, 2012, the Company ceased consolidating the results of the Decorative Surfaces segment and now reports its ownership interest in Wilsonart using the equity method of accounting. As the Company's investment in Wilsonart is structured as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes, U.S. taxes are recorded separately from the equity investment. For the first quarter  ended March 31, 2013, the Company recorded a loss of $2 million in Other income (expense) related to its interest in Wilsonart, which was primarily due to the impact of purchase accounting.Due to the Company's continuing involvement through its 49% interest in Wilsonart, the historical operating results of Decorative Surfaces are presented in continuing operations. Additionally, as of November 1, 2012, the operating results of Decorative Surfaces were no longer reviewed by senior management of the Company and therefore, effective the fourth quarter of 2012, Decorative Surfaces was no longer a reportable segment of the Company.Historical operating results of Decorative Surfaces for the three months ended March 31, 2012 were as follows:(In millions)Three Months Ended March 31, 2012Operating revenues$275Operating income426(3)    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSThe Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term objectives. The following summarizes the Company's discontinued operations.In April 2011, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its finishing group of businesses previously included in the Specialty Products segment (formerly the All Other segment) to Graco Inc. in a $650 million cash transaction. The sale of the finishing business to Graco was completed on April 2, 2012 and the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $454 million in the second quarter of 2012.In the third quarter of 2012, the Company divested two consumer packaging businesses in separate transactions that were previously included in the Specialty Products segment (formerly the All Other segment). The sale of the consumer packaging businesses resulted in pre-tax gains of $26 million and $17 million recorded in the third quarter of 2012.In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company divested a packaging distribution business previously included in the Industrial Packaging segment and a welding manufacturing business previously included in the Welding segment (formerly in the Power Systems & Electronics segment). The sale of these businesses resulted in a pre-tax loss of $19 million and a pre-tax gain of $16 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2012.  In the first quarter of 2013, the Company committed to plans for the divestiture of two transportation related businesses and a machine components business previously included in the Specialty Products segment, two construction distribution businesses previously included in the Construction Products segment, and a chemical manufacturing business previously included in the Polymers & Fluids segment. The Company expects to dispose of these businesses within the next year.  These businesses have been classified as held for sale in the first quarter of 2013. In connection with the anticipated sale of these businesses, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $42 million and loss reserves on assets held for sale of $60 million in the first quarter of 2013 which were included in Income (loss) from discontinued operations.The Company has restated the statement of income and the notes to financial statements to present the operating results of the held for sale and previously divested businesses discussed above as discontinued operations. Results of the discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: Three Months Ended(In millions)March 31, 2013 2012Operating revenues$149 $303    Income (loss) from discontinued operations before income taxes$(101) $33Income taxes(4) (11)Income (loss) from discontinued operations$(105) $227The assets and liabilities of the held for sale businesses discussed above were included in assets and liabilities held for sale in the statement of financial position as of March 31, 2013. There were no businesses classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2012. The following table summarizes the classes of assets and liabilities held for sale as of March 31, 2013:(In millions)  March 31, 2013Trade receivables $92Inventories 94Net plant and equipment 21Goodwill and intangible assets 150Other 19Loss reserves on assets held for sale (60)Total assets held for sale $316   Accounts payable $35Accrued expenses 26Other 23Total liabilities held for sale $84(4)    STRATEGIC REVIEW OF INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENTOn February 19, 2013, the Company announced that it is initiating a review process to explore strategic alternatives for its Industrial Packaging segment, which may include a sale or spin-off of the business. The Company expects the review process will last through the remainder of 2013. (5)    GAIN ON ACQUISITION OF CONTROLLING INTEREST IN EQUITY INVESTMENTOn January 31, 2013, the Company acquired the controlling interest of an existing consumer packaging business in the Specialty Products segment previously accounted for under the equity method. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $30 million in Other income (expense) as a result of remeasuring the Company's existing equity interest to fair value by determining the implied equity value using a Level 3 valuation method.(6)    INCOME TAXESThe effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 were 29.0% and 28.9%, respectively.The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions including the Internal Revenue Service, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, German Fiscal Authority, French Fiscal Authority, and Australian Tax Office and a number of these audits are currently ongoing, which may increase the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits in future periods. Due to the ongoing audits, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the amount of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits may be decreased by approximately $40 million related predominantly to various intercompany transactions. The Company has recorded its best estimate of the potential exposure for these issues.(7)    INVENTORIESInventories as of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 were as follows:  8(8)    RETIREMENT PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITSPension and other postretirement benefit costs related to both continuing and discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, were as follows:Three Months Ended(In millions)March 31, Pension Other Postretirement Benefits 2013 2012 2013 2012Components of net periodic benefit cost:       Service cost$23 $25 $3 $3Interest cost24 28 6 7Expected return on plan assets(39) (40) (5) (5)Amortization of actuarial loss19 13 — —Amortization of prior service cost— — — 1Net periodic benefit cost$27 $26 $4 $6        Amounts were included in the statement of income as follows:       Income from continuing operations$27 $25 $4 $6Income (loss) from discontinued operations— 1 — —Net periodic benefit cost$27 $26 $4 $6 The Company expects to contribute approximately $132 million to its pension plans and $9 million to its other postretirement plans in 2013. As of March 31, 2013, contributions of $41 million to pension plans and $2 million to other postretirement plans have been made.(9)    SHORT-TERM DEBTThe Company had outstanding commercial paper of $418 million as of March 31, 2013 and $408 million at December 31, 2012. Commercial paper is stated at cost, which approximates fair value.(10)    LONG-TERM DEBTThe approximate fair value and related carrying value of the Company's long-term debt, including current maturities, as of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 were as follows: The approximate fair values of the Company's long-term debt, including current maturities, were based on a Level 2 valuation model, using observable inputs, which included market rates for comparable instruments for the respective periods.9(11)    ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEEffective January 1, 2013, the Company adopted new accounting guidance that was issued in February 2013 requiring disclosure of amounts transferred out of accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in the statement of income. The following table summarizes changes in accumulated other comprehensive income during the first quarter of 2013 and 2012: Three Months Ended(In millions)March 31,2013 2012Beginning balance$293 $224    Foreign currency translation adjustments during the period(154) 180Foreign currency translation adjustments reclassified to income4 (4)Income taxes— —Total foreign currency translation adjustments(150) 176    Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income19 14Income taxes(7) (4)Total pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments12 10    Ending balance$155 $410Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income represents the amortization of actuarial losses and prior service cost. Refer to the Retirement Plans and Postretirement Benefits note for additional information. The ending balance of accumulated other comprehensive income as of March 31, 2013 and 2012 consisted of cumulative translation adjustment income of $717 million and $949 million, respectively, and unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefits costs of $562 million and $539 million, respectively.(12)    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATIONOn February 15, 2013, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved an annual equity award (the “2013 Awards”) consisting of stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance restricted stock units (“PRSUs”). The RSUs provide for full “cliff” vesting three years from the date of grant. The PRSUs provide for full “cliff” vesting after three years if the Compensation Committee certifies that the performance goals set with respect to the PRSUs have been met. Upon vesting, the holder will receive one share of common stock of the Company for each vested RSU or PRSU. The stock options vest over a four-year period and have a maturity of ten years from the issuance date. Option exercise prices are equal to the common stock fair market value on the date of grant. The following table summarizes the 2013 Awards:(Shares in millions)Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Weighted-Average Exercise PriceStock options1.2 $9.83 $63.25Restricted stock units (RSUs/PRSUs)0.5 58.69 —10The fair value of RSUs and PRSUs was determined by reducing the closing market price on the date of the grant by the present value of projected dividends over the vesting period. The Company uses a binomial option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the stock options granted. Lattice-based option valuation models, such as the binomial option pricing model, incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs. The risk-free rate of interest for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on a zero-coupon U.S. government instrument over the contractual term of the equity instrument. Expected volatility is based on implied volatility from traded options on the Company's stock and historical volatility of the Company's stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise timing and employee termination rates within the valuation model. The weighted-average dividend yield is based on historical information. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The ranges presented below result from separate groups of employees assumed to exhibit different behavior. The following table summarizes the assumptions used in the models to determine the fair value of the 2013 Awards:Risk-free interest rate0.2-2.1%Weighted-average volatility21.0%Dividend yield2.72%Expected years until exercise6.6-7.6(13)    SEGMENT INFORMATIONEffective January 1, 2013, the Company made certain changes in how its operations are reported to senior management in order to better align its portfolio of businesses with its enterprise-wide portfolio management initiative. As a result of this reorganization, the Company's operations are aggregated into the following eight external reportable segments: Test & Measurement and Electronics; Automotive OEM; Polymers & Fluids; Food Equipment; Construction Products; Welding;  Specialty Products; and Industrial Packaging.The significant changes resulting from this reorganization include the following:•Certain businesses within the former Transportation segment, primarily related to the automotive aftermarket business, are reported in the Polymers & Fluids segment and the Transportation segment has been renamed Automotive OEM.•The Welding business, which was formerly reported in the Power Systems & Electronics segment, is reported separately as the Welding segment.•The Electronics business, which was formerly reported in the Power Systems & Electronics segment, has been combined with the Test & Measurement business, which was formerly reported in the All Other segment, to form a new Test & Measurement and Electronics segment.•The All Other segment has been renamed Specialty Products.The changes in the reportable segments and underlying reporting units did not result in any goodwill impairment charges in the first quarter of 2013.Commensurate with the change in reportable segments described above, the segment operating income was also revised for a change in how operating expenses maintained at the corporate level are allocated to the Company's segments. Prior to January 1, 2013, the Company allocated all operating expenses maintained at the corporate level to its segments. Beginning January 1, 2013, segments are allocated a fixed overhead charge based on the segment's revenues. Expenses not charged to the segments are now reported separately as Unallocated. Because the Unallocated category includes a variety of items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.The prior year segment results and related disclosures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation under the new segment structure and expense allocation methodology. See Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information regarding operating revenues and operating income for the Company's segments.11Item 2 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsINTRODUCTIONManagement analyzes the Company’s consolidated results of operations and the results of each segment by identifying the effects of changes in the results of the base businesses, newly acquired and recently divested companies, restructuring costs, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, and currency translation on the operating revenues and operating income of each segment. Base businesses are those businesses that have been included in the Company’s results of operations for more than 12 months. The changes to base business operating income include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and changes in variable margins and overhead costs. Operating leverage is the estimated effect of the base business revenue volume changes on operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period. As manufacturing and administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing, the percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage is usually more than the percentage change in the base business revenues. Changes in variable margins and overhead costs represent the estimated effect of non-volume related changes in base business operating income and may be driven by a number of factors, including changes in product mix, the cost of raw materials, labor and overhead, and pricing to customers. Selling price versus material cost comparisons represent the estimated net impact of increases or decreases in the cost of materials used in the Company’s products versus changes in the selling price to the Company’s customers. Management reviews these price versus cost comparisons by analyzing the net impact of changes to each segment’s operating margin.The discussion of operating results should be read in conjunction with Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.DIVESTITURE OF MAJORITY INTEREST IN DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT On August 15, 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) to divest a 51% majority interest in its Decorative Surfaces segment to certain funds managed by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”). Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, the Company contributed the assets and stock of the Decorative Surfaces segment to a newly formed entity, Wilsonart International Holdings LLC (“Wilsonart”). The transaction closed on October 31, 2012, reducing the Company's ownership of Wilsonart to 49% immediately following the close of the transaction. The Company ceased consolidating the results of the Decorative Surfaces segment as of October 31, 2012 and now reports its 49% ownership interest in Wilsonart using the equity method of accounting. Due to the Company's continuing involvement through its 49% interest in Wilsonart, the historical operating results of Decorative Surfaces are presented in continuing operations. Additionally, as of November 1, 2012, the operating results of Decorative Surfaces were no longer reviewed by senior management of the Company and therefore, effective the fourth quarter of 2012, Decorative Surfaces was no longer a reportable segment of the Company. See the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Decorative Surfaces Segment note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for further discussion of this transaction.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSThe Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term objectives.  In the first quarter of 2013, the Company committed to plans for the divestiture of two transportation related businesses and a machine components business previously included in the Specialty Products segment, two construction distribution businesses previously included in the Construction Products segment, and a chemical manufacturing business previously included in the Polymers & Fluids segment. These held for sale businesses, as well as certain previously divested businesses are reported as discontinued operations in the statement of income. All related prior period income statement information has been restated to conform to the current year reporting of these businesses. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item I - Financial Statements for further details regarding the Company’s discontinued operations.STRATEGIC REVIEW OF INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENTOn February 19, 2013, the Company announced that it is initiating a review process to explore strategic alternatives for its Industrial Packaging segment, which may include a sale or spin-off of the business. The Company expects the review process will last through the remainder of 2013.122013 SEGMENT CHANGESEffective January 1, 2013, the Company made certain changes in how its operations are reported to senior management in order to better align its portfolio of businesses with its enterprise-wide portfolio management initiative.

Excluding the first quarter 2012 revenue of the Decorative Surfaces segment, revenue declined 1.8%.  Worldwide base revenues decreased 2.7%, as North American base revenues decreased 1.9% and international base revenues declined 3.5% in the first quarter of 2013 versus 2012.  European base revenues decreased 5.8% due to weakness in the European economic environment, and Asia Pacific base revenues increased 0.5% driven by growth in China and India, partially offset by weakness in Australia.  Worldwide base revenue decreases were driven by lower equipment sales, which decreased 6% due to lower capital expenditures by businesses versus the prior year period. Divestitures reduced revenues by 6.4% primarily due to the sale of a 51% interest in the Decorative Surfaces segment on October 31, 2012, at which time the segment was deconsolidated. Acquisitions contributed 1.3% to revenues primarily due to the purchase of a medical device manufacturer in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the purchase of a manufacturer of advanced technology silicone materials in the second quarter of 2012.Operating IncomeOperating income decreased 4.9% in the first quarter of 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to the divestiture of the Decorative Surfaces segment in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the lower base revenues noted above, partially offset by lower operating and restructuring expenses in the first quarter of 2013 versus 2012.  Excluding the first quarter 2012 operating income of the Decorative Surfaces segment, operating income increased 1.2%. Total base operating margins increased 30 basis points primarily due to lower overhead expenses, partially offset by the negative operating leverage effect of the decrease in base revenues of 70 basis points. The changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased base margins by 100 basis points primarily due to a reduction of overhead expenses of 80 basis points, resulting primarily from overhead cost management and the benefits of business structure simplification activities, and the favorable effect of selling price versus material cost comparisons of 30 basis points. The lower restructuring expenses noted above improved operating margins by 20 basis points versus the prior year period.14RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENTThe reconciliation of segment operating revenues to total operating revenues is as follows:The reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is as follows:TEST & MEASUREMENT AND ELECTRONICSBusinesses in this segment produce equipment, consumables, and related software for testing and measuring of materials and structures, and equipment and consumables used in the production of electronic subassemblies and microelectronics.In the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment, products include:•equipment, consumables, and related software for testing and measuring of materials, structures, gases and fluids;•electronic assembly equipment and related consumable solder materials;•electronic components and component packaging;•static control equipment and consumables used for contamination control in clean room environments; and•pressure sensitive adhesives and components for telecommunications, electronics, medical and transportation applications.15This segment primarily serves the electronics, general industrial, consumer durables and industrial capital goods markets.The results of operations for the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment for the first quarter of 2013 and 2012 were as follows:In the first quarter of 2013, the changes in operating revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: Three Months EndedMarch 31% Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Point Increase (Decrease)Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating MarginsBase business:  Revenue change/Operating leverage(3.4)% (13.2)% (1.2)%Changes in variable margins & overhead costs— % 16.3 % 2.0 %(3.4)% 3.1 % 0.8 %Acquisitions1.8 % 0.4 % (0.2)%Divestitures— % — % — %Restructuring costs— % 5.5 % 0.7 %Impairment of goodwill & intangibles— % — % — %Translation(0.5)% (0.5)% (0.1)%Other— % — % — %Total(2.1)% 8.5 % 1.2 %Operating RevenuesRevenues decreased 2.1% in the first quarter of 2013 versus 2012 due to a decline in base business and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by revenues from acquisitions. Worldwide electronics base business revenues decreased 8.8% in the first quarter of 2013 versus 2012. Base revenues for the electronics assembly businesses were lower for the first quarter of 2013 versus 2012, primarily due to decreased customer spending on capital equipment and slower activity in the personal computing industry. The other electronics businesses were virtually flat for the first quarter of 2013 versus 2012. Base revenues for the worldwide test and measurement businesses increased 1.9% driven by higher customer demand for electromechanical material testing equipment.16Operating IncomeOperating income increased 8.5% in the first quarter of 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to lower overhead and restructuring expenses, partially offset by lower base revenues. Total base operating margins increased 80 basis points primarily due to the changes in variable margins and overhead costs, partially offset by the negative operating leverage effect of the decrease in base revenues of 120 basis points. The changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased base margins by 200 basis points primarily due to a reduction of overhead expenses of 140 basis points, resulting primarily from overhead cost management and the benefits of business structure simplification activities, lower intangible asset amortization and other acquisition accounting items of 60 basis points, and favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons of 30 basis points, partially offset by lower variable margins due to product mix in the worldwide test and measurement businesses. Lower restructuring expenses improved total operating margins by 70 basis points in the first quarter of 2013 versus 2012.AUTOMOTIVE OEMBusinesses in this segment produce components and fasteners for automotive-related applications.In the Automotive OEM segment, products and services include:•plastic and metal components, fasteners and assemblies for automobiles, light trucks, and other industrial uses.This segment primarily serves the automotive original equipment manufacturers and tiers.The results of operations for the Automotive OEM segment for the first quarter of 2013 and 2012 were as follows:In the first quarter of 2013, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: Three Months EndedMarch 31% Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Point Increase (Decrease)Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating MarginsBase business:  Revenue change/Operating leverage4.0% 7.3 % 0.6 %Changes in variable margins & overhead costs—% (1.8)% (0.3)%4.0% 5.5 % 0.3 %Acquisitions—% — % — %Divestitures—% — % — %Restructuring costs—% (1.8)% (0.3)%Impairment of goodwill & intangibles—% — % — %Translation—% 0.6 % 0.1 %Other—% — % — %Total4.0% 4.3 % 0.1 %17Operating RevenuesRevenues increased 4.0% in the first quarter of 2013 versus 2012 due to the increase in base revenues.

Principal end markets served include commercial, renovation and residential construction.On August 15, 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) to divest a 51% majority interest in its Decorative Surfaces segment to certain funds managed by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”). Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, the Company contributed the assets and stock of the Decorative Surfaces segment to a newly formed entity, Wilsonart International Holdings LLC (“Wilsonart”). The transaction closed on October 31, 2012, reducing the Company's ownership of Wilsonart to 49% immediately following the close of the transaction. The Company ceased consolidating the results of the Decorative Surfaces segment as of October 31, 2012 and now reports its 49% ownership interest in Wilsonart using the equity method of accounting. Due to the Company's continuing involvement through its 49% interest in Wilsonart, the historical operating results of Decorative Surfaces are presented in continuing operations.  Additionally, as of November 1, 2012, the operating results of Decorative Surfaces were no longer reviewed by senior management of the Company and therefore, effective the fourth quarter of 2012, Decorative Surfaces was no longer a reportable segment of the Company. See the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Decorative Surfaces Segment note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for further discussion of this transaction.Historical operating results of Decorative Surfaces for the three months ended March 31, 2012 were as follows:(Dollars in millions)Three Months EndedMarch 31, 2012Operating revenues$275Operating income42Operating margin %15.3%AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETSAmortization expense decreased to $68 million in the first quarter of 2013 versus $69 million in the first quarter of 2012 due to fully amortized intangibles at various business units.INTEREST EXPENSEInterest expense increased to $60 million in the first quarter of 2013, which included interest expense on the 3.9% notes issued in late August 2012, versus $50 million in the first quarter of 2012.OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)Other income (expense) was income of $46 million for the first quarter of 2013 versus income of $8 million for the first quarter of 2012 primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $30 million in the first quarter of 2013 related to the acquisition of the controlling interest in an existing equity investment and foreign currency gains of $3 million in the first quarter of 2013 versus losses of $7 million in the first quarter of 2012. See the Gain on Acquisition of Controlling Interest in Equity Investment note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for further details regarding the gain related to the acquired controlling interest.INCOME TAXESThe effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 were 29.0% and 28.9%, respectively. See the Income Taxes note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for further details on income taxes. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONSIncome from continuing operations of $459 million in the first quarter of 2013 was 1.0% lower than the 2012 income from continuing operations of $464 million. The prior year period includes operating results related to the Decorative Surfaces segment, which was divested in the fourth quarter of 2012.  See the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Decorative Surfaces Segment note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for further discussion of this transaction.26FOREIGN CURRENCYThe weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar decreased operating revenues for the first quarter of 2013 by approximately $15 million and decreased income from continuing operations by approximately $1 million (less than $0.01 per diluted share) versus 2012.INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSIncome (loss) from discontinued operations was a loss of $105 million in the first quarter of 2013 versus income of $22 million in the first quarter of 2012. The loss in the first quarter of 2013 included $42 million of goodwill impairment charges and loss reserves on assets held for sale of $60 million recorded in connection with the anticipated sale of certain businesses held for sale. See the Discontinued Operations note in Item 1 – Financial Statements for further details regarding the Company’s discontinued operations.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIn March 2013, new accounting guidance was issued which clarifies that an entity should release cumulative translation adjustments into net income when the entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business within a foreign entity. The new guidance will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2014. The Company does not expect the adoption of this new accounting guidance to have a significant impact on its financial statements.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe Company’s primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and short-term credit facilities. Management continues to believe that internally generated cash flows will be adequate to service debt, to finance internal growth, to continue to pay dividends, and to fund small to medium-sized acquisitions.The primary uses of liquidity are:•dividend payments - the Company's dividend payout guidelines are 30% to 45% of the average of the last two years' free operating cash flow;•share repurchases; and•acquisitions.Cash FlowThe Company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment.  Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.27Summarized cash flow information for the first quarter of 2013 and 2012 was as follows:Three Months Ended(In millions)March 31,2013 2012Net cash provided by operating activities$366 $323Additions to plant and equipment(89) (84)Free operating cash flow$277 $239    Cash dividends paid$— $(174)Acquisition of businesses (excluding cash and equivalents) and additional interest in affiliates(56) (481)Repurchases of common stock(344) (443)Net proceeds from (repayments of) debt(4) 735Other54 200Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and equivalents(44) 50Net increase (decrease) in cash and equivalents$(117) $126On May 6, 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to $4.0 billion of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2011 Program”). In the first quarter of 2013, the Company used cash to repurchase approximately 5.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $62.86 under the 2011 Program. As of March 31, 2013, there was approximately $1.5 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2011 Program.Return on Average Invested CapitalThe Company uses return on average invested capital (“ROIC”) to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company’s operations.

For the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, ROIC was as follows:28The ROIC decrease of 20 basis points in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 was the result of operating income after taxes decreasing 4.9%, offset partially by average invested capital decreasing 3.7%.Working CapitalManagement uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the Company. Net working capital as of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 is summarized as follows:Cash and equivalents totaled approximately $2.7 billion as of March 31, 2013, primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries and may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the U.S. Cash balances held internationally are typically used for international operating needs, reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses, or used to fund new international acquisitions. In the U.S., the Company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs which primarily consist of dividend payments, acquisitions, share repurchases, servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs. The Company also uses its commercial paper program, which is backed by long-term credit facilities of $2.5 billion, for short-term liquidity needs. The Company believes cash generated domestically will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the U.S.DebtTotal debt and total debt to capitalization as of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 were as follows:The Company had outstanding commercial paper of $418 million as of March 31, 2013 and $408 million as of December 31, 2012, which was included in short-term debt.The Company believes that, based on its current free operating cash flow, debt to capitalization ratios and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary.29Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDAThe Company uses the ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. The Company believes that total debt to adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA and the ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. The ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA represents total debt divided by income from continuing operations before interest expense, gain on sale of interest in Decorative Surfaces, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis.Total debt to adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve month periods ended March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 was as follows:Stockholders’ EquityThe changes to stockholders’ equity during 2013 were as follows:(In millions) Total stockholders’ equity, December 31, 2012$10,570Net income354Stock option and restricted stock activity42Repurchases of common stock(366)Cash dividends declared(171)Noncontrolling interest activity(12)Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments12Foreign currency translation adjustments(150)Total stockholders’ equity, March 31, 2013$10,27930FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
