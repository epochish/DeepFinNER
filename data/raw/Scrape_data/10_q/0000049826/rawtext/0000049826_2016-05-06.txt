In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in the Company’s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform with current year reporting.In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for revenue recognition. The core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, several new revenue recognition disclosures will be required. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact the guidance will have upon adoption. In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for recognizing leasing transactions. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize a lease liability and lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a lease term greater than twelve months in the statement of financial position. Subsequent measurement, including presentation of expenses and cash flows, will depend on the classification of the lease as either a financing or operating lease. In addition, several new disclosures will be required. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact the guidance will have upon adoption. In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that includes several changes to simplify the accounting for stock-based compensation, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements and cash flow statement classification. The new guidance will require recognition of the income tax effects associated with the vesting or settlement of stock-based awards in income tax expense rather than additional paid-in-capital. The income tax effects will also be presented as an operating cash flow in the statement of cash flows rather than a financing activity. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact the guidance will have upon adoption.(2)    Income TaxesThe Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions including the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, German Fiscal Authority, French Fiscal Authority, and Australian Tax Office, and a number of these audits are currently ongoing, which may increase the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits in future periods. Due to the ongoing audits, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the amount of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits may be decreased by approximately $122 million related predominantly to various intercompany transactions. The Company has recorded its best estimate of the potential exposure for these issues.On February 18, 2014, the Company received a Notice of Deficiency (“NOD”) from the IRS asserting that a non-taxable return of capital received from a subsidiary was a taxable dividend distribution. The NOD assesses additional taxes of $70 million for the 2006 tax year, plus interest and penalties. In May 2014, the Company petitioned the United States Tax Court to challenge the NOD. The Company's petition was subsequently denied and the case will proceed to court with trial set for the third quarter of 2016. Although the outcome of this process cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes it will be successful in defending its positions. Accordingly, no reserve has been recorded related to this matter.7(3)    InventoriesInventories as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows: (4)    Pension and Other Postretirement BenefitsPension and other postretirement benefit costs for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, were as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, Pension Other Postretirement BenefitsIn millions2016 2015 2016 2015Components of net periodic benefit cost:       Service cost$16 $18 $2 $3Interest cost23 23 6 6Expected return on plan assets(37) (38) (6) (6)Amortization of actuarial (gain) loss11 15 — —Net periodic benefit (income) cost$13 $18 $2 $3The Company expects to contribute approximately $73 million to its pension plans and $5 million to its other postretirement plans in 2016. As of March 31, 2016, contributions of $5 million to pension plans and $1 million to other postretirement plans have been made.(5)    DebtShort-term debt as of December 31, 2015 included commercial paper of $498 million. There was no commercial paper outstanding as of March 31, 2016. In addition, in the first quarter of 2016, the Company reclassified $649 million related to the 0.90% notes due February 25, 2017 from Long-term debt to Short-term debt. The approximate fair value and related carrying value of the Company's total long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt presented as short-term debt, as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows: The approximate fair values of the Company's long-term debt, including current maturities, were based on a Level 2 valuation model, using observable inputs which included market rates for comparable instruments for the respective periods.8(6)    Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)The following table summarizes changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015: Three Months Ended March 31,In millions2016 2015Beginning balance$(1,504) $(658)    Foreign currency translation adjustments during the period124 (527)Foreign currency translation adjustments reclassified to income1 —Income taxes39 (50)Foreign currency translation adjustments, net of tax164 (577)    Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments during the period1 (2)Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income11 15Income taxes(4) (4)Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments, net of tax8 9    Ending balance$(1,332) $(1,226)        Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income relate to the amortization of actuarial losses. Refer to the Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits note for additional information.The Company designated the €1.0 billion of Euro notes issued in May 2015 and the €1.0 billion of Euro notes issued in May 2014 as hedges of a portion of its net investment in Euro-denominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations. The carrying values of the Euro notes were $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, as of March 31, 2016. Changes in the value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate have been recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The unrealized pre-tax gain recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the net investment hedge was $204 million and $308 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.The ending balance of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 consisted of cumulative translation adjustment losses, net of tax, of $961 million and $842 million, respectively, and unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefits costs, net of tax, of $371 million and $384 million, respectively.(7)    Segment InformationThe Company has seven reportable segments: Automotive OEM; Food Equipment; Test & Measurement and Electronics; Welding; Polymers & Fluids; Construction Products; and Specialty Products. See Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information regarding operating revenue and operating income for the Company's segments.9Item 2 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsINTRODUCTIONIllinois Tool Works Inc. (the "Company" or "ITW") is a global manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with 84 divisions in 57 countries. As of December 31, 2015, the Company employed approximately 48,000 persons.The Company's operations are organized and managed based on similar product offerings and similar end markets, and are reported to senior management as the following seven segments: Automotive OEM; Food Equipment; Test & Measurement and Electronics; Welding; Polymers & Fluids; Construction Products; and Specialty Products.Due to the large number of diverse businesses and the Company's decentralized operating structure, the Company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results. Instead, the Company's corporate management collects data on several key measurements: operating revenue, operating income, operating margin, overhead costs, number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested capital. These key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management.THE ITW BUSINESS MODELThe powerful and highly differentiated ITW Business Model is the Company’s core source of value creation. This business model is the Company’s competitive advantage and defines how ITW creates value for its shareholders and comprises three unique elements:•ITW’s 80/20 management process is the operating system that is applied in every ITW business. Initially introduced as a manufacturing efficiency tool in the 1980’s, ITW has continually refined, improved and expanded 80/20 into a proprietary, holistic business management process that generates significant value for the Company. Through the application of data-driven insights generated by 80/20 practice, ITW focuses on its largest and best opportunities (the “80”) and eliminates complexity associated with the less profitable opportunities (the “20”). 80/20 enables ITW businesses to consistently deliver world-class operational excellence in regards to product availability, quality, and innovation, while generating superior financial performance;•Customer-back innovation has fueled decades of profitable growth at ITW. The Company’s unique innovation approach is built on the insight gathered from the 80/20 management process. Working from the customer back, ITW businesses position themselves as the go-to problem solver for their “80” customers. ITW’s innovation efforts are focused on understanding customer needs, particularly those in “80” markets with solid long-term growth fundamentals, and then creating unique solutions to address those needs. These customer insights and learnings drive innovation at ITW and have contributed to a portfolio of more than 16,000 granted and pending patents;•ITW’s decentralized, entrepreneurial culture allows ITW businesses to be fast, focused, and responsive. ITW businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the ITW Business Model to customize their approach in order to best serve their customers. ITW colleagues are clear about what is expected of them with regard to ITW’s business model, strategy, and values. This leads to a focused and simple organizational structure that, combined with outstanding execution, delivers operational excellence adapted to their specific customers and end markets.ENTERPRISE STRATEGYIn 2013, ITW began the process of transitioning the Company onto its current strategic path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the ITW Business Model. Since then, ITW has made considerable progress, as evidenced by the Company’s strong financial performance over the past three years.The roots of ITW’s Enterprise Strategy began in 2011-2012, when the Company undertook a complete review of its performance. ITW gathered deep insights from its businesses that were delivering consistent above-market growth with best-in-class margins and returns, and defined a strategy to replicate that performance throughout the Company.Based on this rigorous and thorough evaluation, ITW determined two paths to deliver world-class financial performance and compelling long-term returns for its shareholders. One, ITW needed to shift the Company's primary growth engine to organic; and two, the Company needed to leverage the ITW Business Model to deliver best-in-class margins and returns.10Shift the Company’s Core Growth Engine to OrganicIn order to pivot to fully focus on organic growth, the Company needed to first accomplish several preparatory steps. These key initiatives were a major focus of the Company in 2012-2015, which included portfolio management, business structure simplification and strategic sourcing.The first step, portfolio management, was to construct and maintain a business portfolio capable of delivering consistent above-market organic growth. As part of this initiative to realign the portfolio, ITW exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a must-have requirement for all ITW businesses. This process included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated ITW divisions.As a result of this work, ITW’s business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential. ITW segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve margins and generate price/cost increases. This was achieved through product line simplification which focuses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines. Most of this initiative is complete and ITW businesses are demonstrating notably improved financial performance; the Company expects the remaining product line simplification work to largely be accomplished in 2016.The second step, business structure simplification, was to scale-up ITW’s operating structure to support increased engineering, marketing, and sales resources, and to improve global reach and competitiveness, all of which were critical to ITW’s ability to drive accelerated organic growth. ITW now has 84 scaled-up divisions with significantly enhanced focus on growth investments, core customers and products, and customer-back innovation.With the portfolio realignment and scale-up work largely complete, the Company is now able to shift its focus to preparing for, and accelerating, organic growth.As a third preparatory step, ITW is currently in the process of reapplying 80/20 to optimize its newly scaled-up divisions for growth. This process involves first using 80/20 to build a foundation of operational excellence, and then applying 80/20-driven insights to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth.Once the business is operationally excellent and has identified the right growth opportunities, the final step is to accelerate organic growth. The process of preparing for accelerated organic growth generally takes 18 to 24 months.Based on the financial performance of the divisions that are further along in this process, the Company believes that this framework is capable of delivering above market organic growth in all ITW segments. Many ITW divisions are ready to grow and growing above their respective markets, while the rest of the Company’s divisions are at various phases of preparing to grow. ITW management is fully aligned on this plan and very focused on executing it. By the end of 2016, the Company expects approximately 85 percent of its businesses to be ready to grow.Leverage the ITW Business Model to Deliver Best-in-Class Margins and ReturnsThe Company’s work to deliver best-in-class margins and returns is focused on two key areas of ongoing activity. The first is strategic sourcing, where the Company seeks to benefit from its size and scale in procurement processes. Sourcing is now a core strategic and operational capability and this improved competitiveness supports ITW’s organic growth framework. The Company’s 80/20-enabled sourcing organization has delivered an average of 1 percent reduction in spend each year in 2013-2015 and is on track to do the same in 2016 and 2017.The second element of the margins and returns area of focus is to better leverage the full power of the ITW Business Model through a much more consistent and focused approach to 80/20 best practice implementation across the Company. ITW has clearly defined what excellence in the practice of ITW’s 80/20 management process looks like and the result is significant opportunity to create meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the Company’s improvement in both operating margin and after-tax return on invested capital. These 80/20 initiatives can result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns.11TERMS USED BY ITWManagement uses the following terms to describe the financial results of operations of the Company:•Organic business - acquired businesses that have been included in the Company's results of operations for more than 12 months on a constant currency basis.•Operating leverage - the estimated effect of the organic revenue volume changes on organic operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period.•Price/cost - represents the estimated net impact of increases or decreases in the cost of materials used in the Company's products versus changes in the selling price to the Company's customers.•Product line simplification (PLS) - focuses businesses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines; in the short-term, PLS may result in a decrease in revenue and overhead costs while improving operating margin. In the long-term, PLS is expected to result in growth in revenue, profitability, and returns.Unless otherwise stated, the changes in financial results in the consolidated results of operations and the results of operations by segment represent the current year period versus the comparable period in the prior year. The following discussion of operating results should be read in conjunction with Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSIn the first quarter, the Company delivered solid financial results primarily attributable to the continued successful execution of enterprise initiatives despite challenging end market conditions and foreign currency translation headwinds.The Company’s consolidated results of operations for the first quarter of 2016 and 2015 were as follows:•Operating revenue decreased 2.0% primarily due to the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation.•Organic revenue grew 0.7% as consumer-facing businesses increased 3.3%, representing approximately 60% of total revenues, partially offset by a decline of 3.1% in the industrial-facing businesses.◦Construction Products, Automotive OEM, Food Equipment and Specialty Products had solid worldwide organic revenue growth primarily due to higher end market demand, penetration gains and product innovation. Organic revenue declined in the Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments primarily as a result of lower demand in the oil and gas end markets and the impact of a challenging capital spending environment.◦PLS activities associated with the portfolio management component of the Company's Enterprise Strategy reduced organic revenue growth by approximately one percentage point.◦North American organic revenue increased 1.8% as growth in the Construction Products, Automotive OEM, Food Equipment and Specialty Products segments was partially offset by a decline in the Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments.◦Europe, Middle East and Africa organic revenue increased 0.5%. Growth in the Automotive OEM and Food Equipment segments was partially offset by a decline in the Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments.◦Asia Pacific organic revenue decreased 1.8% primarily due to a decline in the Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments, partially offset by growth in the Construction Products segment.•Operating income of $722 million increased 3.7%. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency translation of 2.6%, operating income would have increased 6.3%.12•First quarter record operating margin of 22.1% increased 120 basis points primarily due to the benefit of the Company's enterprise initiatives that contributed 130 basis points, favorable price/cost and positive operating leverage each contributed 20 basis points, partially offset by additional investment in the business and overhead inflation.•Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.29 increased 6.6%. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency of $0.04 per diluted share, EPS would have increased 9.9%.•Free cash flow was $422 million in the first quarter of 2016. Refer to the Cash Flow section of Liquidity and Capital Resources for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure.•The Company repurchased approximately 5.3 million shares of its common stock in the first quarter of 2016 for approximately $500 million.•Total cash dividends of $200 million were paid in the first quarter of 2016.•First quarter record adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital was 21.2%, an increase of 180 basis points. Refer to the Adjusted After-Tax Return on Average Invested Capital section of Liquidity and Capital Resources for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENTTotal operating revenue and operating income for the first quarter of 2016 and 2015 were as follows:AUTOMOTIVE OEMThis segment is a global, niche supplier to top tier OEMs, providing unique innovation to address pain points for sophisticated customers with complex problems.

The decrease was primarily due to a $15 million gain on the sale of a business in the first quarter of 2015 and lower  interest income in 2016, partially offset by a decrease in an equity investment loss.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for revenue recognition. The core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, several new revenue recognition disclosures will be required. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact the guidance will have upon adoption.In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for recognizing leasing transactions. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize a lease liability and lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a lease term greater than twelve months in the statement of financial position. Subsequent measurement, including presentation of expenses and cash flows, will depend on the classification of the lease as either a financing or operating lease. In addition, several new disclosures will be required. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact the guidance will have upon adoption.In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that includes several changes to simplify the accounting for stock-based compensation, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements and cash flow statement classification. The new guidance will require recognition of the income tax effects associated with the vesting or settlement of stock-based awards in income tax expense rather than additional paid-in-capital. The income tax effects will also be presented as an operating cash flow in the statement of cash flows rather than a financing activity. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact the guidance will have upon adoption.18LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe Company’s primary sources of liquidity are free cash flow and short-term credit facilities. In addition, the Company had $2.4 billion of cash on hand at March 31, 2016 and also maintains strong access to public debt markets. Management believes that these sources are sufficient to service debt and to finance the Company's capital allocation priorities, which include:•internal investments to support organic growth and sustain core businesses;•payment of an attractive dividend to shareholders; and•external investments in selective strategic acquisitions that support organic growth focus and an active share repurchase program.The Company believes that, based on its revenue, operating margin, current free cash flow, and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary.Cash FlowThe Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. Summarized cash flow information for the first quarter of 2016 and 2015 was as follows: Three Months Ended March 31,In millions2016 2015Net cash provided by operating activities$479 $442Additions to plant and equipment(57) (83)Free cash flow$422 $359    Cash dividends paid$(200) $(186)Repurchases of common stock(480) (1,479)Acquisition of businesses (excluding cash and equivalents) and additional interest in affiliates(2) (2)Net proceeds from (repayment of) debt(525) 233Other51 62Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and equivalents92 (305)Net increase (decrease) in cash and equivalents$(642) $(1,318)Stock Repurchase ProgramsOn August 2, 2013, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provided for the buyback of up to $6.0 billion of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2013 Program”). Under the 2013 Program, the Company repurchased approximately 14.9 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $96.84 in the first quarter of 2015. The 2013 Program was completed in the first quarter of 2015.On February 13, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to $6.0 billion of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2015 Program”). Under the 2015 Program, the Company repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $97.19 in the first quarter of 2015, approximately 1.9 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $97.19 in the second quarter of 2015, approximately 2.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $84.45 in the third quarter of 2015 and approximately 5.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $94.07 in the first quarter of 2016. As of March 31, 2016, there were approximately $4.9 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2015 Program.19Adjusted After-Tax Return on Average Invested CapitalThe Company uses adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations, as well as the Company's equity investment in the Wilsonart business (formerly the Decorative Surfaces segment). Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter.ROIC for the first quarter of 2016 and 2015 was as follows:ROIC increased 180 basis points for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of a 5.2% improvement in after-tax operating income and a 3.6% decrease in adjusted average invested capital.20Working CapitalManagement uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the Company. Net working capital as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is summarized as follows:The decrease in net working capital as of March 31, 2016 was primarily driven by lower cash and equivalents which were used to fund share repurchases.Cash and equivalents totaled approximately $2.4 billion as of March 31, 2016 and $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2015, primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries. The reduction in cash on hand was primarily driven by the share repurchases discussed above. Cash and equivalents held internationally may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the U.S. Cash and equivalents balances held internationally are typically used for international operating needs, reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses, used to fund new international acquisitions, or used to repay debt held internationally. In the U.S., the Company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs, which primarily consist of dividend payments, share repurchases, acquisitions, servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs. The Company also uses its commercial paper program, which is backed by long-term credit facilities, for short-term liquidity needs. The Company believes cash generated domestically and liquidity provided by the Company's commercial paper program will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the U.S.DebtTotal debt as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was as follows:Short-term debt as of December 31, 2015 included commercial paper of $498 million. There was no commercial paper outstanding as of March 31, 2016. In addition, in the first quarter of 2016, the Company reclassified $649 million related to the 0.90% notes due February 25, 2017 from Long-term debt to Short-term debt.Total Debt to EBITDAThe Company uses the ratio of total debt to EBITDA to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. The Company believes that total debt to EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to EBITDA. EBITDA and the ratio of total debt to EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. The ratio of total debt to EBITDA represents total debt divided by net income before interest expense, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization and impairment of intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis.21Total debt to EBITDA for the trailing twelve month periods ended March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was as follows:Stockholders’ EquityThe changes to stockholders’ equity during 2016 were as follows:In millions Total stockholders’ equity, December 31, 2015$5,228Net income468Cash dividends declared(198)Repurchases of common stock(500)Stock option and restricted stock activity51Foreign currency translation adjustments, net of tax164Other9Total stockholders’ equity, March 31, 2016$5,222FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
