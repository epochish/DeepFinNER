been issued to officers and other management employees under ITWs 1996 Stock Incentive Plan. The stock options generally vest over a four-year period and have a maturity of ten years from the issuance date. Restricted stock generally vests over a three-year period. The restricted shares vest only if the employee is actively employed by the Company on the vesting date, and unvested shares are forfeited upon retirement, death or disability, unless the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determines otherwise. The restricted shares carry full voting and dividend rights unless the shares are forfeited. To cover the exercise of vested options, the Company generally issues new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool. At September 30, 2005, 18,048,432 shares of ITW common stock were reserved for issuance under this plan. Option exercise prices are equal to the common stock fair market value on the date of grant.   Effective January 1, 2005, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which requires the Company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity awards based on the grant date fair value. Starting in 2005, the Company records compensation cost related to the amortization of the unamortized grant date fair value of stock awards unvested as of December 31, 2004 over the remaining service periods of those awards. SFAS 123R superseded Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25).   Prior to 2005, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with APB 25, using the intrinsic value method, which did not require that compensation cost be recognized for the Companys stock options. The Companys net income and net income per share for 2004 would have been reduced if compensation cost related to stock options had been expensed based on fair value at the grant dates. Pro forma net income as if the fair value method had been applied to all awards is as follows:   (In thousands, except for per share amounts)            Three Months Ended September 30       Nine Months Ended September 30                 2005       2004       2005       2004         Net income as reported       $   408,202       $   330,051       $   1,094,290       $   980,597         Add: Restricted stock and stock options recorded as                                                          expense, net of tax           10,215           5,942           32,694           18,026         Deduct: Total stock-based compensation                                                          expense, net of tax           (10,215   )       (10,552   )       (32,694   )       (31,856   )     Pro forma net income       $   408,202       $   325,441       $   1,094,290       $   966,767                                                                   Net income per share:                                                         Basic  as reported           $1.44           $1.10           $3.81           $3.21         Basic  pro forma           $1.44           $1.08           $3.81           $3.17         Diluted  as reported           $1.43           $1.09           $3.78           $3.19         Diluted  pro forma           $1.43           $1.07           $3.78           $3.14            The following table summarizes the components of the Companys stock-based compensation programs recorded as expense:   (In thousands)            Three Months Ended September 30       Nine Months Ended September 30                 2005       2004       2005       2004         Restricted Stock:                                                         Pretax compensation expense       $   7,679       $   8,076       $   25,458       $   24,475         Tax benefit           (2,054   )       (2,134   )       (6,767   )       (6,449   )     Restricted stock expense, net of tax       $   5,625       $   5,942       $   18,691       $   18,026                                                                   Stock Options:                                                         Pretax compensation expense       $   6,468       $          $   19,782       $            Tax benefit           (1,878   )                  (5,779   )                Stock option expense, net of tax       $   4,590       $          $   14,003       $                                                                      Total Stock-Based Compensation:                                                         Pretax compensation expense       $   14,147       $   8,076       $   45,240       $   24,475         Tax benefit           (3,932   )       (2,134   )       (12,546   )       (6,449   )     Total restricted stock and stock options recorded as                                                          expense, net of tax       $   10,215       $   5,942       $   32,694       $   18,026         The following table summarizes the annual estimated pretax impact of compensation cost related to equity awards granted through September 30, 2005:   (In thousands)    The following table summarizes information on unvested restricted stock and stock options outstanding as of September 30, 2005:               The estimated fair value of the options granted during 2004 was calculated using a binomial option pricing model. Previous grants were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following summarizes the assumptions used in the 2004 binomial model:       Risk-free interest rate           2.61 - 4.26   %         Expected stock volatility           15.5 - 25.4   %         Weighted average volatility           24.6   %         Dividend yield           1.15   %         Expected years until exercise           2.6 - 6.3             Lattice-based option valuation models, such as the binomial option pricing model, incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs. The risk-free rate of interest for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on a zero-coupon U.S. government instrument over the contractual term of the equity instrument. Expected volatility is based on implied volatility from traded options on the Companys stock and historical volatility of the Companys stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise timing and employee termination rates within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The ranges given above result from separate groups of employees exhibiting different behavior.    The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during 2004 was $21.99 per share. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 was $15,858,000 and $77,519,000, respectively. Aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and options exercisable at September 30, 2005 was $199,549,000 and $185,068,000, respectively. Exercise of options during the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, resulted in cash receipts of $18,318,000 and $69,029,000, respectively. For the quarter ended September 30, 2005, the weighted average remaining contractual term of options outstanding and options exercisable was 5.86 years and 4.75 years, respectively.

(In thousands)       (4)   GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS:     Goodwill represents the excess cost over fair value of the net assets of purchased businesses. The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. In the first quarter of each year, the Company performs an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives based on the fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset.    As of December 31, 2004, the Company had assigned its recorded goodwill and intangible assets to approximately 340 of its 650 reporting units. When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Fair values are determined by discounting estimated future cash flows at the Companys estimated cost of capital of 10%. Estimated future cash flows are based either on current operating cash flows or on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant operating unit. If the fair value of an operating unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value of the units goodwill and the carrying value of the goodwill.   Amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for the periods ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 were as follows:   (In thousands)            Three Months Ended September 30       Nine Months Ended September 30                 2005       2004       2005       2004         Goodwill:                                                         Impairment       $          $          $   6,206       $   11,492         Intangible Assets:                                                         Amortization           15,770           10,617           45,718           25,980         Impairment                                 5,049           10,220         Total       $   15,770       $   10,617       $   56,973       $   47,692         In the first quarter of 2005, the Company performed its annual impairment testing of its goodwill and intangible assets, which resulted in impairment charges of $11,255,000. The first quarter 2005 goodwill impairment charges of $6,206,000 were primarily related to a Canadian stretch packaging equipment business and a U.S. welding components business, and resulted from lower estimated future cash flows than previously expected. Also in the first quarter of 2005, intangible asset impairments of $5,049,000 were recorded to reduce to estimated fair value the carrying value of trademarks, patents and customer-related intangible assets related to a U.S. business that manufactures clean room mats in the Engineered Products  North America segment.   In the first quarter of 2004, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $11,492,000, which were primarily related to a European automotive components business and a U.S. electrical components business and resulted from lower estimated future cash flows than previously expected. Also in the first quarter of 2004, intangible asset impairments of $10,220,000 were recorded to reduce to estimated fair value the carrying value of trademarks and brands related primarily to several U.S. welding components businesses and a U.S. industrial packaging business in the Specialty Systems  North America segment and a U.S. business that manufactures clean room mats in the Engineered Products  North America segment.

As of September 30, 2005, contributions of $91,425,000 have been made.      (6)   SHORT-TERM DEBT:     In 2004, the Company entered into a $400,000,000 Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 17, 2005. On March 7, 2005, the Company exercised a provision of the Line of Credit Agreement which provided for an increase in the aggregate commitment by $200,000,000 to a total of $600,000,000. This line of credit was replaced on June 17, 2005, by a $600,000,000 Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 16, 2006.   The Company had outstanding commercial paper of $278,458,000 at September 30, 2005 and $134,982,000 at December 31, 2004.          (7)   LONG-TERM DEBT:     On March 18, 2005, the Company issued $53,735,000 of 4.88% senior notes due December 31, 2020 at 100% of face value. The effective interest rate of the senior debt is 4.96%.   In June 2003, the Company entered into a $350,000,000 revolving credit facility (RCF). This RCF was replaced on June 17, 2005 by a $350,000,000 RCF with a termination date of June 17, 2010.          (8)   INCOME TAXES:     In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) was enacted in the United States. One of the provisions of the AJCA was to allow a special one-time dividends-received deduction of 85% on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to U.S. taxpayers, provided certain criteria regarding the sources and uses of the repatriated funds are met. The Company has not finalized its 2005 repatriation plans related to the AJCA. The range of possible total 2005 repatriated amounts and the related tax effects are as follows:      (In thousands)       Minimum       Maximum         Estimated repatriation       $   1,054,000       $   1,218,000         Estimated U.S. tax cost of repatriation       $   29,500       $   35,000             In 2004, the Company recorded a deferred tax liability of $25,000,000 to reflect the estimated tax cost of the minimum foreign dividends expected to be repatriated under the AJCA in 2005. As of September 30, 2005, the Company has repatriated $1,054,000,000 and recorded additional tax expense in the third quarter of 2005 of $4,500,000 to reflect the estimated tax cost of foreign dividends.      (9)   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:     The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including those involving environmental, tax, product liability (including toxic tort) and general liability claims. The Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are based on developments to date, the Companys estimates of the outcomes of these matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling other similar matters. The Company believes resolution of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, liquidity or future operations.    Among the toxic tort cases in which the Company is a defendant, the Company as well as its subsidiaries Hobart Brothers Company and Miller Electric Mfg. Co., have been named, along with numerous other defendants, in lawsuits alleging injury from exposure to welding rod fumes. The plaintiffs in these suits claim unspecified damages for injuries resulting from the plaintiffs alleged exposure to asbestos, manganese and/or toxic fumes in connection with the welding process. Based upon the Companys experience in defending these claims, the Company believes that the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, liquidity or future operations. The Company has not recorded any significant reserves related to these cases.   Wilsonart International, Inc. (Wilsonart), a wholly owned subsidiary of ITW, is a defendant in a consolidated class action lawsuit filed in 2000 in federal district court in White Plains, New York on behalf of purchasers of high-pressure laminate. The complaint alleges that Wilsonart participated in a conspiracy with competitors to fix, raise, maintain or stabilize prices for high-pressure laminate between 1994 and 2000 and seeks injunctive relief and treble damages. Indirect purchasers of high-pressure laminate filed similar purported class action cases under various state antitrust and consumer protection statutes in 13 states and the District of Columbia, all of which cases have been stayed pending the outcome of the consolidated class action. These lawsuits were brought following the commencement of a federal grand jury investigation into price-fixing in the high-pressure laminate industry, which investigation was subsequently closed by the Department of Justice with no further proceedings and with all documents being returned to the parties. Plaintiffs are seeking damages of $470,000,000 before trebling. Without admitting liability, Wilsonarts co-defendants, International Paper Company and Panolam International, Inc. have settled the federal consolidated class action case for $31,000,000 and $9,500,000, respectively. The plaintiffs claims against Formica Corporation, the remaining co-defendant in the case, were dismissed with prejudice on September 27, 2004 as a result of its bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, Wilsonart is the sole remaining defendant in the consolidated class action lawsuit. While no assurances can be given regarding the ultimate outcome or the timing of the resolution of these claims, the Company believes that the plaintiffs claims are without merit and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in this action and all related actions that are now pending or that may be brought in the future.

Internationally, base business revenues increased 2% in the third quarter and 3% year-to-date. The growth in North American revenues in both periods was primarily due to the continuing impact of price increases implemented to offset raw material cost increases, modest growth in industrial production and increased demand in certain capital equipment markets. Slowing economic growth in Europe continues to hamper international revenue growth.   Operating income for the third quarter of 2005 and year-to-date period improved due to leverage from the growth in base business revenue, income from acquired companies and favorable currency translation. These increases were partially offset in both periods by increased restructuring expenses. Variable margins improved modestly in the third quarter of 2005 due to price increases to recover higher raw material costs. However, year-to-date variable margins have remained below last years levels for the year-to-date period due to raw material cost increases. Lower overhead cost in the third quarter of 2005 also contributed to the increase in income. Leasing and Investments income increased in the third quarter due to gains on sales in the commercial mortgage portfolio but decreased year-to-date due to lower year-to-date gains on sales of mortgage properties and lower income from leases of equipment. In addition, operating income in the third quarter and year-to-date periods was negatively impacted by pretax charges to expense stock options of $6.5 million and $19.8 million, respectively. A 2005 first quarter charge of $8.7 million to resolve accounting issues at a European food equipment business negatively impacted income in the year-to-date period.   As a result of the Companys annual impairment testing of its goodwill and intangible assets, impairment charges of $11.3 million were incurred in the first quarter of 2005. The impaired assets reflected diminished expectations of future cash flows and primarily related to a Canadian stretch packaging equipment business, a U.S. welding components business and a U.S. business that manufactures clean room mats.

Construction base revenues increased 2% for both the third quarter and year-to-date periods, primarily as a result of growth in the residential, remodeling/rehab and commercial construction markets. Automotive base revenues increased 3% and 1% for the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, despite a 6% year-to-date decline in automotive production at the large domestic North American automotive manufacturers. This was due to increased product penetration which helped to offset lower production levels. Base revenues from the other industrial-based businesses in this segment grew 3% and 6% for the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, as a result of increased demand in a broad array of end markets. The incremental acquisition revenue in the third quarter was primarily related to the acquisitions of a construction business in the second quarter of 2004, an automotive components business in the third quarter of 2004, one engineered polymers business in the fourth quarter of 2004, another engineered polymers business in the first quarter of 2005 and an automotive fasteners business in the third quarter of 2005. Year-to-date revenue also benefited from the acquisition of a construction business in the second quarter of 2004.   Operating income increased for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2005 primarily due to leverage from the growth in base business revenues described above, increased acquisition income and lower overhead costs stemming from 2004 restructuring projects. In addition, variable margins increased 0.4% in the third quarter of 2005 as raw material cost increases were fully recovered through price increases. Year-to-date variable margins declined 0.7% due to raw material cost increases as well as sales declines in high margin businesses. In addition, year-to-date income was higher due to lower goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges over the prior year. In the first quarter of 2005, an intangible asset impairment charge of $5.1 million was recorded related to the intangibles of a U.S. manufacturer of clean room mats. Additionally, year-to-date income increased due to a $10.0 million charge in the second quarter of 2004 associated with a warranty issue related to a discontinued product at the Wilsonart laminate business.

The acquisition revenue increase was primarily due to the acquisition of a European polymers business at the end of the fourth quarter of 2004 and a European construction business in the second quarter of 2005. Year-to-date revenue was also favorably impacted by the second quarter 2004 acquisition of two European fluid products businesses and a first quarter 2004 acquisition of a European polymers business. Base business construction revenues increased 1% and 3% in the third quarter and year-to-date, respectively, as the European and Australasian markets remained weak in the third quarter of 2005. Increased demand at the Wilsonart high pressure laminate businesses offset declines in other sectors of the Asian construction businesses in the third quarter and year-to-date. In addition, automotive base revenues declined 3% and 4% in the third quarter and year-to-date period, respectively, primarily due to declines in automotive production at some European automotive manufacturers. The other businesses in this segment serve a broad array of industrial and commercial end markets. Base revenues from these businesses decreased 2% and 1% for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2005, respectively, due primarily to the sluggish European economy.    Operating income for the third quarter of 2005 increased primarily due to acquisitions, lower operating costs and the favorable effect of currency translation offset by lower base revenues and increased restructuring expenses. Year-to-date income increased primarily due to favorable currency translation, acquisitions, and lower impairment expenses offset by higher operating costs and restructuring expenses.

The results of operations for the Specialty Systems  International segment for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2005 and 2004 were as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)    In the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2005, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:              Three Months Ended September 30       Nine Months Ended September 30             % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)       % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)                 Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins       Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins         Base manufacturing business:                                                         Revenue change/Operating leverage       4.5   %   12.8   %   1.1   %   5.3   %   15.9   %   1.3   %     Changes in variable margins and                                                         overhead costs              (13.0   )   (1.7   )          (16.8   )   (2.1   )     Total       4.5       (0.2   )   (0.6   )   5.3       (0.9   )   (0.8   )                                                               Restructuring costs              (13.6   )   (1.8   )          (6.5   )   (0.8   )     Impairment of goodwill and intangibles                                   0.1                Acquisitions and divestitures       2.8       2.1       (0.1   )   2.7       0.5       (0.2   )     Translation       0.7       1.8       0.2       4.1       4.9       0.1         Total       8.0   %   (9.9   )%   (2.3   )%   12.1   %   (1.9   )%   (1.7   )%     Revenues increased in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2005 mainly due to base business revenue growth, revenues from acquired companies and favorable currency translation, primarily as a result of the Euro strengthening versus the U.S. dollar. Food equipment base revenues increased 3% and 4% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, while industrial packaging base revenues increased 6% and 7% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively. Other base business revenues, including the welding and finishing businesses, increased 2% in both the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2005. The incremental acquisition revenue was primarily related to the acquisition of a decorating business in the first quarter of 2005, a resealable plastic packaging business in the third quarter of 2005 and an aircraft ground power business in the third quarter of 2005.   Operating income increased in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2005 primarily as a result of the revenue increases and currency changes described above. Variable margin declines of 0.5% and 0.9% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, offset these increases. Year-to-date variable margins were adversely affected by raw material cost increases. Also, third quarter 2005 income was negatively impacted by an increase in overhead costs. Third quarter 2005 income was adversely affected by increased restructuring expenses primarily related to several industrial packaging, food equipment and decorating businesses. In addition, year-to-date operating income decreased due to a 2005 first quarter adjustment of $8.7 million to resolve accounting issues at a European food equipment business.    LEASING AND INVESTMENTS   Businesses in this segment make investments in mortgage entities, leases of telecommunications, aircraft, air traffic control and other equipment, properties, affordable housing and a venture capital fund. As a result of the Companys strong cash flow, the Company has historically had excess funds to make opportunistic investments that meet the Companys desired returns. In connection with some of these investment transactions, the Company may be contractually required to make future cash payments related to affordable housing contributions, venture fund capital contributions or the redemption of preferred stock of subsidiaries. See the Companys Annual Report to Stockholders for further information regarding these contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004.     The results of operations for the Leasing and Investments segment for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2005 and 2004 were as follows:   (In thousands)    Operating income (loss) by investment for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2005 and 2004 were as follows:   (In thousands)    In the third quarter of 2005 operating income was higher primarily due to gains of $35.6 million on sales of three commercial mortgage properties, partially offset by impairments of $6.1 million, versus gains of $2.9 million on the sale of three commercial mortgage properties in 2004. In the third quarter of 2005, income from mark-to-market adjustments on venture capital was $9.2 million higher than in 2004.   For the year-to-date period, operating income was lower primarily due to gains net of impairments on commercial mortgage properties of $23.4 million in 2005 versus net gains of $41.1 million in 2004. Additionally, in the year-to-date 2005 period, income from leases of equipment was $9.6 million lower than 2004 due to the normal decline in leveraged lease income.   OPERATING REVENUES   The reconciliation of segment operating revenues to total operating revenues is as follows:   (In thousands)    AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS   The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. In the first quarter of each year, the Company performs an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives based on the fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset.    As of December 31, 2004, the Company had assigned its recorded goodwill and intangible assets to approximately 340 of its 650 reporting units. When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Fair values are determined by discounting estimated future cash flows at the Companys estimated cost of capital of 10%. Estimated future cash flows are based either on current operating cash flows or on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant operating unit. If the fair value of an operating unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value of the units goodwill and the carrying value of the goodwill.   Amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for the periods ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 were as follows:   (In thousands)            Three Months Ended September 30       Nine Months Ended September 30                 2005       2004       2005       2004         Goodwill:                                                         Impairment       $          $          $   6,206       $   11,492         Intangible Assets:                                                         Amortization           15,770           10,617           45,718           25,980         Impairment                                 5,049           10,220         Total       $   15,770       $   10,617       $   56,973       $   47,692         In the first quarter of 2005, the Company performed its annual impairment testing of its goodwill and intangible assets, which resulted in impairment charges of $11.3 million. The first quarter 2005 goodwill impairment charges of $6.2 million were primarily related to a Canadian stretch packaging equipment business and a U.S. welding components business and resulted from lower estimated future cash flows than previously expected. Also in the first quarter of 2005, intangible asset impairments of $5.1 million were recorded to reduce to estimated fair value the carrying value of trademarks, patents and customer-related intangible assets related to a U.S. business that manufactures clean room mats in the Engineered Products  North America segment.    In the first quarter of 2004, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $11.5 million, which were primarily related to a European automotive components business and a U.S. electrical components business and resulted from lower estimated future cash flows than previously expected. Also in the first quarter of 2004, intangible asset impairments of $10.2 million were recorded to reduce to estimated fair value the carrying value of trademarks and brands related primarily to several U.S. welding components businesses and a U.S. industrial packaging business in the Specialty Systems  North America segment and a U.S. business that manufactures clean room mats in the Engineered Products  North America segment.   INTEREST EXPENSE   Interest expense increased to $64.3 million in the first nine months of 2005 from $53.4 million in 2004 primarily due to interest expense related to the issuance of commercial paper in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first three quarters of 2005 offset by lower interest expense at international operations.   OTHER INCOME   Other income decreased to $9.5 million for the first nine months of 2005 from $17.5 million in 2004, primarily due to an estimated loss on a proposed divestiture in 2005, lower interest income in 2005 versus 2004 and losses in 2005 on the sale of fixed assets versus gains in 2004. This is partially offset by currency translation gains in 2005 versus losses in 2004 and lower minority interest expense in 2005.   INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS   Income from continuing operations of $1,094.3 million ($3.78 per diluted share) in the first nine months of 2005 was 11.6% higher than the 2004 income from continuing operations of $980.4 million ($3.19 per diluted share).   FOREIGN CURRENCY   The weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in 2005 increased operating revenues for the first nine months of 2005 by approximately $179.0 million and increased earnings by approximately 7 cents per diluted share.     NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   Effective January 1, 2005, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. See the Stock-Based Compensation footnote for further details of the effect of the adoption of this pronouncement.    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   Cash Flow   The Companys primary source of liquidity is free operating cash flow. Management continues to believe that such internally generated cash flow will be adequate to service existing debt and to continue to pay dividends that meet its dividend payout objective of 25-30% of the last three years average net income. In addition, free operating cash flow is expected to be adequate to finance internal growth, small-to-medium sized acquisitions and additional investments.   The Company uses free operating cash flow to measure normal cash flow generated by its operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions, debt repayment and additional investments. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.   On April 19, 2004 the Companys Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, which provides for the buy back of up to 31 million shares. In the third quarter of 2005, the Company repurchased 5,527,805 shares of its common stock at an average price of $84.86 per share. Since the inception of the program, the Company has repurchased 31,000,000 shares of its common stock for $2.8 billion at an average price of $89.41 per share. The Company completed the share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2005.   Summarized cash flow information for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2005 and 2004 was as follows:   (In thousands)        Return on Invested Capital   The Company uses return on average invested capital (ROIC) to measure the effectiveness of the operations use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2005 and 2004 was as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)    The 280 basis point increase in ROIC in the third quarter of 2005 was due primarily to a 25% increase in after-tax operating income, mainly as a result of increased operating income from base business and Leasing and Investments and a decrease in the effective tax rate to 32% in the third quarter of 2005 from 34% in the third quarter of 2004. The positive impact was partially offset by an increase in average invested capital from acquisitions.    The 30 basis point increase in ROIC for year-to-date 2005 was due primarily to a 13% increase in after-tax operating income, mainly as a result of increased operating income from base business and a decrease in the year-to-date effective tax rate to 32% in 2005 from 34% in 2004. The positive impact was partially offset by an increase in average invested capital from acquisitions.    Working Capital   Net working capital at September 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004 is summarized as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)    Cash and equivalents decreased due to the repurchase of common stock and cash paid for acquisitions and dividends, partially offset by cash flows from operating activities. Trade receivables increased due to increased sales. The increase in domestic short-term debt is primarily due to the issuance of commercial paper to fund the stock repurchase program, acquisitions and dividends.     In May 2005, the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service issued a notice that provides detailed tax guidance for U.S. companies that elect to repatriate earnings from foreign subsidiaries subject to the temporary tax rate available under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. As of September 30, 2005, the Company has repatriated $1.1 billion in foreign dividends.    Debt   Total debt at September 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004 was as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)    In 2004, the Company entered into a $400.0 million Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 17, 2005. On March 7, 2005, the Company exercised a provision of the Line of Credit Agreement which provided for an increase in the aggregate commitment by $200.0 million to a total of $600.0 million. This line of credit was replaced on June 17, 2005, by a $600.0 million Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 16, 2006. This debt capacity is for use principally to support any issuances of commercial paper and to fund larger acquisitions.   The Company had outstanding commercial paper of $278.5 million at September 30, 2005 and $135.0 million at December 31, 2004.   On March 18, 2005, the Company issued $53.7 million of 4.88% senior notes due December 31, 2020 at 100% of face value. The effective interest rate of the senior debt is 4.96%.   In June 2003, the Company entered into a $350.0 million revolving credit facility (RCF). This RCF was replaced on June 17, 2005, by a $350.0 million RCF with a termination date of June 17, 2010.
