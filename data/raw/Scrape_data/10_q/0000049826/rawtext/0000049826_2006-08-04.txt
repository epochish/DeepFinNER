(In thousands)       (3)   INVENTORIES     Inventories at June 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 were as follows:   (In thousands)       (4)   GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS     Goodwill represents the excess cost over fair value of the net assets of purchased businesses. The Company does not amortize goodwill or intangible assets that have indefinite lives. In the first quarter of each year, the Company performs an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives based on the fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset.   As of January 1, 2006, the Company had assigned its recorded goodwill and intangible assets to approximately 375 of its 700 reporting units. When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Fair values are determined by discounting estimated future cash flows at the Companys estimated cost of capital of 10%. Estimated future cash flows are based either on current operating cash flows or on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant operating unit. If the fair value of an operating unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value of the units goodwill and the carrying value of the goodwill.     Amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for the periods ended June 30, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:   (In thousands)            Three Months Ended June 30       Six Months Ended June 30                 2006       2005       2006       2005         Goodwill:                                                         Impairment       $          $          $   9,200       $   6,206         Intangible Assets:                                                         Amortization           24,664           15,213           48,452           29,948         Impairment                                 2,985           5,049         Total       $   24,664       $   15,213       $   60,637       $   41,203         In the first quarter of 2006, the Company performed its annual impairment testing of its goodwill and intangible assets, which resulted in impairment charges of $12,185,000. The first quarter 2006 goodwill impairment charges of $9,200,000 were primarily related to a U.S. joist business, a U.S. heat transfer business and an Asian construction business, and resulted from lower estimated future cash flows than previously expected. Also in the first quarter of 2006, intangible asset impairments of $2,985,000 were recorded to reduce to the estimated fair value the carrying value of trademarks, patents and customer-related intangible assets primarily related to a U.S. welding components business in the Specialty Systems  North America segment and a U.S. contamination control business in the Engineered Products  North America segment.   In the first quarter of 2005, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $6,206,000, which were primarily related to a Canadian stretch packaging equipment business and a U.S. welding components business, and which resulted from lower estimated future cash flows than previously expected. Also in the first quarter of 2005, intangible asset impairments of $5,049,000 were recorded to reduce to estimated fair value the carrying value of trademarks, patents and customer-related intangible assets related to a U.S. business that manufactures clean room mats in the Engineered Products  North America segment.      (5)   RETIREMENT PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS     Pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the periods ended June 30, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:   (In thousands)    The Company expects to contribute $75,000,000 to its pension plans in 2006. As of June 30, 2006, contributions of $15,219,000 have been made.        (6)   SHORT-TERM DEBT     In June 2005, the Company entered into a $600,000,000 Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 16, 2006. This line of credit was replaced on June 16, 2006, by a $600,000,000 Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 15, 2007. No amounts were outstanding under this facility at June 30, 2006.   The Company had outstanding commercial paper of $19,988,000 at June 30, 2006 and $94,488,000 at December 31, 2005.      (7)   LONG-TERM DEBT     In June 2005, the Company entered into a $350,000,000 revolving credit facility (RCF) with a termination date of June 17, 2010. This RCF was replaced on June 16, 2006 by a $350,000,000 RCF with a termination date of June 16, 2011. No amounts were outstanding under this facility at June 30, 2006.      (8)   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES     The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including those involving environmental, tax, product liability (including toxic tort) and general liability claims. The Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are based on developments to date, the Companys estimates of the outcomes of these matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling other similar matters. The Company believes resolution of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, liquidity or future operations.    Among the toxic tort cases in which the Company is a defendant, the Company as well as its subsidiaries Hobart Brothers Company and Miller Electric Mfg. Co., have been named, along with numerous other defendants, in lawsuits alleging injury from exposure to welding consumables. The plaintiffs in these suits claim unspecified damages for injuries resulting from the plaintiffs alleged exposure to asbestos, manganese and/or toxic fumes in connection with the welding process. Based upon the Companys experience in defending these claims, the Company believes that the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, liquidity or future operations. The Company has not recorded any significant reserves related to these cases.   Wilsonart International, Inc. (Wilsonart), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in a consolidated class action lawsuit filed in 2000 in federal district court in White Plains, New York on behalf of direct purchasers of high-pressure laminate.  The complaint alleges that Wilsonart participated in a conspiracy with competitors to fix, raise, maintain or stabilize prices for high pressure laminate between 1994 and 2000 and seeks injunctive relief and treble damages.  In addition, indirect purchasers of high-pressure laminate filed similar purported class action cases under various state antitrust and consumer protection laws in 13 states and the District of Columbia, all of which cases have been stayed pending the outcome of the consolidated class action.  On May 24, 2006, after a two month trial, a federal jury unanimously rejected the plaintiffs claims and rendered a verdict in favor of Wilsonart in the consolidated class action lawsuit.  The stay of the 13 states and District of Columbia proceedings has been continued until October 2006.  The company intends to vigorously contest any appeal of the jury verdict in the federal consolidated class action lawsuit as well as any further state court proceedings. The Company has not recorded any reserves related to this case.      (9)   COMMON STOCK     On May 5, 2006, the Board of Directors of ITW approved a two-for-one split of the Companys common stock, with an effective date of May 25, 2006, at a rate of one additional share for each common share held by stockholders of record on May 18, 2006. All per-share data is reported on a post-split basis.    (10)     SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM   On August 4, 2006 the Companys Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program which provides for the buy back of up to 35 million shares.      (11)   SEGMENT INFORMATION     See Managements Discussion and Analysis for information regarding operating revenues and operating income for the Companys segments.   In the first quarter of 2006, the Company announced that given the planned run-off of assets in the Leasing and Investments portfolio and its desire to utilize free cash flow for core manufacturing investments and acquisitions rather than to make additional financial investments, its internal reporting has been revised to eliminate the reporting of Leasing and Investments as an operating segment. Accordingly, income from Leasing and Investment activities will be reported as non-operating investment income. Leasing and Investments results have been reclassified to investment income in the prior years income statement to conform to the current years presentation, as follows:              Three Months Ended       Leasing &       Three Months Ended                 June 30, 2005       Investments       June 30, 2005                 as Previously Reported       Reclassification       as Currently Reported         Operating Revenues       $   3,295,644       $   (9,583   )   $   3,286,061         Cost of revenues           2,156,602           (2,718   )       2,153,884         Selling, administrative, and                                              research & development expense           556,975           83           557,058         Amortization and impairment of                                              goodwill & intangibles           15,213                      15,213         Operating Income       $   566,854       $   (6,948   )   $   559,906         Interest expense           (27,352   )       (1,454   )       (28,806   )     Investment income                      8,455           8,455         Other income (expense)           6,880           (53   )       6,827         Income Before Income Taxes       $   546,382       $          $   546,382                      Six Months Ended       Leasing &       Six Months Ended                 June 30, 2005       Investments       June 30, 2005                 as Previously Reported       Reclassification       as Currently Reported         Operating Revenues       $   6,369,935       $   (31,993   )   $   6,337,942         Cost of revenues           4,178,939           (6,030   )       4,172,909         Selling, administrative, and                                              research & development expense           1,105,050           142           1,105,192         Amortization and impairment of                                              goodwill & intangibles           41,203                      41,203         Operating Income       $   1,044,743       $   (26,105   )   $   1,018,638         Interest expense           (46,079   )       (2,982   )       (49,061   )     Investment income                      29,356           29,356         Other income (expense)           10,324           (269   )       10,055         Income Before Income Taxes       $   1,008,988       $          $   1,008,988                (12)   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS     In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. This Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, and provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. This Interpretation will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2007, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of the Interpretation on its financial statements.   In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 13-2, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction. FSP FAS 13-2 addresses how a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction affects the accounting by a lessor for that lease. FSP FAS 13-2 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2007, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of FSP FAS 13-2 on its financial statements.    Item 2 - Managements Discussion and Analysis   CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   The Companys consolidated results of operations for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2006 and 2005 were as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)    In the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2006, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:              Three Months Ended June 30       Six Months Ended June 30             % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)       % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)                 Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins       Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins         Base manufacturing business:                                                         Revenue change/Operating                                                         leverage       4.5   %   10.7   %   1.0   %   5.3   %   13.2   %   1.2   %     Changes in variable margins and                                                         overhead costs              3.0       0.5              2.6       0.4         Total       4.5       13.7       1.5       5.3       15.8       1.6                                                                   Acquisitions and divestitures       6.7       3.3       (0.7   )   6.0       2.7       (0.6   )     Restructuring costs              1.9       0.3              0.9       0.1         Impairment of goodwill and                                                          intangibles                                   (0.1   )            Translation       (1.4   )   (1.1   )   0.1       (2.0   )   (1.5   )   0.1         Intercompany       (0.9   )          0.2       (0.8   )          0.1         Total       8.9   %   17.8   %   1.4   %   8.5   %   17.8   %   1.3   %     North American base business revenues increased 4.4% and 6.3% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2006, respectively. Base business revenues increased 4.3% and 3.4% internationally for the same periods. The growth in North American revenues was primarily due to growth in industrial production and increased demand in the capital equipment markets that ITW serves. Improvements in economic growth conditions in Europe contributed to the international base revenue growth in the second quarter.   Operating income for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2006 improved due to leverage from the growth in base business revenue, income from acquired companies and lower restructuring expenses, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. Variable margins improved 90 basis points and 100 basis points in the second quarter and year-to-date periods mainly due to sales volume increases, operating efficiency gains and sales price increases in excess of raw material cost increases. Income for the year-to-date period was favorably impacted by a first quarter 2005 charge of $8.7 million to resolve accounting issues at a European food equipment business. In addition, consolidated operating income in the first quarter of 2006 was negatively impacted by a $19.7 million charge related to retiree health care and life insurance liabilities.   As a result of the Companys annual impairment testing of its goodwill and intangible assets, impairment charges of $12.2 million were incurred in the first quarter of 2006. The impaired assets reflected diminished expectations of future cash flows and primarily related to a U.S. joist business, a U.S. welding components business, a U.S. heat transfer business, an Asian construction business and a contamination control business.

The acquired revenue growth was primarily related to the acquisition of a construction business, two machined components businesses and five polymers businesses. Construction base revenues decreased 0.9% in the second quarter of 2006 primarily due to slowing residential construction. Base revenues increased 3.4% for the year-to-date period primarily as a result of growth in the commercial construction markets and new product introductions at the Wilsonart business in the first quarter of 2006. Automotive base revenues increased by 1.2% for the second quarter and 1.4% year-to-date as automotive production at the North American Big 3 automotive manufacturers increased 2% in the first quarter of 2006 and declined 1% in the second quarter. Base revenues from the other industrial-based businesses in this segment grew 6.0% and 7.1% for the second quarter and year-to-date periods as a result of increased demand in a broad array of end markets, particularly the reclosable packaging market.   Operating income increased in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2006 primarily due to leverage from the growth in base business revenues described above, income from acquisitions and lower restructuring expenses. In addition, variable margins increased 130 basis points and 120 basis points in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, as selling price increases fully recovered raw material cost increases and operating costs were lower due to operational efficiencies. Year-to-date 2006 income was unfavorably impacted by higher goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. In the first quarter of 2006, an impairment charge of $5.6 million was recorded primarily related to the goodwill of a U.S. joist business and the intangibles of a contamination control business. In addition, year-to-date income was negatively impacted by a first quarter 2006 charge of $9.8 million related to retiree healthcare and life insurance liabilities.

The revenues from acquisitions increased primarily due to an acquisition of a European construction business and a European laminate business. The increased revenues were partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation, primarily as a result of the Euro weakening against the dollar. Base business construction revenue increased 5.3% and 2.1% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, due to strong demand in both the European and Australasia markets. Automotive base revenues increased 1.6% and 2.3% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to higher production levels at many European automotive manufacturers. Base revenues from the other businesses in this segment increased 5.1% and 3.4% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2006 as they benefited from strong demand in a broad array of industrial and commercial end markets that they serve.     Operating income for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2006 increased primarily due to the positive leverage effect from the increase in base revenue. Lower restructuring expenses also increased income in the second quarter of 2006. Variable margins increased 60 basis points in both periods offset by an increase in overhead costs and unfavorable currency translation. Year-to-date income was negatively affected by a $1.7 million impairment charge related to two Asian construction businesses in the first quarter of 2006.

Welding base revenues increased 20.8% and 21.3% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2006 respectively, due to high demand for replacement equipment and new product introductions. Industrial packaging base revenues grew 3.8% and 4.9%, primarily due to increased demand for machinery. Food equipment base revenues decreased 0.8% in the second quarter and increased 2.3% year-to-date as strong first quarter 2006 demand from restaurant and institutional customers was partially offset by weaker second quarter demand. Base business revenue in the other businesses in this segment, including the marking, decorating and finishing businesses, increased 3.0% for the second quarter and 3.4% in the year-to-date periods, respectively. The acquired revenues were primarily due to the acquisition of a materials and structural testing business in the fourth quarter of 2005 and a coding business in the first quarter of 2006.   Operating income increased in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2006 primarily due to leverage from base business revenue increases described above. In addition, variable margins improved by 120 basis points in both periods mainly due to sales volume increases and operating efficiency gains. Operating income was also higher year-to-date due to lower goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges over the prior year. In the first quarter of 2006, a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $4.7 million was recorded related to the goodwill of a heat transfer business and the goodwill and intangibles of a welding components business. In the first quarter of 2005 an impairment charge of $6.1 million was incurred related to a stretch packaging business and welding components business. Operating income improved in the second quarter of 2006 due to lower restructuring expenses, however, the year-to-date period was adversely affected by increased restructuring expenses in the decorating businesses and food equipment businesses. In addition, operating income was unfavorably impacted year-to-date by a first quarter 2006 charge of $9.8 million related to retiree healthcare and life insurance liabilities.

The results of operations for the Specialty Systems  International segment for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2006 and 2005 were as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)    In the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2006, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:              Three Months Ended June 30       Six Months Ended June 30             % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)       % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)                 Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins       Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins         Base manufacturing business:                                                         Revenue change/Operating                                                         leverage       4.6   %   13.0   %   1.1   %   4.5   %   15.2   %   1.2   %     Changes in variable margins and                                                         overhead costs              4.4       0.6              8.5       0.9         Total       4.6       17.4       1.7       4.5       23.7       2.1                                                                   Acquisitions and divestitures       7.2       2.1       (0.7   )   7.7       1.9       (0.8   )     Restructuring costs              0.5                     1.4       0.1         Impairment of goodwill and                                                          intangibles                                   (0.2   )            Translation       (3.9   )   (4.1   )          (5.5   )   (6.3   )            Total       7.9   %   15.9   %   1.0   %   6.7   %   20.5   %   1.4   %         Revenues increased in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2006 primarily due to base business revenue growth and revenues from acquired companies offset by unfavorable currency translation. Food equipment base revenues increased 3.3% in the second quarter and 3.1% year-to-date, due primarily to growth in European institutional demand. Industrial packaging base revenues were flat for the second quarter due to slower machine sales in Asia, but increased 1.4% year-to-date. Other base business revenues, including the welding and finishing businesses, increased 13.4% for the quarter and 11.3% year-to-date led by strong welding equipment and consumable sales in Asia. The contribution from acquired revenues was primarily related to the acquisition of a materials and structural testing business and an aircraft ground power business.   Operating income increased in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2006 primarily as a result of the revenue increases described above and reduced operating costs. In addition, operating income was favorably impacted by lower restructuring expenses and income from acquisitions. Income was also positively affected by a nonrecurring first quarter 2005 charge of $8.7 million to resolve accounting issues at a European food equipment business. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation.   OPERATING REVENUES   The reconciliation of segment operating revenues to total operating revenues is as follows:   (In thousands)    AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS   The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. In the first quarter of each year, the Company performs an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives based on the fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset.   As of January 1, 2006, the Company had assigned its recorded goodwill and intangible assets to approximately 375 of its 700 reporting units. When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Fair values are determined by discounting estimated future cash flows at the Companys estimated cost of capital of 10%. Estimated future cash flows are based either on current operating cash flows or on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant operating unit. If the fair value of an operating unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value of the units goodwill and the carrying value of the goodwill.   Amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for the periods ended June 30, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:   (In thousands)            Three Months Ended June 30       Six Months Ended June 30                 2006       2005       2006       2005         Goodwill:                                                         Impairment       $          $          $   9,200       $   6,206         Intangible Assets:                                                         Amortization           24,664           15,213           48,452           29,948         Impairment                                 2,985           5,049         Total       $   24,664       $   15,213       $   60,637       $   41,203             In the first quarter of 2006, the Company performed its annual impairment testing of its goodwill and intangible assets, which resulted in impairment charges of $12.2 million. The first quarter 2006 goodwill impairment charges of $9.2 million were primarily related to a U.S. joist business, a U.S. heat transfer business, and an Asian construction business and resulted from lower estimated future cash flows than previously expected. Also in the first quarter of 2006, intangible asset impairments of $3.0 million were recorded to reduce to the estimated fair value the carrying value of trademarks, patents and customer-related intangible assets primarily related to a U.S. welding components business in the Specialty Systems  North America segment and a U.S. contamination control business in the Engineered Products  North America segment.   In the first quarter of 2005, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $6.2 million, which were primarily related to a Canadian stretch packaging equipment business and a U.S. welding components business, and which resulted from lower estimated future cash flows than previously expected. Also in the first quarter of 2005, intangible asset impairments of $5.0 million were recorded to reduce to estimated fair value the carrying value of trademarks, patents and customer-related intangible assets related to a U.S. business that manufactures clean room mats in the Engineered Products  North America segment.   INTEREST EXPENSE   Interest expense decreased to $37.9 million in the first six months of 2006 from $49.1 million in 2005 primarily due to a lower amount of commercial paper outstanding in the first six months of 2006 and higher interest expense in 2005 due to forward contract discount amortization.   INVESTMENT INCOME   Investment income increased to $36.6 million in the first six months of 2006 from $29.4 million in 2005. The increase was primarily due to higher gains on venture capital investments in 2006 than in 2005. These gains were partially offset by lower income from leverage leases in 2006 due to the normal scheduled decline in leverage lease income and lower income from property developments as fewer homes were sold in 2006 versus 2005.   Mortgage investment income for the first six months of 2006 was virtually flat compared to the same period in 2005. Mortgage investment income increased due to gains on the sales of properties in 2006 versus losses on the sales of properties and an impairment charge in 2005. However, this increase was mostly offset by lower equity income in 2006 as compared to 2005, as a result of the liquidation of the first mortgage investment in December 2005.   OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)   Other income (expense) was an expense of $0.7 million for the first six months of 2006 versus income of $10.1 million in 2005, primarily due to higher currency translation losses and losses on divestitures in 2006. This is partially offset by gains in 2006 on the sale of fixed assets versus losses in 2005.   INCOME TAXES   The effective tax rate for the first six months of 2006 was 30.5%, 1.5 percentage points lower than the effective rate for the first six months of 2005. The Companys decrease in effective income tax rate is a result of additional nontaxable foreign interest income and the favorable resolution of an IRS tax audit.   NET INCOME   Net income of $832.4 million ($1.46 per diluted share) in the first six months of 2006 was 21.3% higher than the 2005 net income of $686.1 million ($1.18 per diluted share).   FOREIGN CURRENCY   The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in 2006 decreased operating revenues for the first six months of 2006 by approximately $120.0 million and decreased earnings by approximately 2 cents per diluted share.     NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. This Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, and provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. This Interpretation will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2007, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of the Interpretation on its financial statements.   In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 13-2, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction. FSP FAS 13-2 addresses how a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction affects the accounting by a lessor for that lease. FSP FAS 13-2 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2007, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of FSP FAS 13-2 on its financial statements.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   Cash Flow   The Companys primary source of liquidity is free operating cash flow. Management continues to believe that such internally generated cash flow will be adequate to service existing debt and to continue to pay dividends that meet its dividend payout objective of 25-35% of the last two years average net income. In addition, free operating cash flow is expected to be adequate to finance internal growth and small-to-medium sized acquisitions.   The Company uses free operating cash flow to measure normal cash flow generated by its operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions and debt repayment. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.   Summarized cash flow information for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2006 and 2005 was as follows:   (In thousands)    The decrease in free operating cash flow in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2006 was primarily due to income tax prepayments in 2006 related to the treatment of the Companys leverage leases.   On August 4, 2006 the Companys Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program which provides for the buy back of up to 35 million shares over an unspecified period of time.     Return on Average Invested Capital   The Company uses return on average invested capital (ROIC) to measure the effectiveness of the operations use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2006 and 2005 was as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)    The 210 basis point increase in ROIC in the second quarter of 2006 was due primarily to a 20% increase in after-tax operating income, mainly as a result of increased operating income from base business and a decrease in the effective tax rate to 30.1% in the second quarter of 2006 from 31.6% in the second quarter of 2005.  The above positive impact was partially offset by an 8% increase in average invested capital primarily due to acquisitions.   The 220 basis point increase in ROIC for year-to-date 2006 was due primarily to a 20% increase in after-tax operating income, mainly as a result of increased operating income from base business and a decrease in the effective tax rate to 30.5% in the first half of 2006 from 32.0% in the first half of 2005.  The above positive impact was partially offset by a 7% increase in average invested capital primarily due to acquisitions.   Working Capital   Net working capital at June 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 is summarized as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)    Trade receivables and inventories increased due to increased sales, acquisitions and translation. Other current assets increased primarily due to a $145.0 million increase in income tax refunds receivable. This increase is related to the timing of income tax payments and a favorable conclusion of an IRS tax audit. Short-term debt decreased primarily as a result of excess cash used to pay off a portion of the debt. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased primarily due to acquisitions and foreign currency translation.     Debt   Total debt at June 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 was as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)    The Company had outstanding commercial paper of $20.0 million at June 30, 2006 and $94.5 million at December 31, 2005.   In June 2005, the Company entered into a $600,000,000 Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 16, 2006. This line of credit was replaced on June 16, 2006 by a $600,000,000 Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 15, 2007. No amounts were outstanding under this facility at June 30, 2006.   In June 2005, the Company entered into a $350,000,000 revolving credit facility (RCF) with a termination date of June 17, 2010. This RCF was replaced on June 16, 2006 by a $350,000,000 RCF with a termination date of June 16, 2011. No amounts were outstanding under this facility at June 30, 2006.   Stockholders Equity   The changes to stockholders equity during 2006 were as follows:   (In thousands)      Total stockholders equity, December 31, 2005       $   7,546,895         Net income           832,384         Cash dividends declared           (187,227   )     Shares issued for acquisitions           163,384         Stock option and restricted stock activity           93,337         Currency translation adjustments           145,144         Total stockholders equity, June 30, 2006       $   8,593,917             FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, statements regarding 2006 contributions to the Companys pension plans, the adequacy of internally generated funds, the meeting of dividend payout objectives, and the outcome of outstanding legal proceedings.

Item 4  Controls and Procedures   The Companys management, with the participation of the Companys Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Vice President & Controller, Financial Reporting, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a15(e)) as of June 30, 2006. Based on such evaluation, the Companys Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Vice President & Controller, Financial Reporting, have concluded that, as of June 30, 2006, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting the Companys management to all information required to be included in this Form 10-Q and other Exchange Act filings.   In connection with the evaluation by management, including the Companys Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Vice President & Controller, Financial Reporting, no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the quarter ended June 30, 2006 were identified that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Companys internal control over financial reporting.      Part II  Other Information   Item 1  Legal Proceedings   Wilsonart International, Inc. (Wilsonart), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in a consolidated class action lawsuit filed in 2000 in federal district court in White Plains, New York on behalf of direct purchasers of high-pressure laminate.  The complaint alleges that Wilsonart participated in a conspiracy with competitors to fix, raise, maintain or stabilize prices for high pressure laminate between 1994 and 2000 and seeks injunctive relief and treble damages.  In addition, indirect purchasers of high-pressure laminate filed similar purported class action cases under various state antitrust and consumer protection laws in 13 states and the District of Columbia, all of which cases have been stayed pending the outcome of the consolidated class action.  On May 24, 2006, after a two month trial, a federal jury unanimously rejected the plaintiffs claims and rendered a verdict in favor of Wilsonart in the consolidated class action lawsuit.  The stay of the 13 states and District of Columbia proceedings has been continued until October 2006.  The company intends to vigorously contest any appeal of the jury verdict in the federal consolidated class action lawsuit as well as any further state court proceedings.
