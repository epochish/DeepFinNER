ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. and SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)   (1)           FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   The unaudited financial statements included herein have been prepared by Illinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”). In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in the Company’s 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform with current year reporting.   Prior to 2011, the Company’s international operations outside of North America had a fiscal reporting period that began on December 1 and ended on November 30. Effective January 1, 2011, the Company eliminated the one month lag for the reporting of its international operations outside of North America. As a result, the Company is now reporting both North American and international results on a calendar year basis. The Company determined that the elimination of the one month reporting lag was preferable because the same period-end reporting date improves overall financial reporting as the impact of current events, economic conditions and global trends are consistently reflected in the financial statements of the North American and international business units.   The Company has applied this change in accounting principle retrospectively to all prior financial statement periods presented. The elimination of the one month reporting lag for international operations outside of North America resulted in a decrease to operating revenues from continuing operations of $30,572,000, to income from continuing operations of $7,506,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, and to net income of $9,336,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2010; an increase to operating revenues from continuing operations of $93,363,000, to income from continuing operations of $26,961,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, and to net income of $30,138,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2010; and an increase to income reinvested in the business of $8,722,000 as of December 31, 2010.   (2)           COMPREHENSIVE INCOME   The components of comprehensive income in the periods presented were:        (3)           DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS   In April 2011, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its finishing group of businesses to Graco Inc. in a $650,000,000 cash transaction. The sale is not expected to be completed prior to the fourth quarter of 2011, to accommodate regulatory reviews. The finishing businesses, which were included within the All Other segment, had revenues of approximately $305,000,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors approved plans to divest a consumer packaging business in the All Other segment and an electronics components business in the Power Systems & Electronics segment, which had combined 2010 revenues of approximately $100,000,000. The Company expects to dispose of both businesses within one year. These businesses are classified as held for sale as of June 30, 2011.   The held for sale finishing, consumer packaging, and electronics components businesses discussed above, along with a flooring business in the Decorative Surfaces segment that was exited in early 2011 and a security printing business in the All Other segment that was sold in the third quarter of 2010, are reported as discontinued operations in the statement of income. All related prior period income statement information has been restated to conform to the current year reporting of these businesses.                      Results of the discontinued operations for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2011 and 2010 were as follows:        As of June 30, 2011, the assets and liabilities of the held for sale finishing, consumer packaging, and electronics components businesses discussed above were included in assets and liabilities held for sale in the statement of financial position, as follows:       (In thousands)         June 30, 2011       Trade receivables      $   87,350       Inventories         57,035       Net plant and equipment         49,130       Goodwill and intangible assets         215,320       Other         14,939         Total assets held for sale      $   423,774                       Accounts payable      $   23,509       Accrued expenses         50,848       Other         27,818         Total liabilities held for sale      $   102,175         (4)           INCOME TAXES   The Company has been litigating its dispute with the Australian Tax Office over the tax treatment of an intercompany financing transaction between the U.S. and Australia. The case was heard before the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria, in September 2010. The proceedings resulted from the Company’s appeal of a decision by the Australian Tax Commissioner to disallow income tax deductions for the income tax years 2002 through 2005 and the assessment of withholding taxes for income tax year 2003. The Company also contested the Commissioner’s similar determination for income tax years 2006 and 2007; however, the parties agreed to follow the Court’s decision made on the earlier years. On February 4, 2011, the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria, decided in the Company’s favor with respect to a significant portion of the income tax deductions. The Court issued the final orders on February 18, 2011. Based on this decision, the Company decreased its unrecognized tax benefits related to this matter by approximately $197,000,000 and recorded a favorable discrete non-cash tax benefit to reduce tax expense by $165,927,000 in the first half of 2011. The Australian Tax Office has appealed the timing of certain of the deductions, the outcome of which is not expected to be material.   During the first quarter of 2011, the Company resolved an issue with the Internal Revenue Service in the United States related to a deduction for foreign exchange losses on an intercompany loan that resulted in a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $179,000,000.   In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act were signed into law. As a result, future tax deductions for retiree prescription drug coverage will be reduced by the amount of subsidies received starting in 2013. In the first quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a discrete tax charge of $21,881,000 for the impact of the health care reform legislation.   The components of the effective tax rate for the six month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 were as follows:            June 30, 2011       June 30, 2010      Estimated annual effective tax rate      29.0  %     30.6  %   Discrete tax adjustments      (12.7  )     2.0     Effective tax rate      16.3  %     32.6  %                         The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions and a number of these audits are currently ongoing.

The results of operations for the Construction Products segment for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2011 and 2010 were as follows:        In the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2011, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:           Three Months Ended June 30       Six Months Ended June 30           % Increase (Decrease)       % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)       % Increase (Decrease)       % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)           Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins       Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins      Base business:                                        Revenue change/Operating leverage      (2.2  )%     (6.7  )%     (0.7  )%     2.6  %     10.0  %     0.9  %   Changes in variable margins & overhead costs      —       (12.4  )     (1.8  )     —       (23.2  )     (2.7  )   Total      (2.2  )     (19.1  )     (2.5  )     2.6       (13.2  )     (1.8  )                                                       Acquisitions      3.5       0.8       (0.3  )     5.3       0.7       (0.5  )   Restructuring costs      —       2.1       0.3       —       11.2       1.3     Translation      10.4       11.5       0.4       7.6       11.3       0.5     Other      —       —       —       —       —       —     Total      11.7  %     (4.7  )%     (2.1  )%     15.5  %     10.0  %     (0.5  )%     Operating Revenues  Revenues increased 11.7% and 15.5% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2011, respectively, versus 2010 primarily due to the favorable effect of currency translation and revenues from acquisitions. Acquisition revenue was primarily due to the acquisition of a European retail distribution business in the second quarter of 2010 and a Canadian fastener business in the second quarter of 2011. Base business revenues declined 2.2% in the second quarter of 2011 while increasing 2.6% in the year-to-date period. International base revenues increased 2.1% and 5.2% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily driven by a 6.1% and 11.3% increase in European base revenues in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, versus 2010. While European base revenues grew year-over-year as a result of commercial construction end market demand, growth moderated in the second quarter 2011 from earlier in the year. Base revenues for the Asia Pacific region decreased 2.8% and 1.6% for the same periods primarily due to pricing pressure in the Australian/New Zealand market. North American base revenues decreased 10.7% and 3.0% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to continued weakness in North American construction end market activity and a one-time licensing agreement settlement that positively impacted revenues in the second quarter of 2010.    Operating Income Operating income decreased 4.7% in the second quarter versus 2010 primarily due to negative leverage from the decrease in base revenues described above and increased operating expenses, partially offset by the favorable effect of currency translation. Operating income increased 10.0% for the year-to-date period versus 2010 primarily due to the favorable effect of currency translation and lower restructuring expenses, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Base margins decreased 250 and 180 basis points in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to the one-time licensing agreement settlement in 2010 and the negative impact of selling price versus material cost comparisons in 2011.                          POLYMERS & FLUIDS   Businesses in this segment produce adhesives, sealants, lubrication and cutting fluids, and hygiene products.

This segment primarily serves the general industrial, construction, maintenance, repair and operations, and automotive aftermarket markets.   The results of operations for the Polymers & Fluids segment for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2011 and 2010 were as follows:        In the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2011, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:           Three Months Ended June 30       Six Months Ended June 30           % Increase (Decrease)       % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)       % Increase (Decrease)       % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)           Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins       Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins      Base business:                                        Revenue change/Operating leverage      1.5  %     3.4  %     0.4  %     3.2  %     7.9  %     0.8  %   Changes in variable margins & overhead costs      —       (9.6  )     (1.9  )     —       (12.8  )     (2.3  )   Total      1.5       (6.2  )     (1.5  )     3.2       (4.9  )     (1.5  )                                                       Acquisitions      18.5       8.4       (1.4  )     17.1       9.4       (0.9  )   Restructuring costs      —       (1.7  )     (0.3  )     —       (1.7  )     (0.3  )   Translation      8.1       6.5       —       5.4       4.9       —     Other      —       0.1       (0.1  )     0.1       0.1       0.1     Total      28.1  %     7.1  %     (3.3  )%     25.8  %     7.8  %     (2.6  )%     Operating Revenues  Revenues increased 28.1% and 25.8% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2011, respectively, versus 2010 primarily due to revenues from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation. Acquisition revenue was primarily the result of the purchase of an international polymers business and a Latin American fluids business in the fourth quarter of 2010, as well as a Latin American solvent business in the second quarter of 2011. Worldwide base revenues for the fluids businesses increased 5.6% and 4.9% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively. Worldwide base revenues for the polymers businesses were flat in the second quarter and increased 2.5% for the year-to-date period as industrial demand for polymer products in North American and international end markets moderated in the second quarter of 2011.                           Operating Income Operating income increased 7.1% and 7.8% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2011, respectively, versus 2010 primarily due to income from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by higher operating expenses and higher restructuring expenses. Base margins decreased 150 basis points in both periods due to the negative impact of selling price versus material cost comparisons and increased overhead costs resulting from higher investment in new product development and other growth initiatives, partially offset by the positive leverage effect of the increase in base revenues.    DECORATIVE SURFACES   Businesses in this segment produce decorative surfacing materials for furniture, office and retail space, countertops, and other applications.       In the Decorative Surfaces segment, products include:    •   decorative high-pressure laminate for furniture, office and retail space and countertops; and    •   high-pressure laminate worktops.      This segment serves the commercial construction, renovation construction and residential construction markets.

Base revenues increased 4.9% and 6.6% for the North American laminate businesses in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to new product introductions and modest improvement in commercial construction activity. International base revenues increased 8.3% and 10.0% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to increased commercial construction activity in Europe and Asia Pacific.   Operating Income Operating income decreased 1.6% in the second quarter of 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to higher operating costs partially offset by the increase in base revenues and the favorable effect of currency translation. Operating income increased 8.4% in year-to-date period of 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to the increase in base revenues, lower restructuring costs and the favorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by higher operating costs. Base margins declined 150 and 130 basis points in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, as the positive leverage effect of the increase in base revenues was offset by the negative impact of selling price versus material cost comparisons and increased operating costs.    ALL OTHER   This segment contains all other operating segments.       In the All Other segment, products include:    •   equipment and related software for testing and measuring of materials and structures;    •   plastic reclosable packaging for consumer food storage;    •   plastic consumables that multi-pack cans and bottles and related equipment;    •   plastic fasteners and components for appliances, furniture and industrial uses;    •   metal fasteners and components for appliances and industrial applications;    •   foil, film and related equipment used to decorate consumer products;    •   product coding and marking equipment and related consumables; and    •   line integration, conveyor systems and line automation for the food and beverage industries.

The acquisition revenue is primarily due to the purchase of a test and measurement business and a plastics and security business in 2010. Base revenues increased 17.0% and 18.1% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, for the worldwide test and measurement businesses due to increased equipment orders in Asia and Europe. Base business revenues increased 5.7% and 6.2% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, for the consumer packaging businesses due to strength in the worldwide decorating and consumer packaging businesses. Base revenues in the worldwide industrial fasteners and appliance businesses decreased 0.5% in the second quarter of 2011 primarily due to weakness in the appliance end market. Base revenues increased 2.2% year-to-date for the worldwide industrial fasteners and appliance businesses.   Operating Income Operating income increased 20.1% and 23.7% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2011, respectively, versus 2010 primarily due to growth in base revenues, favorable currency translation and lower restructuring expenses. Base margins increased 130 and 180 basis points in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to the positive leverage effect of the increase in base revenues, partially offset by higher operating costs. Acquisitions and divestitures diluted total operating margins by 50 basis points in both periods of 2011 versus 2010.    AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS   Amortization expense increased to $117.9 million in the first six months of 2011 versus $103.5 million in the first six months of 2010, due to intangible amortization related to newly acquired businesses.   INTEREST EXPENSE   Interest expense increased slightly to $89.4 million in the first six months of 2011 versus $87.6 million in the first six months of 2010.   OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)   Other income (expense) was income of $21.3 million for the first six months of 2011 versus income of $6.1 million in 2010 primarily due to higher interest income and higher investment income in 2011, partially offset by higher currency translation losses in 2011 versus 2010.                         INCOME TAXES   The effective tax rate for the first six months of 2011 was 16.3% which included the favorable discrete non-cash tax benefit of $165.9 million in the first quarter of 2011 related to the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria decision in the Company’s favor with respect to a significant portion of the income tax deductions. The effective tax rate for the first six months of 2010 was 32.6% which included the discrete tax charge of $21.9 million related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. See the Income Taxes Note in Item 1 – Financial Statements for further details on these discrete tax adjustments.   INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS   Income from continuing operations of $1.1 billion ($2.17 per diluted share) in the first six months of 2011 was 51.1% higher than the 2010 income from continuing operations of $721.1 million ($1.43 per diluted share).   FOREIGN CURRENCY   The strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar increased operating revenues for the first six months of 2011 by approximately $299 million and income from continuing operations by approximately 7 cents per diluted share versus 2010.   INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS   Income from discontinued operations increased to $31.8 million ($0.06 per diluted share) in the first six months of 2011 versus $24.2 million ($0.05 per diluted share) in 2010 primarily as a result of improved operating results in the held for sale finishing businesses. See the Discontinued Operations Note in Item 1 – Financial Statements for further details regarding the Company’s discontinued operations.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and short-term credit facilities. Management continues to believe that internally generated cash flows will be adequate to service debt, to continue to pay dividends, to finance internal growth and to fund small to medium-sized acquisitions.   The primary uses of liquidity are:     ·     dividend payments – the Company’s dividend payout guidelines are 30% to 45% of the average of the last two years of free operating cash flow;        ·     acquisitions; and        ·     any excess liquidity may be used for share repurchases.      Cash Flow   The Company uses free operating cash flow to measure normal cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.                       Summarized cash flow information for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2011 and 2010 was as follows:        On August 20, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to $3.0 billion of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2007 Program”). In the first six months of 2011, the Company repurchased approximately 9.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $57.01 per share under this program. As of June 30, 2011, there was approximately $321 million of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2007 Program.   On May 6, 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to an additional $4.0 billion of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2011 Program”). As of June 30, 2011, no shares have been repurchased under the 2011 Program.                         Return on Average Invested Capital   The Company uses return on average invested capital (“ROIC”) to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. The Company believes that ROIC is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company’s operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the year and at the end of each quarter. For the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2011 and 2010, ROIC was as follows:        The ROIC decrease of 70 basis points in the second quarter of 2011 was the result of average invested capital increasing 23.4%, while operating income after taxes increased 18.1%.   The ROIC increase of 40 basis points for the year-to-date period of 2011 was the result of operating income after taxes increasing 21.7%, while average invested capital increased 18.2%.                      In the first quarter of 2011, the Company recorded a favorable discrete non-cash tax benefit of $165.9 million related to the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria decision in the Company’s favor with respect to a significant portion of the income tax deductions. See the Income Taxes Note in Item 1 – Financial Statements for further details on this discrete tax adjustment. Since the benefit was unusual, the ROIC calculation has been adjusted to exclude this item to improve comparability and better reflect the return on average invested capital for the periods presented. A reconciliation of the 2011 year-to-date tax rate as reported to the tax rate used above is as follows:            Six Months Ended June 30, 2011      (Dollars in thousands)     Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes       Income Taxes       Tax Rate      As reported    $ 1,301,516     $ 211,750       16.3  %   Discrete tax adjustment      —       165,927       12.7  %   As adjusted    $ 1,301,516     $ 377,677       29.0  %     In the first quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a discrete tax charge of $21.9 million related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. See the Income Taxes Note in Item 1 – Financial Statements for further details on this discrete tax adjustment. Since this charge was unusual, the ROIC calculation has been adjusted to exclude this item to improve comparability and better reflect the return on average invested capital for the periods presented. A reconciliation of the 2010 year-to-date tax rate as reported to the tax rate used above is as follows:            Six Months Ended June 30, 2010      (Dollars in thousands)     Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes       Income Taxes       Tax Rate      As reported    $ 1,070,231     $ 349,143       32.6  %   Discrete tax adjustment      —       (21,881  )     (2.0  )%   As adjusted    $ 1,070,231     $ 327,262       30.6  %     Working Capital   Management uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the Company. Net working capital at June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010 is summarized as follows:                               Trade receivables and inventories increased primarily due to the increase in base revenues and acquisitions. Other current assets increased primarily due to higher tax receivables. Short-term debt increased primarily due to issuances of commercial paper to fund acquisitions, share repurchases and dividend payments. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased due to higher purchase activity, and other current liabilities decreased primarily due to the decrease in income taxes payable.   Debt   The Company’s targeted debt-to-capital ratio is 20% to 30%, excluding the impact of any larger acquisitions. Total debt at June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010 was as follows:        The Company had outstanding commercial paper of approximately $1.1 billion at June 30, 2011, which is included in short-term debt, and no outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2010.   In June 2010, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 10, 2011.
