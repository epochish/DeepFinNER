FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   The unaudited financial statements included herein have been prepared by Illinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”). In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in the Company’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform with current year reporting.   (2)           COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)   The components of comprehensive income (loss) in the periods presented were:       (In thousands)     Three Months Ended March 31           2010       2009      Net Income (Loss)    $ 294,331     $ (39,374 )   Other Comprehensive Income (Loss):                       Foreign currency translation adjustments      (237,270  )     (122,988  )      Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments, net of tax      6,037       (20  )   Comprehensive Income (Loss)    $ 63,098     $ (162,382 )     (3)           DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS   The Company periodically reviews its approximately 800 operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with its long-term objectives. In August 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the divestiture of the Click Commerce industrial software business which was previously reported in the All Other segment. In the second quarter of 2009, the Company completed the sale of the Click Commerce business.   In 2007, the Company classified an automotive components business as held for sale which was sold in the third quarter of 2009.   Results of the discontinued operations for the first quarter of 2009 were as follows:       (In thousands)      Three Months Ended             March 31, 2009       Operating revenues      $   13,627                       Loss before taxes      $   (33,812   )    Income tax benefit         2,454       Loss from discontinued operations      $   (31,358   )      In the first quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a loss on the anticipated sale of the Click Commerce business of $30,000,000 to reflect the estimated selling price.         5            (4)           INCOME TAXES   In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act were signed into law. As a result, future tax deductions for retiree prescription drug coverage will be reduced by the amount of subsidies received starting in 2013. In the first quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a discrete charge of $21,881,000 for the impact of the health care reform legislation.   In March of 2009, the Company incurred significant charges related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $89,997,000 that were mostly non-deductible and discrete tax items of $27,800,000 to record reserves on net operating loss carryforwards no longer expected to be utilized and other tax adjustments.   The components of the effective tax rate for the period ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:            March 31, 2010       March 31, 2009      Estimated annual effective tax rate      29.0  %     28.0  %   Discrete tax adjustments      4.9       50.1     Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges      —       36.3     Effective tax rate      33.9  %     114.4  %     The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions and a number of these audits are currently ongoing.   The Company is litigating its dispute with the Australian Tax Office over the treatment of an intercompany financing transaction between the U.S. and Australia. The Company has recorded its best estimate of the exposure for this audit; however, it is reasonably possible that the Company will resolve the Australian financing issue within the next 12 months and that the amount of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately $159,000,000.   (5)           INVENTORIES   Inventories at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 were as follows:   (In thousands)      (6)           GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS   Goodwill represents the excess cost over fair value of the net assets of purchased businesses. The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. The Company performs an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives based on the estimated fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset.   When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company compares the estimated fair value of each of its 60 reporting units to its carrying value. Fair values are determined primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows based either on current operating cash flows or on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant reporting unit. The Company also considers additional valuation techniques, such as market multiples from similar transactions and quoted market prices of relevant public companies. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. During 2009, the Company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment assessment from the first quarter to the third quarter.   The Company’s indefinite-lived intangibles consist of trademarks and brands. The estimated fair values of these intangibles are determined based on a relief-of-royalty income approach derived from internally forecasted revenues of the related products.  If the fair value of the trademark or brand is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the intangible asset.   In the first quarter of 2009, the Company performed a goodwill impairment assessment which resulted in impairment charges of $60,000,000 related to the pressure sensitive adhesives reporting unit in the Polymers & Fluids segment and $18,000,000 related to the PC board fabrication reporting unit in the Power Systems & Electronics segment.         6              Also in the first quarter of 2009, intangible asset impairments of $11,997,000 were recorded to reduce to the estimated fair value the carrying value of certain trademarks and brands. Approximately $5,800,000 of this total charge related to the PC board fabrication reporting unit and the remainder to various trademarks and brands of other reporting units.   The impairments during 2009 were primarily related to new reporting units which had been acquired before the recent economic downturn. These charges were driven primarily by lower current forecasts compared to the expected forecasts at the time the reporting units were acquired.   A summary of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that were adjusted to fair value and the related impairment charges included in earnings for the first quarter of 2009 were as follows:       (In Thousands)     Book Value       Fair Value       Total Impairment Charges      Goodwill    $ 353,000     $ 275,000     $ 78,000     Indefinite-lived intangible assets      94,973       82,976       11,997                                   (7)RETIREMENT PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS   Pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the periods ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:        The Company expects to contribute $52,700,000 to its pension plans and $37,900,000 to its other postretirement plans in 2010. As of March 31, 2010, contributions of $7,000,000 to pension plans and $9,400,000 to other postretirement plans have been made.   (8)           SHORT-TERM DEBT   The Company had outstanding commercial paper of $250,493,000 at March 31, 2010 and $135,498,000 at December 31, 2009.   (9)           LONG-TERM DEBT   Based on rates for comparable instruments, the approximate fair value and related carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt, including current maturities, were as follows:   (In thousands)      (10)           SEGMENT INFORMATION   See Management’s Discussion and Analysis for information regarding operating revenues and operating income for the Company’s segments.         7              Item 2 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis   CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   The Company’s consolidated results of operations for the first quarter of 2010 and 2009 were as follows:        In the first quarter of 2010, the changes in revenues and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:         Three Months Ended March 31           % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)           Operating Revenues       Operating Margins      Base business:                Revenue change/Operating leverage      7.5  %     2.6  %   Changes in variable margins and overhead costs      —       5.5     Total      7.5       8.1                         Acquisitions and divestitures      2.0       (0.2  )   Restructuring costs      —       0.2     Impairment of goodwill and intangibles      —       2.7     Translation      5.4       (0.3  )   Other      (0.3  )     —     Total      14.6  %     10.5  %     Operating Revenues Revenues increased 14.6% in the first quarter of 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to higher base revenues, the favorable effect of currency translation and revenues from acquisitions. Base revenues increased 7.5% in the first quarter of 2010 versus 2009 as the Company saw improvement in macroeconomic data across many worldwide end markets. North American and international businesses increased 7.1% and 8.0%, respectively, as end markets including transportation, polymers and fluids, industrial packaging and PC board/electronics showed strength in the quarter.   Operating Income Operating income increased $392.6 million in the first quarter of 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to the increase in base revenues, lower operating expenses and lower goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. In the prior year first quarter, the Company recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $90.0 million. Improvements in base variable margins and lower overhead costs increased base variable margins 5.5% in the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to the cumulative benefits of restructuring projects, favorable inventory obsolescence reserve comparisons and favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons.         8              The reconciliation of segment operating revenues to total operating revenues is as follows:        TRANSPORTATION   Businesses in this segment produce components, fasteners, fluids and polymers, as well as truck remanufacturing and related parts and service.       In the Transportation segment, products and services include:    •   metal and plastic components, fasteners and assemblies for automobiles and light trucks;    •   fluids and polymers for auto aftermarket maintenance and appearance;    •   fillers and putties for auto body repair;     •   polyester coatings and patch and repair products for the marine industry; and    •   truck remanufacturing and related parts and service.      This segment primarily serves the automotive original equipment manufacturers and tiers and automotive aftermarket markets.   The results of operations for the Transportation segment for the first quarter of 2010 and 2009 were as follows:                9              In the first quarter of 2010, the changes in revenues and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:         Three Months Ended March 31           % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)           Operating Revenues       Operating Margins      Base business:                Revenue change/Operating leverage      32.0  %     8.8  %   Changes in variable margins and overhead costs      —       7.2     Total      32.0       16.0                         Acquisitions and divestitures      (0.3  )     0.3     Restructuring costs      —       1.9     Impairment of goodwill and intangibles      —       0.4     Translation      4.0       (0.5  )   Other      (0.1  )     —     Total      35.6  %     18.1  %     Operating Revenues Revenues increased 35.6% in the first quarter of 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to the increase in base revenues and the favorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by a decline in revenue for the truck remanufacturing business. North American automotive base revenues increased 22.8% in the first quarter of 2010 due to an increase in car builds of 70%. International automotive base revenues increased 65.8% due to a 38% increase in European car builds.  The automotive aftermarket businesses, which were less impacted in 2009 by the economic downturn, increased 0.6%.   Operating Income Operating income increased $99.7 million primarily due to the significant increase in base revenues and lower operating costs. Total base margins increased 16.0% as a result of leverage from the increase in base revenues, an improved cost structure due to restructurings and business unit consolidation, and favorable inventory obsolescence reserve comparisons.   INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING   Businesses in this segment produce steel, plastic and paper products used for bundling, shipping and protecting goods in transit.

Worldwide base revenues for the fluids businesses increased 13.9% while base revenues for the polymers businesses increased 4.7%.   Operating Income Operating income increased $86.2 million in the first quarter of 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to favorable goodwill and intangible asset impairment comparisons, the increase in base revenues described above and lower operating expenses. During the first quarter of 2009, a $60.0 million goodwill impairment charge was taken against the goodwill of the pressure sensitive adhesive reporting unit. Base margins increased 8.6% due to the positive leverage effect of the increase in base revenues, benefits of restructuring projects and favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons.   DECORATIVE SURFACES   Businesses in this segment produce decorative surfacing materials for furniture, office and retail space, countertops, flooring and other applications.       In the Decorative Surfaces segment, products include:    •   decorative high-pressure laminate for furniture, office and retail space and countertops;    •   high-pressure laminate flooring; and    •   high-pressure laminate worktops.

The acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a consumer packaging business in the fourth quarter of 2009. Base revenues increased 4.2% for the consumer packaging business. The industrial plastics and metals businesses improved 12.9% due to increased demand for domestic appliances. Base business revenues declined 7.5% and 5.8% for the test and measurement and finishing businesses, respectively, due to weak capital goods spending in North America, Europe and Asia.   Operating Income Operating income increased $49.1 million in the first quarter of 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to cost reduction initiatives, benefits of restructuring projects and the growth in base revenues. Base margins increased 5.6% as cost reductions more than offset slightly unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons. Acquisitions diluted total operating margins by 0.9%.   AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS   Amortization expense increased to $53.1 million in the first three months of 2010 versus $50.6 million in the first three months of 2009 due to intangible amortization related to newly acquired businesses.         17              IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS   During 2009, the Company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment assessment from the first quarter to the third quarter.   Total goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges by segment for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 were as follows:       (In thousands)      Three Months Ended             March 31, 2009       Transportation      $   2,414       Industrial Packaging         386       Food Equipment         46       Power Systems & Electronics         24,766       Polymers & Fluids         60,416       All Other         1,969             $    89,997          Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets was $90.0 million in the first three months of 2009, primarily due to goodwill impairment charges related to the pressure sensitive adhesives reporting unit of $60.0 million and the PC board fabrication reporting unit of $18.0 million.   See the Goodwill and Intangible Assets note for further details of the impairment charges.   INTEREST EXPENSE   Interest expense increased to $44.6 million in the first three months of 2010 from $31.4 million in the first three months of 2009 primarily due to interest on the 6.25% and 5.15% notes which were issued in March 2009, partially offset by lower interest related to the 5.75% notes repaid at maturity in March 2009 and lower commercial paper borrowings and rates.   OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)   Other income (expense) was income of $6.0 million for the first three months of 2010 versus expense of $4.3 million in 2009, primarily due to investment income in 2010 versus investment losses in 2009.   INCOME TAXES   The effective tax rate for the first three months of 2010 was 33.9% which included the discrete tax charge of $21.9 million related to the recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. The effective tax rate for the first three months of 2010 decreased compared to 114.4% for the first three months of 2009. The decrease in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from the impairment of non-deductible goodwill and discrete tax adjustments recorded in the first three months of 2009.   INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS   Income from continuing operations was $294.3 million ($0.58 per diluted share) in the first three months of 2010 compared to the 2009 loss from continuing operations of $8.0 million ($0.02 per diluted share).   FOREIGN CURRENCY   The weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in 2010 increased operating revenues for the first three months of 2010 by approximately $179 million and increased net income by approximately 3 cents per diluted share.   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS   Loss from discontinued operations was $31.4 million in the first three months of 2009 primarily due to the loss on the anticipated sale of the Click Commerce business of $30.0 million.         18              LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and short-term credit facilities. Management continues to believe that internally generated cash flows will be adequate to service debt, continue to pay dividends, to finance internal growth and to fund small to medium-sized acquisitions.   The primary uses of liquidity are:     ·     dividend payments – the Company’s dividend payout guidelines are 25% to 35% of the last two years’ average income from continuing operations;        ·     acquisitions; and        ·     any excess liquidity may be used for share repurchases. The Company’s open-ended share repurchase program allows it flexibility in achieving the targeted debt-to-capital ratio.      Cash Flow   The Company uses free operating cash flow to measure normal cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.   Summarized cash flow information for the first quarter of 2010 and 2009 was as follows:        On August 20, 2007, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, which provides for the buyback of up to $3.0 billion of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time.  There are approximately $1.2 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under this program.           19              Return on Average Invested Capital   The Company uses return on average invested capital (“ROIC”) to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. The Company believes that ROIC is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company’s operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the year and at the end of each quarter. For the first quarter of 2010 and 2009, ROIC was as follows:        The ROIC increase of 8.0% in the first quarter of 2010 was the result of operating income after taxes increasing 163.2%, primarily due to an increase in base business, while average invested capital increased slightly.   In the first quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a discrete tax adjustment of $21.9 million. Since this charge was unusual, the ROIC calculation has been adjusted to exclude this item to improve comparability and better reflect the return on average invested capital for the periods presented. A reconciliation of the tax rate as reported to the tax rate used above is as follows:       (Dollars in thousands)     Operating Income       Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes       Income Taxes       Tax Rate      As reported    $ 483,930     $ 445,331     $ 151,000       33.9  %   Discrete tax adjustment      —       —       (21,881  )     (4.9  )%   As adjusted    $ 483,930     $ 445,331     $ 129,119       29.0  %             20              In the first quarter of 2009, the Company incurred significant charges for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $90.0 million that was mostly non-deductible and discrete tax adjustments of $28.0 million. Since these charges were unusual the ROIC calculation has been adjusted to exclude these items to improve comparability and better reflect the return on average invested capital for the periods presented. A reconciliation of operating income and the tax rate as reported to operating income and tax rate used above is as follows:       (Dollars in thousands)     Operating Income       Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes       Income Taxes       Tax Rate      As reported    $ 91,294     $ 55,517     $ 63,533       114.4  %   Goodwill and intangible asset impairments      89,997       89,997       5,058       (36.3  )%   Discrete tax adjustments      —       —       (27,800  )     (50.1  )%   As adjusted    $ 181,291     $ 145,514     $ 40,791       28.0  %     Working Capital   Management uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the Company. Net working capital at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 is summarized as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)      Short-term debt increased primarily to fund dividend and tax payments and acquisitions.
