GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS      Goodwill represents the excess cost over fair value of the net assets of purchased businesses. The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. In the first quarter of each year, the Company performs an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives based on the fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset.   As of January 1, 2007, the Company had assigned its recorded goodwill and intangible assets to approximately 440 of its 750 reporting units. When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Fair values are determined by discounting estimated future cash flows at the Companys estimated cost of capital of 10%. Estimated future cash flows are based either on current operating cash flows or on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant operating unit. If the fair value of an operating unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value of the units goodwill and the carrying value of the goodwill.   Amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for the periods ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows:   (In thousands)             Three Months Ended March 31                 2007       2006         Goodwill:                                 Impairment       $   988       $   9,200         Intangible Assets:                                 Amortization           38,025           23,788         Impairment           1,166           2,985         Total       $   40,179       $   35,973          In the first quarter of 2007, the Company performed its annual impairment testing of its goodwill and intangible assets, which resulted in total impairment charges of $2,154,000. The first quarter 2007 goodwill impairment charges of $988,000 were primarily related to a      French fluid and polymer business and an Asian construction business in the Engineered Products  International segment and resulted from lower estimated future cash flows than previously expected. Also in the first quarter of 2007, intangible asset impairments of $1,166,000 were recorded to reduce to the estimated fair value the carrying value of trademarks and customer-related intangible assets primarily related to a French fluid and polymer business in the Engineered Products  International segment and a U.S. contamination control business in the Engineered Products  North America segment.   In the first quarter of 2006, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $9,200,000 which were primarily related to a U.S. construction joist business in the Engineered Products  North America segment, a U.S. thermal transfer ribbon business in the Specialty Systems  North America segment, and an Asian construction business in the Engineered Products  International segment and resulted from lower estimated future cash flows than previously expected. Also in the first quarter of 2006, intangible asset impairments of $2,985,000 were recorded to reduce to the estimated fair value the carrying value of trademarks, patents and customer-related intangible assets primarily related to a U.S. welding components business in the Specialty Systems  North America segment and a U.S. contamination control business in the Engineered Products  North America segment.

As of March 31, 2007, contributions of $54,989,000 have been made.       (5)   SHORT-TERM DEBT      The Company had outstanding commercial paper of $298,911,000 at March 31, 2007 and $200,340,000 at December 31, 2006.       (6)   INCOME TAXES      On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48).  FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, and provides guidance on derecognition, classification, and interest and penalties, related to uncertain tax positions. As a result of implementation of FIN 48, the Company did not recognize any change in its liability for unrecognized tax benefits.   As of the adoption date, the Company had $688,000,000 of unrecognized tax benefits. If these unrecognized tax benefits were recognized, approximately $593,000,000 would impact the Company's effective tax rate. There has been no significant change to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits during the quarter ended March 31, 2007. The Company does not expect any significant changes to the estimated amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.       The Company files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the United States Federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. The following table summarizes the open tax years for the Companys major jurisdictions:        The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. There were no significant accruals for interest and penalties recorded as of January 1, 2007.       (7)   LEVERAGED LEASES      On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Staff Position No. FAS 13-2, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction (FSP 13-2). FSP 13-2 addresses how a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction affects the accounting by a lessor for that lease. Upon adoption of FSP 13-2, the Company recorded an after-tax charge to retained earnings of $22,600,000, resulting from a change in the timing of expected cash flows related to income tax benefits of the Company's leveraged lease transactions.       (8)   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY      On August 4, 2006 the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, which provided for the buyback of up to 35,000,000 shares. In the first quarter of 2007, the Company repurchased 3,677,141 shares of its common stock at an average price of $48.92 per share.

Item 2 - Managements Discussion and Analysis   CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   The Companys consolidated results of operations for the first quarter of 2007 and 2006 were as follows:        In the first quarter of 2007, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:               Three Months Ended March 31             % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)                 Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins         Base manufacturing business:                                 Revenue change/Operating leverage       1.0   %   2.5   %   0.3   %     Changes in variable margins and overhead costs              (0.2   )            Total       1.0       2.3       0.3                                           Acquisitions       10.7              (1.6   )     Divestitures       (0.5   )   (0.2   )            Restructuring costs              (1.1   )   (0.2   )     Impairment of goodwill and intangibles              1.9       0.3         Translation       3.0       2.4       (0.1   )     Intercompany/Other       (0.2   )                   Total       14.0   %   5.3   %   (1.3   )%      In the first quarter of 2007 revenues increased 14.0% over the first quarter of 2006 primarily due to revenues from acquisitions and favorable currency translation. Base business revenues increased 1% for the quarter versus first quarter 2006 primarily related to an 8.9% increase in international base business revenues offset by a 3.5% decline in North American base revenues. European economic growth and market demand continued the growth seen in the last half of 2006. North American base revenues declined due to weak industrial production and slow demand throughout the North American end markets.   Operating income in the first quarter of 2007 improved over the first quarter of 2006 primarily due to leverage from the growth in base business revenues, favorable currency translation, and lower goodwill and intangibles impairment charges. Operating margins were negatively affected by lower margins of acquired businesses, including amortization expense. Goodwill and intangible impairment charges were $10.0 million lower in the first quarter of 2007 versus the first quarter of 2006.

Acquisition revenue was primarily related to the acquisition of an electronic switches business and a truss business. In the fourth quarter of 2006, a roofing components business was divested. Construction base revenues declined 10.5% mainly due to declines in the residential construction market. Automotive base revenues decreased 7.1% due to a 12% decline in automotive production at the Detroit 3 automotive manufacturers. Base revenues from the other industrial-based businesses in this segment declined 1.4% primarily due to declines in the strength films business and industrial plastics and metals.   Operating income decreased in the first quarter of 2007 versus the first quarter of 2006 primarily due to the decline in base business revenues and increased restructuring expenses offset by lower goodwill and intangible impairment charges. Variable margins increased 30 basis points mainly due to aggressive expense management in the automotive and construction businesses, a favorable sales mix and the benefits of 2006 restructuring projects. Goodwill and intangible impairment charges were $5.3 million lower in the first quarter of 2007 versus the first quarter of 2006. Overhead expense was favorably impacted in the first quarter of 2007 due to a first quarter 2006 charge of $9.8 million related to retiree healthcare and life insurance liabilities.

The results of operations for the Engineered Products  International segment for the first quarter of 2007 and 2006 were as follows:       (Dollars in thousands)       Three Months Ended March 31                 2007       2006         Operating revenues           $833,085           $624,321         Operating income       97,540           75,830         Margin %       11.7   %       12.1   %                       In the first quarter of 2007, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:               Three Months Ended March 31             % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)                 Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins         Base manufacturing business:                                 Revenue change/Operating leverage       8.2   %   27.1   %   2.1   %     Changes in variable margins and overhead costs              (13.2   )   (1.5   )     Total       8.2       13.9       0.6                                           Acquisitions       17.2       4.9       (1.2   )     Divestitures       (0.6   )   0.6       0.1         Restructuring costs              (0.8   )   (0.1   )     Impairment of goodwill and intangibles              0.2                Translation       8.5       9.9       0.2         Other       0.1       (0.1   )            Total       33.4   %   28.6   %   (0.4   )%      Revenues increased in the first quarter of 2007 due to revenues from acquisitions, the favorable effect of currency translation and growth in base business revenues. Base business construction revenues increased 12.5% due to strong demand across the European and Asia Pacific markets. Automotive base business revenues were relatively flat despite a 5.0% increase in automotive production due to customer mix and the abandonment of some lower margin business. Base revenues from the other businesses in this segment increased 7.1% as they benefited from strong demand in the broad array of industrial and commercial end markets that they serve. Acquisition revenue was primarily related to the acquisition of two European laminate manufacturers, one Korean and one European automotive business, and a European construction business.    Operating income increased in the first quarter of 2007 versus the first quarter of 2006 primarily due to the positive leverage effect from the increase in base revenues described above, income from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation. Variable margins decreased 100 basis points in the first quarter 2007 mainly due to production inefficiencies at two European laminate and appliance businesses, a product mix issue at a European laminate business and increased raw material costs. These increased expenses were partially offset by lower overhead expenses due to the benefits of 2006 restructuring projects and efficiencies from higher volumes.

The acquired revenues were primarily related to the acquisition of two businesses supplying the electronic and microelectronic assembly industry, two decorating businesses, a supply chain management software business and an industrial packaging business.  During the first quarter of 2007 the sleeve label businesses were divested. Base business revenues declined primarily due to decreased demand for machinery and consumables in many of the end markets that this segment serves.  Welding base revenues increased 7.1% due to higher demand in energy related end markets.  Total packaging base revenues declined 7.0% due to weakness in the construction related industrial packaging categories in North America. Food equipment base revenues increased 3.0% due to growth in the restaurant and institutional sector as well as the service business. Base business revenue from the other businesses in this segment, including the marking, decorating and finishing businesses, decreased 6.1% in the first quarter of 2007 over the first quarter of 2006.       Operating income increased in the first quarter of 2007 versus the first quarter of 2006 primarily due to decreased overhead costs, including the favorable first quarter 2007 impact of a $9.8 million charge related to retiree health care and life insurance liabilities incurred in the first quarter of 2006, impairment charges and restructuring expenses offset by lower acquisition income and the negative leverage effect from the decrease in base revenues described above.

The contribution from acquired business was primarily related to the acquisition of two businesses supplying the electronic and microelectronic assembly industry, a European industrial packaging business, and a European test and measurement business. Food equipment base revenues increased 7.7% due primarily to growth in European institutional demand. Total packaging base revenues increased 7.7% with strong demand in the consumer multi-pack carrier business and the European and Asia-Pacific industrial packaging businesses. Other base business revenues, including the welding and finishing businesses, increased 10.8% led by strong welding equipment and consumable sales in Asia and Europe.   Operating income increased in the first quarter of 2007 versus the first quarter of 2006 primarily as a result of leverage from the revenue increases described above and the favorable effect of currency translation. These increases were partially offset by increased restructuring expenses and the effect of the divestiture of the sleeve label businesses.   OPERATING REVENUES   The reconciliation of segment operating revenues to total operating revenues is as follows:   (In thousands)            AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS   The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. In the first quarter of each year, the Company performs an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives based on the fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset.   As of January 1, 2007, the Company had assigned its recorded goodwill and intangible assets to approximately 440 of its 750 reporting units. When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Fair values are determined by discounting estimated future cash flows at the Companys estimated cost of capital of 10%. Estimated future cash flows are based either on current operating cash flows or on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant operating unit. If the fair value of an operating unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value of the units goodwill and the carrying value of the goodwill.   Amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for the periods ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows:   (In thousands)             Three Months Ended March 31                 2007       2006         Goodwill:                                 Impairment       $   988       $   9,200         Intangible Assets:                                 Amortization           38,025           23,788         Impairment           1,166           2,985         Total       $   40,179       $   35,973          In the first quarter of 2007, the Company performed its annual impairment testing of its goodwill and intangible assets, which resulted in total impairment charges of $2.2 million. The first quarter 2007 goodwill impairment charges of $1.0 million were primarily related to a French fluid and polymer business and an Asian construction business in the Engineered Products  International segment and resulted from lower estimated future cash flows than previously expected. Also in the first quarter of 2007, intangible asset impairments of $1.2 million were recorded to reduce to the estimated fair value the carrying value of trademarks and customer-related intangible assets primarily related to a French fluid and polymer business in the Engineered Products  International segment and a U.S. contamination control business in the Engineered Products  North America segment.   In the first quarter of 2006, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $9.2 million which were primarily related to a U.S. construction joist business in the Engineered Products  North America segment, a U.S. thermal transfer ribbon business in the Specialty Systems  North America segment, and an Asian construction business in the Engineered Products  International segment and resulted from lower estimated future cash flows than previously expected. Also in the first quarter of 2006, intangible asset impairments of $3.0 million were recorded to reduce to the estimated fair value the carrying value of trademarks, patents and customer-related intangible assets primarily related to a U.S. welding components business in the Specialty Systems  North America segment and a U.S. contamination control business in the Engineered Products  North America segment.   INTEREST EXPENSE   Interest expense increased to $24.4 million in the first three months of 2007 from $18.9 million in 2006 primarily due to a higher amount of commercial paper outstanding in the first quarter of 2007.   OTHER INCOME   Other income increased to $26.6 million for the first three months of 2007 from $10.2 million in 2006, primarily due to gains on divestitures versus losses in 2006. These amounts are partially offset by lower investment income in 2007, primarily due to the liquidation of the Company's mortgage transactions in the fourth quarter of 2006.   INCOME TAXES   The effective tax rate for the first rate three months of 2007 was 29.5%, 1.5 percentage points lower than the effective rate for the first three months of 2006. The reduction in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from an increased domestic manufacturing deduction and an increased mix of income from foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates.       NET INCOME   Net income of $402.4 million ($0.71 per diluted share) in the first three months of 2007 was 9.8% higher than the 2006 net income of $366.5 million ($0.65 per diluted share).   FOREIGN CURRENCY   The weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in 2007 increased operating revenues for the first three months of 2007 by approximately $100.0 million and increased earnings by approximately 2 cents per diluted share.   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48).  FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, and provides guidance on derecognition, classification, and interest and penalties, related to uncertain tax positions. As a result of implementation of FIN 48, the Company did not recognize any change in its liability for unrecognized tax benefits. See the income taxes note for additional information.   On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Staff Position No. FAS 13-2, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction (FSP 13-2). FSP 13-2 addresses how a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction affects the accounting by a lessor for that lease. Upon adoption of FSP 13-2, the Company recorded an after-tax charge to retained earnings of $22.6 million, resulting from a change in the timing of expected cash flows related to income tax benefits of the Company's leveraged lease transactions.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   Cash Flow   The Companys primary source of liquidity is free operating cash flow. Management continues to believe that such internally generated cash flow will be adequate to service existing debt and to continue to pay dividends that meet its dividend payout guideline of 25% to 35% of the last two years average net income. In addition, free operating cash flow is expected to be adequate to finance internal growth, acquisitions and share repurchases.   The Company uses free operating cash flow to measure normal cash flow generated by its operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.   On August 4, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to 35.0 million shares. In the first quarter of 2007, the Company repurchased 3,677,141 shares of its common stock at an average price of $48.92 per share. Since inception of this program, the Company has repurchased 13,357,872 shares of its common stock for $626.7 million at an average price of $46.92 per share.       Summarized cash flow information for the first quarter of 2007 and 2006 was as follows:   (In thousands)             Three Months Ended March 31                 2007       2006         Net cash provided by operating activities       $   422,819       $   391,385         Additions to plant and equipment           (85,291   )       (68,319   )     Free operating cash flow       $   337,528       $   323,066                                           Acquisitions       $   (269,082   )   $   (198,997   )     Proceeds from sale of operations and affiliates           91,739           12,524         Cash dividends paid           (117,337   )       (92,620   )     Issuance of common stock           51,003           42,007         Repurchases of common stock           (179,873   )                Net proceeds (repayments) of debt           89,215           (23,970   )     Repayment of preferred stock of subsidiary           (40,000   )                Other           21,175           22,043         Net increase (decrease) in cash and equivalents       $   (15,632   )   $   84,053          Return on Average Invested Capital   The Company uses return on average invested capital (ROIC) to measure the effectiveness of its operations use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC for the first quarter of 2007 and 2006 was as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)        The 120 basis point decrease in ROIC in the first quarter of 2007 was due primarily to a 16.1% increase in average invested capital, mainly from acquisitions. The negative impact of acquisitions was partially offset by a 7.6% increase in after-tax operating income primarily due to an increase in base business operating income, translation, lower goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, and a decrease in the effective tax rate.       Working Capital   Net working capital at March 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 is summarized as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)      Trade receivables and inventories increased primarily as a result of acquisitions. Short-term debt increased due to an increase in short-term commercial paper to fund acquisition activity and stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2007.    Debt   Total debt at March 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 was as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)      The Company had outstanding commercial paper of $298.9 million at March 31, 2007 and $200.3 million at December 31, 2006.
