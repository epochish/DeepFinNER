In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in the Company’s 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform with current year reporting.On January 1, 2013, the Company adopted new accounting guidance which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test of an indefinite-lived intangible asset. The entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset unless, based on the qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. The Company performs its annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test in the third quarter and does not expect the adoption of this new accounting guidance to have a significant impact on its financial statements.(2)    DIVESTITURE OF MAJORITY INTEREST IN FORMER DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENTOn August 15, 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) to divest a 51% majority interest in its Decorative Surfaces segment to certain funds managed by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”).  The transaction closed on October 31, 2012, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $933 million ($632 million after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2012.Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, the Company contributed the assets and stock of the Decorative Surfaces segment to a newly formed entity, Wilsonart International Holdings LLC (“Wilsonart”). Through a combination of CD&R's equity investment in Wilsonart and new third party borrowings by a subsidiary of Wilsonart, the Company and its subsidiaries received payments of approximately $1.05 billion from Wilsonart and its subsidiaries as well as common units (the “Common Units”) initially representing approximately 49% (on an as-converted basis) of the total outstanding equity of Wilsonart immediately following the closing of the transaction. CD&R contributed $395 million to Wilsonart in exchange for newly issued cumulative convertible participating preferred units (the “Preferred Units”) of Wilsonart initially representing approximately 51% (on an as-converted basis) of the total outstanding equity immediately following the closing of the transaction. The Preferred Units rank senior to the Common Units as to dividends and liquidation preference, and accrue dividends at a rate of 10.00% per annum. As of October 31, 2012, the Company ceased consolidating the results of the Decorative Surfaces segment and now reports its ownership interest in Wilsonart using the equity method of accounting. As the Company's investment in Wilsonart is structured as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes, U.S. taxes are recorded separately from the equity investment. The Company's equity in the earnings of Wilsonart was $1 million of income for the three month period and $1 million of loss for the six month period ended June 30, 2013, which was included in Other income (expense). Due to the Company's continuing involvement through its 49% interest in Wilsonart, the historical operating results of Decorative Surfaces are presented in continuing operations. Additionally, as of November 1, 2012, the operating results of Decorative Surfaces were no longer reviewed by senior management of the Company and therefore, effective the fourth quarter of 2012, Decorative Surfaces was no longer a reportable segment of the Company.Historical operating results of the former Decorative Surfaces segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 were as follows:6(3)    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSThe Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term objectives. The following summarizes the Company's discontinued operations.In April 2011, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its finishing group of businesses previously included in the Specialty Products segment (formerly the All Other segment) to Graco Inc. in a $650 million cash transaction. The sale of the finishing business to Graco was completed on April 2, 2012 and the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $454 million in the second quarter of 2012.In the third quarter of 2012, the Company divested two consumer packaging businesses in separate transactions that were previously included in the Specialty Products segment (formerly the All Other segment). The sale of the consumer packaging businesses resulted in pre-tax gains of $26 million and $17 million recorded in the third quarter of 2012.In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company divested a packaging distribution business previously included in the Industrial Packaging segment and a welding manufacturing business previously included in the Welding segment (formerly in the Power Systems & Electronics segment). The sale of these businesses resulted in a pre-tax loss of $19 million and a pre-tax gain of $16 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2012.  In the first quarter of 2013, the Company committed to plans for the divestiture of two transportation related businesses and a machine components business previously included in the Specialty Products segment, two construction distribution businesses previously included in the Construction Products segment, and a chemical manufacturing business previously included in the Polymers & Fluids segment. These businesses were classified as held for sale in the first quarter of 2013. In connection with the anticipated sale of these businesses, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $42 million and loss reserves on assets held for sale of $60 million in the first quarter of 2013 which were included in Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations.In the second quarter of 2013, the Company divested one of the transportation related businesses resulting in a pre-tax loss of $1 million, the machine components business resulting in a pre-tax gain of $14 million, and the chemical manufacturing business resulting in a pre-tax loss of $6 million. Additionally, the Company recognized a pre-tax loss related to previously divested businesses of $10 million and adjustments to loss reserves on assets held for sale of $7 million in the second quarter of 2013. The Company expects to dispose of the other transportation related business and the two construction distribution businesses held for sale as of the second quarter of 2013 within the next year.The Company has restated the statement of income and the notes to financial statements to present the operating results of the held for sale and previously divested businesses discussed above as discontinued operations. Results of the discontinued operations for the second quarter and year-to-date periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 were as follows:7The assets and liabilities of the remaining held for sale businesses discussed above were included in assets and liabilities held for sale in the statement of financial position as of June 30, 2013. There were no businesses classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2012. The following table summarizes the classes of assets and liabilities held for sale as of June 30, 2013:(In millions)  June 30, 2013Trade receivables $63Inventories 72Net plant and equipment 11Goodwill and intangible assets 121Other 14Loss reserves on assets held for sale (46)Total assets held for sale $235   Accounts payable $22Accrued expenses 23Other 19Total liabilities held for sale $64(4)    STRATEGIC REVIEW OF INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENTOn February 19, 2013, the Company announced that it was initiating a review process to explore strategic alternatives for its Industrial Packaging segment, which may include a sale or spin-off of the business. The Company's strategic review of this segment is ongoing and is expected to conclude during 2013.(5)    GAIN ON ACQUISITION OF CONTROLLING INTEREST IN EQUITY INVESTMENTOn January 31, 2013, the Company acquired the controlling interest of an existing consumer packaging business in the Specialty Products segment previously accounted for under the equity method. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $30 million in Other income (expense) in the first quarter of 2013 as a result of remeasuring the Company's existing equity interest to fair value by determining the implied equity value using a Level 3 valuation method.(6)    INCOME TAXESThe effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 was 29.0% and 28.9%, respectively.The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions including the Internal Revenue Service, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, German Fiscal Authority, French Fiscal Authority, and Australian Tax Office and a number of these audits are currently ongoing, which may increase the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits in future periods. Due to the ongoing audits, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the amount of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits may be decreased by approximately $57 million related predominantly to various intercompany transactions. The Company has recorded its best estimate of the potential exposure for these issues.(7)    INVENTORIESInventories as of June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 were as follows:  8(8)    RETIREMENT PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITSPension and other postretirement benefit costs related to both continuing and discontinued operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, were as follows:In the second quarter of 2013, the Company recognized a $34 million pre-tax settlement charge tied primarily to higher lump sum pension payments related to the exit of Decorative Surfaces employees from the Company's U.S. primary pension plan. Refer to the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Former Decorative Surfaces Segment note for further details regarding the Decorative Surfaces transaction. The Company expects to contribute approximately $132 million to its pension plans and $9 million to its other postretirement plans in 2013. As of June 30, 2013, contributions of $117 million to pension plans and $4 million to other postretirement plans have been made.(9)    DEBTShort-term debt represents obligations with an original maturity date of one year or less and are stated at cost which approximates fair value. Short-term debt also includes current maturities of long-term debt. Included in short-term debt is commercial paper of $431 million as of June 30, 2013 and $408 million at December 31, 2012. Long-term debt represents obligations with an original maturity date of greater than one year, excluding amounts reclassified to short-term debt. In 2009, the Company issued $800 million of 5.15% redeemable notes due April 1, 2014, which were reclassified from long-term to short-term debt in the second quarter of 2013.  The approximate fair value and related carrying value of the Company's total long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt reclassified to short-term debt, as of June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 were as follows: The approximate fair values of the Company's long-term debt, including current maturities, were based on a Level 2 valuation model, using observable inputs, which included market rates for comparable instruments for the respective periods.9(10)    ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEEffective January 1, 2013, the Company adopted new accounting guidance that was issued in February 2013 requiring disclosure of amounts transferred out of accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in the statement of income. The following table summarizes changes in accumulated other comprehensive income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012:Foreign currency translation adjustments reclassified to income are primarily related to the disposal of certain discontinued operations. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note for additional information. Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income represent the amortization of actuarial losses and prior service cost, and settlement losses recognized in net periodic benefit cost. Refer to the Retirement Plans and Postretirement Benefits note for the amounts included in net periodic benefit cost. Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments also include $4 million and $9 million for the three-month periods, respectively, and $4 million and $11 million for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, related to the disposal of certain discontinued operations. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note for additional information.The ending balance of accumulated other comprehensive income as of June 30, 2013 and 2012 consisted of cumulative translation adjustment income of $466 million and $658 million, respectively, and unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefits costs, net of tax, of $454 million and $523 million, respectively.(11)    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATIONOn February 15, 2013, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved an annual equity award (the “2013 Awards”) consisting of stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance restricted stock units (“PRSUs”). The RSUs provide for full “cliff” vesting three years from the date of grant. The PRSUs provide for full “cliff” vesting after three years if the Compensation Committee certifies that the performance goals set with respect to the PRSUs have been met. Upon vesting, the holder will receive one share of common stock of the Company for each vested RSU or PRSU. The stock options vest over a four-year period and have a maturity of ten years from the issuance date. Option exercise prices are equal to the common stock fair market value on the date of grant. The following table summarizes the 2013 Awards:(Shares in millions)Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Weighted-Average Exercise PriceStock options1.2 $9.83 $63.25Restricted stock units (RSUs/PRSUs)0.5 58.69 —10The fair value of RSUs and PRSUs was determined by reducing the closing market price on the date of the grant by the present value of projected dividends over the vesting period. The Company uses a binomial option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the stock options granted. Lattice-based option valuation models, such as the binomial option pricing model, incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs. The risk-free rate of interest for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on a zero-coupon U.S. government instrument over the contractual term of the equity instrument. Expected volatility is based on implied volatility from traded options on the Company's stock and historical volatility of the Company's stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise timing and employee termination rates within the valuation model. The weighted-average dividend yield is based on historical information. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The ranges presented below result from separate groups of employees assumed to exhibit different behavior. The following table summarizes the assumptions used in the models to determine the fair value of the 2013 Awards:Risk-free interest rate0.2 - 2.1%Weighted-average volatility21.0%Dividend yield2.72%Expected years until exercise6.6 -7.6(12)    SEGMENT INFORMATIONEffective January 1, 2013, the Company made certain changes in how its operations are reported to senior management in order to better align its portfolio of businesses with its enterprise-wide portfolio management initiative. As a result of this reorganization, the Company's operations are aggregated into the following eight external reportable segments: Test & Measurement and Electronics; Automotive OEM; Polymers & Fluids; Food Equipment; Construction Products; Welding;  Specialty Products; and Industrial Packaging.The significant changes resulting from this reorganization included the following:•Certain businesses within the former Transportation segment, primarily related to the automotive aftermarket business, are reported in the Polymers & Fluids segment and the Transportation segment has been renamed Automotive OEM.•The Welding business, which was formerly reported in the Power Systems & Electronics segment, is reported separately as the Welding segment.•The Electronics business, which was formerly reported in the Power Systems & Electronics segment, has been combined with the Test & Measurement business, which was formerly reported in the All Other segment, to form a new Test & Measurement and Electronics segment.•The All Other segment has been renamed Specialty Products.The changes in the reportable segments and underlying reporting units did not result in any goodwill impairment charges in the first quarter of 2013.Commensurate with the change in reportable segments described above, the segment operating income was also revised for a change in how operating expenses maintained at the corporate level are allocated to the Company's segments. Prior to January 1, 2013, the Company allocated all operating expenses maintained at the corporate level to its segments. Beginning January 1, 2013, segments are allocated a fixed overhead charge based on the segment's revenues. Expenses not charged to the segments are now reported separately as Unallocated. Because the Unallocated category includes a variety of items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.The prior year segment results and related disclosures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation under the new segment structure and expense allocation methodology. See Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information regarding operating revenues and operating income for the Company's segments.11Item 2 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsINTRODUCTIONManagement analyzes the Company’s consolidated results of operations and the results of each segment by identifying the effects of changes in the results of the base businesses, newly acquired and recently divested companies, restructuring costs, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, and currency translation on the operating revenues and operating income of each segment. Base businesses are those businesses that have been included in the Company’s results of operations for more than 12 months. The changes to base business operating income include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and changes in variable margins and overhead costs. Operating leverage is the estimated effect of the base business revenue volume changes on operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period. As manufacturing and administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing, the percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage is usually more than the percentage change in the base business revenues. Changes in variable margins and overhead costs represent the estimated effect of non-volume related changes in base business operating income and may be driven by a number of factors, including changes in product mix, the cost of raw materials, labor and overhead, and pricing to customers. Selling price versus material cost comparisons represent the estimated net impact of increases or decreases in the cost of materials used in the Company’s products versus changes in the selling price to the Company’s customers. Management reviews these price versus cost comparisons by analyzing the net impact of changes to each segment’s operating margin.The discussion of operating results should be read in conjunction with Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.DIVESTITURE OF MAJORITY INTEREST IN FORMER DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT On August 15, 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) to divest a 51% majority interest in its Decorative Surfaces segment to certain funds managed by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”). Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, the Company contributed the assets and stock of the Decorative Surfaces segment to a newly formed entity, Wilsonart International Holdings LLC (“Wilsonart”). The transaction closed on October 31, 2012, reducing the Company's ownership of Wilsonart to 49% immediately following the close of the transaction. The Company ceased consolidating the results of the Decorative Surfaces segment as of October 31, 2012 and now reports its 49% ownership interest in Wilsonart using the equity method of accounting. Due to the Company's continuing involvement through its 49% interest in Wilsonart, the historical operating results of Decorative Surfaces are presented in continuing operations. Additionally, as of November 1, 2012, the operating results of Decorative Surfaces were no longer reviewed by senior management of the Company and therefore, effective the fourth quarter of 2012, Decorative Surfaces was no longer a reportable segment of the Company. See the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Former Decorative Surfaces Segment note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for further discussion of this transaction.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSThe Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term objectives. In the first quarter of 2013, the Company committed to plans for the divestiture of two transportation related businesses and a machine components business previously included in the Specialty Products segment, two construction distribution businesses previously included in the Construction Products segment, and a chemical manufacturing business previously included in the Polymers & Fluids segment. In the second quarter of 2013, the Company divested one of the transportation related businesses, the machine components business and the chemical manufacturing business, all of which were previously held for sale as of the first quarter of 2013.The held for sale businesses discussed above, as well as certain previously divested businesses are reported as discontinued operations in the statement of income. All related prior period income statement information has been restated to conform to the current year reporting of these businesses. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item I - Financial Statements for further details regarding the Company’s discontinued operations.12STRATEGIC REVIEW OF INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENTOn February 19, 2013, the Company announced that it was initiating a review process to explore strategic alternatives for its Industrial Packaging segment, which may include a sale or spin-off of the business. The Company's strategic review of this segment is ongoing and is expected to conclude during 2013.2013 SEGMENT CHANGESEffective January 1, 2013, the Company made certain changes in how its operations are reported to senior management in order to better align its portfolio of businesses with its enterprise-wide portfolio management initiative. As a result of this reorganization, the Company's operations are aggregated into the following eight external reportable segments: Test & Measurement and Electronics; Automotive OEM; Polymers & Fluids; Food Equipment; Construction Products; Welding;  Specialty Products; and Industrial Packaging.The significant changes resulting from this reorganization included the following:•Certain businesses within the former Transportation segment, primarily related to the automotive aftermarket business, are reported in the Polymers & Fluids segment and the Transportation segment has been renamed Automotive OEM.•The Welding business, which was formerly reported in the Power Systems & Electronics segment, is reported separately as the Welding segment.•The Electronics business, which was formerly reported in the Power Systems & Electronics segment, has been combined with the Test & Measurement business, which was formerly reported in the All Other segment, to form a new Test & Measurement and Electronics segment.•The All Other segment has been renamed Specialty Products.The changes in the reportable segments and underlying reporting units did not result in any goodwill impairment charges in the first quarter of 2013.Commensurate with the change in reportable segments described above, the segment operating income was also revised for a change in how operating expenses maintained at the corporate level are allocated to the Company's segments. Prior to January 1, 2013, the Company allocated all operating expenses maintained at the corporate level to its segments. Beginning January 1, 2013, segments are allocated a fixed overhead charge based on the segment's revenues. Expenses not charged to the segments are now reported separately as Unallocated. Because the Unallocated category includes a variety of items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.The prior year segment results and related disclosures have been restated to conform to the current year presentation under the new segment structure and expense allocation methodology.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe Company’s consolidated results of operations for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2013 and 2012 were as follows:13In the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2013, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: Three Months Ended Six Months EndedJune 30 June 30% Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Point Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Point Increase (Decrease)Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating Margins Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating MarginsBase business:        Revenue change/Operating leverage— % (0.1)% — % (1.3)% (3.2)% (0.3)%Changes in variable margins & overhead costs— % 0.8 % 0.1 % — % 3.3 % 0.5 %— % 0.7 % 0.1 % (1.3)% 0.1 % 0.2 %Acquisitions1.0 % 0.4 % (0.1)% 1.1 % 0.2 % (0.2)%Divestitures(6.5)% (5.5)% 0.1 % (6.4)% (5.4)% 0.2 %Restructuring costs— % (3.3)% (0.6)% — % (1.2)% (0.2)%Impairment of goodwill & intangibles— % — % — % — % — % — %Translation— % 0.2 % 0.1 % (0.1)% 0.1 % — %Other— % — % — % — % — % — %Total(5.5)% (7.5)% (0.4)% (6.7)% (6.2)% — %Operating RevenuesRevenues decreased 5.5% and 6.7% for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2013, respectively, versus 2012 primarily due to the divestiture of  Decorative Surfaces segment in the fourth quarter of 2012 and lower base revenues in the year-to-date period, partially offset by revenues from acquisitions.  Excluding the former Decorative Surfaces segment revenue from the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2012, revenues increased 1.0% and declined 0.4%, respectively.  Worldwide base revenues for the second quarter and year-to-date periods were flat and declined 1.3%, respectively.  For the second quarter, international base revenues increased 1.1% and North American base revenues decreased 1.0%.  Asia Pacific base revenues increased 2.6% driven by growth in China and India, partially offset by moderating declines in European base revenues of 1.0%.  North American declines were driven by the electronics assembly platform within the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment, partially offset by higher organic revenues in the Automotive OEM segment. For the year-to-date period, international base revenues decreased 1.2% and North American base revenues decreased 1.4%. European base revenues declined 3.4% primarily due to weakness in the European economic environment in the first quarter of 2013. Asia Pacific base revenues increased 1.6% driven by growth in China and India, partially offset by weakness in Australia in the first quarter of 2013.  Total worldwide base revenues were driven by lower equipment sales which decreased 3.7% and 4.9% for the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, due to lower industrial capital expenditures versus the prior year period, and softness in the electronics assembly platform as noted above. Divestitures reduced revenues by 6.5% and 6.4% for the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to the sale of a 51% interest in the former Decorative Surfaces segment on October 31, 2012, at which time the segment was deconsolidated. Acquisitions contributed 1.0% and 1.1% to revenues for the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively.14Operating IncomeOperating income decreased 7.5% and 6.2% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2013, respectively, versus 2012 primarily due to the divestiture of the former Decorative Surfaces segment in the fourth quarter of 2012, higher restructuring expenses, and lower base revenues in the year-to-date period noted above, partially offset by lower operating expenses.  In the second quarter of 2013, the Company recognized a $34 million pre-tax pension settlement charge tied primarily to higher lump sum pension payments related to the exit of Decorative Surfaces employees from the Company's U.S. primary pension plan.  Total base operating margins increased 10 and 20 basis points in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to higher variable margins in both periods and lower overhead expenses in the year-to-date period, partially offset by the negative operating leverage effect of the decrease in base revenues of 30 basis points in the year-to-date period. The changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased base margins by 10 basis points in the second quarter primarily due to a reduction of overhead expenses of 60 basis points, resulting primarily from the benefits of business structure simplification activities and strategic sourcing initiatives, and the favorable effect of selling price versus material cost comparisons of 50 basis points, partially offset by the 80 basis points impact of the pension settlement charge noted above.  In the year-to-date period, the changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased base margins by 50 basis points primarily due to a reduction of overhead expenses of 70 basis points and the favorable effect of selling price versus material cost comparisons of 40 basis points, partially offset by the 50 basis points impact of the pension settlement charge.  Higher restructuring expenses diluted total operating margins by 60 basis points and 20 basis points in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2013, respectively, versus the prior year period.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENTThe reconciliation of segment operating revenues to total operating revenues is as follows:15The reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is as follows:Unallocated expenses increased in the three month and year-to-date periods primarily due to the $34 million pre-tax pension settlement charge recognized in the second quarter of 2013.

Operating IncomeOperating income increased 2.8% in the second quarter of 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to lower operating expenses and higher base revenues, largely offset by higher restructuring expenses.  Operating income increased 14.3% in the year-to-date period of 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower base revenues and higher restructuring expenses. Total base operating margins increased 310 and 220 basis points in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to changes in variable margins and overhead costs, which were partially offset by the negative operating leverage effect of the decrease in base revenues of 50 basis points in the year-to-date period. The changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased base margins by 300 and 270 basis points in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to a reduction of overhead expenses of 170 basis points in each period, resulting primarily from overhead cost management and the benefits of business structure simplification activities, favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons of 60 and 40 basis points, respectively, and lower intangible asset amortization of 50 and 40 basis points, respectively. Higher restructuring expenses in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2013 versus 2012 diluted total operating margins by 280 and 40 basis points, respectively, primarily due to cost reduction activities in Europe in the second quarter.SPECIALTY PRODUCTSDiversified businesses in this segment produce product coding and marking equipment and consumables, beverage packaging equipment and consumables, and appliance components and fasteners.In the Specialty Products segment, products include:•plastic consumables that multi-pack cans and bottles and related equipment;•foil, film and related equipment used to decorate consumer products;•product coding and marking equipment and related consumables;•line integration, conveyor systems and line automation for the food and beverage industries;•plastic and metal fasteners and components for appliances;•airport ground support equipment; and•components for medical devices.This segment primarily serves the food and beverage, consumer durables, general industrial, and printing & publishing markets.The results of operations for the Specialty Products segment for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2013 and 2012 were as follows:25In the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2013, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: Three Months Ended Six Months EndedJune 30 June 30% Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Point Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Point Increase (Decrease)Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating Margins Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating MarginsBase business:        Revenue change/Operating leverage1.6% 3.3 % 0.4 % 1.0 % 2.1 % 0.2 %Changes in variable margins & overhead costs—% 1.3 % 0.3 % — % 3.9 % 0.8 %1.6% 4.6 % 0.7 % 1.0 % 6.0 % 1.0 %Acquisitions3.6% 2.7 % (0.2)% 3.5 % 1.5 % (0.4)%Divestitures—% — % — % — % — % — %Restructuring costs—% (0.5)% (0.1)% — % (0.2)% — %Impairment of goodwill & intangibles—% — % — % — % — % — %Translation—% 0.4 % — % (0.1)% 0.3 % 0.1 %Other—% — % — % — % — % — %Total5.2% 7.2 % 0.4 % 4.4 % 7.6 % 0.7 %Operating RevenuesRevenues increased 5.2% and 4.4% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2013, respectively, versus 2012 primarily due to an increase in acquisition and base business revenues. Acquisition revenue was primarily due to the fourth quarter 2012 purchase of a North American medical products manufacturer. Worldwide consumer packaging base revenues increased 2.0% and 1.4% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to an increase in warehouse automation systems sales in the global packaging systems businesses and higher sales of reclosable consumer food storage bags in emerging markets by value added consumer packaging businesses.  Worldwide appliance base business revenues declined 4.3% and 3.5% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to lower consumer demand in the European and North American home appliance sectors.Operating IncomeOperating income increased 7.2% and 7.6% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2013, respectively, versus 2012 primarily due to an increase in base revenues, lower operating expenses, and income from acquisitions. Total base operating margins increased 70 and 100 basis points in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to the positive operating leverage effect of the increase in base revenues of 40 and 20 basis points, respectively, and changes in variable margins and overhead costs. The changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased base margins by 30 and 80 basis points in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, due to a reduction of overhead expenses of 60 basis points in each period resulting primarily from the benefits of business structure simplification activities and overhead cost management, lower intangible asset amortization of 30 and 20 basis points, respectively, partially offset by lower variable margins in the consumer packaging businesses. Acquisitions diluted total operating margins by 20 and 40 basis points in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively.INDUSTRIAL PACKAGINGBusinesses in this segment produce steel, plastic and paper products and equipment used for bundling, shipping and protecting goods in transit.In the Industrial Packaging segment, products include:•steel and plastic strapping and related tools and equipment;•plastic stretch film and related equipment; and•paper and plastic products that protect goods in transit.26This segment primarily serves the general industrial, primary metals, beverage and food, and paper products markets.The results of operations for the Industrial Packaging segment for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2013 and 2012 were as follows:In the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2013, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30 June 30 % Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Point Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Point Increase (Decrease) Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating Margins Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating MarginsBase business:           Revenue change/Operating leverage(1.0)% (3.1)% (0.3)% (2.7)% (8.7)% (0.7)%Changes in variable margins & overhead costs— % (1.6)% (0.2)% — % 6.6 % 0.8 %(1.0)% (4.7)% (0.5)% (2.7)% (2.1)% 0.1 %Acquisitions0.3 % — % — % 0.3 % 0.1 % — %Divestitures — % — % — % — % — % — %Restructuring costs— % (2.6)% (0.3)% — % 1.8 % 0.2 %Impairment of goodwill & intangibles— % — % — % — % — % — %Translation0.1 % 0.3 % — % (0.2)% (0.4)% (0.1)%Other— % — % — % — % — % — %Total(0.6)% (7.0)% (0.8)% (2.6)% (0.6)% 0.2 %Operating RevenuesOperating revenues decreased 0.6% and 2.6% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2013, respectively, versus 2012 primarily due to a decline in base business, partially offset by revenues from acquisitions. North American base revenues decreased 2.5% and 1.8% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to lower steel strapping volume, partially offset by higher plastic strapping sales due to penetration gains and growth in construction end markets. International base revenues increased 0.5% in the second quarter primarily due to growth in Asia Pacific driven by higher packaging and equipment sales in India, and decreased 3.5% in the year-to-date period primarily due to moderating end market softness in the European steel, lumber, and construction markets. 27Operating IncomeOperating income decreased 7.0% in the second quarter of 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to lower base revenues and higher operating and restructuring expenses.  In the year-to-date period, operating income decreased 0.6% primarily due to lower base revenues partially offset by lower operating and restructuring expenses. Total base operating margins decreased 50 basis points in the second quarter and increased 10 basis points in the year-to-date period due to changes in variable margins and overhead costs and the negative operating leverage effect of the decrease in base revenues of 30 and 70 basis points in each respective period. In the second quarter, the changes in variable margins and overhead costs decreased base margins by 20 basis points, primarily due to higher overhead expenses. In the year-to-date period, the changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased base margins by 80 basis points primarily due to favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons of 50 basis points and a reduction of overhead expenses of 20 basis points.  Higher restructuring expenses diluted total operating margins by 30 basis points in the second quarter, while lower restructuring expenses in the first quarter improved total operating margins by 20 basis points in the year-to-date period.DECORATIVE SURFACESThe former Decorative Surfaces segment produces decorative high-pressure laminate surfacing materials for furniture, office and retail space, countertops, worktops and other applications. Principal end markets served include commercial, renovation and residential construction.On August 15, 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) to divest a 51% majority interest in its Decorative Surfaces segment to certain funds managed by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”). Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, the Company contributed the assets and stock of the Decorative Surfaces segment to a newly formed entity, Wilsonart International Holdings LLC (“Wilsonart”). The transaction closed on October 31, 2012, reducing the Company's ownership of Wilsonart to 49% immediately following the close of the transaction. The Company ceased consolidating the results of the Decorative Surfaces segment as of October 31, 2012, and now reports its 49% ownership interest in Wilsonart using the equity method of accounting. Due to the Company's continuing involvement through its 49% interest in Wilsonart, the historical operating results of Decorative Surfaces are presented in continuing operations.  Additionally, as of November 1, 2012, the operating results of Decorative Surfaces were no longer reviewed by senior management of the Company and therefore, effective the fourth quarter of 2012, Decorative Surfaces was no longer a reportable segment of the Company. See the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Former Decorative Surfaces Segment note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for further discussion of this transaction.Historical operating results of the former Decorative Surfaces segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 were as follows:28AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETSAmortization expense decreased to $133 million in the first six months of 2013 versus $141 million in the first six months of 2012 due to fully amortized intangibles at various business units.INTEREST EXPENSEInterest expense increased to $119 million in the first six months of 2013, which included interest expense on the 3.9% notes issued in late August 2012, versus $100 million in the first six months of 2012.OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)Other income (expense) increased to income of $57 million for the first six months of 2013 versus income of $32 million for the first six months of 2012 primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $30 million in the first quarter of 2013 related to the acquisition of the controlling interest in an existing equity investment. See the Gain on Acquisition of Controlling Interest in Equity Investment note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for further details regarding the gain related to the acquired controlling interest. INCOME TAXESThe effective tax rate for the first six months of 2013 and 2012 was 29.0% and 28.9%, respectively. See the Income Taxes note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for further details on income taxes. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONSIncome from continuing operations of $923 million for the first six months of 2013 was 6.1% lower than the 2012 income from continuing operations of $983 million. The prior year period includes operating results related to the former Decorative Surfaces segment, which was divested on October 31, 2012.  See the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Former Decorative Surfaces Segment note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for further discussion of this transaction.FOREIGN CURRENCYFor the first six months of 2013 versus 2012, the impact of foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar decreased both revenues and income from continuing operations by approximately 10 basis points.INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSIncome (loss) from discontinued operations was a loss of $104 million for the first six months of 2013 versus income of $384 million for the first six months of 2012. The loss in the first six months of 2013 included $42 million of goodwill impairment charges and loss reserves on assets held for sale of $67 million recorded in connection with the anticipated sale of certain businesses held for sale. The income in the first six months of 2012 was primarily a result of the gain on the sale of the finishing group of businesses. See the Discontinued Operations note in Item 1 – Financial Statements for further details regarding the Company’s discontinued operations.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIn March 2013, new accounting guidance was issued which clarifies that an entity should release cumulative translation adjustments into net income when the entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business within a foreign entity. The new guidance will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2014. The Company does not expect the adoption of this new accounting guidance to have a significant impact on its financial statements.29LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe Company’s primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and short-term credit facilities. Management continues to believe that internally generated cash flows will be adequate to service debt, to finance internal growth, to continue to pay dividends, and to fund small to medium-sized acquisitions.The primary uses of liquidity are:•dividend payments - the Company's dividend payout guidelines are 30% to 45% of the average of the last two years' free operating cash flow;•share repurchases; and•acquisitions.Cash FlowThe Company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.Summarized cash flow information for the year-to-date periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 was as follows: Six Months Ended(In millions) June 30, 2013 2012Net cash provided by operating activities $1,009 $832Additions to plant and equipment (178) (184)Free operating cash flow $831 $648     Cash dividends paid $(171) $(346)Acquisition of businesses (excluding cash and equivalents) and additional interest in affiliates (77) (587)Repurchases of common stock (677) (1,000)Net proceeds from sale of discontinued operations 59 626Proceeds from sale of operations and affiliates 1 3Net proceeds from debt 42 926Other 161 268Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and equivalents (180) (24)Net increase (decrease) in cash and equivalents $(11) $514Cash dividends paid during the six months ended June 30, 2013 does not include the dividend payment originally scheduled to be paid in January 2013, which was accelerated and paid in December 2012.On May 6, 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to $4.0 billion of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2011 Program”). The Company used cash to repurchase approximately 5.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $62.86 in the first quarter of 2013 and approximately 4.6 million shares at an average price of $66.45 in the second quarter of 2013 under the 2011 Program. As of June 30, 2013, there was approximately $1.2 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2011 Program.30Return on Average Invested CapitalThe Company uses return on average invested capital (“ROIC”) to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. To improve comparability of ROIC in the periods presented, operating income and invested capital have been adjusted to exclude the former Decorative Surfaces segment. Invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company’s operations, as well as the Company's net investment in the former Decorative Surfaces segment and subsequent equity investment in the Wilsonart business. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. For the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2013 and 2012, ROIC was as follows:The ROIC increase of 70 basis points in the second quarter of 2013 compared to the second quarter of 2012 was the result of adjusted operating income after taxes decreasing only slightly, while average invested capital decreased 5.7%.The ROIC increase of 60 basis points for the year-to-date period of 2013 compared to the year-to-date period of 2012 was the result of operating income after taxes remaining flat, while average invested capital decreased 3.6%.31Working CapitalManagement uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the Company. Net working capital as of June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 is summarized as follows:The decrease in net working capital as of June 30, 2013 is primarily due to current maturities of long-term debt related to the $800 million of 5.15% redeemable notes due April 1, 2014. Cash and equivalents totaled approximately $2.8 billion as of June 30, 2013, primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries and may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the U.S. Cash balances held internationally are typically used for international operating needs, reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses, or used to fund new international acquisitions. In the U.S., the Company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs which primarily consist of dividend payments, acquisitions, share repurchases, servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs. The Company also uses its commercial paper program, which is backed by long-term credit facilities of $2.5 billion, for short-term liquidity needs. The Company believes cash generated domestically will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the U.S.DebtTotal debt and total debt to capitalization as of June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 were as follows:The Company had outstanding commercial paper of $431 million as of June 30, 2013 and $408 million as of December 31, 2012, which was included in short-term debt.In 2009, the Company issued $800 million of 5.15% redeemable notes due April 1, 2014. These notes have been classified as current maturities of long-term debt and included in short-term debt as of June 30, 2013.  These notes were classified as long-term debt at December 31, 2012. The Company believes that, based on its current free operating cash flow, debt to capitalization ratios and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary.32Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDAThe Company uses the ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. The Company believes that total debt to adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA and the ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. The ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA represents total debt divided by income from continuing operations before interest expense, gain on sale of interest in Decorative Surfaces, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis.Total debt to adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve month periods ended June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 was as follows:Stockholders’ EquityThe changes to stockholders’ equity during 2013 were as follows:(In millions) Total stockholders’ equity, December 31, 2012$10,570Net income819Stock option and restricted stock activity150Repurchases of common stock(676)Cash dividends declared(341)Noncontrolling interest activity(10)Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments, net of tax120Foreign currency translation adjustments(401)Total stockholders’ equity, June 30, 2013$10,23133FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
