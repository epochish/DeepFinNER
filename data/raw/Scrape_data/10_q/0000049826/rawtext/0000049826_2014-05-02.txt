Statements (Unaudited)(1)    Financial StatementsThe unaudited financial statements included herein have been prepared by Illinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”). In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in the Company’s 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform with current year reporting.(2)    Discontinued OperationsThe Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term objectives. As such, the Company may commit to a plan to exit or dispose of certain businesses and present them as discontinued operations. The following summarizes the Company's discontinued operations.The Company has restated the statement of income and the notes to financial statements to present the operating results of the held for sale and previously divested businesses discussed below as discontinued operations.Third Quarter 2013 Discontinued Operations - In February 2013, the Company announced that it was initiating a review process to explore strategic alternatives for its Industrial Packaging segment. In September 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the Industrial Packaging segment. The Company classified the Industrial Packaging segment as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013 and is no longer presenting this segment as part of its continuing operations.On February 6, 2014, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell its Industrial Packaging segment to The Carlyle Group for $3.2 billion. The transaction was completed on May 1, 2014.In the third quarter of 2013, the Company also committed to plans for the divestiture of a construction distribution business previously included in the Construction Products segment and a specialty coatings business previously included in the Polymers & Fluids segment. These businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013. The specialty coatings business was sold in the fourth quarter of 2013. The Company expects to sell the construction distribution business by mid-2014.First Quarter 2013 Discontinued Operations - In the first quarter of 2013, the Company committed to plans for the divestiture of two transportation related businesses and a machine components business previously included in the Specialty Products segment, two construction distribution businesses previously included in the Construction Products segment, and a chemical manufacturing business previously included in the Polymers & Fluids segment. These businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the first quarter of 2013.The Company also reclassified certain previously divested businesses as discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2013. These included a consumer packaging business that was previously included in the Specialty Products segment, a packaging distribution business which was previously included in the former Industrial Packaging segment, and a welding manufacturing business previously included in the Welding segment.In the second quarter of 2013, the Company divested one of the held for sale transportation related businesses, the machine components business, and the chemical manufacturing business. In the third quarter of 2013, the Company divested the second held for sale transportation related business. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company divested one construction distribution business. The Company expects to dispose of the remaining held for sale construction distribution business by mid-2014.6Results of the discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Three Months Ended(In millions)March 31, 2014 2013Operating revenues$586 $737    Income (loss) before income taxes$72 $(19)Income tax expense(27) (28)Income (loss) from discontinued operations$45 $(47)Income (loss) before income taxes from discontinued operations was income of $72 million and a loss of $19 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The loss in the first three months of 2013 included a $42 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in connection with the anticipated sale of one of the transportation related businesses and loss reserves on assets held for sale of $60 million.As of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the assets and liabilities of the Industrial Packaging business and the two construction distribution businesses discussed above were included in assets and liabilities held for sale in the statement of financial position, as follows:(3)    Gain on Acquisition of Controlling Interest in Equity InvestmentOn January 31, 2013, the Company acquired the controlling interest of an existing consumer packaging business in the Specialty Products segment previously accounted for under the equity method. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $30 million in Other income (expense) in the first three months of 2013 as a result of remeasuring the Company's existing equity interest to fair value by determining the implied equity value using a Level 3 valuation method.(4)    Income TaxesThe Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions including the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, German Fiscal Authority, French Fiscal Authority, and Australian Tax Office and a number of these audits are currently ongoing, which may increase the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits in future periods. Due to the ongoing audits, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the amount of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits may be decreased by approximately $52 million related predominantly to various intercompany transactions. The Company has recorded its best estimate of the potential exposure for these issues.On February 18, 2014, the Company received a Notice of Deficiency (“NOD”) from the IRS asserting that a non-taxable return of capital received from a subsidiary was a taxable dividend distribution. The NOD assesses additional taxes of $70 million for the 2006 tax year. The Company intends to petition the United States Tax Court to challenge the NOD. Although the outcome of this process cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes it will be successful in defending its position.7(5)    InventoriesInventories as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were as follows: (6)    Retirement Plans and Postretirement BenefitsPension and other postretirement benefit costs related to both continuing and discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, were as follows: Three Months Ended(In millions)March 31, Pension Other Postretirement Benefits 2014 2013 2014 2013Components of net periodic benefit cost:       Service cost$20 $23 $3 $3Interest cost26 24 6 6Expected return on plan assets(40) (39) (6) (5)Amortization of actuarial losses12 19 (2) —Net periodic benefit cost$18 $27 $1 $4        Net periodic benefit cost included in the statement of income was:       Income from continuing operations$16 $24 $1 $4Income (loss) from discontinued operations2 3 — —Net periodic benefit cost$18 $27 $1 $4The Company expects to contribute approximately $136 million to its pension plans and $7 million to its other postretirement plans in 2014. As of March 31, 2014, contributions of $32 million to pension plans and $2 million to other postretirement plans have been made.(7)    DebtShort-term debt represents obligations with a maturity date of one year or less and are stated at cost which approximates fair value. Short-term debt also includes current maturities of long-term debt. Current maturities of long-term debt included $800 million of 5.15% redeemable notes due April 1, 2014, which were repaid on the due date, and €750 million($1.0 billion) of 5.25% Euro notes due October 1, 2014. In addition, short-term debt included commercial paper of $950 million as of March 31, 2014 and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2013. On January 22, 2014, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion short-term line of credit agreement with a term of up to 364 days to provide additional liquidity under the Company's commercial paper program in order to fund short-term capital allocation needs. No amount was outstanding under this facility at March 31, 2014.Long-term debt represents obligations with a maturity date greater than one year, and excludes current maturities that have been reclassified to short-term debt.  In February 2014, the Company issued $650 million of 0.9% notes due February 25, 2017, $650 million of 1.95% notes due March 1, 2019, and $700 million of 3.5% notes due March 1, 2024. Proceeds from the February 2014 debt issuance were used to repay commercial paper.8The approximate fair value and related carrying value of the Company's total long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt reclassified to short-term debt, as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were as follows: The approximate fair values of the Company's long-term debt, including current maturities, were based on a Level 2 valuation model, using observable inputs which included market rates for comparable instruments for the respective periods.(8)    Accumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeThe following table summarizes changes in accumulated other comprehensive income for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013: Three Months Ended(In millions)March 31, 2014 2013Beginning balance$384 $293    Foreign currency translation adjustments during the period28 (154)Foreign currency translation adjustments reclassified to income— 4Total foreign currency translation adjustments28 (150)    Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income10 19Income taxes(2) (7)Total pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments8 12    Ending balance$420 $155Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income represent the amortization of actuarial losses recognized in net periodic benefit cost. Refer to the Retirement Plans and Postretirement Benefits note for the amounts included in net periodic benefit cost.The ending balance of accumulated other comprehensive income as of March 31, 2014 and 2013 consisted of cumulative translation adjustment income of $702 million and $717 million, respectively, and unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefits costs, net of tax, of $282 million and $562 million, respectively.(9)    Segment InformationThe Company has seven reportable segments: Automotive OEM; Test & Measurement and Electronics; Food Equipment; Polymers & Fluids; Welding; Construction Products; and Specialty Products.  See Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information regarding operating revenues and operating income for the Company's segments.9Item 2 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsIntroductionManagement analyzes the Company’s consolidated results of operations and the results of each segment by identifying the effects of changes in the results of the base businesses, newly acquired and recently divested companies, restructuring costs, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, and currency translation on the operating revenues and operating income of each segment. Base businesses are those businesses that have been included in the Company’s results of operations for more than 12 months. The changes to base business operating income include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and changes in variable margins and overhead costs. Operating leverage is the estimated effect of the base business revenue volume changes on operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period. As manufacturing and administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing, the percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage is usually more than the percentage change in the base business revenues. Changes in variable margins and overhead costs represent the estimated effect of non-volume related changes in base business operating income and may be driven by a number of factors, including changes in product mix, the cost of raw materials, labor and overhead, and pricing to customers. Selling price versus material cost comparisons represent the estimated net impact of increases or decreases in the cost of materials used in the Company’s products versus changes in the selling price to the Company’s customers. Management reviews these price versus cost comparisons by analyzing the net impact of changes to each segment’s operating margin.The discussion of operating results should be read in conjunction with Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.Enterprise StrategyDuring 2012, the Company embarked on an Enterprise Strategy that includes three key initiatives - portfolio management, business structure simplification, and strategic sourcing. These enterprise initiatives are expected to enhance the business through 2017 and are targeted at expanding organic revenue growth and improving profitability and returns.Portfolio Management - The Company's portfolio management initiative aims to construct a business portfolio that leverages the Company’s differentiated business model and growth potential. As part of this initiative, the Company reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its long-term objectives. As a result, the Company's divestiture activity increased over historical periods in 2012 and 2013 and is increasing further in 2014 with the divestiture of the Industrial Packaging segment. The Company has historically acquired businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms. Going forward, the focus will be on businesses with sustainable differentiation and growth potential. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for discussion of the Company’s discontinued operations.Business Structure Simplification - The business structure simplification initiative simplifies the Company's organizational model and adds scale to the Company's operating divisions in order to increase organic revenue growth, enhance global competitiveness and drive operational efficiencies. This initiative focuses on reducing the number of the Company's operating divisions and increasing the average revenue size of each division, while retaining the positive attributes of a decentralized operating model. The Company expects to enhance its profitability and returns through a combination of applying its 80/20 business process to the new divisions, more focused growth investments and reduced infrastructure.Strategic Sourcing - The Company's strategic sourcing initiative focuses on building sourcing capability in order to leverage purchasing scale to enhance profitability and global competitiveness. It incorporates both enterprise-level and segment-level purchasing that cross the Company's many businesses. This initiative is expected to transform sourcing into a core strategic function in the Company.Discontinued OperationsThe Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term objectives. As such, the Company may commit to a plan to exit or dispose of certain businesses and present them as discontinued operations. 10In February 2013, the Company announced that it was initiating a review process to explore strategic alternatives for the Industrial Packaging segment.

The construction distribution and specialty coatings businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013.In the first quarter of 2013, the Company committed to plans for the divestiture of two transportation related businesses and a machine components business previously included in the Specialty Products segment, two construction distribution businesses previously included in the Construction Products segment, and a chemical manufacturing business previously included in the Polymers & Fluids segment. These businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the first quarter of 2013. These held for sale businesses discussed above, as well as certain previously divested businesses, are reported as discontinued operations in the statement of income. All related prior period income statement information has been restated to conform to the current year reporting of these businesses. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for discussion of the Company’s discontinued operations.Consolidated Results of OperationsThe Company’s consolidated results of operations for the first quarter of 2014 and 2013 were as follows:In the first quarter of 2014, the changes in operating revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: Three Months Ended March 31 % Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Point          Increase (Decrease) Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating MarginsBase business (organic):     Revenue change/Operating leverage3.3 % 8.5 % 0.8 %Changes in variable margins & overhead costs— % 6.5 % 1.1 % 3.3 % 15.0 % 1.9 %Acquisitions1.5 % 0.4 % (0.2)%Divestitures— % — % — %Restructuring costs— % 0.3 % 0.1 %Impairment of goodwill & intangibles— % — % — %Translation(0.4)% (0.2)% — %Total4.4 % 15.5 % 1.8 %11Operating RevenuesOperating revenues increased 4.4% in the first quarter of 2014 versus 2013 primarily due to an increase in organic revenues and revenues from acquisitions. Worldwide organic revenues for the first quarter increased 3.3%. International organic revenues grew 6.3%. European organic revenues increased 4.8% primarily driven by growth in the Automotive OEM, Food Equipment, and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments, partially offset by a decline in the Welding segment. Asia Pacific organic revenues increased 7.2% primarily due to strong growth in Australia in the Construction Products segment and in China in the Automotive OEM segment. North American organic revenues increased a modest 1.0% primarily driven by the Automotive OEM and Food Equipment segments. North American organic revenue growth was negatively impacted by weak industrial capital spending in the Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments. In addition, North American organic revenues declined in the Polymers & Fluids segment due to ongoing product line simplification ("PLS") activities. Acquisitions completed in 2013 contributed 1.5% to revenues in 2014 versus 2013 primarily due to the purchase of a European consumer packaging equipment business and a Chinese food equipment business.Operating IncomeOperating income increased 15.5% in the first quarter of 2014 versus 2013 primarily due to higher organic revenues and changes in variable margins and overhead expenses. Total base operating margins increased 190 basis points, primarily due to changes in variable margins and overhead costs and the positive operating leverage effect of the increase in organic revenues. The changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased base margins by 110 basis points driven primarily by the benefits of the Company's enterprise initiatives, business structure simplification and strategic sourcing, which contributed 120 basis points of improvement. Results of Operations by SegmentTotal operating revenues are as follows:12Total operating income is as follows:AUTOMOTIVE OEMBusinesses in this segment produce components and fasteners for automotive-related applications.In the Automotive OEM segment, products and services include:•plastic and metal components, fasteners and assemblies for automobiles, light trucks, and other industrial uses.This segment primarily serves the automotive original equipment manufacturers and tiers, and automotive aftermarket markets.The results of operations for the Automotive OEM segment for the first quarter of 2014 and 2013 were as follows:13In the first quarter of 2014, the changes in operating revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: Three Months Ended March 31 % Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Point          Increase (Decrease) Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating MarginsBase business (organic):     Revenue change/Operating leverage13.0% 24.3% 2.0%Changes in variable margins & overhead costs—% 5.3% 0.9% 13.0% 29.6% 2.9%Acquisitions—% —% —%Divestitures—% —% —%Restructuring costs—% 2.7% 0.5%Impairment of goodwill & intangibles—% —% —%Translation0.4% 1.2% 0.1%Total13.4% 33.5% 3.5%Operating RevenuesOperating revenues increased 13.4% in the first quarter of 2014 versus 2013 due to the increase in organic revenues and the favorable impact of currency translation. Worldwide automotive organic revenue growth of 13.0% exceeded worldwide auto builds of approximately 5%, primarily due to product penetration gains. European organic revenue growth of 14.4% exceeded auto build growth of 7%. Organic revenues for Asia Pacific increased 17.3% primarily due to organic revenue growth in China of 27.8%, which exceeded Chinese auto build growth of 10%. North American automotive organic revenues grew 10.7% as North American auto builds increased 6%.Operating IncomeOperating income increased 33.5% in the first quarter of 2014 versus 2013 primarily due to higher organic revenues and changes in variable margins and overhead costs. Total base operating margins increased 290 basis points primarily due to the positive operating leverage effect of the increase in organic revenues of 200 basis points and changes in variable margins and overhead costs. The changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased base margins by 90 basis points primarily driven by the benefits of the Company's enterprise initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons of 20 basis points. Lower restructuring expenses increased total operating margins by 50 basis points.TEST & MEASUREMENT AND ELECTRONICSBusinesses in this segment produce equipment, consumables, and related software for testing and measuring of materials and structures, and equipment and consumables used in the production of electronic subassemblies and microelectronics.In the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment, products include:•equipment, consumables, and related software for testing and measuring of materials, structures, gases and fluids;•electronic assembly equipment and related consumable solder materials;•electronic components and component packaging;•static control equipment and consumables used for contamination control in clean room environments; and•pressure sensitive adhesives and components for telecommunications, electronics, medical and transportation applications.This segment primarily serves the general industrial market, which includes industrial capital goods, energy, and other general industrial markets, electronics, automotive original equipment manufacturers and tiers, and consumer durables markets.14The results of operations for the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment for the first quarter of 2014 and 2013 were as follows:In the first quarter of 2014, the changes in operating revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: Three Months Ended March 31 % Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % Point          Increase (Decrease) Operating Revenues Operating Income Operating MarginsBase business (organic):     Revenue change/Operating leverage(0.4)% (1.3)% (0.1)%Changes in variable margins & overhead costs— % (0.3)% (0.1)% (0.4)% (1.6)% (0.2)%Acquisitions— % — % — %Divestitures(0.1)% 0.4 % 0.1 %Restructuring costs— % (6.1)% (0.8)%Impairment of goodwill & intangibles— % — % — %Translation0.4 % 0.6 % 0.1 %Total(0.1)% (6.7)% (0.8)%Operating Revenues Operating revenues were essentially flat in the first quarter of 2014 versus 2013 as a slight decline in organic revenues was offset by the favorable effect of currency translation. Organic revenues for the worldwide test and measurement businesses decreased 1.0% primarily due to softness in industrial capital spending and order timing. Worldwide electronics organic revenues increased 0.4% primarily due to a 3.8% increase in the other electronics businesses, which include the contamination control and pressure sensitive adhesive businesses, resulting primarily from increased demand in China and Europe. Organic revenues for the electronic assembly businesses declined 7.2% primarily due to weak end market demand. Operating IncomeOperating income decreased 6.7% in the first quarter of 2014 versus 2013 primarily due to higher restructuring expenses and lower organic revenues, partially offset by the favorable effect of currency translation. Total base operating margins decreased 20 basis points due to lower organic revenues and changes in variable margins and overhead costs.

Refer to the Debt note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for further information regarding the notes issued in February 2014.OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)Other income (expense) was income of $9 million in the first quarter of 2014 versus income of $47 million in the first quarter of 2013. This decrease was primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $30 million in the first quarter of 2013 related to the acquisition of the controlling interest in an existing equity investment. Refer to the Gain on Acquisition of Controlling Interest in Equity Investment note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for further details regarding the gain related to the acquired controlling interest. INCOME TAXESThe effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2014 increased slightly to 30.0% versus 29.0% in the first quarter of 2013.FOREIGN CURRENCYFor the first quarter of 2014 the impact of foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar decreased operating revenues by approximately $17 million (approximately 40 basis points) and decreased income from continuing operations by approximately $2 million ($0.01 per diluted share) versus the first quarter of 2013. INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSIncome (loss) from discontinued operations was income of $45 million in the first quarter of 2014 versus a loss of $47 million in the first quarter of 2013. The loss in the first quarter of 2013 included a $42 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in connection with the anticipated sale of one of the transportation related businesses and loss reserves on assets held for sale of $60 million. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 1 – Financial Statements for further details regarding the Company’s discontinued operations.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIn March 2013, new accounting guidance was issued which clarifies that an entity should release cumulative translation adjustments into net income when the entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business within a foreign entity, which is consistent with the Company's prior accounting policy. The new guidance became effective for the Company on January 1, 2014 and did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.In April 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for reporting discontinued operations. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in a company's operations and financial results should be reported as discontinued operations, with expanded disclosures. In addition, disclosure of the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of an organization that does not qualify as a discontinued operation is required. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2015. The guidance applies prospectively to new disposals and new classifications of disposal groups held for sale after the effective date. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, the guidance will have upon adoption.22LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe Company’s primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and short-term credit facilities. In addition, the Company had $3.5 billion of cash on hand at March 31, 2014 and also maintains strong access to public debt markets. Management believes that these sources are sufficient to service debt and to finance the Company's capital allocation priorities, which include:•investment in existing businesses to fund internal growth;•payment of an attractive dividend to shareholders;•share repurchases; and•acquisitions.In September 2013, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the Industrial Packaging segment. The Company classified the Industrial Packaging segment as held for sale in the third quarter of 2013 and is no longer presenting this segment as part of its continuing operations. As to the impact of this divestiture on the Company’s income per share from continuing operations and capital structure going forward, the Company also indicated that it intends to repurchase approximately 50 million shares through a program utilizing its existing share repurchase authorization to offset the full amount of divestiture-related dilution of income per share from continuing operations through a combination of sale proceeds, free operating cash flow and additional leverage. As a result, the Company repurchased approximately 14.0 million shares of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2013 and approximately 18.5 million additional shares of its common stock in the first quarter of 2014. The Company expects to substantially complete this program by the end of the second quarter of 2014.On February 6, 2014, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell the Industrial Packaging segment to The Carlyle Group for $3.2 billion. The transaction was completed on May 1, 2014.The Company believes that, based on its revenues, operating margins, current free operating cash flow, and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary.Cash FlowThe Company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.Summarized cash flow information for the first quarter of 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Three Months Ended(In millions)March 31, 2014 2013Net cash provided by operating activities$314 $366Additions to plant and equipment(68) (89)Free operating cash flow$246 $277    Cash dividends paid$(181) $—Acquisition of businesses (excluding cash and equivalents) and additional interest in affiliates(2) (56)Repurchases of common stock(1,440) (344)Net proceeds from (repayments of) debt1,266 (4)Other30 54Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and equivalents10 (44)Net increase (decrease) in cash and equivalents$(71) $(117)23On May 6, 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to $4.0 billion of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2011 Program”). In the first quarter of 2013, the Company repurchased approximately 5.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $62.86 under the 2011 Program.  The 2011 Program was fully utilized in the fourth quarter of 2013. On August 2, 2013, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to an additional $6.0 billion of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2013 Program”). In the first quarter of 2014, the Company repurchased approximately 18.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $80.94 under the 2013 Program. As of March 31, 2014, there was $4.2 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2013 Program.Adjusted Return on Average Invested CapitalThe Company uses adjusted return on average invested capital (“adjusted ROIC”) to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. Adjusted ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations, as well as the Company's net investment in the former Industrial Packaging segment and the equity investment in the Wilsonart business (formerly Decorative Surfaces). Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. For the first quarter of 2014 and 2013, adjusted ROIC was as follows:The annualized adjusted ROIC increase of 240 basis points for the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013 was primarily the result of an improvement in after-tax operating income of 13.9% and a 1.9% decrease in adjusted average invested capital.24Working CapitalManagement uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the Company. Net working capital as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 is summarized as follows:The increase in net working capital as of March 31, 2014 is primarily due to lower short-term debt resulting from $702 million net repayments of commercial paper funded through the first quarter debt offering.Cash and equivalents totaled approximately $3.5 billion as of March 31, 2014 and $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2013, primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries and may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the U.S. Cash balances held internationally are typically used for international operating needs, reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses, or used to fund new international acquisitions. In the U.S., the Company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs which primarily consist of dividend payments, share repurchases, acquisitions, servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs. The Company also uses its commercial paper program, which is backed by short-term and long-term credit facilities, for short-term liquidity needs. The Company believes cash generated domestically and liquidity provided by the Company's commercial paper program will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the U.S.DebtTotal debt and total debt to capitalization as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were as follows:The Company had outstanding commercial paper of $950 million as of March 31, 2014 and $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2013, which was included in short-term debt. Short-term debt also included $800 million of 5.15% redeemable notes due April 1, 2014, which were repaid on the due date, and €750 million ($1.0 billion) of 5.25% Euro notes due October 1, 2014.On January 22, 2014, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion short-term line of credit agreement with a term of up to 364 days to provide additional liquidity under the Company's commercial paper program in order to fund short-term capital allocation needs. No amount was outstanding under this facility at March 31, 2014.25In February 2014, the Company issued $650 million of 0.9% notes due February 25, 2017, $650 million of 1.95% notes due March 1, 2019, and $700 million of 3.5% notes due March 1, 2024. Proceeds from the February 2014 debt issuances were used to repay commercial paper.Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDAThe Company uses the ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. The Company believes that total debt to adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA and the ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. The ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA represents total debt divided by income from continuing operations before interest expense, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis.Total debt to adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve month periods ended March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was as follows:Stockholders’ EquityThe changes to stockholders’ equity during 2014 were as follows:(In millions) Total stockholders’ equity, December 31, 2013$9,709Net income473Cash dividends declared(174)Repurchases of common stock(1,500)Stock option and restricted stock activity34Foreign currency translation adjustments28Other10Total stockholders’ equity, March 31, 2014$8,58026FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
