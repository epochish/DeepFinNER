In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in the Company’s 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform with current year reporting.(2)    Discontinued OperationsThe Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term objectives. As a result, the Company may commit to a plan to exit or dispose of certain businesses and present them as discontinued operations. The following summarizes the Company’s discontinued operations.Third Quarter 2013 Discontinued Operations - In the third quarter of 2013, the Company committed to a plan to sell the Industrial Packaging business and began classifying this business as held for sale. The Industrial Packaging business was sold in the second quarter of 2014.In the third quarter of 2013, the Company also committed to a plan for the divestiture of a construction business previously included in the Construction Products segment. This business was classified as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013 and was sold in the second quarter of 2014.First Quarter 2013 Discontinued Operations - In the first quarter of 2013, the Company committed to a plan for the divestiture of a construction distribution business previously included in the Construction Products segment. This business was classified as held for sale beginning in the first quarter of 2013 and was sold in the second quarter of 2014.As of the second quarter of 2014, the Company had completed the divestiture of all of the businesses previously reported as discontinued operations.Results of the discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 were as follows:In millionsThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 September 30, 2014Operating revenue$— $798    Income before income taxes$10 $1,806Income tax expense14 (739)Income from discontinued operations$24 $1,067        Income before income taxes from discontinued operations was income of $1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The income in the first nine months of 2014 included the pre-tax gain of $1.7 billion ($1.1 billion after tax) on the sale of the Industrial Packaging business recorded in the second quarter of 2014. Income tax expense in the first nine months of 2014 included $175 million of U.S. income tax expense related to the repatriation of approximately $1.3 billion of international proceeds from the sale of the Industrial Packaging business. In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for reporting discontinued operations. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in a company's operations and financial results should be reported as discontinued operations, with expanded disclosures. In addition, disclosure of the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of an organization that does not qualify as a discontinued operation is required. The Company adopted this new guidance effective January 1, 2015. The new guidance applies prospectively to new disposals and new classifications of disposal groups held for sale after such date. As a result, this guidance did not have any impact on the Company's financial statements or related disclosures upon adoption. 7(3)    Income TaxesThe Company files tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions including the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, German Fiscal Authority, French Fiscal Authority, and Australian Tax Office, and a number of these audits are currently ongoing, which may increase the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits in future periods. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the amount of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits may be decreased by approximately $68 million related predominantly to various intercompany transactions. The Company has recorded its best estimate of the potential exposure for these issues.On February 18, 2014, the Company received a Notice of Deficiency (“NOD”) from the IRS asserting that a non-taxable return of capital received from a subsidiary was a taxable dividend distribution. The NOD assesses additional taxes of $70 million for the 2006 tax year, plus interest and penalties. In May 2014, the Company petitioned the United States Tax Court to challenge the NOD. The Company's petition was subsequently denied and the case will proceed to court. Although the outcome of this process cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes it will be successful in defending its positions. Accordingly, no reserve has been recorded related to this matter.(4)    InventoriesInventories as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were as follows: (5)    Goodwill and Intangible AssetsGoodwill represents the excess cost over fair value of the net assets of purchased businesses. The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. The Company performs an impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, or more frequently if triggering events occur, based on the estimated fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company evaluates the goodwill assigned to each of its reporting units for potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the relevant reporting unit to the carrying value. The Company uses various Level 2 and Level 3 valuation techniques to determine the fair value of its reporting units, including discounting estimated future cash flows based on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant reporting unit and market multiples of relevant public companies. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill.The Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trademarks and brands. The estimated fair values of these intangible assets are determined based on a Level 3 valuation method using a relief-of-royalty income approach derived from internally forecasted revenues of the related products. If the fair value of the trademark or brand is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the intangible asset. The Company performed its annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter of 2015 and 2014, which resulted in no goodwill impairment charges and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $2 million and $3 million, respectively. The charge in the third quarter of 2015 related to a brand in the Polymers & Fluids segment. The charges in the third quarter of 2014 related to certain brands in the Polymers & Fluids and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments. 8A summary of indefinite-lived intangible assets that were adjusted to fair value and the related impairment charges included in the statement of income in the third quarter of 2015 and 2014 was as follows:(6)    Pension and Other Postretirement BenefitsPension and other postretirement benefit costs related to both continuing and discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, were as follows:The Company recognized a $9 million curtailment gain on the U.S. primary postretirement plan in the second quarter of 2014 related to the Company's sale of the Industrial Packaging business. This curtailment charge was included in Income from Discontinued Operations.The Company expects to contribute approximately $100 million to its pension plans and $5 million to its other postretirement plans in 2015. As of September 30, 2015, contributions of $93 million to pension plans and $4 million to other postretirement plans have been made.(7)    DebtShort-term debt as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 included commercial paper of $784 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. In May 2015, the Company issued €500 million of 1.25% Euro notes due May 22, 2023 at 99.239% of face value and €500 million of 2.125% Euro notes due May 22, 2030 at 99.303% of face value. Net proceeds from the May 2015 debt issuances were used to repay commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. The Company designated the €1.0 billion of Euro notes as a hedge of a portion of its net investment in Euro-denominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations. Changes in the value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate have been recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other 9comprehensive income (loss). Refer to the Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) note for additional information regarding the net investment hedge.  The approximate fair value and related carrying value of the Company's total long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt presented as short-term debt, as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were as follows: The approximate fair values of the Company's long-term debt, including current maturities, were based on a Level 2 valuation model, using observable inputs which included market rates for comparable instruments for the respective periods.(8)    Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)The following table summarizes changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014: Three Months Ended Nine Months EndedIn millionsSeptember 30, September 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014Beginning balance$(1,046) $359 $(658) $384        Foreign currency translation adjustments during the period(337) (514) (711) (404)Foreign currency translation adjustments reclassified to income— (1) — (133)Income taxes2 — (32) —Total foreign currency translation adjustments(335) (515) (743) (537)        Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments during the period1 (2) (1) (43)Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income15 13 45 42Income taxes(5) (3) (13) 6Total pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments11 8 31 5        Ending balance$(1,370) $(148) $(1,370) $(148)Foreign currency translation adjustments reclassified to income are primarily related to the disposal of certain discontinued operations. Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income primarily relate to the amortization of actuarial (gain) loss and prior service cost, and recognition of deferred actuarial losses related to plan settlements in net periodic benefit cost. In the second quarter of 2014, $6 million of deferred actuarial losses were reclassified to income related to the disposal of certain discontinued operations. Refer to the Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits and the Discontinued Operations notes for additional information. The Company designated the €1.0 billion of Euro notes issued in May 2015 and the €1.0 billion of Euro notes issued in May 2014 as hedges of a portion of its net investment in Euro-denominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations. The carrying values of the Euro notes were $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2015. Changes in the value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate have been recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The unrealized gain recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the net investment hedge was $244 million and $158 million as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.10The ending balance of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of September 30, 2015 and 2014 consisted of cumulative translation adjustment expense of $1.0 billion and income of $137 million, respectively, and unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefits costs, net of tax, of $362 million and $285 million, respectively.(9)    Segment InformationThe Company has seven reportable segments: Automotive OEM; Test & Measurement and Electronics; Food Equipment; Polymers & Fluids; Welding; Construction Products; and Specialty Products. See Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information regarding operating revenue and operating income for the Company's segments.11Item 2 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsINTRODUCTIONFounded in 1912, ITW is a multi-industry company with a strong portfolio of global industrial businesses including Automotive OEM, Test & Measurement and Electronics, Food Equipment, Polymers & Fluids, Welding, Construction Products and Specialty Products. The core source of value creation and competitive advantage is the ITW Business Model, consisting of the 80/20 business process, a customer-back approach to innovation and a decentralized entrepreneurial culture. Each ITW business leverages the ITW Business Model to deliver best-in-class financial performance. The Company has approximately 49,000 employees and operations in 57 countries.THE ITW BUSINESS MODELThe Company is built around a powerful and highly differentiated business model that comprises three elements:80/20 Business Process - ITW's proprietary 80/20 business process focuses on what is most important (the 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value) in order to spend less time and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value), resulting in improved financial performance. The Company uses this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key drivers of business profitability, and as a result, reduces complexity that creates unnecessary expense and disguises what is truly important. The Company utilizes the 80/20 process in all aspects of its business. Common applications of the 80/20 business process include:•Simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products offered by combining the features of similar products, outsourcing products or eliminating low-value products.•Segmenting the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers separately and finding alternative ways to serve the 20/80 customers.•Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.•Designing business processes, systems and measurements around the 80/20 activities.Over the past three decades, the result of the application of the 80/20 business process is that the Company has improved its long-term operating and financial performance and believes that there is considerable future opportunity from the continuous disciplined application of 80/20. These 80/20 efforts can result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns. Customer-Back Innovation - ITW’s customer-back approach to innovation builds on the Company’s 80/20 business process to help ITW businesses focus on the most profitable customers and invent solutions to solve their specific problems. ITW businesses are focused on building relationships with these major customers to develop deep knowledge and insight around their needs. These customer insights and learnings drive innovation at ITW and have contributed to a portfolio of approximately 16,000 granted and pending patents. Decentralized Entrepreneurial Culture - At the core of ITW's culture is a desire to keep decision making and management responsibility close to customers in order to best meet their needs while rapidly adapting to changes in end markets. ITW businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the ITW Business Model to customize their approach in order to best serve their customers. This leads to a focused and simple organizational structure that, combined with outstanding execution, delivers operational excellence adapted to their customers and end markets.ENTERPRISE STRATEGYIn 2012, the Company embarked on a five-year Enterprise Strategy with the objective of positioning the Company to generate the maximum yield from the compelling performance potential that resides within the ITW Business Model. By doing so, the Company expects to generate solid growth with best-in-class margins and after-tax return on invested capital for the Company and sustainable long-term value creation for shareholders. With this objective in mind, the Company is committed to achieving the following performance goals by the end of 2017:•Organic Growth:            200 basis points above global GDP•Operating Margin:        Approximately 23 percent•After-Tax ROIC:            20+ percent•Free Cash Flow:            100 percent of net income12The Company has made significant progress toward these goals. The Enterprise Initiatives have helped build a foundation from which the Company is pivoting to a heightened focus on organic revenue growth. Since 2012, the Company has seen both operating margins and after-tax ROIC increase by more than 500 basis points, with operating margin of 22.7 percent and after-tax ROIC of 21.5 percent in the third quarter of 2015. KEY INITIATIVESIn conjunction with the Enterprise Strategy, the Company is in the process of implementing three key initiatives - portfolio management, business structure simplification, and strategic sourcing. These enterprise initiatives are expected to enhance the business through 2017 and are targeted at expanding organic revenue growth and improving profitability and returns to position ITW to deliver 12 to 14 percent annualized total shareholder return over the long-term, assuming global GDP of 3 percent.Portfolio Management - The Company's portfolio management initiative aims to reposition the business portfolio to fully leverage the ITW Business Model. This initiative began with the divestiture of over 30 businesses that did not have the attributes necessary to fully leverage the ITW Business Model. As a result, the Company's divestiture activity increased in 2012, 2013 and 2014. With the sale of the Company's former Industrial Packaging segment on May 1, 2014, the divestiture element of the Company's portfolio management initiative is essentially complete. The Company has historically acquired businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms. Going forward, the Company will emphasize organic growth, while acquisitions will be targeted to bolt-on acquisitions that support and accelerate organic growth in existing segments, and new platforms that expand the Company’s long-term growth and earnings potential. The focus of the portfolio repositioning efforts has now shifted from divestitures to significant efforts inside the Company's businesses to exit slower-growth product lines so that they can concentrate their efforts and resources on taking full advantage of their most compelling organic growth opportunities. Product line simplification (PLS) focuses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines. In the short-term, PLS may result in a decrease in revenue and overhead costs while improving operating margin. Over the long-term, product line simplification is expected to result in growth in revenue, profitability and returns. PLS activities have resulted in approximately 100 basis points of organic revenue headwind in 2014 and 2015, as the Company strategically exits certain products and customer relationships. The impact of PLS is expected to moderate beginning in 2016.Business Structure Simplification - The business structure simplification initiative simplifies the Company's organizational model and adds scale to the Company's operating divisions in order to fully leverage 80/20, increase organic revenue growth, enhance global competitiveness and drive operational efficiencies. This initiative focuses on consolidating the Company's operating structure from over 800 regional businesses into approximately 90 global divisions while retaining the positive attributes of a decentralized operating model. The Company expects to enhance its profitability and returns through a combination of applying its 80/20 business process to the new divisions, more focused growth investments and reduced infrastructure.Strategic Sourcing - The Company's strategic sourcing initiative focuses on building sourcing capability in order to leverage purchasing scale to enhance profitability and global competitiveness. It incorporates both enterprise-level and segment-level purchasing that cross the Company's many businesses. The target is to reduce global spend by an average of one percent per year for the five-year period from 2013-2017. The Company has exceeded its annual targets in each of the past two years.TERMS USED BY ITWManagement uses the following terms to describe the financial results of operations of the Company:•Organic business - acquired businesses that have been included in the Company's results of operations for more than 12 months on a constant currency basis.•Operating leverage - the estimated effect of the organic revenue volume changes on organic operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period.•Changes in variable margins and overhead costs - represent the estimated effect of non-volume related changes in the operating income of organic businesses and may be driven by a number of factors, including changes in product mix, the cost of raw materials, labor and overhead, and pricing to customers.13•Price/cost - represents the estimated net impact of increases or decreases in the cost of materials used in the Company's products versus changes in the selling price to the Company's customers. Price/cost is a component of changes in variable margins and overhead costs.•Product line simplification (PLS) - focuses businesses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines; in the short-term, PLS may result in a decrease in revenue and overhead costs while improving operating margin. In the long-term, PLS is expected to result in growth in revenue, profitability, and returns. Unless otherwise stated, the changes in financial results in the consolidated results of operations and the results of operations by segment represent the current year period versus the comparable period in the prior year. The discussion of operating results should be read in conjunction with Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSIn the third quarter and year-to-date periods, the Company delivered solid financial results primarily attributable to the continued successful execution of enterprise initiatives despite a challenging combination of foreign currency translation headwinds and decelerating end market conditions.The Company’s consolidated results of operations for the third quarter and year-to-date periods were as follows:•Organic revenue decreased 1.7% and 0.3% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively. ◦Automotive OEM, Food Equipment and Construction Products had solid worldwide organic revenue growth  primarily due to product innovation, penetration gains and higher market demand. Organic revenue declined in the Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments primarily as a result of the impact of a challenging capital spending environment and lower demand in the oil and gas end markets. ◦PLS activities associated with the portfolio management component of the Company's Enterprise Strategy reduced organic revenue growth by approximately one percentage point in both the third quarter and year-to-date periods.◦North American organic revenue decreased 1.5% and 0.1% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, as a decline in the Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments was offset by growth in the Automotive OEM, Food Equipment and Construction Products segments. ◦Europe, Middle East and Africa organic revenue decreased 0.7% in the third quarter and increased 0.9% in the year-to-date period. In both periods, a decline in the Polymers & Fluids, Test & Measurement and Electronics, Welding and Specialty Products segments was offset by double-digit growth in the Automotive OEM segment. ◦Asia Pacific organic revenue decreased 4.1% and 1.9% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, primarily due to a decline in the Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments, partially offset by growth in the Construction Products segment.  14•Operating revenue decreased in the third quarter and year-to-date periods primarily due to the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most major currencies. In the year-to-date period, operating revenue declined $850 million while operating income was essentially flat.•Operating margin of 22.7% and 21.6% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods increased 180 and 150 basis points, respectively, versus the prior year. The primary driver of the operating margin improvement was the benefit of the Company's enterprise initiatives related to strategic sourcing and business structure simplification that contributed 110 basis points in each respective period. Lower restructuring expenses contributed 70 and 20 basis points of margin expansion in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively. Favorable price/cost of 20 basis points in both comparable periods was offset by negative operating leverage of 40 and 20 basis points in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively. •Diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of $1.39 for the third quarter increased 8.6%. The unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation decreased third quarter EPS by approximately $0.12 per diluted share, or 9%. In the year-to-date period, EPS from continuing operations of $3.90 increased 11.7%. The unfavorable effect of currency translation decreased year-to-date EPS by approximately $0.33 per diluted share, or 10%.•The Company repurchased approximately 2.6 million and 21.0 million shares of its common stock in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, for approximately $216 million and $2.0 billion, respectively. •Free cash flow was $644 million, or 126% of net income, for the third quarter.

Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for discussion of the Company's discontinued operations.22NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for revenue recognition. The core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, several new revenue recognition disclosures will be required. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact the guidance will have upon adoption.In April 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to simplify the balance sheet presentation of debt issuance costs. Under the new guidance, debt issuance costs will be presented as a reduction of the carrying amount of the debt liability. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016 and will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. As of September 30, 2015, the Company had $43 million of deferred debt issuance costs. The Company does not expect adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe Company’s primary sources of liquidity are free cash flows and short-term credit facilities. In addition, the Company had $3.0 billion of cash on hand at September 30, 2015 and also maintains strong access to public debt markets. Management believes that these sources are sufficient to service debt and to finance the Company's capital allocation priorities, which include:•investment in existing businesses to fund internal growth;•payment of an attractive dividend to shareholders;•share repurchases; and•acquisitions.The Company believes that, based on its revenues, operating margin, current free cash flow, and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary.Cash FlowThe Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.23Summarized cash flow information for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2015 and 2014 was as follows:Stock Repurchase ProgramsOn August 2, 2013, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provided for the buyback of up to $6.0 billion of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2013 Program”). Under the 2013 Program, the Company repurchased approximately 18.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $80.94 in the first quarter of 2014, approximately 17.2 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $86.01 in the second quarter of 2014, approximately 5.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $85.35 in the third quarter of 2014, approximately 8.9 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $90.81 in the fourth quarter of 2014, and approximately 14.9 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $96.84 in the first quarter of 2015. The 2013 Program was completed in the first quarter of 2015.On February 13, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to $6.0 billion of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2015 Program”). Under the 2015 Program, the Company repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $97.19 in the first quarter of 2015, approximately 1.9 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $97.19 in the second quarter of 2015, and approximately 2.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $84.45 in the third quarter of 2015. As of September 30, 2015, there were approximately $5.4 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2015 Program.Adjusted Return on Average Invested CapitalThe Company uses adjusted return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. Adjusted ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations, as well as the Company's net investment in the former Industrial Packaging segment and the equity investment in the Wilsonart business (formerly the Decorative Surfaces segment). Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter.24Adjusted ROIC for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2015 and 2014 was as follows:The annualized adjusted ROIC increase of 140 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of a 7.3% decrease in adjusted average invested capital. Additionally, the annualized adjusted ROIC increase of 140 basis points for the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of a 7.9% decrease in adjusted average invested capital. Working CapitalManagement uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the Company. Net working capital as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 is summarized as follows:The decrease in net working capital as of September 30, 2015 was primarily driven by lower cash and equivalents, which were used to fund share repurchases and lower short-term debt resulting from repayments of commercial paper.25Cash and equivalents totaled approximately $3.0 billion as of September 30, 2015 and $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2014, primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries. The reduction in cash on hand was primarily driven by the share repurchases discussed above. Cash and cash equivalents held internationally may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the U.S. Cash balances held internationally are typically used for international operating needs, reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses, used to fund new international acquisitions, or used to repay debt held internationally. In the U.S., the Company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs, which primarily consist of dividend payments, share repurchases, acquisitions, servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs. The Company also uses its commercial paper program, which is backed by long-term credit facilities, for short-term liquidity needs. The Company believes cash generated domestically and liquidity provided by the Company's commercial paper program will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the U.S.DebtTotal debt as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was as follows:Short-term debt as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 included commercial paper of $784 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. In May 2015, the Company issued €500 million of 1.25% Euro notes due May 22, 2023 at 99.239% of face value and €500 million of 2.125% Euro notes due May 22, 2030 at 99.303% of face value. Net proceeds from the May 2015 debt issuances were used to repay commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. Total Debt to EBITDAThe Company uses the ratio of total debt to EBITDA to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. The Company believes that total debt to EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to EBITDA. EBITDA and the ratio of total debt to EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. The ratio of total debt to EBITDA represents total debt divided by income from continuing operations before interest expense, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis.Total debt to EBITDA for the trailing twelve month periods ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was as follows:26Stockholders’ EquityThe changes to stockholders’ equity during 2015 were as follows:In millions   Total stockholders’ equity, December 31, 2014$6,824Net income1,449Cash dividends declared(556)Repurchases of common stock(2,002)Stock option and restricted stock activity88Foreign currency translation adjustments, net of tax(743)Other30Total stockholders’ equity, September 30, 2015$5,090FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
