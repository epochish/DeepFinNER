The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. In the first quarter of each year, the Company performs an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives based on the fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset.   As of January 1, 2006, the Company had assigned its recorded goodwill and intangible assets to approximately 375 of its 700 reporting units. When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Fair values are determined by discounting estimated future cash flows at the Companys estimated cost of capital of 10%. Estimated future cash flows are based either on current operating cash flows or on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant operating unit. If the fair value of an operating unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value of the units goodwill and the carrying value of the goodwill.     Amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for the periods ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:   (In thousands)            Three Months Ended March 31                 2006       2005         Goodwill:                                 Impairment       $   9,200       $   6,206         Intangible Assets:                                 Amortization           23,788           14,735         Impairment           2,985           5,049         Total       $   35,973       $   25,990         In the first quarter of 2006, the Company performed its annual impairment testing of its goodwill and intangible assets, which resulted in impairment charges of $12,185,000. The first quarter 2006 goodwill impairment charges of $9,200,000 were primarily related to a U.S. joist business, a U.S. heat transfer business and an Asian construction business and resulted from lower estimated future cash flows than previously expected. Also in the first quarter of 2006, intangible asset impairments of $2,985,000 were recorded to reduce to the estimated fair value the carrying value of trademarks, patents and customer-related intangible assets primarily related to a U.S. welding components business in the Specialty Systems  North America segment and a U.S. contamination control business in the Engineered Products  North America segment.   In the first quarter of 2005, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $6,206,000, which were primarily related to a Canadian stretch packaging equipment business and a U.S. welding components business, and which resulted from lower estimated future cash flows than previously expected. Also in the first quarter of 2005, intangible asset impairments of $5,049,000 were recorded to reduce to estimated fair value the carrying value of trademarks, patents and customer-related intangible assets related to a U.S. business that manufactures clean room mats in the Engineered Products  North America segment.

As of March 31, 2006, contributions of $6,195,000 have been made.      (6)   SHORT-TERM DEBT     The Company had outstanding commercial paper of $56,485,000 at March 31, 2006 and $94,488,000 at December 31, 2005.      (7)   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES     The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including those involving environmental, tax, product liability (including toxic tort) and general liability claims. The Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are based  on developments to date, the Companys estimates of the outcomes of these matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling other similar matters. The Company believes resolution of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, liquidity or future operations.    Among the toxic tort cases in which the Company is a defendant, the Company as well as its subsidiaries Hobart Brothers Company and Miller Electric Mfg. Co., have been named, along with numerous other defendants, in lawsuits alleging injury from exposure to welding consumables. The plaintiffs in these suits claim unspecified damages for injuries resulting from the plaintiffs alleged exposure to asbestos, manganese and/or toxic fumes in connection with the welding process. Based upon the Companys experience in defending these claims, the Company believes that the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, liquidity or future operations. The Company has not recorded any significant reserves related to these cases.   Wilsonart International, Inc. (Wilsonart), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in a consolidated class action lawsuit filed in 2000 in U.S. federal district court in White Plains, New York on behalf of purchasers of high-pressure laminate. The complaint alleges that Wilsonart participated in a conspiracy with competitors to fix, raise, maintain or stabilize prices for high-pressure laminate between 1994 and 2000 and seeks injunctive relief and treble damages. Indirect purchasers of high-pressure laminate filed similar purported class action cases under various state antitrust and consumer protection statutes in 13 states and the District of Columbia, all of which cases have been stayed pending the outcome of the consolidated class action. These lawsuits were brought following the commencement of a federal grand jury investigation into price-fixing in the high-pressure laminate industry, which investigation was subsequently closed by the Department of Justice with no further proceedings and with all documents being returned to the parties. Plaintiffs are seeking damages of $470,000,000 before trebling. Without admitting liability, Wilsonarts co-defendants, International Paper Company and Panolam International, Inc. have settled the federal consolidated class action case for $31,000,000 and $9,500,000, respectively. The plaintiffs claims against Formica Corporation, the remaining co-defendant in the case, were dismissed with prejudice on September 27, 2004 as a result of its bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, Wilsonart is the sole remaining defendant in the consolidated class action lawsuit. The trial in this matter began on April 10, 2006. While no assurances can be given regarding the ultimate outcome or the timing of the resolution of these claims, the Company believes that the plaintiffs claims are without merit and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in this action and all related actions that are now pending or that may be brought in the future. The Company has not recorded any reserves related to this case.      (8)   SEGMENT INFORMATION     See Managements Discussion and Analysis for information regarding operating revenues and operating income for the Companys segments.   In the first quarter of 2006, the Company announced that given the planned run-off of assets in the Leasing and Investments portfolio and its desire to utilize free cash flow for core manufacturing investments and acquisitions rather than to make additional financial investments, its internal reporting has been revised to eliminate the reporting of Leasing and Investments as an operating segment. Accordingly, income from Leasing and Investment activities will be reported as non-operating investment income. Leasing and Investments results have been reclassified to investment income in the prior years income statement to conform to the current years presentation, as follows:              Three Months Ended               Three Months Ended                 March 31, 2005               March 31, 2005                 as Previously Reported       2006 Reclassification       as Currently Reported         Operating Revenues       $   3,074,291       $   (22,410   )   $   3,051,881         Cost of revenues           2,022,337           (3,312   )       2,019,025         Selling, administrative, and research & development expense           548,075           59           548,134         Amortization and impairment of goodwill & intangibles           25,990                      25,990         Operating Income       $   477,889       $   (19,157   )   $   458,732         Interest expense           (18,727   )       (1,528   )       (20,255   )     Investment income                      20,901           20,901         Other income (expense)           3,444           (216   )       3,228         Income Before Income Taxes       $   462,606       $          $   462,606              Item 2 - Managements Discussion and Analysis   CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   The Companys consolidated results of operations for the first quarter and year-to-date periods of 2006 and 2005 were as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)    In the first quarter of 2006, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:              Three Months Ended March 31             % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)                 Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins         Base manufacturing business:                                 Revenue change/Operating leverage       6.1   %   16.2   %   1.4   %     Changes in variable margins and overhead costs              2.2       0.3         Total       6.1       18.4       1.7                                           Acquisitions and divestitures       5.3       1.9       (0.5   )     Restructuring costs              (0.4   )            Impairment of goodwill and intangibles              (0.2   )            Translation       (2.6   )   (2.0   )   0.1         Intercompany       (0.8   )          0.1         Total       8.0   %   17.7   %   1.4   %     In the first quarter of 2006 base business revenues increased 8.1% and 2.4% versus the prior year period in North America and internationally, respectively. The growth in North American revenues was primarily due to growth in industrial production and increased demand in the capital equipment markets that ITW serves. Slow economic growth in Europe continued to hamper international revenue growth.   Operating income for the first quarter of 2006 improved due to leverage from the growth in base business revenue and income from acquired companies. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, increased restructuring expenses and higher impairment charges. Variable margins improved 110 basis points mainly due to sales volume increases, operating efficiency gains and sales price increases in excess of raw material cost increases. Income was favorably impacted by a first quarter 2005 charge of $8.7 million to resolve accounting issues at a European food equipment business. In addition, consolidated operating income in the first quarter of 2006 was negatively impacted by a $19.7 million charge related to retiree health care and life insurance liabilities.   As a result of the Companys annual impairment testing of its goodwill and intangible assets, impairment charges of $12.2 million were incurred in the first quarter of 2006. The impaired assets reflected diminished expectations of future cash flows and primarily related to a U.S. joist business, a U.S. welding components business, a U.S. heat transfer business, an Asian construction business and a contamination control business.

The acquired revenue growth was primarily related to the acquisition of a construction business, an automotive business, a finishing materials business, a machined components business and four polymers businesses. Construction base revenues increased 8.2%, primarily as a result of growth in the commercial and residential construction markets and new product introductions at the Wilsonart business. Automotive base revenues increased 1.6% for the first quarter as a result of a 2% increase in automotive production at the North American Big 3 automotive manufacturers. Base revenues from the other industrial-based businesses in this segment grew 8.2% for the first quarter as a result of increased demand in a broad array of end markets.   Operating income increased significantly in the first quarter of 2006 primarily due to leverage from the growth in base business revenues described above, increased acquisition income and lower restructuring expenses. In addition, variable margins increased 120 basis points in the first quarter of 2006 as selling price increases fully recovered raw material cost increases and operating costs were lower due to efficiencies. First quarter 2006 income was unfavorably impacted by higher goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. In the first quarter of 2006, an impairment charge of $5.6 million was recorded primarily related to the goodwill of a U.S. joist business and the intangibles of a contamination control business. In addition, income was negatively impacted by a first quarter of 2006 charge of $9.8 million related to retiree healthcare and life insurance liabilities.

Offsetting this revenue decline was an increase in base and acquired revenue. The acquired revenue increase is primarily due to the acquisition of a European construction business, a European reclosable packaging business, and a European polymers business. Base business construction revenue declined 1.4% due to weakness in the European, Australasia and China markets. Automotive base revenues increased 3.1% primarily due to higher production levels at many European automotive manufacturers. Base revenues from the other businesses in this segment increased 1.5% for the first quarter of 2006 as they benefited from increased demand in a broad array of industrial and commercial end markets that they serve.   Operating income for the first quarter of 2006 decreased primarily due to the unfavorable effect of currency translation and increased restructuring expense. The positive leverage effect from the increase in base revenue was partially offset by higher overhead costs. In addition, income was negatively affected by a $1.7 million impairment charge related to two Asian construction businesses.

Industrial packaging base revenues grew 6.0%, primarily due to increased demand for machinery. Food equipment base revenues increased 5.5% resulting from increased demand from restaurant and institutional customers. Base revenues in the other businesses in this segment, including the marking, decorating and finishing businesses, increased 3.8% in the first quarter. The acquired revenue increase was primarily due to the acquisition of a materials and structural testing business in the fourth quarter of 2005 and a coding business in the first quarter of 2006.   Operating income increased in the first quarter of 2006 primarily due to leverage from base business revenue increases described above. In addition, variable margins improved by 120 basis points mainly due to sales volume increases and operating efficiency gains. Base business income was also higher due to lower goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges over the prior year. In the first quarter of 2006, a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $4.7 million was recorded related to the goodwill of a heat transfer business and the goodwill and intangibles of a welding components business. In the first quarter of 2005 an impairment charge of $6.1 million was incurred related to a stretch packaging business and welding components business. Operating income was adversely affected by increased restructuring expenses in the decorating businesses and food equipment businesses. In addition, operating income was unfavorably impacted by a first quarter 2006 charge of $9.8 million related to retiree healthcare and life insurance liabilities.

Base revenues also contributed to top-line growth. Food equipment base revenues increased 2.9% in the first quarter, while industrial packaging base revenues increased 2.6%. Other base business revenues, including the welding and finishing businesses, increased 9.1% led by strong welding consumable sales in Asia. The contribution from acquired revenues was primarily related to the acquisitions of a materials and structural testing business, a decorating business, an aircraft ground power business and a European welding components business.   Operating income increased in the first quarter of 2006 primarily as a result of the revenue increases described above and reduced operating costs. In addition, operating income was favorably impacted by lower restructuring expenses and income from acquisitions. Income was also positively affected by a nonrecurring first quarter 2005 charge of $8.7 million to resolve accounting issues at a European food equipment business. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation.   OPERATING REVENUES   The reconciliation of segment operating revenues to total operating revenues is as follows:   (In thousands)    AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS   The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. In the first quarter of each year, the Company performs an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives based on the fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset.     As of January 1, 2006, the Company had assigned its recorded goodwill and intangible assets to approximately 375 of its then 700 reporting units. When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Fair values are determined by discounting estimated future cash flows at the Companys estimated cost of capital of 10%. Estimated future cash flows are based either on current operating cash flows or on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant operating unit. If the fair value of an operating unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value of the units goodwill and the carrying value of the goodwill.   Amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for the periods ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:   (In thousands)            Three Months Ended March 31                 2006       2005         Goodwill:                                 Impairment       $   9,200       $   6,206         Intangible Assets:                                 Amortization           23,788           14,735         Impairment           2,985           5,049         Total       $   35,973       $   25,990         In the first quarter of 2006, the Company performed its annual impairment testing of its goodwill and intangible assets, which resulted in impairment charges of $12.2 million. The first quarter 2006 goodwill impairment charges of $9.2 million were primarily related to a U.S. joist business, a U.S. heat transfer business, and an Asian construction business and resulted from lower estimated future cash flows than previously expected. Also in the first quarter of 2006, intangible asset impairments of $3.0 million were recorded to reduce to the estimated fair value the carrying value of trademarks, patents and customer-related intangible assets primarily related to a U.S. welding components business in the Specialty Systems  North America segment and a U.S. contamination control business in the Engineered Products  North America segment.   In the first quarter of 2005, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $6.2 million, which were primarily related to a Canadian stretch packaging equipment business and a U.S. welding components business, and which resulted from lower estimated future cash flows than previously expected. Also in the first quarter of 2005, intangible asset impairments of $5.0 million were recorded to reduce to estimated fair value the carrying value of trademarks, patents and customer-related intangible assets related to a U.S. business that manufactures clean room mats in the Engineered Products  North America segment.   INTEREST EXPENSE   Interest expense decreased to $18.9 million in the first three months of 2006 from $20.3 million in 2005 primarily due to a lower amount of commercial paper outstanding in the first quarter of 2006.   INVESTMENT INCOME   Investment income was $10.2 million in the first three months of 2006 from $20.9 million in 2005. The decline was due to lower equity income from mortgage investments due to completion of the first mortgage transaction in 2005. In addition, there was a small loss in 2006 on venture capital investments versus gains from mark-to-market adjustments in 2005.   OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)   Other income (expense) was an expense of $33,000 for the first three months of 2006 versus income of $3.2 million in 2005, primarily due to losses on divestitures and higher losses on currency translation in 2006, partially offset by higher interest income in 2006.   NET INCOME   Net income of $366.5 million ($1.29 per diluted share) in the first three months of 2006 was 17.4% higher than the 2005 income from continuing operations of $312.3 million ($1.06 per diluted share).   FOREIGN CURRENCY   The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in 2006 decreased operating revenues for the first three months of 2006 by approximately $78.0 million and decreased earnings by approximately 2 cents per diluted share.     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   Cash Flow   The Companys primary source of liquidity is free operating cash flow. Management continues to believe that such internally generated cash flow will be adequate to service existing debt and to continue to pay dividends that meet its dividend payout objective of 25-30% of the last three years average net income. In addition, free operating cash flow is expected to be adequate to finance internal growth and small-to-medium sized acquisitions.   The Company uses free operating cash flow to measure normal cash flow generated by its operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions and debt repayment. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.   Summarized cash flow information for the first quarter of 2006 and 2005 was as follows:   (In thousands)            Three Months Ended March 31                 2006       2005         Net cash provided by operating activities       $   388,511       $   302,951         Additions to plant and equipment           (68,319   )       (64,028   )     Free operating cash flow       $   320,192       $   238,923                                           Acquisitions       $   (198,997   )   $   (188,354   )     Cash dividends paid           (92,620   )       (81,653   )     Purchase of investments           (2,060   )       (70,669   )     Issuance of common stock           42,007           12,334         Repurchases of common stock                      (189,732   )     Net proceeds (repayments) of debt           (23,970   )       630,752         Other           39,501           33,950         Net increase in cash and equivalents       $   84,053       $   385,551         In the prior year, there was an increase in debt to fund the repurchase of common stock and acquisitions.   Return on Average Invested Capital   The Company uses return on average invested capital (ROIC) to measure the effectiveness of the operations use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC for the first quarter of 2006 and 2005 was as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)        The 230 basis point increase in ROIC in the first quarter of 2006 was due primarily to a 20% increase in after-tax operating income, mainly as a result of increased operating income from the base businesses and a decrease in the effective tax rate to 31% in the first quarter of 2006 from 32.5% in the first quarter of 2005. The above positive impact was partially offset by an increase of 4% in average invested capital primarily due to acquisitions.   Working Capital   Net working capital at March 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 is summarized as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)    Debt   Total debt at March 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 was as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)    The Company had outstanding commercial paper of $56.5 million at March 31, 2006 and $94.5 million at December 31, 2005.   Stockholders Equity   The changes to stockholders equity during 2006 were as follows:   (In thousands)      Total stockholders equity, December 31, 2005       $   7,546,895         Net income           366,530         Cash dividends declared           (93,563   )     Shares issued for acquisitions           163,384         Stock option and restricted stock activity           53,508         Currency translation adjustments           28,418         Total stockholders equity, March 31, 2006       $   8,065,172             FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, statements regarding 2006 contributions to the Companys pension plans, the adequacy of internally generated funds, the meeting of dividend payout objectives, and the outcome of outstanding legal proceedings.

The 2006 Plan succeeds the Directors Restricted Stock Plan, and the non-deferral provisions of the Non-Officer Directors Fee Conversion Plan were merged into the 2006 Plan.  The 2006 Plan was approved by the Companys Board of Directors on February 10, 2006, and became effective with the stockholders approval on May 5, 2006.     The 2006 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. It is a stock-based compensation plan that provides for grants of stock options, performance units, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights and other stock awards to non-employee directors and key employees of the Company, including executive officers. These awards are subject to certain limitations as set forth in the 2006 Plan. A maximum of 35,000,000 shares of ITW common stock may be issued under the 2006 Plan. As of May 5, 2006, 35,000,000 shares remained available for future issuance under the 2006 Plan.   A more detailed description of the terms of the 2006 Plan is included under Approval of the Illinois Tool Works Inc. 2006 Stock Incentive Plan in the Companys definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 28, 2006, which description is incorporated herein by reference.   At its May 5, 2006 meeting, the Companys Board of Directors approved an amendment to the 2006 Plan that limited the number of shares of ITW common stock issuable under the 2006 Plan in the form of stock awards, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units to 5,000,000 in the aggregate. The amendment also eliminated the Companys ability to re-use shares surrendered or withheld to pay withholding taxes or option exercise prices and shares covered by a stock option or other incentive that is forfeited or lapses, expires or is otherwise terminated.   The full text of the 2006 Plan, as amended by the Companys Board of Directors on May 5, 2006, is attached to this filing as Exhibit 10(a).
