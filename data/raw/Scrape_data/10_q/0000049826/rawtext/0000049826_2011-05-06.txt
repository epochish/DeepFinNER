ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. and SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)   (1)           FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   The unaudited financial statements included herein have been prepared by Illinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”). In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in the Company’s 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform with current year reporting.   Prior to 2011, the Company’s international operations outside of North America had a fiscal reporting period that began on December 1 and ended on November 30. Effective January 1, 2011, the Company eliminated the one month lag for the reporting of its international operations outside of North America. As a result, the Company is now reporting both North American and international results on a calendar year basis. The Company determined that the elimination of the one month reporting lag was preferable because the same period-end reporting date improves overall financial reporting as the impact of current events, economic conditions and global trends are consistently reflected in the financial statements of the North American and international business units.   The Company has applied this change in accounting principle retrospectively to all prior financial statement periods presented.  The elimination of the one month reporting lag for international operations outside of North America resulted in an increase to revenues of $131,212,000 and an increase to net income of $39,474,000, or $0.08 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2010, and an increase to income reinvested in the business of $8,722,000 as of December 31, 2010.   (2)           COMPREHENSIVE INCOME   The components of comprehensive income in the periods presented were:       (In thousands)     Three Months Ended March 31           2011       2010      Net Income    $ 623,140     $ 333,805     Other Comprehensive Income:                       Foreign currency translation adjustments      231,594       (57,567  )      Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments, net of tax      8,785       6,037     Comprehensive Income    $ 863,519     $ 282,275       (3)           INCOME TAXES   The Company has been litigating its dispute with the Australian Tax Office over the tax treatment of an intercompany financing transaction between the U.S. and Australia. The case was heard before the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria, in September 2010. The proceedings resulted from the Company’s appeal of a decision by the Australian Tax Commissioner to disallow income tax deductions for the income tax years 2002 through 2005 and the assessment of withholding taxes for income tax year 2003. The Company also contested the Commissioner’s similar determination for income tax years 2006 and 2007; the parties agreed to follow the Court’s decision made on the earlier years. On February 4, 2011, the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria decided in the Company’s favor with respect to a significant portion of the income tax deductions. The Court issued the final orders on February 18, 2011. Based on this decision, the Company decreased its unrecognized tax benefits related to this matter by approximately $197,000,000 and recorded a favorable discrete non-cash tax benefit to reduce tax expense by $165,927,000 in the first quarter of 2011. The Australian Tax Office has appealed the timing of certain of the deductions, the outcome of which is not expected to be material.   During the first quarter of 2011, the Company resolved an issue with the Internal Revenue Service in the United States related to a deduction for foreign exchange losses on an intercompany loan that resulted in a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $179,000,000.   In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act were signed into law. As a result, future tax deductions for retiree prescription drug coverage will be reduced by the amount of subsidies received starting in 2013. In the first quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a discrete tax charge of $21,881,000 for the impact of the health care reform legislation.               The components of the effective tax rate for the period ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows:            March 31, 2011       March 31, 2010      Estimated annual effective tax rate      29.0  %     29.1  %   Discrete tax adjustments      (25.7  )     4.4     Effective tax rate      3.3  %     33.5  %     The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions and a number of these audits are currently ongoing.   (4)           INVENTORIES   Inventories at March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 were as follows:   (In thousands)      (5)RETIREMENT PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS   Pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the periods ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows:        The Company expects to contribute $59,300,000 to its pension plans and $39,500,000 to its other postretirement plans in 2011. As of March 31, 2011, contributions of $33,500,000 to pension plans and $8,600,000 to other postretirement plans have been made.   (6)           SHORT-TERM DEBT   The Company had outstanding commercial paper of $412,975,000 at March 31, 2011 and no outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2010.                         (7)           LONG-TERM DEBT   Based on rates for comparable instruments, the approximate fair value and related carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt, including current maturities, were as follows:   (In thousands)      (8)           SEGMENT INFORMATION   See Management’s Discussion and Analysis for information regarding operating revenues and operating income for the Company’s segments.   (9)           SUBSEQUENT EVENT   In April 2011, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its finishing group of businesses to Graco Inc. in a $650,000,000 cash transaction. The sale is not expected to be completed until June 2011, at the earliest, to accommodate regulatory reviews. The finishing businesses, which are included within the “All Other” segment, had revenues of approximately $305,000,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010.                           Item 2 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis   INTERNATIONAL REPORTING CHANGE   Prior to 2011, the Company’s international operations outside of North America had a fiscal reporting period that began on December 1 and ended on November 30. Effective January 1, 2011, the Company eliminated the one month lag for the reporting of its international operations outside of North America. As a result, the Company is now reporting both North American and international results on a calendar year basis. The Company has applied this change in accounting principle retrospectively to all prior financial statement periods presented.   CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   The Company’s consolidated results of operations for the first quarter of 2011 and 2010 were as follows:        In the first quarter of 2011, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:         Three Months Ended March 31           % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)           Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins      Base manufacturing business:                      Revenue change/Operating leverage      11.7  %     34.0  %     2.9  %   Changes in variable margins and overhead costs      —       (15.0  )     (2.0  )   Total      11.7       19.0       0.9                                 Acquisitions and divestitures      4.2       1.3       (0.4  )   Restructuring expenses      —       3.4       0.4     Translation      1.6       2.3       0.1     Other      (0.1  )     —       0.1     Total      17.4  %     26.0  %     1.1  %     Operating Revenues  Revenues increased 17.4% in the first quarter of 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to higher base revenues, revenues from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation as the U.S. dollar weakened against foreign currencies during the first quarter. Base revenues increased 11.7% in the first quarter versus 2010 as the Company benefited from improvement in macroeconomic conditions across many of its worldwide consumable and equipment related end markets. North American base revenues increased 12.2% and international base revenues increased 11.0% in the first quarter. Against a backdrop of improved global macroeconomic data, end markets associated with the automotive OEM, welding, industrial packaging, PC board fabrication, and test and measurement businesses showed particular strength in the quarter.                           Operating Income  Operating income increased $141.1 million or 26.0% in the first quarter of 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to the increase in base revenues, lower restructuring expenses, the favorable effect of currency translation and income from acquisitions. Base margins increased 90 basis points in the first quarter primarily due to the positive leverage effect of the growth in base revenues partially offset by the negative impact of selling price versus material cost comparisons and increased overhead costs. Acquisitions diluted total margins by 40 basis points.    Certain reclassifications of prior year segment data have been made to conform with current year reporting. The reconciliation of segment operating revenues to total operating revenues is as follows:        TRANSPORTATION   Businesses in this segment produce components, fasteners, fluids and polymers, as well as truck remanufacturing and related parts and service.       In the Transportation segment, products and services include:    •   metal and plastic components, fasteners and assemblies for automobiles and light trucks;    •   fluids, polymers and other supplies for auto aftermarket maintenance and appearance;    •   fillers and putties for auto body repair;     •   polyester coatings and patch and repair products for the marine industry; and    •   truck remanufacturing and related parts and service.      This segment primarily serves automotive original equipment manufacturers and tiers, and the automotive aftermarket.   The results of operations for the Transportation segment for the first quarter of 2011 and 2010 were as follows:                              In the first quarter of 2011, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:         Three Months Ended March 31           % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)           Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins      Base manufacturing business:                      Revenue change/Operating leverage      15.1  %     37.0  %     2.9  %   Changes in variable margins and overhead costs      —       (11.2  )     (1.5  )   Total      15.1       25.8       1.4                                 Acquisitions      7.5       3.4       (0.6  )   Restructuring expenses      —       (0.1  )     —     Translation      1.1       1.3       —     Other      (0.1  )     —       —     Total      23.6  %     30.4  %     0.8  %     Operating Revenues  Revenues increased 23.6% in the first quarter of 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to the increase in base revenues, revenues from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation. The increase in acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of two North American automotive aftermarket businesses. North American automotive base revenues increased 18.1% in the first quarter of 2011 due to a 16.0% increase in auto builds and increased product penetration. International automotive base revenues increased 13.7% due to an 8.0% increase in European auto builds and increased product penetration. The automotive aftermarket businesses increased 6.2%, while the truck remanufacturing and related parts and service business increased 25.5% driven primarily by the strengthening economic recovery in North America.    Operating Income  Operating income increased $28.0 million or 30.4% in the first quarter of 2011 primarily due to the increase in base revenues, income from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation. Base margins increased 140 basis points in the first quarter primarily as a result of positive leverage from the increase in base revenues partially offset by the negative impact of selling price versus material cost comparisons and higher operating costs.    INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING   Businesses in this segment produce steel, plastic and paper products and equipment used for bundling, shipping and protecting goods in transit.       In the Industrial Packaging segment, products include:    •   steel and plastic strapping and related tools and equipment;    •   plastic stretch film and related equipment;    •   paper and plastic products that protect goods in transit; and    •   metal jacketing and other insulation products.      This segment primarily serves the general industrial, primary metals, food and beverage, and construction markets.

The results of operations for the All Other segment for the first quarter of 2011 and 2010 were as follows:        In the first quarter of 2011, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:         Three Months Ended March 31           % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)           Operating Revenues       Operating Income       Operating Margins      Base manufacturing business:                      Revenue change/Operating leverage      11.5  %     31.5  %     3.1  %   Changes in variable margins and overhead costs      —       (3.8  )     (0.6  )   Total      11.5       27.7       2.5                                 Acquisitions and divestitures      2.2       (1.1  )     (0.6  )   Restructuring expenses      —       2.6       0.4     Translation      0.9       1.2       —     Other      —       —       0.1     Total      14.6  %     30.4  %     2.4  %     Operating Revenues  Revenues increased 14.6% in the first quarter of 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to an increase in base revenues and revenues from acquisitions. The acquisition revenue is primarily due to the purchase of a test and measurement business, a U.S. beverage packaging business and a plastics and security business. Base revenues increased 19.2% in the first quarter for the test and measurement businesses due to increased demand for capital equipment particularly in Asia Pacific and Europe. Base revenues increased 7.2% in the first quarter for the consumer packaging business largely as a result of increased revenues in the decorating equipment and beverage packaging solutions end markets. Base revenues for the industrial fasteners and appliance businesses improved 5.1% in the first quarter primarily due to increased industrial fastener demand. Base revenues increased 20.0% for the finishing businesses due to improved international industrial-based end market demand.     Operating Income  Operating income increased $36.7 million or 30.4% in the first quarter of 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to the growth in base revenues, lower restructuring expenses and favorable currency translation, partially offset by higher operating costs. Base margins increased 250 basis points in the first quarter as the positive leverage effect of the increase in base revenues was partially offset by higher operating costs. Acquisitions and divestitures diluted total operating margins by 60 basis points in the first quarter.    AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS   Amortization expense increased to $56.4 million in the first three months of 2011 versus $52.9 million in the first three months of 2010 primarily due to intangible amortization related to newly acquired businesses.   INTEREST EXPENSE   Interest expense was essentially flat at $44.0 million in the first three months of 2011 compared to $44.4 million in the first three months of 2010.                       OTHER INCOME   Other income was $5.6 million for the first three months of 2011 versus $4.6 million in 2010 primarily due to higher interest income in 2011 versus 2010.   INCOME TAXES   The effective tax rate for the first three months of 2011 was 3.3% which included the favorable discrete non-cash tax benefit of $165.9 million related to the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria decision in the Company’s favor with respect to a significant portion of the income tax deductions. The effective tax rate for the first three months of 2010 was 33.5% which included the discrete tax charge of $21.9 million related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. See the Income Taxes Note in Item1 – Financial Statements for further details on these discrete tax adjustments.   NET INCOME   Net income of $623.1 million ($1.24 per diluted share) in the first three months of 2011 was 86.7% higher than the 2010 net income of $333.8 million ($0.66 per diluted share).   FOREIGN CURRENCY   The weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in 2011 increased operating revenues for the first three months of 2011 by approximately $56 million and increased net income by approximately 2 cents per diluted share.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and short-term credit facilities. Management continues to believe that internally generated cash flows will be adequate to service debt, to continue to pay dividends, to finance internal growth and to fund small to medium-sized acquisitions.   The primary uses of liquidity are:     ·     dividend payments – the Company’s dividend payout guidelines are 30% to 45% of the last two years’ average free operating cash flow;        ·     acquisitions; and        ·     any excess liquidity may be used for share repurchases.      Cash Flow   The Company uses free operating cash flow to measure normal cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.                         Summarized cash flow information for the first quarter of 2011 and 2010 was as follows:        On August 20, 2007, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, which provides for the buyback of up to $3.0 billion of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time. As of March 31, 2011, there was approximately $871 million of authorized repurchases remaining under this program.   Return on Average Invested Capital   The Company uses return on average invested capital (“ROIC”) to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. The Company believes that ROIC is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company’s operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the year and at the end of each quarter. For the first quarter of 2011 and 2010, ROIC was as follows:        The ROIC increase of 150 basis points in the first quarter of 2011 was the result of operating income after taxes increasing 26.2%, primarily due to an increase in base business, while average invested capital increased by 14.3%.                         In the first quarter of 2011, the Company recorded a favorable discrete non-cash tax benefit of $165.9 million related to the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria decision in the Company’s favor with respect to a significant portion of the income tax deductions. See the Income Taxes Note in Item 1 – Financial Statements for further details on this discrete tax adjustment. Since this benefit was unusual, the ROIC calculation has been adjusted to exclude this item to improve comparability and better reflect the return on average invested capital for the periods presented. A reconciliation of the tax rate as reported to the tax rate used above is as follows:            Three Months Ended March 31, 2011      (Dollars in thousands)     Income Before Taxes       Income Taxes       Tax Rate      As reported    $ 644,140     $ 21,000       3.3  %   Discrete tax adjustment      —       165,927       25.7  %   As adjusted    $ 644,140     $ 186,927       29.0  %     In the first quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a discrete tax charge of $21.9 million related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. See the Income Taxes Note in Item 1 – Financial Statements for further details on this discrete tax adjustment. Since this charge was unusual, the ROIC calculation has been adjusted to exclude this item to improve comparability and better reflect the return on average invested capital for the periods presented. A reconciliation of the tax rate as reported to the tax rate used above is as follows:            Three Months Ended March 31, 2010      (Dollars in thousands)     Income Before Taxes       Income Taxes       Tax Rate      As reported    $ 501,805     $ 168,000       33.5  %   Discrete tax adjustment      —       (21,881  )     (4.4  )%   As adjusted    $ 501,805     $ 146,119       29.1  %     Working Capital   Management uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the Company. Net working capital at March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 is summarized as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)      Inventories and trade receivables increased primarily due to seasonality in working capital, and the increase in base revenues and acquisitions. Other current assets increased primarily due to higher tax receivables and general corporate purposes. Short-term debt increased primarily due to issuances of commercial paper to fund acquisitions and tax payments in the first quarter of 2011. Accounts payable increased due to higher purchase activity. Other current liabilities decreased primarily due to the decrease in income taxes payable.                         Debt   Total debt at March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 was as follows:   (Dollars in thousands)      The Company had outstanding commercial paper of $413.0 million at March 31, 2011 and no outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2010.   The Company believes that based on its current free operating cash flow, debt-to-capitalization ratios and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary. The Company's targeted debt-to-capital ratio is 20% to 30%, excluding the impact of any larger acquisitions.   Stockholders’ Equity   The changes to stockholders’ equity during 2011 were as follows:   (In thousands)       Total stockholders’ equity, December 31, 2010      $   9,571,999       Net income         623,140       Stock option and restricted stock activity         112,762       Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments, net of tax         8,785       Noncontrolling interest         1,039       Cash dividends declared         (170,017   )    Currency translation adjustments         231,594       Total stockholders’ equity, March 31, 2011      $   10,379,302         SUBSEQUENT EVENT   In April 2011, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its finishing group of businesses to Graco Inc. in a $650 million cash transaction. The sale is not expected to be completed until June 2011, at the earliest, to accommodate regulatory reviews. The finishing businesses, which are included within the “All Other” segment, had revenues of approximately $305 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The Company intends to utilize after-tax proceeds from the sale to repurchase shares as part of its share repurchase program.
