ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. and SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)   (1)           FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   The unaudited financial statements included herein have been prepared by Illinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”). In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in the Company’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform to current year reporting.   (2)           COMPREHENSIVE INCOME   The components of comprehensive income in the periods presented were:        (3)           DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS   The Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with its long-term objectives. In August 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the divestiture of the Click Commerce industrial software business which was previously reported in the All Other segment. In the second quarter of 2009, the Company completed the sale of the Click Commerce business.   In 2007, the Company classified an automotive components business as held for sale which was sold in the third quarter of 2009.   Results of the discontinued operations for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009 were as follows:       (In thousands)     Three Months Ended       Six Months Ended           June 30, 2009       June 30, 2009      Operating revenues    $ 9,542     $ 23,169                         Loss before taxes    $ (1,252 )   $ (35,064 )   Income tax (expense) benefit      (1,126  )     1,328     Loss from discontinued operations    $ (2,378 )   $ (33,736 )     In 2009, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss on the disposal of the Click Commerce business of $29,827,000.   (4)           INCOME TAXES   In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act were signed into law. As a result, future tax deductions for retiree prescription drug coverage will be reduced by the amount of subsidies received starting in 2013. In the first quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a discrete charge of $21,881,000 for the impact of the health care reform legislation.   In the first half of 2009, the Company incurred significant charges related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $89,997,000 that were mostly non-deductible and discrete tax items of $43,540,000 to record reserves on net operating loss carryforwards no longer expected to be utilized and other tax adjustments.                       The components of the effective tax rate for the six month periods ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:            June 30, 2010       June 30, 2009      Estimated annual effective tax rate      30.5  %     28.1  %   Discrete tax adjustments      2.0       13.4     Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges      —       6.2     Effective tax rate      32.5  %     47.7  %     The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions and a number of these audits are currently ongoing.   The Company is litigating its dispute with the Australian Tax Office over the treatment of an intercompany financing transaction between the U.S. and Australia. The Company has recorded its best estimate of the exposure for this audit; however, it is reasonably possible that the Company will resolve the Australian financing issue within the next 12 months and that the amount of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately $163,000,000.   (5)           INVENTORIES   Inventories at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 were as follows:   (In thousands)      (6)           GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS   Goodwill represents the excess cost over fair value of the net assets of purchased businesses. The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. The Company performs an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives based on the estimated fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset.   When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company compares the estimated fair value of each of its 60 reporting units to its carrying value. Fair values are determined primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows based either on current operating cash flows or on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant reporting unit. The Company also considers additional valuation techniques, such as market multiples from similar transactions and quoted market prices of relevant public companies. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. During 2009, the Company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment assessment from the first quarter to the third quarter.   The Company’s indefinite-lived intangibles consist of trademarks and brands. The estimated fair values of these intangibles are determined based on a relief-of-royalty income approach derived from internally forecasted revenues of the related products.  If the fair value of the trademark or brand is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the intangible asset.   In the first quarter of 2009, the Company performed a goodwill impairment assessment which resulted in impairment charges of $60,000,000 related to the pressure sensitive adhesives reporting unit in the Polymers & Fluids segment and $18,000,000 related to the PC board fabrication reporting unit in the Power Systems & Electronics segment.   Also in the first quarter of 2009, intangible asset impairments of $11,997,000 were recorded to reduce to the estimated fair value the carrying value of certain trademarks and brands. Approximately $5,800,000 of this total charge related to the PC board fabrication reporting unit and the remainder to various trademarks and brands of other reporting units.   The impairments during 2009 were primarily related to new reporting units which had been acquired before the recent economic downturn. These charges were driven primarily by lower current forecasts compared to the expected forecasts at the time the reporting units were acquired.                        A summary of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that were adjusted to fair value and the related impairment charges included in earnings for the first quarter of 2009 were as follows:       (In thousands)     Book Value       Fair Value       Total Impairment Charges      Goodwill    $ 353,000     $ 275,000     $ 78,000     Indefinite-lived intangible assets      94,973       82,976       11,997       (7)           RETIREMENT PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS   Pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the periods ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:        The Company expects to contribute $70,500,000 to its pension plans and $37,900,000 to its other postretirement plans in 2010. As of June 30, 2010, contributions of $35,800,000 to pension plans and $18,400,000 to other postretirement plans have been made.   (8)           SHORT-TERM DEBT   In June 2009, the Company entered into a $2,000,000,000 Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 11, 2010. This line of credit was replaced on June 11, 2010 by a $1,000,000,000 Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 10, 2011. No amounts were outstanding under this facility at June 30, 2010.   The Company had outstanding commercial paper of $248,491,000 at June 30, 2010 and $135,498,000 at December 31, 2009.                        (9)           LONG-TERM DEBT   Based on rates for comparable instruments the approximate fair value and related carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt, including current maturities, were as follows:   (In thousands)      On June 11, 2010, the Company entered into a $1,000,000,000 Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 11, 2013. No amounts were outstanding under this facility at June 30, 2010.   (10)           SEGMENT INFORMATION   See Management’s Discussion and Analysis for information regarding operating revenues and operating income for the Company’s segments.                       Item 2 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis   CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   The Company’s consolidated results of operations for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010 and 2009 were as follows:        In the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, the changes in revenues and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:           Three Months Ended June 30       Six Months Ended June 30           % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)       % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)           Operating Revenues       Operating Margins       Operating Revenues       Operating Margins      Base business:                            Revenue change/Operating leverage      15.1  %     4.1  %     11.5  %     3.5  %   Changes in variable margins and overhead costs      —       0.6       —       2.9     Total      15.1       4.7       11.5       6.4                                         Acquisitions and divestitures      2.9       (0.2  )     2.4       (0.1  )   Restructuring costs      —       1.6       —       0.9     Impairment of goodwill and intangibles      —       —       —       1.2     Translation      2.3       —       3.8       (0.2  )   Other      (0.2  )     —       (0.2  )     0.1     Total      20.1  %     6.1  %     17.5  %     8.3  %     Operating Revenues Revenues increased 20.1% and 17.5% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, respectively, versus 2009 primarily due to higher base revenues, the favorable effect of currency translation and revenues from acquisitions. Base revenues increased 15.1% and 11.5% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, respectively, versus 2009 as the Company saw improvement in macroeconomic data across many worldwide end markets. North American base revenues increased 15.8% and 11.7% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, while international base revenues increased 14.2% and 11.1% in the same periods. End markets including transportation, polymers and fluids, industrial packaging and PC board/electronics showed strength in the second quarter and year-to-date periods.   Operating Income Operating income increased $317.9 million and $710.5 million in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, respectively, versus 2009 primarily due to the increase in base revenues, lower operating expenses, lower restructuring expenses and lower year-to-date goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. Base margins increased 4.7% and 6.4% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, respectively, primarily due to the positive leverage effect of the increase in base revenues and the cumulative benefits of restructuring projects. Selling price versus material cost comparisons were unfavorable in the second quarter but remained favorable for the year-to-date period. In the prior year first quarter, the Company recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $90.0 million.                       The reconciliation of segment operating revenues to total operating revenues is as follows:        TRANSPORTATION   Businesses in this segment produce components, fasteners, fluids and polymers, as well as truck remanufacturing and related parts and service.       In the Transportation segment, products and services include:    •   metal and plastic components, fasteners and assemblies for automobiles and light trucks;    •   fluids and polymers for auto aftermarket maintenance and appearance;    •   fillers and putties for auto body repair;    •   polyester coatings and patch and repair products for the marine industry; and    •   truck remanufacturing and related parts and service.      This segment primarily serves the automotive original equipment manufacturers and tiers and automotive aftermarket markets.   The results of operations for the Transportation segment for the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010 and 2009 were as follows:                               In the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, the changes in revenues and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:           Three Months Ended June 30       Six Months Ended June 30           % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)       % Increase (Decrease)       % Point Increase (Decrease)           Operating Revenues       Operating Margins       Operating Revenues       Operating Margins      Base business:                            Revenue change/Operating leverage      29.3  %     6.9  %     30.5  %     7.8  %   Changes in variable margins and overhead costs      —       3.2       —       5.0     Total      29.3       10.1       30.5       12.8                                         Acquisitions and divestitures      3.1       0.2       1.5       0.3     Restructuring costs      —       1.9       —       1.9     Impairment of goodwill and intangibles      —       —       —       0.2     Translation      1.6       (0.2  )     2.7       (0.4  )   Other      0.1       (0.1  )     0.1       (0.1  )   Total      34.1  %     11.9  %     34.8  %     14.7  %     Operating Revenues Revenues increased 34.1% and 34.8% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, respectively, versus 2009 primarily due to the increase in base revenues, revenues from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by a decline in revenue for the truck remanufacturing business. The increase in acquisition revenue is primarily due to the purchase of a North American automotive aftermarket business in the second quarter of 2010.  North American automotive base revenues increased 38.2% and 30.4% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, due to a year-to-date increase in car builds of 72%. International automotive base revenues increased 30.6% and 44.6% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, due to a year-to-date increase in European car builds of 29%. The automotive aftermarket businesses, which were less impacted in 2009 by the economic downturn, increased 4.2% and 2.5% in the same periods, respectively.   Operating Income Operating income increased $87.4 million and $187.1 million in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, respectively, versus 2009, primarily due to the increase in base revenues and lower operating costs. Total base margins increased 10.1% and 12.8% for the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, as a result of leverage from the increase in base revenues and an improved cost structure due to business unit consolidations and restructurings. In addition, favorable inventory obsolescence expense comparisons in the year-to-date period improved margins. In the second quarter of 2010, unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons were more than offset by productivity gains.   INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING   Businesses in this segment produce steel, plastic and paper products and equipment used for bundling, shipping and protecting goods in transit.       In the Industrial Packaging segment, products include:    •   steel and plastic strapping and related tools and equipment;    •   plastic stretch film and related equipment;    •   paper and plastic products that protect goods in transit; and    •   metal jacketing and other insulation products.      This segment primarily serves the general industrial, primary metals, food and beverage and construction markets.

Operating Income Operating income increased $66.4 million and $115.5 million in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010, respectively, versus 2009 primarily due to growth in base revenues, cost reduction initiatives, benefits of restructuring projects and income from acquisitions. Base margins increased 4.6% and 5.2% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, as cost reductions more than offset unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons. Acquisitions diluted total operating margins by 0.7% and 0.8% in the second quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively.   AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS   Amortization expense increased to $107.0 million in the first six months of 2010 versus $102.5 million in the first six months of 2009, due to intangible amortization related to newly acquired businesses.   IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS   During 2009, the Company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment assessment from the first quarter to the third quarter.   Total goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges by segment for the six months ended June 30, 2009 were as follows:       (In thousands)      Six Months Ended             June 30, 2009       Transportation      $   2,414       Industrial Packaging         386       Food Equipment         46       Power Systems & Electronics         24,766       Polymers & Fluids         60,416       All Other         1,969             $   89,997         Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets was $90.0 million in the first six months of 2009, primarily due to goodwill impairment charges in the first quarter of 2009 related to the pressure sensitive adhesives reporting unit of $60.0 million and the PC board fabrication reporting unit of $18.0 million.   See the Goodwill and Intangible Assets note for further details of the impairment charges.   INTEREST EXPENSE   Interest expense increased to $88.3 million in the first six months of 2010 from $75.3 million in the first six months of 2009 primarily due to interest on the 6.25% and 5.15% notes issued in March 2009, partially offset by lower interest related to the 5.75% notes repaid at maturity in March 2009 and lower commercial paper borrowings and rates.   OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)   Other income (expense) was income of $11.7 million for the first six months of 2010 versus expense of $24.2 million in 2009, primarily due to gains on investments in 2010 versus losses in 2009 and lower currency translation losses in 2010 versus 2009.                        INCOME TAXES   The effective tax rate for the first six months of 2010 was 32.5% which included the discrete tax charge of $21.9 million in the first quarter of 2010 related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. The effective tax rate for the first six months of 2010 decreased compared to 47.7% for the first six months of 2009. The decrease in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from the impairment of non-deductible goodwill and discrete tax adjustments recorded in the first quarter of 2009.   INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS   Income from continuing operations was $715.1 million ($1.41 per diluted share) in the first six months of 2010 compared to the 2009 income from continuing operations of $170.9 million ($0.34 per diluted share).   FOREIGN CURRENCY   The weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in 2010 increased operating revenues for the first six months of 2010 by approximately $277 million and increased net income by approximately 6 cents per diluted share.   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS   Loss from discontinued operations was $33.7 million in the first six months of 2009 primarily due to the loss on sale of the Click Commerce industrial software business of $29.8 million.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and short-term credit facilities. Management continues to believe that internally generated cash flows will be adequate to service debt, continue to pay dividends, to finance internal growth and to fund small to medium-sized acquisitions.   The primary uses of liquidity are:     ·     dividend payments – the Company’s dividend payout guidelines are 25% to 35% of the last two years’ average income from continuing operations;        ·     acquisitions; and        ·     any excess liquidity may be used for share repurchases. The Company’s open-ended share repurchase program allows it flexibility in achieving the targeted debt-to-capital ratio.      Cash Flow   The Company uses free operating cash flow to measure normal cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.                       Summarized cash flow information for the second quarter of 2010 and 2009 was as follows:        On August 20, 2007 the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, which provides for the buyback of up to $3.0 billion of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time. There are approximately $1.2 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under this program.   Return on Average Invested Capital   The Company uses return on average invested capital (“ROIC”) to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. The Company believes that ROIC is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company’s operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the year and at the end of each quarter. For the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010 and 2009, ROIC was as follows:        The ROIC increase of 8.4% in the second quarter of 2010 was the result of after-tax operating income increasing 102.0%, primarily due to an increase in base business, while average invested capital increased slightly.                        The ROIC increase of 8.2% for year-to-date 2010 was the result of after-tax operating income increasing 124.8%, primarily due to an increase in base business, while average invested capital increased slightly.   In the first quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a discrete tax charge of $21.9 million. Since the charge was unusual, the ROIC calculation has been adjusted to exclude this item to improve comparability and better reflect the return on invested capital for the periods presented. A reconciliation of the tax rate as reported to the tax rate used above is as follows:       (Dollars in thousands)     Operating Income       Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes       Income Taxes       Tax Rate      As reported    $ 1,136,668     $ 1,060,123     $ 345,000       32.5  %   Discrete tax adjustments      —       —       (21,881  )     (2.0  )%   As adjusted    $ 1,136,668     $ 1,060,123     $ 323,119       30.5  %     In the first quarter of 2009, the Company incurred significant charges for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $90.0 million that was mostly non-deductible and discrete tax items of $27.8 million. Since these charges were unusual, the ROIC calculation has been adjusted to exclude these items to improve comparability and better reflect the return on invested capital for the 2009 year-to-date period presented above. A reconciliation of 2009 year-to-date operating income and the tax rate as reported to operating income after taxes and tax rate used above is as follows:       (Dollars in thousands)     Operating Income       Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes       Income Taxes       Tax Rate      As reported    $ 426,129     $ 326,627     $ 155,700       47.7  %   Goodwill and intangible asset impairments      89,997       89,997       5,058       (7.3  )%   Discrete tax adjustments      —       —       (27,800  )     (8.5  )%   As adjusted    $ 516,126     $ 416,624     $ 132,958       31.9  %     Working Capital   Management uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the Company. Net working capital at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 is summarized as follows:        Inventories increased primarily as a result of increased sales and acquisitions, partially offset by foreign currency translation. Other current liabilities decreased primarily due to lower income taxes payable and foreign currency translation.                      Debt   Total debt at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 was as follows:        The Company had outstanding commercial paper of $248.5 million at June 30, 2010 and $135.5 million at December 31, 2009.   In June 2009, the Company entered into a $2.0 billion Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 11, 2010. This line of credit was replaced on June 11, 2010 by a $1.0 billion Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 10, 2011 and a $1.0 billion Line of Credit Agreement with a termination date of June 11, 2013. No amounts were outstanding under these facilities at June 30, 2010.   The Company believes that based on its current free operating cash flow, debt-to-capitalization ratios and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary. The Company's targeted debt-to-capital ratio is 20% to 30%, excluding the impact of any larger acquisitions.   Stockholders’ Equity   The changes to stockholders’ equity during 2010 were as follows:   (In thousands)     Total stockholders’ equity, December 31, 2009      $   8,817,876       Net income         715,123       Stock option and restricted stock activity         73,691       Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments, net of tax         11,988       Noncontrolling interest         (60   )    Cash dividends declared         (311,859   )    Currency translation adjustments         (574,895   )    Total stockholders’ equity, June 30, 2010      $   8,731,864         FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that may be identified by the use of words such as “believe,” “expect,” “plans,” “strategy,” “prospects,” “estimate,” “project,” “target,” “anticipate,” “guidance,” and other similar words, including, without limitation, the adequacy of internally generated funds and credit facilities, the meeting of dividend payout objectives, the ability to fund debt service obligations, expected contributions to the Company’s pension and postretirement plans and the estimated timing and amount related to the resolution of tax matters.
