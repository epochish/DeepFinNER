ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSINTRODUCTIONILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. (THE “COMPANY” OR “ITW”) IS A MULTINATIONAL MANUFACTURER OF A DIVERSIFIED RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT WITH OPERATIONS IN 58 COUNTRIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THESE BUSINESSES ARE INTERNALLY REPORTED AS 40 OPERATING SEGMENTS TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANY’S 40 OPERATING SEGMENTS HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED INTO THE FOLLOWING SEVEN EXTERNAL REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: TRANSPORTATION; POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS; INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING; FOOD EQUIPMENT; CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS; POLYMERS & FLUIDS; AND ALL OTHER.DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF DIVERSE BUSINESSES AND THE COMPANY’S DECENTRALIZED OPERATING STRUCTURE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT REQUIRE ITS BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE DETAILED INFORMATION ON OPERATING RESULTS. INSTEAD, THE COMPANY’S CORPORATE MANAGEMENT COLLECTS DATA ON SEVERAL KEY MEASUREMENTS: OPERATING REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME, OPERATING MARGINS, OVERHEAD COSTS, NUMBER OF MONTHS ON HAND IN INVENTORY, DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PAST DUE RECEIVABLES AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. THESE KEY MEASURES ARE MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OPERATING RESULTS VERSUS CURRENT TRENDS IN END MARKETS AND VARIANCES FROM FORECASTS ARE DISCUSSED WITH OPERATING UNIT MANAGEMENT.MANAGEMENT ANALYZES THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE RESULTS OF EACH SEGMENT BY IDENTIFYING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN THE RESULTS OF THE BASE BUSINESSES, NEWLY ACQUIRED AND RECENTLY DIVESTED COMPANIES, RESTRUCTURING COSTS, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AND CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON THE OPERATING REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME OF EACH SEGMENT. BASE BUSINESSES ARE THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR MORE THAN 12 MONTHS. THE CHANGES TO BASE BUSINESS OPERATING INCOME INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF BOTH OPERATING LEVERAGE AND CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS. OPERATING LEVERAGE IS THE ESTIMATED EFFECT OF THE BASE BUSINESS REVENUE VOLUME CHANGES ON OPERATING INCOME, ASSUMING VARIABLE MARGINS REMAIN THE SAME AS THE PRIOR PERIOD. AS MANUFACTURING AND ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD COSTS USUALLY DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE AS A RESULT OF REVENUES INCREASING OR DECREASING, THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN OPERATING INCOME DUE TO OPERATING LEVERAGE IS USUALLY MORE THAN THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE BASE BUSINESS REVENUES. CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED EFFECT OF NON-VOLUME RELATED CHANGES IN BASE BUSINESS OPERATING INCOME AND MAY BE DRIVEN BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX, THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS, LABOR AND OVERHEAD, AND PRICING TO CUSTOMERS. SELLING PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED NET IMPACT OF INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THE COST OF MATERIALS USED IN THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS VERSUS CHANGES IN THE SELLING PRICE TO THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THESE PRICE VERSUS COST COMPARISONS BY ANALYZING THE NET IMPACT OF CHANGES TO EACH SEGMENT'S OPERATING MARGIN.A KEY ELEMENT OF THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS STRATEGY IS ITS CONTINUOUS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS FOR BOTH EXISTING BUSINESSES AND NEW ACQUISITIONS. THE BASIC CONCEPT OF THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS IS TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT (THE 20% OF THE ITEMS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 80% OF THE VALUE) AND TO SPEND LESS TIME AND RESOURCES ON THE LESS IMPORTANT (THE 80% OF THE ITEMS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 20% OF THE VALUE). THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS USE THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS TO SIMPLIFY AND FOCUS ON THE KEY PARTS OF THEIR BUSINESS, AND AS A RESULT, REDUCE COMPLEXITY THAT OFTEN DISGUISES WHAT IS TRULY IMPORTANT. THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS UTILIZE THE 80/20 PROCESS IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THEIR BUSINESSES. COMMON APPLICATIONS OF THE 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS INCLUDE: •SIMPLIFYING PRODUCT LINES BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS OFFERED BY COMBINING THE FEATURES OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS, OUTSOURCING PRODUCTS OR, AS A LAST RESORT, ELIMINATING LOW-VALUE PRODUCTS.•SEGMENTING THE CUSTOMER BASE BY FOCUSING ON THE 80/20 CUSTOMERS SEPARATELY AND FINDING ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO SERVE THE 20/80 CUSTOMERS.•SIMPLIFYING THE SUPPLIER BASE BY PARTNERING WITH 80/20 SUPPLIERS AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF 20/80 SUPPLIERS.•DESIGNING BUSINESS PROCESSES, SYSTEMS AND MEASUREMENTS AROUND THE 80/20 ACTIVITIES.THE RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS IS THAT THE COMPANY HAS OVER TIME IMPROVED ITS LONG-TERM OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THESE 80/20 EFFORTS CAN RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS THAT REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE MARGINS. CORPORATE MANAGEMENT WORKS CLOSELY WITH THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE OPERATING RESULTS BELOW EXPECTATIONS TO HELP THOSE BUSINESSES BETTER APPLY THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS AND IMPROVE THEIR RESULTS.INTERNATIONAL REPORTING CHANGEEFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011, THE COMPANY ELIMINATED THE ONE-MONTH LAG FOR THE REPORTING OF ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY NOW REPORTS BOTH NORTH AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL RESULTS ON A CALENDAR YEAR BASIS. PRIOR TO THIS, THE INTERNATIONAL FISCAL REPORTING PERIOD BEGAN ON DECEMBER 1ST AND ENDED ON NOVEMBER 30TH. THE COMPANY APPLIED THIS CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PRIOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PERIODS PRESENTED. REFER TO THE INTERNATIONAL REPORTING LAG NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR DISCUSSION OF THE INTERNATIONAL REPORTING CHANGE.15DIVESTITURE OF MAJORITY INTEREST IN DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENTON AUGUST 15, 2012, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT (THE “INVESTMENT AGREEMENT”) TO DIVEST A 51% MAJORITY INTEREST IN ITS DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT TO CERTAIN FUNDS MANAGED BY CLAYTON, DUBILIER & RICE, LLC (“CD&R”). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED THE ASSETS AND STOCK OF THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT TO A NEWLY FORMED JOINT VENTURE, WILSONART INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LLC (“WILSONART”). THE TRANSACTION CLOSED ON OCTOBER 31, 2012, REDUCING THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP OF WILSONART TO 49% IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE CLOSE OF THE TRANSACTION. THE COMPANY CEASED CONSOLIDATING THE RESULTS OF THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2012 AND NOW REPORTS ITS 49% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN WILSONART USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 1, 2012, THE COMPANY MADE CHANGES TO ITS MANAGEMENT REPORTING STRUCTURE AND DECORATIVE SURFACES IS NO LONGER A REPORTABLE SEGMENT OF THE COMPANY. SEE THE DIVESTITURE OF MAJORITY INTEREST IN DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THIS TRANSACTION.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSTHE COMPANY PERIODICALLY REVIEWS ITS OPERATIONS FOR BUSINESSES THAT MAY NO LONGER BE ALIGNED WITH ITS LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES. FOR BUSINESSES REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE STATEMENT OF INCOME, ALL RELATED PRIOR PERIOD INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION HAS BEEN RESTATED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR REPORTING OF THESE BUSINESSES. REFER TO THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY’S DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.STRATEGIC REVIEW OF INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENTON FEBRUARY 19, 2013, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT IS INITIATING A REVIEW PROCESS TO EXPLORE STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES FOR ITS INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENT, WHICH MAY INCLUDE A SALE OR SPIN-OFF OF THE BUSINESS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE REVIEW PROCESS WILL LAST THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF 2013. 2011 AND 2012 SEGMENT CHANGESTHE COMPANY PERIODICALLY MAKES CHANGES TO ITS MANAGEMENT REPORTING STRUCTURE TO BETTER ALIGN ITS BUSINESSES WITH COMPANY OBJECTIVES AND OPERATING STRATEGIES. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, THE COMPANY MADE CERTAIN CHANGES IN ITS MANAGEMENT REPORTING STRUCTURE THAT RESULTED IN CHANGES IN SOME OF THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS. THE PRESSURE SENSITIVE ADHESIVES, AND THE STATIC AND CONTAMINATION CONTROL REPORTING UNITS WERE MOVED TO THE POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS SEGMENT FROM THE POLYMERS & FLUIDS AND ALL OTHER SEGMENTS, RESPECTIVELY. THE CHANGES IN THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND UNDERLYING REPORTING UNITS DID NOT RESULT IN ANY GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012, THE COMPANY MADE CERTAIN CHANGES IN ITS MANAGEMENT REPORTING STRUCTURE THAT RESULTED IN CHANGES IN SOME OF THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS. THESE CHANGES PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE INDUSTRIAL FASTENERS REPORTING UNIT, FORMERLY IN THE ALL OTHER SEGMENT, MOVING TO THE TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT; CERTAIN BUSINESSES IN A LATIN AMERICAN REPORTING UNIT, FORMERLY IN THE POLYMERS & FLUIDS SEGMENT, MOVING TO THE TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT; AND A WORLDWIDE INSULATION REPORTING UNIT, FORMERLY IN THE INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENT, MOVING TO THE POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS SEGMENT. THE CHANGES IN THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND UNDERLYING REPORTING UNITS DID NOT RESULT IN ANY GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012. THE PRIOR PERIOD SEGMENT RESULTS HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR REPORTING OF THESE BUSINESSES.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSTHE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2012, 2011 AND 2010 ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS:16IN 2012 AND 2011, THE CHANGES IN REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGINS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: OPERATING REVENUESREVENUES INCREASED 0.8% IN 2012 VERSUS 2011 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER BASE REVENUES AND REVENUES FROM ACQUISITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND THE REDUCTION OF REVENUES DUE TO DIVESTITURES. BASE REVENUES INCREASED 1.7% IN 2012 VERSUS 2011 AS NORTH AMERICAN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WERE STRONGER THAN THE EUROPEAN AND ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS. NORTH AMERICAN BASE REVENUES INCREASED 4.3% IN 2012 VERSUS 2011. INTERNATIONAL BASE REVENUES DECREASED 1.1% AS EUROPE DECREASED 2.3% IN 2012 VERSUS 2011 PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY WEAKNESS IN SOUTHERN EUROPE. ASIA PACIFIC BASE REVENUES INCREASED 1.3% IN 2012 VERSUS 2011 PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN INDIA. ACQUISITIONS CONTRIBUTED 3.1% TO REVENUES PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PURCHASE OF A MANUFACTURER OF SPECIALTY DEVICES USED TO MEASURE THE FLOW OF GASES AND FLUIDS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012 AND A THERMAL PROCESSING AND ENVIRONMENTAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER PURCHASED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011. CURRENCY TRANSLATION RESULTED IN A 2.7% DECLINE IN REVENUES PRIMARILY DUE TO A WEAKER EURO VERSUS THE YEAR AGO PERIOD. DIVESTITURES REDUCED REVENUES BY 1.4% PRIMARILY DUE TO ONLY TEN MONTHS OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT IN 2012 VERSUS TWELVE MONTHS OF OPERATING RESULTS IN 2011 AS THE COMPANY DIVESTED A 51% INTEREST IN THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT ON OCTOBER 31, 2012, AND THE SEGMENT WAS DECONSOLIDATED AS OF THAT DATE.REVENUES INCREASED 15.4% IN 2011 VERSUS 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER BASE REVENUES, REVENUES FROM ACQUISITIONS, AND THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION. BASE REVENUES INCREASED 7.5% IN 2011 VERSUS 2010 AS WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS STRENGTHENED. NORTH AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL BASE REVENUES INCREASED 8.7% AND 6.1%, RESPECTIVELY, IN 2011 VERSUS 2010.

OPERATING INCOMEOPERATING INCOME INCREASED 4.2% IN 2012 VERSUS 2011 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE POSITIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE EFFECTS OF THE BASE REVENUE INCREASE NOTED ABOVE AND IMPROVED VARIABLE MARGINS. CURRENCY TRANSLATION RESULTED IN A 2.5% DECLINE IN OPERATING INCOME PRIMARILY DUE TO A WEAKER EURO VERSUS THE YEAR AGO PERIOD. HIGHER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES DUE TO INCREASED COST REDUCTION ACTIVITIES ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OPERATING INCOME BY 1.9%. BASE MARGINS INCREASED 110 BASIS POINTS PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED VARIABLE MARGINS AND THE POSITIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE EFFECT OF THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES NOTED ABOVE. CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS IMPROVED BASE MARGINS 70 BASIS POINTS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF SELLING 17PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS OF 50 BASIS POINTS AND BENEFITS OF RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS. THE INCREASE IN BASE MARGINS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 40 BASIS POINT DECLINE RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS, PRIMARILY DUE TO AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS. RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES DILUTED TOTAL OPERATING MARGINS BY 30 BASIS POINTS PRIMARILY DUE TO RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES RELATED TO CONTINUED IMPROVEMENTS IN OPERATING STRUCTURE AND EFFICIENCIES.OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 21.2% IN 2011 VERSUS 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE POSITIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE EFFECTS OF THE BASE REVENUE INCREASE NOTED ABOVE, THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND INCOME FROM ACQUISITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY WEAKER VARIABLE MARGINS. CURRENCY TRANSLATION RESULTED IN A 3.4% INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME PRIMARILY DUE TO A STRONGER EURO AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR VERSUS THE YEAR AGO PERIOD. BASE MARGINS INCREASED 120 BASIS POINTS DUE TO THE POSITIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE EFFECT OF THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS OF 70 BASIS POINTS, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF SELLING PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS OF 60 BASIS POINTS. ACQUISITIONS DILUTED TOTAL OPERATING MARGINS BY 40 BASIS POINTS PRIMARILY DUE TO AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENTTHE RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME TO TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME IS AS FOLLOWS:18TRANSPORTATIONBUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT PRODUCE COMPONENTS, FASTENERS, FLUIDS AND POLYMERS, AS WELL AS TRUCK REMANUFACTURING AND RELATED PARTS AND SERVICE.IN THE TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDE:•PLASTIC AND METAL COMPONENTS, FASTENERS AND ASSEMBLIES FOR AUTOMOBILES, LIGHT TRUCKS AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL USES;•FLUIDS, POLYMERS AND OTHER SUPPLIES FOR AUTO AFTERMARKET MAINTENANCE AND APPEARANCE;•FILLERS AND PUTTIES FOR AUTO BODY REPAIR;•POLYESTER COATINGS AND PATCH AND REPAIR PRODUCTS FOR THE MARINE INDUSTRY; AND•TRUCK REMANUFACTURING AND RELATED PARTS AND SERVICE.IN 2012, THIS SEGMENT PRIMARILY SERVED THE AUTOMOTIVE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS AND TIERS (53%) AND AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET (31%) MARKETS.THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT FOR 2012, 2011 AND 2010 WERE AS FOLLOWS:IN 2012 AND 2011, THE CHANGES IN REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGINS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 2011 COMPARED TO 2010% INCREASE (DECREASE) % POINT INCREASE(DECREASE) % INCREASE (DECREASE) % POINT INCREASE(DECREASE) OPERATINGREVENUES OPERATINGINCOME OPERATINGMARGINS OPERATINGREVENUES OPERATINGINCOME OPERATINGMARGINSBASE BUSINESS: REVENUE CHANGE/OPERATING LEVERAGE3.5 % 8.0 % 0.7 % 9.7% 23.3 % 1.9 %CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS— (0.9) (0.2) — (6.0) (0.8) 3.5 7.1 0.5 9.7 17.3 1.1ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES2.4 1.5 (0.1) 9.2 7.4 (0.3)RESTRUCTURING COSTS— (1.5) (0.2) — (1.5) (0.2)IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES— — — — — —TRANSLATION(2.8) (3.3) (0.1) 2.4 3.0 0.1OTHER— — — — — — 3.1 % 3.8 % 0.1 % 21.3% 26.2 % 0.7 %OPERATING REVENUESREVENUES INCREASED 3.1% IN 2012 VERSUS 2011 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN BASE BUSINESS AND REVENUES FROM ACQUISITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THESE DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENTS AND A RECONCILIATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE TO THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.30INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONSINCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN 2012 OF $2.5 BILLION ($5.27 PER DILUTED SHARE) WAS 23.7% HIGHER THAN 2011 INCOME OF $2.0 BILLION ($4.08 PER DILUTED SHARE). INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN 2011 WAS 38.9% HIGHER THAN 2010 INCOME OF $1.5 BILLION ($2.89 PER DILUTED SHARE).FOREIGN CURRENCYTHE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2012 VERSUS 2011 DECREASED OPERATING REVENUES BY APPROXIMATELY $466 MILLION IN 2012 AND DECREASED INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY $44 MILLION ($0.09 PER DILUTED SHARE). THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2011 VERSUS 2010 INCREASED OPERATING REVENUES BY APPROXIMATELY $460 MILLION IN 2011 AND INCREASED INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY $51 MILLION ($0.10 PER DILUTED SHARE).INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSINCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WAS $375 MILLION IN 2012 VERSUS $54 MILLION IN 2011 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN AFTER-TAX GAIN OF $372 MILLION ON THE SALE OF THE FINISHING BUSINESS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2012. INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN 2011 WAS HIGHER THAN 2010 INCOME OF $51 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED OPERATING RESULTS IN THE HELD FOR SALE FINISHING BUSINESS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $3 MILLION ON THE SALE OF A DISCONTINUED OPERATION IN 2011 VERSUS AN AFTER-TAX GAIN OF $5 MILLION ON THE SALE OF A DISCONTINUED OPERATION IN 2010. SEE THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY’S DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.2013 SEGMENT CHANGESEFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2013, THE COMPANY MADE CERTAIN CHANGES IN HOW ITS OPERATIONS ARE REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT IN ORDER TO BETTER ALIGN ITS PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSES WITH ITS ENTERPRISE-WIDE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE. AS A RESULT OF THIS REORGANIZATION, THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS WILL BE PROSPECTIVELY AGGREGATED INTO THE FOLLOWING EIGHT EXTERNAL REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING; TEST & MEASUREMENT AND ELECTRONICS; AUTOMOTIVE OEM; POLYMERS & FLUIDS; FOOD EQUIPMENT; CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS; WELDING; AND SPECIALTY PRODUCTS.THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES RESULTING FROM THIS REORGANIZATION INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: •CERTAIN BUSINESSES WITHIN THE FORMER TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET BUSINESS, WILL BE REPORTED IN THE POLYMERS & FLUIDS SEGMENT AND THE TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT WILL BE RENAMED AUTOMOTIVE OEM.•THE WELDING BUSINESS, WHICH WAS FORMERLY REPORTED IN THE POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS SEGMENT, WILL BE REPORTED SEPARATELY AS THE WELDING SEGMENT.•THE ELECTRONICS BUSINESS, WHICH WAS FORMERLY REPORTED IN THE POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS SEGMENT, WILL BE COMBINED WITH THE TEST & MEASUREMENT BUSINESS, WHICH WAS FORMERLY REPORTED IN THE ALL OTHER SEGMENT, TO FORM A NEW TEST & MEASUREMENT AND ELECTRONICS SEGMENT.•THE ALL OTHER SEGMENT WILL BE RENAMED SPECIALTY PRODUCTS.THE 2012 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K HAS NOT BEEN RESTATED FOR THESE CHANGES IN SEGMENT REPORTING. RESULTS FOR 2012 AND PRIOR PERIODS ARE REPORTED ON THE BASIS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY MANAGED ITS BUSINESS IN 2012 AND DO NOT REFLECT THE JANUARY 2013 REORGANIZATION DESCRIBED ABOVE.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESTHE COMPANY’S PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT, TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS, AND TO FUND SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS.THE PRIMARY USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE:•DIVIDEND PAYMENTS – THE COMPANY’S DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINES ARE 30% TO 45% OF THE AVERAGE OF THE LAST TWO YEARS’ FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW;•ACQUISITIONS; AND•SHARE REPURCHASES.31CASH FLOWTHE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW REPRESENTS NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS ADDITIONS TO PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 WAS AS FOLLOWS: ON AUGUST 20, 2007, THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDED FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME (THE “2007 PROGRAM”). UNDER THE 2007 PROGRAM, THE COMPANY MADE REPURCHASES OF APPROXIMATELY 16.3 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $53.51 PER SHARE AND APPROXIMATELY 8.1 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $43.29 PER SHARE DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THERE WERE NO AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THE 2007 PROGRAM.ON MAY 6, 2011, THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $4.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME (THE “2011 PROGRAM”). UNDER THE 2011 PROGRAM, THE COMPANY MADE REPURCHASES OF APPROXIMATELY 1.8 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $43.20 PER SHARE DURING 2011 AND APPROXIMATELY 35.5 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $56.93 PER SHARE DURING 2012. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.9 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THE 2011 PROGRAM.RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITALTHE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (“ROIC”) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS’ USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ROIC IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE PERIOD AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER.32ROIC FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011, AND 2010 WAS AS FOLLOWS: ROIC DECREASED 180 BASIS POINTS IN 2012 VERSUS 2011 AS A RESULT OF AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME DECREASING 7.2% AND AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL. THE DECREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME WAS DUE TO A HIGHER TAX RATE IN 2012 RESULTING FROM DISCRETE TAX CHARGES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012, WHICH INCLUDED THE SETTLEMENT OF AN IRS TAX AUDIT FOR THE YEARS 2008-2009, VERSUS A DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011 FOR AN AUSTRALIAN TAX MATTER. THE FOURTH QUARTER 2012 DISCRETE TAX CHARGES HAD AN UNFAVORABLE 40 BASIS POINT IMPACT ON ROIC IN 2012.ROIC INCREASED 220 BASIS POINTS IN 2011 VERSUS 2010 AS A RESULT OF AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME INCREASING 35.6%, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL. THE INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BASE BUSINESS AND A LOWER TAX RATE IN 2011 RESULTING FROM A DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011 FOR AN AUSTRALIAN TAX MATTER VERSUS A DISCRETE TAX CHARGE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010 FOR THE IMPACT OF THE HEALTH CARE REFORM LEGISLATION. THE FIRST QUARTER 2011 DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT HAD A FAVORABLE 140 BASIS POINT IMPACT ON ROIC IN 2011. WORKING CAPITALMANAGEMENT USES WORKING CAPITAL AS A MEASUREMENT OF THE SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY. NET WORKING CAPITAL AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS:33CASH AND EQUIVALENTS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $2.8 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND $1.2 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, PRIMARILY ALL OF WHICH WAS HELD BY INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXES AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES IF REPATRIATED TO THE U.S. CASH BALANCES HELD INTERNATIONALLY ARE TYPICALLY USED FOR INTERNATIONAL OPERATING NEEDS, REINVESTED TO FUND EXPANSION OF EXISTING INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES, OR USED TO FUND NEW INTERNATIONAL ACQUISITIONS. IN THE U.S., THE COMPANY UTILIZES CASH FLOWS FROM DOMESTIC OPERATIONS TO FUND DOMESTIC CASH NEEDS, WHICH PRIMARILY CONSIST OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES, SERVICING OF DOMESTIC DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, WHICH IS BACKED BY LONG-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES OF $2.5 BILLION, FOR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES CASH GENERATED DOMESTICALLY WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND CASH REQUIREMENTS IN THE U.S.DEBTTOTAL DEBT AND TOTAL DEBT TO CAPITALIZATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011 WERE AS FOLLOWS:THE COMPANY MAY ISSUE COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FUND GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS AND TO FUND SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE COMPANY HAS COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT OF $2.5 BILLION IN THE U.S. TO SUPPORT THE POTENTIAL ISSUANCES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. OF THIS AMOUNT, $1.0 BILLION IS PROVIDED UNDER A LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 10, 2016 AND $1.5 BILLION IS PROVIDED UNDER A LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 8, 2017. NO AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE TWO FACILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2012. THE COMPANY’S FOREIGN OPERATIONS ALSO HAD AUTHORIZED CREDIT FACILITIES OF $337 MILLION OF WHICH $89 MILLION WAS OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012. THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OF APPROXIMATELY $408 MILLION AND $192 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND DECEMBER 31, 2011, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN SHORT-TERM DEBT. THE MAXIMUM OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER BALANCE DURING 2012 WAS $1.5 BILLION WHILE THE AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE WAS $808 MILLION.IN 2012, THE COMPANY ISSUED $1.1 BILLION OF 3.9% NOTES DUE SEPTEMBER 1, 2042 AT 99.038% OF FACE VALUE. THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OF THE NOTES IS 3.955%. THESE NOTES ARE SENIOR UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS, RANKING EQUAL IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT WITH ALL OTHER SENIOR UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS OF THE COMPANY. THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THIS ISSUANCE WERE USED TO REPAY OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER.THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT, BASED ON ITS CURRENT FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW, DEBT TO CAPITALIZATION RATIOS AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY. TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDATHE COMPANY USES THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA TO MEASURE ITS ABILITY TO REPAY ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S LONG TERM FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA. ADJUSTED EBITDA AND THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA REPRESENTS TOTAL DEBT DIVIDED BY INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, GAIN ON SALE OF INTEREST IN DECORATIVE SURFACES, OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ON A TRAILING TWELVE MONTH BASIS.34TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011 WAS AS FOLLOWS:THE COMPANY'S DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA RATIO INCREASED FROM 1.2 TO 1.5 IN 2012 VERSUS 2011 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN LONG-TERM DEBT RELATED TO THE $1.1 BILLION OF 3.9% NOTES THAT WERE ISSUED IN AUGUST 2012.STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITYTHE CHANGES TO STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY DURING 2012 AND 2011 WERE AS FOLLOWS:CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSTHE COMPANY’S SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 WERE AS FOLLOWS:AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED NONCURRENT LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF $108 MILLION. THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE COMPANY HAD OPEN STAND-BY LETTERS OF CREDIT OF APPROXIMATELY $194 MILLION, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH EXPIRE IN 2013 AND 2014. THE COMPANY HAD NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2012.35CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESTHE COMPANY HAS SIX ACCOUNTING POLICIES WHICH IT BELIEVES ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND WHICH REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND IN SOME CASES ON OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION. VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS ARE ALSO USED THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.THE COMPANY'S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE AS FOLLOWS:REALIZABILITY OF INVENTORIES — INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY’S BUSINESSES PERFORM AN ANALYSIS OF THE HISTORICAL SALES USAGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL INVENTORY ITEMS ON HAND AND A RESERVE IS RECORDED TO ADJUST INVENTORY COST TO MARKET VALUE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING USAGE CRITERIA:USAGE CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA RESERVE %ACTIVE QUANTITY ON HAND IS LESS THAN PRIOR 6 MONTHS’ USAGE 0%SLOW-MOVING SOME USAGE IN LAST 12 MONTHS, BUT QUANTITY ON HAND EXCEEDS PRIOR 6 MONTHS’ USAGE 50%OBSOLETE NO USAGE IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS 90%IN ADDITION, FOR APPROXIMATELY 44% OF THE U.S. INVENTORIES, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO USE THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (“LIFO”) METHOD OF INVENTORY COSTING. GENERALLY, THIS METHOD RESULTS IN A LOWER INVENTORY VALUE THAN THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (“FIFO”) METHOD DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION.COLLECTIBILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE — THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS BASED ON THE GREATER OF A SPECIFIC RESERVE OR A RESERVE CALCULATED BASED ON THE HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF PERCENTAGE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. IN ADDITION, THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS INCLUDES RESERVES FOR CUSTOMER CREDITS AND CASH DISCOUNTS, WHICH ARE ALSO ESTIMATED BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE.DEPRECIATION OF PLANT AND EQUIPMENT — THE COMPANY’S U.S. BUSINESSES COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS, AS FOLLOWS:BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS150% DECLINING BALANCEMACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT200% DECLINING BALANCETHE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS TO CONFORM TO THEIR LOCAL STATUTORY ACCOUNTING AND TAX REGULATIONS.INCOME TAXES — THE COMPANY PROVIDES DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX LAWS. THE COMPANY’S DEFERRED AND OTHER TAX BALANCES ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE TAX REGULATIONS AND RULINGS IN NUMEROUS TAXING JURISDICTIONS. INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES RECOGNIZED BY THE COMPANY ALSO REFLECT ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE LEVEL OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, THE EFFECT OF THE COMPANY’S VARIOUS TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES AND UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. FUTURE TAX AUTHORITY RULINGS AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, CHANGES IN PROJECTED LEVELS OF TAXABLE INCOME AND FUTURE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES COULD AFFECT THE ACTUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND TAX BALANCES RECORDED BY THE COMPANY.GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS — THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS TYPICALLY RESULT IN RECORDING GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH ARE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY’S TOTAL ASSETS AND AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT THE COMPANY COULD INCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE GUIDANCE PRESCRIBED IN THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO TEST GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF TRIGGERING EVENTS OCCUR, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ITS 40 REPORTING UNITS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO DETERMINE IF A POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, IF ANY, IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT’S GOODWILL. IN CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS OR SPECIFIC INTANGIBLE ASSETS, MANAGEMENT RELIES ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OPERATING RESULTS, BUSINESS PLANS, ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS, ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER MARKET DATA. THERE ARE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THESE FACTORS AND MANAGEMENT’S JUDGMENT IN APPLYING THEM IN THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE COMPANY HAD TOTAL GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $7.8 BILLION ALLOCATED TO ITS 40 REPORTING UNITS. ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ITS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE COMPANY GENERALLY BELIEVES THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IS LESSENED BY THE 36NUMBER OF DIVERSIFIED BUSINESSES AND END MARKETS REPRESENTED BY ITS 40 REPORTING UNITS THAT HAVE GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES IN MANY OF THE REPORTING UNITS HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, AND IN MANY CASES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPANY’S 80/20 BUSINESS SIMPLIFICATION PROCESS. THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL REPORTING UNITS RANGES FROM APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION TO $1.1 BILLION, WITH THE AVERAGE AMOUNT EQUAL TO $195 MILLION.FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT AND ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE COMPANY’S GLOBAL END MARKETS, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ONE OR MORE REPORTING UNITS COULD OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS.PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS — THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS COMPANY-SPONSORED DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF U.S. EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON EACH PARTICIPANT’S YEARS OF SERVICE, FUTURE COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES. SEE THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES.THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES AS OF THE YEAR-END MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN. THE DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH THE ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES COULD THEORETICALLY BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. IN ESTIMATING THIS RATE, THE COMPANY LOOKS AT RATES OF RETURN ON HIGH-QUALITY FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS, WITH SIMILAR DURATION TO THE LIABILITIES IN THE PLAN. A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN OBLIGATION BY APPROXIMATELY $36 MILLION.THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR SIMILAR INVESTMENT ALLOCATIONS AMONG ASSET CLASSES. FOR THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANY’S ASSUMPTION FOR THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 8.0% FOR 2012 AND WILL BE 8.0% FOR 2013. A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WOULD INCREASE THE ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION. SEE THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY'S PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS AND RELATED ASSUMPTIONS.37ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMARKET RISKTHE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CERTAIN MARKET RISKS WHICH EXIST AS PART OF ITS ONGOING BUSINESS OPERATIONS INCLUDING CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRICE VOLATILITY FOR CERTAIN COMMODITIES AND CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE OR LEVERAGED TRANSACTIONS AND DOES NOT HOLD OR ISSUE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING PURPOSES. INTEREST RATE RISKTHE COMPANY’S EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK FOR CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY’S FIXED RATE DEBT. THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE COMPANY’S DEBT FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGING MARKET INTEREST RATES:FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKTHE COMPANY OPERATES IN THE U.S. AND 57 FOREIGN COUNTRIES. IN GENERAL, THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY MANUFACTURED AND SOLD WITHIN THE SAME COUNTRY. THE INITIAL FUNDING FOR THE FOREIGN MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS WAS PROVIDED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE PERMANENT INVESTMENT OF EQUITY CAPITAL FROM THE U.S. PARENT COMPANY. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT ASSETS OR LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT DERIVATIVES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 OR 2011.IN OCTOBER 2007, THE COMPANY ISSUED €750 MILLION OF 5.25% EURO NOTES DUE OCTOBER 1, 2014. THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS WITH THE EURO AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EURO CASH FLOWS FROM THESE BUSINESSES WILL BE ADEQUATE TO FUND THE DEBT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE NOTES.38ITEM 8.

OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AN OPINION ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDITS.WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS.

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

(THE “COMPANY” OR “ITW”) IS A MULTINATIONAL MANUFACTURER OF A DIVERSIFIED RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT WITH OPERATIONS IN 58 COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY PRIMARILY SERVES THE GENERAL INDUSTRIAL, AUTOMOTIVE OEM/TIERS, AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET, CONSTRUCTION, FOOD AND BEVERAGE, AND FOOD INSTITUTIONAL/RESTAURANT AND SERVICE MARKETS.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES OF THE COMPANY ARE IN ITALICS. CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS OF PRIOR YEARS’ DATA HAVE BEEN MADE TO CONFORM TO CURRENT YEAR REPORTING.THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. THE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES INCLUDED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE RELATED TO INVENTORIES, TRADE RECEIVABLES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INCOME TAXES, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PRODUCT LIABILITY MATTERS, LITIGATION, PRODUCT WARRANTIES, PENSIONS, OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND STOCK BASED COMPENSATION.ON JANUARY 1, 2012, THE COMPANY ADOPTED NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE THAT REQUIRES THE PRESENTATION OF NET INCOME AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME EITHER IN A SINGLE CONTINUOUS FINANCIAL STATEMENT OR IN TWO SEPARATE BUT CONSECUTIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY IS REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN A SEPARATE CONSECUTIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS.INTERNATIONAL REPORTING LAG—PRIOR TO 2011, THE COMPANY’S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA HAD A FISCAL REPORTING PERIOD THAT BEGAN ON DECEMBER 1 AND ENDED ON NOVEMBER 30. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011, THE COMPANY ELIMINATED THE ONE-MONTH LAG FOR THE REPORTING OF ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY IS NOW REPORTING BOTH NORTH AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL RESULTS ON A CALENDAR YEAR BASIS. THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE ELIMINATION OF THE ONE-MONTH REPORTING LAG WAS PREFERABLE BECAUSE THE SAME PERIOD-END REPORTING DATE IMPROVES OVERALL FINANCIAL REPORTING AS THE IMPACT OF CURRENT EVENTS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND GLOBAL TRENDS ARE CONSISTENTLY REFLECTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE NORTH AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES.THE COMPANY APPLIED THIS CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PRIOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PERIODS PRESENTED. THE IMPACT OF THE ELIMINATION OF THE ONE-MONTH REPORTING LAG FOR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 WAS AS FOLLOWS: INCREASE (DECREASE)IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS 2010OPERATING REVENUES $(22)INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS (25)INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS PER DILUTED SHARE (0.04)NET INCOME (24)NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE (0.04) THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ADOPTING THIS CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE WAS RECORDED TO INCOME REINVESTED IN THE BUSINESS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2009.CONSOLIDATION AND TRANSLATION—THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE COMPANY AND ITS MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST. ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS ARE ELIMINATED FROM THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES’ ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE TRANSLATED TO U.S. DOLLARS AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES FOR THE PERIOD. TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY. DIVESTITURE OF MAJORITY INTEREST IN DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT—ON AUGUST 15, 2012, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT (THE “INVESTMENT AGREEMENT”) TO DIVEST A 51% MAJORITY INTEREST IN ITS DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT TO CERTAIN FUNDS MANAGED BY CLAYTON, DUBILIER & RICE, LLC (“CD&R”). THE TRANSACTION CLOSED ON OCTOBER 31, 2012 RESULTING IN A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $933 MILLION ($632 MILLION AFTER-TAX) IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012. 45UNDER THE TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED THE ASSETS AND STOCK OF THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT TO A NEWLY FORMED JOINT VENTURE, WILSONART INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LLC (“WILSONART”). THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CD&R'S EQUITY INVESTMENT IN WILSONART AND NEW THIRD PARTY BORROWINGS BY A SUBSIDIARY OF WILSONART, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES RECEIVED PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.05 BILLION FROM WILSONART AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AS WELL AS COMMON UNITS (THE “COMMON UNITS”) INITIALLY REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 49% (ON AN AS-CONVERTED BASIS) OF THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING EQUITY OF WILSONART IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION. CD&R CONTRIBUTED $395 MILLION TO WILSONART IN EXCHANGE FOR NEWLY ISSUED CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PARTICIPATING PREFERRED UNITS (THE “PREFERRED UNITS”) OF WILSONART INITIALLY REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 51% (ON AN AS-CONVERTED BASIS) OF THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING EQUITY IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION. THE PREFERRED UNITS RANK SENIOR TO THE COMMON UNITS AS TO DIVIDENDS AND LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE. THE PREFERRED UNITS HAVE AN INITIAL LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF $395 MILLION AND ACCRUE DIVIDENDS AT A RATE OF 10.00% PER ANNUM PAYABLE IN CASH OR IN ADDITIONAL PREFERRED UNITS AT THE OPTION OF WILSONART. IN THE EVENT THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS PAID IN ADDITIONAL PREFERRED UNITS EXCEEDS CERTAIN THRESHOLDS, THE DIVIDENDS MAY ACCUMULATE AS CASH DIVIDENDS TO BE PAID AT A LATER DATE, IN WHICH CASE THE DIVIDEND RATE WILL INCREASE TO 12.00% PER ANNUM. DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON THE PREFERRED UNITS MAY BE ELIMINATED IF WILSONART ACHIEVES CERTAIN PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR THREE TWELVE-MONTH PERIODS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT AGREEMENT, WILSONART INCURRED NEW THIRD PARTY INDEBTEDNESS OF APPROXIMATELY $725 MILLION.AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2012, THE COMPANY CEASED CONSOLIDATING THE RESULTS OF THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT AND NOW REPORTS ITS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN WILSONART USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THE COMPANY RECORDED ITS INITIAL EQUITY INVESTMENT IN WILSONART AT FAIR VALUE. THE FAIR VALUE WAS DETERMINED USING AN IMPLIED EQUITY VALUE APPROACH, WHICH IS A LEVEL 3 VALUATION METHOD. UNDER THIS APPROACH, THE TOTAL EQUITY OF WILSONART WAS VALUED USING AN OPTION PRICING MODEL AND THE VALUE OF THE PREFERRED UNITS WAS DEDUCTED TO ARRIVE AT THE IMPLIED EQUITY VALUE OF THE COMMON UNITS. THE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS UTILIZED IN THIS CALCULATION WERE THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE INVESTMENT AND ASSUMED VOLATILITY DURING THE TERM. THE COMPANY ALSO APPLIED A DISCOUNT FACTOR TO THE IMPLIED EQUITY VALUE OF THE COMMON UNITS DUE TO THE LACK OF MARKETABILITY OF THE COMMON UNITS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S RETAINED OWNERSHIP INTEREST WAS DETERMINED TO BE $204 MILLION AND RESULTED IN A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $51 MILLION RELATED TO THE RETAINED INTEREST WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN THE PRE-TAX GAIN NOTED ABOVE. THE COMPANY'S EQUITY INVESTMENT IN WILSONART IS REPORTED IN OTHER ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION. THE COMPANY'S PROPORTIONATE SHARE IN THE INCOME (LOSS) OF WILSONART IS REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. AS THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT IN WILSONART IS STRUCTURED AS A PARTNERSHIP FOR U.S. TAX PURPOSES, U.S. TAXES ARE RECORDED SEPARATELY FROM THE EQUITY INVESTMENT. FOR THE TWO MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE COMPANY RECORDED A LOSS OF $30 MILLION IN OTHER INCOME(EXPENSE) RELATED TO ITS INTEREST IN WILSONART. WILSONART'S LOSS FOR THE TWO MONTH PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO TRANSACTION COSTS RELATED TO THE FORMATION OF WILSONART AND THE IMPACT OF PURCHASE ACCOUNTING.DUE TO THE COMPANY'S CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT THROUGH ITS 49% INTEREST IN WILSONART, THE HISTORICAL OPERATING RESULTS OF DECORATIVE SURFACES ARE PRESENTED IN CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

BASED ON THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY DECREASED ITS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THIS MATTER BY APPROXIMATELY $125 MILLION AND RECORDED AN UNFAVORABLE DISCRETE TAX CHARGE OF $35 MILLION. 51THE COMPANY LITIGATED A DISPUTE WITH THE AUSTRALIAN TAX OFFICE OVER THE TAX TREATMENT OF AN INTERCOMPANY FINANCING TRANSACTION BETWEEN THE U.S. AND AUSTRALIA. THE CASE WAS HEARD BEFORE THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA, VICTORIA, IN SEPTEMBER 2010. THE PROCEEDINGS RESULTED FROM THE COMPANY’S APPEAL OF A DECISION BY THE AUSTRALIAN TAX COMMISSIONER TO DISALLOW INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR THE INCOME TAX YEARS 2002 THROUGH 2005 AND THE ASSESSMENT OF WITHHOLDING TAXES FOR INCOME TAX YEAR 2003. THE COMPANY ALSO CONTESTED THE COMMISSIONER’S SIMILAR DETERMINATION FOR INCOME TAX YEARS 2006 AND 2007; HOWEVER, THE PARTIES AGREED TO FOLLOW THE COURT’S DECISION MADE ON THE EARLIER YEARS. ON FEBRUARY 4, 2011, THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA, VICTORIA, DECIDED IN THE COMPANY’S FAVOR WITH RESPECT TO A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS. THE COURT ISSUED THE FINAL ORDERS ON FEBRUARY 18, 2011. BASED ON THIS DECISION, THE COMPANY DECREASED ITS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THIS MATTER BY APPROXIMATELY $197 MILLION AND RECORDED A FAVORABLE DISCRETE NON-CASH TAX BENEFIT TO REDUCE TAX EXPENSE BY $166 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011. SUBSEQUENT TO THE 2011 RULING, THE AUSTRALIAN TAX OFFICE APPEALED THE TIMING OF CERTAIN OF THE DEDUCTIONS. IN MARCH 2012, THE COURT RULED IN FAVOR OF THE AUSTRALIAN TAX OFFICE REGARDING THE TIMING OF THE DEDUCTIONS, WHICH DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE COMPANY.DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, THE COMPANY RESOLVED AN ISSUE WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE IN THE U.S. RELATED TO A DEDUCTION FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSSES ON AN INTERCOMPANY LOAN THAT RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF APPROXIMATELY $179 MILLION.IN MARCH 2010, THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT WERE SIGNED INTO LAW. AS A RESULT, FUTURE TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR RETIREE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE WILL BE REDUCED BY THE AMOUNT OF SUBSIDIES RECEIVED STARTING IN 2013. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, THE COMPANY RECORDED A DISCRETE TAX CHARGE OF $22 MILLION FOR THE IMPACT OF THE HEALTH CARE REFORM LEGISLATION.THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FILE TAX RETURNS IN THE U.S. AND VARIOUS STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THESE TAX RETURNS ARE ROUTINELY AUDITED BY THE TAX AUTHORITIES IN THESE JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, HER MAJESTY'S REVENUE AND CUSTOMS, GERMAN FISCAL AUTHORITY, FRENCH FISCAL AUTHORITY, AND AUSTRALIAN TAX OFFICE, AND A NUMBER OF THESE AUDITS ARE CURRENTLY ONGOING, WHICH MAY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN FUTURE PERIODS. DUE TO THE ONGOING AUDITS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPANY'S UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS MAY BE DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $39 MILLION RELATED PREDOMINANTLY TO VARIOUS INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED ITS BEST ESTIMATE OF THE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE FOR THESE ISSUES.

INVENTORIES PRICED AT LIFO WERE APPROXIMATELY 21% AND 22% OF TOTAL INVENTORIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (“FIFO”) METHOD, WHICH APPROXIMATES CURRENT COST, IS USED FOR ALL OTHER INVENTORIES. IF THE FIFO METHOD WAS USED FOR ALL INVENTORIES, TOTAL INVENTORIES WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $101 MILLION AND $128 MILLION HIGHER THAN REPORTED AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. 53PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011 WERE AS FOLLOWS: NET PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE STATED AT COST, LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION.

THE FOLLOWING SUMMARIZES THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE MODELS:LATTICE-BASED OPTION VALUATION MODELS, SUCH AS THE BINOMIAL OPTION PRICING MODEL, INCORPORATE RANGES OF ASSUMPTIONS FOR INPUTS. THE RISK-FREE RATE OF INTEREST FOR PERIODS WITHIN THE CONTRACTUAL LIFE OF THE OPTION IS BASED ON A ZERO-COUPON U.S. GOVERNMENT INSTRUMENT OVER THE CONTRACTUAL TERM OF THE EQUITY INSTRUMENT. EXPECTED VOLATILITY IS BASED ON IMPLIED VOLATILITY FROM TRADED OPTIONS ON THE COMPANY’S STOCK AND HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF THE COMPANY’S STOCK. THE COMPANY USES HISTORICAL DATA TO ESTIMATE OPTION EXERCISE TIMING AND EMPLOYEE TERMINATION RATES WITHIN THE VALUATION MODEL. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DIVIDEND YIELD IS BASED ON HISTORICAL INFORMATION. THE EXPECTED TERM OF OPTIONS GRANTED IS DERIVED FROM THE OUTPUT OF THE OPTION VALUATION MODEL AND REPRESENTS THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT OPTIONS GRANTED ARE EXPECTED TO BE OUTSTANDING. THE RANGES PRESENTED RESULT FROM SEPARATE GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES ASSUMED TO EXHIBIT DIFFERENT BEHAVIOR.THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED DURING 2012, 2011 AND 2010 WAS $11.48, $12.34 AND $9.59 PER SHARE, RESPECTIVELY. THE AGGREGATE INTRINSIC VALUE OF OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 WAS $84 MILLION, $63 MILLION AND $56 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 THERE WAS $20 MILLION OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO UNVESTED STOCK OPTIONS. THAT COST IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PERIOD OF 2.4 YEARS. EXERCISE OF OPTIONS DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 RESULTED IN CASH RECEIPTS OF $285 MILLION, $151 MILLION AND $114 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF VESTED STOCK OPTION AWARDS DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 WAS $48 MILLION, $33 MILLION AND $30 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THERE WAS $22 MILLION OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. THAT COST IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING CONTRACTUAL LIFE OF 1.7 YEARS.

EXHIBITS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES(A)(1) FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTHE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS INCLUDED AS PART OF ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSINTRODUCTIONILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. (THE “COMPANY” OR “ITW”) IS A MULTINATIONAL MANUFACTURER OF A DIVERSIFIED RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT WITH OPERATIONS IN 58 COUNTRIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THESE BUSINESSES ARE INTERNALLY REPORTED AS 40 OPERATING SEGMENTS TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANY’S 40 OPERATING SEGMENTS HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED INTO THE FOLLOWING SEVEN EXTERNAL REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: TRANSPORTATION; POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS; INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING; FOOD EQUIPMENT; CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS; POLYMERS & FLUIDS; AND ALL OTHER.DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF DIVERSE BUSINESSES AND THE COMPANY’S DECENTRALIZED OPERATING STRUCTURE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT REQUIRE ITS BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE DETAILED INFORMATION ON OPERATING RESULTS. INSTEAD, THE COMPANY’S CORPORATE MANAGEMENT COLLECTS DATA ON SEVERAL KEY MEASUREMENTS: OPERATING REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME, OPERATING MARGINS, OVERHEAD COSTS, NUMBER OF MONTHS ON HAND IN INVENTORY, DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PAST DUE RECEIVABLES AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. THESE KEY MEASURES ARE MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OPERATING RESULTS VERSUS CURRENT TRENDS IN END MARKETS AND VARIANCES FROM FORECASTS ARE DISCUSSED WITH OPERATING UNIT MANAGEMENT.MANAGEMENT ANALYZES THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE RESULTS OF EACH SEGMENT BY IDENTIFYING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN THE RESULTS OF THE BASE BUSINESSES, NEWLY ACQUIRED AND RECENTLY DIVESTED COMPANIES, RESTRUCTURING COSTS, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AND CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON THE OPERATING REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME OF EACH SEGMENT. BASE BUSINESSES ARE THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR MORE THAN 12 MONTHS. THE CHANGES TO BASE BUSINESS OPERATING INCOME INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF BOTH OPERATING LEVERAGE AND CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS. OPERATING LEVERAGE IS THE ESTIMATED EFFECT OF THE BASE BUSINESS REVENUE VOLUME CHANGES ON OPERATING INCOME, ASSUMING VARIABLE MARGINS REMAIN THE SAME AS THE PRIOR PERIOD. AS MANUFACTURING AND ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD COSTS USUALLY DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE AS A RESULT OF REVENUES INCREASING OR DECREASING, THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN OPERATING INCOME DUE TO OPERATING LEVERAGE IS USUALLY MORE THAN THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE BASE BUSINESS REVENUES. CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED EFFECT OF NON-VOLUME RELATED CHANGES IN BASE BUSINESS OPERATING INCOME AND MAY BE DRIVEN BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX, THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS, LABOR AND OVERHEAD, AND PRICING TO CUSTOMERS. SELLING PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED NET IMPACT OF INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THE COST OF MATERIALS USED IN THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS VERSUS CHANGES IN THE SELLING PRICE TO THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THESE PRICE VERSUS COST COMPARISONS BY ANALYZING THE NET IMPACT OF CHANGES TO EACH SEGMENT'S OPERATING MARGIN.A KEY ELEMENT OF THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS STRATEGY IS ITS CONTINUOUS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS FOR BOTH EXISTING BUSINESSES AND NEW ACQUISITIONS. THE BASIC CONCEPT OF THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS IS TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT (THE 20% OF THE ITEMS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 80% OF THE VALUE) AND TO SPEND LESS TIME AND RESOURCES ON THE LESS IMPORTANT (THE 80% OF THE ITEMS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 20% OF THE VALUE). THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS USE THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS TO SIMPLIFY AND FOCUS ON THE KEY PARTS OF THEIR BUSINESS, AND AS A RESULT, REDUCE COMPLEXITY THAT OFTEN DISGUISES WHAT IS TRULY IMPORTANT. THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS UTILIZE THE 80/20 PROCESS IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THEIR BUSINESSES. COMMON APPLICATIONS OF THE 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS INCLUDE: •SIMPLIFYING PRODUCT LINES BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS OFFERED BY COMBINING THE FEATURES OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS, OUTSOURCING PRODUCTS OR, AS A LAST RESORT, ELIMINATING LOW-VALUE PRODUCTS.•SEGMENTING THE CUSTOMER BASE BY FOCUSING ON THE 80/20 CUSTOMERS SEPARATELY AND FINDING ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO SERVE THE 20/80 CUSTOMERS.•SIMPLIFYING THE SUPPLIER BASE BY PARTNERING WITH 80/20 SUPPLIERS AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF 20/80 SUPPLIERS.•DESIGNING BUSINESS PROCESSES, SYSTEMS AND MEASUREMENTS AROUND THE 80/20 ACTIVITIES.THE RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS IS THAT THE COMPANY HAS OVER TIME IMPROVED ITS LONG-TERM OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THESE 80/20 EFFORTS CAN RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS THAT REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE MARGINS. CORPORATE MANAGEMENT WORKS CLOSELY WITH THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE OPERATING RESULTS BELOW EXPECTATIONS TO HELP THOSE BUSINESSES BETTER APPLY THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS AND IMPROVE THEIR RESULTS.INTERNATIONAL REPORTING CHANGEEFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011, THE COMPANY ELIMINATED THE ONE-MONTH LAG FOR THE REPORTING OF ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY NOW REPORTS BOTH NORTH AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL RESULTS ON A CALENDAR YEAR BASIS. PRIOR TO THIS, THE INTERNATIONAL FISCAL REPORTING PERIOD BEGAN ON DECEMBER 1ST AND ENDED ON NOVEMBER 30TH. THE COMPANY APPLIED THIS CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PRIOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PERIODS PRESENTED. REFER TO THE INTERNATIONAL REPORTING LAG NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR DISCUSSION OF THE INTERNATIONAL REPORTING CHANGE.15DIVESTITURE OF MAJORITY INTEREST IN DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENTON AUGUST 15, 2012, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT (THE “INVESTMENT AGREEMENT”) TO DIVEST A 51% MAJORITY INTEREST IN ITS DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT TO CERTAIN FUNDS MANAGED BY CLAYTON, DUBILIER & RICE, LLC (“CD&R”). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED THE ASSETS AND STOCK OF THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT TO A NEWLY FORMED JOINT VENTURE, WILSONART INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LLC (“WILSONART”). THE TRANSACTION CLOSED ON OCTOBER 31, 2012, REDUCING THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP OF WILSONART TO 49% IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE CLOSE OF THE TRANSACTION. THE COMPANY CEASED CONSOLIDATING THE RESULTS OF THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2012 AND NOW REPORTS ITS 49% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN WILSONART USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THIS TRANSACTION.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSTHE COMPANY PERIODICALLY REVIEWS ITS OPERATIONS FOR BUSINESSES THAT MAY NO LONGER BE ALIGNED WITH ITS LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES. FOR BUSINESSES REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE STATEMENT OF INCOME, ALL RELATED PRIOR PERIOD INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION HAS BEEN RESTATED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR REPORTING OF THESE BUSINESSES. REFER TO THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY’S DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.STRATEGIC REVIEW OF INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENTON FEBRUARY 19, 2013, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT IS INITIATING A REVIEW PROCESS TO EXPLORE STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES FOR ITS INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENT, WHICH MAY INCLUDE A SALE OR SPIN-OFF OF THE BUSINESS.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, THE COMPANY MADE CERTAIN CHANGES IN ITS MANAGEMENT REPORTING STRUCTURE THAT RESULTED IN CHANGES IN SOME OF THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS. THE PRESSURE SENSITIVE ADHESIVES, AND THE STATIC AND CONTAMINATION CONTROL REPORTING UNITS WERE MOVED TO THE POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS SEGMENT FROM THE POLYMERS & FLUIDS AND ALL OTHER SEGMENTS, RESPECTIVELY. THE CHANGES IN THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND UNDERLYING REPORTING UNITS DID NOT RESULT IN ANY GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012, THE COMPANY MADE CERTAIN CHANGES IN ITS MANAGEMENT REPORTING STRUCTURE THAT RESULTED IN CHANGES IN SOME OF THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS. THESE CHANGES PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE INDUSTRIAL FASTENERS REPORTING UNIT, FORMERLY IN THE ALL OTHER SEGMENT, MOVING TO THE TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT; CERTAIN BUSINESSES IN A LATIN AMERICAN REPORTING UNIT, FORMERLY IN THE POLYMERS & FLUIDS SEGMENT, MOVING TO THE TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT; AND A WORLDWIDE INSULATION REPORTING UNIT, FORMERLY IN THE INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENT, MOVING TO THE POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS SEGMENT. THE CHANGES IN THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND UNDERLYING REPORTING UNITS DID NOT RESULT IN ANY GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012. THE PRIOR PERIOD SEGMENT RESULTS HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR REPORTING OF THESE BUSINESSES.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSTHE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2012, 2011 AND 2010 ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS:16IN 2012 AND 2011, THE CHANGES IN REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGINS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: OPERATING REVENUESREVENUES INCREASED 0.8% IN 2012 VERSUS 2011 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER BASE REVENUES AND REVENUES FROM ACQUISITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND THE REDUCTION OF REVENUES DUE TO DIVESTITURES. BASE REVENUES INCREASED 1.7% IN 2012 VERSUS 2011 AS NORTH AMERICAN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WERE STRONGER THAN THE EUROPEAN AND ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS. NORTH AMERICAN BASE REVENUES INCREASED 4.3% IN 2012 VERSUS 2011. INTERNATIONAL BASE REVENUES DECREASED 1.1% AS EUROPE DECREASED 2.3% IN 2012 VERSUS 2011 PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY WEAKNESS IN SOUTHERN EUROPE. ASIA PACIFIC BASE REVENUES INCREASED 1.3% IN 2012 VERSUS 2011 PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN INDIA. ACQUISITIONS CONTRIBUTED 3.1% TO REVENUES PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PURCHASE OF A MANUFACTURER OF SPECIALTY DEVICES USED TO MEASURE THE FLOW OF GASES AND FLUIDS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012 AND A THERMAL PROCESSING AND ENVIRONMENTAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER PURCHASED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011. CURRENCY TRANSLATION RESULTED IN A 2.7% DECLINE IN REVENUES PRIMARILY DUE TO A WEAKER EURO VERSUS THE YEAR AGO PERIOD. DIVESTITURES REDUCED REVENUES BY 1.4% PRIMARILY DUE TO ONLY TEN MONTHS OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT IN 2012 VERSUS TWELVE MONTHS OF OPERATING RESULTS IN 2011 AS THE COMPANY DIVESTED A 51% INTEREST IN THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT ON OCTOBER 31, 2012, AND THE SEGMENT WAS DECONSOLIDATED AS OF THAT DATE.REVENUES INCREASED 15.4% IN 2011 VERSUS 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER BASE REVENUES, REVENUES FROM ACQUISITIONS, AND THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION.

CURRENCY TRANSLATION RESULTED IN A 3.1% INCREASE IN REVENUES PRIMARILY DUE TO A STRONGER EURO AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR VERSUS THE YEAR AGO PERIOD. OPERATING INCOMEOPERATING INCOME INCREASED 4.2% IN 2012 VERSUS 2011 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE POSITIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE EFFECTS OF THE BASE REVENUE INCREASE NOTED ABOVE AND IMPROVED VARIABLE MARGINS. CURRENCY TRANSLATION RESULTED IN A 2.5% DECLINE IN OPERATING INCOME PRIMARILY DUE TO A WEAKER EURO VERSUS THE YEAR AGO PERIOD. HIGHER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES DUE TO INCREASED COST REDUCTION ACTIVITIES ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OPERATING INCOME BY 1.9%. BASE MARGINS INCREASED 110 BASIS POINTS PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED VARIABLE MARGINS AND THE POSITIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE EFFECT OF THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES NOTED ABOVE. CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS IMPROVED BASE MARGINS 70 BASIS POINTS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF SELLING 17PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS OF 50 BASIS POINTS AND BENEFITS OF RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS.

MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT, TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH, TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS, AND TO FUND SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS.THE PRIMARY USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE:•DIVIDEND PAYMENTS – THE COMPANY’S DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINES ARE 30% TO 45% OF THE AVERAGE OF THE LAST TWO YEARS’ FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW;•ACQUISITIONS; AND•SHARE REPURCHASES.31CASH FLOWTHE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW REPRESENTS NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS ADDITIONS TO PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 WAS AS FOLLOWS: ON AUGUST 20, 2007, THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDED FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME (THE “2007 PROGRAM”).

ROIC IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE PERIOD AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER.32ROIC FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011, AND 2010 WAS AS FOLLOWS: ROIC DECREASED 180 BASIS POINTS IN 2012 VERSUS 2011 AS A RESULT OF AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME DECREASING 7.2% AND AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL.

THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THIS ISSUANCE WERE USED TO REPAY OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER.THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT, BASED ON ITS CURRENT FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW, DEBT TO CAPITALIZATION RATIOS AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY. TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDATHE COMPANY USES THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA TO MEASURE ITS ABILITY TO REPAY ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S LONG TERM FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA. ADJUSTED EBITDA AND THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA REPRESENTS TOTAL DEBT DIVIDED BY INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, GAIN ON SALE OF INTEREST IN DECORATIVE SURFACES, OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ON A TRAILING TWELVE MONTH BASIS.34TOTAL DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011 WAS AS FOLLOWS:THE COMPANY'S DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA RATIO INCREASED FROM 1.2 TO 1.5 IN 2012 VERSUS 2011 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN LONG-TERM DEBT RELATED TO THE $1.1 BILLION OF 3.9% NOTES THAT WERE ISSUED IN AUGUST 2012.STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITYTHE CHANGES TO STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY DURING 2012 AND 2011 WERE AS FOLLOWS:CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSTHE COMPANY’S SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 WERE AS FOLLOWS:AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED NONCURRENT LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF $108 MILLION.

MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND IN SOME CASES ON OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION. VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS ARE ALSO USED THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.THE COMPANY'S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE AS FOLLOWS:REALIZABILITY OF INVENTORIES — INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY’S BUSINESSES PERFORM AN ANALYSIS OF THE HISTORICAL SALES USAGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL INVENTORY ITEMS ON HAND AND A RESERVE IS RECORDED TO ADJUST INVENTORY COST TO MARKET VALUE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING USAGE CRITERIA:USAGE CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA RESERVE %ACTIVE QUANTITY ON HAND IS LESS THAN PRIOR 6 MONTHS’ USAGE 0%SLOW-MOVING SOME USAGE IN LAST 12 MONTHS, BUT QUANTITY ON HAND EXCEEDS PRIOR 6 MONTHS’ USAGE 50%OBSOLETE NO USAGE IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS 90%IN ADDITION, FOR APPROXIMATELY 44% OF THE U.S. INVENTORIES, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO USE THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (“LIFO”) METHOD OF INVENTORY COSTING. GENERALLY, THIS METHOD RESULTS IN A LOWER INVENTORY VALUE THAN THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (“FIFO”) METHOD DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION.COLLECTIBILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE — THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS BASED ON THE GREATER OF A SPECIFIC RESERVE OR A RESERVE CALCULATED BASED ON THE HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF PERCENTAGE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. IN ADDITION, THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS INCLUDES RESERVES FOR CUSTOMER CREDITS AND CASH DISCOUNTS, WHICH ARE ALSO ESTIMATED BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE.DEPRECIATION OF PLANT AND EQUIPMENT — THE COMPANY’S U.S. BUSINESSES COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS, AS FOLLOWS:BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS150% DECLINING BALANCEMACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT200% DECLINING BALANCETHE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS TO CONFORM TO THEIR LOCAL STATUTORY ACCOUNTING AND TAX REGULATIONS.INCOME TAXES — THE COMPANY PROVIDES DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX LAWS. THE COMPANY’S DEFERRED AND OTHER TAX BALANCES ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE TAX REGULATIONS AND RULINGS IN NUMEROUS TAXING JURISDICTIONS. INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES RECOGNIZED BY THE COMPANY ALSO REFLECT ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE LEVEL OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, THE EFFECT OF THE COMPANY’S VARIOUS TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES AND UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. FUTURE TAX AUTHORITY RULINGS AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, CHANGES IN PROJECTED LEVELS OF TAXABLE INCOME AND FUTURE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES COULD AFFECT THE ACTUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND TAX BALANCES RECORDED BY THE COMPANY.GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS — THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS TYPICALLY RESULT IN RECORDING GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH ARE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY’S TOTAL ASSETS AND AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT THE COMPANY COULD INCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE GUIDANCE PRESCRIBED IN THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO TEST GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF TRIGGERING EVENTS OCCUR, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ITS 40 REPORTING UNITS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO DETERMINE IF A POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, IF ANY, IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT’S GOODWILL. IN CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS OR SPECIFIC INTANGIBLE ASSETS, MANAGEMENT RELIES ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OPERATING RESULTS, BUSINESS PLANS, ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS, ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER MARKET DATA. THERE ARE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THESE FACTORS AND MANAGEMENT’S JUDGMENT IN APPLYING THEM IN THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE COMPANY HAD TOTAL GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $7.8 BILLION ALLOCATED TO ITS 40 REPORTING UNITS. ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ITS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE COMPANY GENERALLY BELIEVES THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IS LESSENED BY THE 36NUMBER OF DIVERSIFIED BUSINESSES AND END MARKETS REPRESENTED BY ITS 40 REPORTING UNITS THAT HAVE GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES IN MANY OF THE REPORTING UNITS HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, AND IN MANY CASES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPANY’S 80/20 BUSINESS SIMPLIFICATION PROCESS. THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL REPORTING UNITS RANGES FROM APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION TO $1.1 BILLION, WITH THE AVERAGE AMOUNT EQUAL TO $195 MILLION.FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT AND ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE COMPANY’S GLOBAL END MARKETS, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ONE OR MORE REPORTING UNITS COULD OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS.PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS — THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS COMPANY-SPONSORED DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF U.S. EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON EACH PARTICIPANT’S YEARS OF SERVICE, FUTURE COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES. SEE THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES.THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES AS OF THE YEAR-END MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN. THE DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH THE ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES COULD THEORETICALLY BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. IN ESTIMATING THIS RATE, THE COMPANY LOOKS AT RATES OF RETURN ON HIGH-QUALITY FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS, WITH SIMILAR DURATION TO THE LIABILITIES IN THE PLAN. A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN OBLIGATION BY APPROXIMATELY $36 MILLION.THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR SIMILAR INVESTMENT ALLOCATIONS AMONG ASSET CLASSES. FOR THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANY’S ASSUMPTION FOR THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 8.0% FOR 2012 AND WILL BE 8.0% FOR 2013. A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WOULD INCREASE THE ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMARKET RISKTHE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CERTAIN MARKET RISKS WHICH EXIST AS PART OF ITS ONGOING BUSINESS OPERATIONS INCLUDING CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRICE VOLATILITY FOR CERTAIN COMMODITIES AND CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE OR LEVERAGED TRANSACTIONS AND DOES NOT HOLD OR ISSUE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING PURPOSES. INTEREST RATE RISKTHE COMPANY’S EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK FOR CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY’S FIXED RATE DEBT. THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE COMPANY’S DEBT FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGING MARKET INTEREST RATES:FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKTHE COMPANY OPERATES IN THE U.S. AND 57 FOREIGN COUNTRIES. IN GENERAL, THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY MANUFACTURED AND SOLD WITHIN THE SAME COUNTRY. THE INITIAL FUNDING FOR THE FOREIGN MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS WAS PROVIDED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE PERMANENT INVESTMENT OF EQUITY CAPITAL FROM THE U.S. PARENT COMPANY. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT ASSETS OR LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT DERIVATIVES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 OR 2011.IN OCTOBER 2007, THE COMPANY ISSUED €750 MILLION OF 5.25% EURO NOTES DUE OCTOBER 1, 2014. THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS WITH THE EURO AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EURO CASH FLOWS FROM THESE BUSINESSES WILL BE ADEQUATE TO FUND THE DEBT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE NOTES.38ITEM 8.

THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AN OPINION ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDITS.WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS.

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

THE COMPANY PRIMARILY SERVES THE GENERAL INDUSTRIAL, AUTOMOTIVE OEM/TIERS, AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET, CONSTRUCTION, FOOD AND BEVERAGE, AND FOOD INSTITUTIONAL/RESTAURANT AND SERVICE MARKETS.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES OF THE COMPANY ARE IN ITALICS. CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS OF PRIOR YEARS’ DATA HAVE BEEN MADE TO CONFORM TO CURRENT YEAR REPORTING.THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. THE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES INCLUDED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE RELATED TO INVENTORIES, TRADE RECEIVABLES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INCOME TAXES, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PRODUCT LIABILITY MATTERS, LITIGATION, PRODUCT WARRANTIES, PENSIONS, OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND STOCK BASED COMPENSATION.ON JANUARY 1, 2012, THE COMPANY ADOPTED NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE THAT REQUIRES THE PRESENTATION OF NET INCOME AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME EITHER IN A SINGLE CONTINUOUS FINANCIAL STATEMENT OR IN TWO SEPARATE BUT CONSECUTIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY IS REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN A SEPARATE CONSECUTIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS.INTERNATIONAL REPORTING LAG—PRIOR TO 2011, THE COMPANY’S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA HAD A FISCAL REPORTING PERIOD THAT BEGAN ON DECEMBER 1 AND ENDED ON NOVEMBER 30. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011, THE COMPANY ELIMINATED THE ONE-MONTH LAG FOR THE REPORTING OF ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY IS NOW REPORTING BOTH NORTH AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL RESULTS ON A CALENDAR YEAR BASIS. THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE ELIMINATION OF THE ONE-MONTH REPORTING LAG WAS PREFERABLE BECAUSE THE SAME PERIOD-END REPORTING DATE IMPROVES OVERALL FINANCIAL REPORTING AS THE IMPACT OF CURRENT EVENTS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND GLOBAL TRENDS ARE CONSISTENTLY REFLECTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE NORTH AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES.THE COMPANY APPLIED THIS CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PRIOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PERIODS PRESENTED. THE IMPACT OF THE ELIMINATION OF THE ONE-MONTH REPORTING LAG FOR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 WAS AS FOLLOWS: INCREASE (DECREASE)IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS 2010OPERATING REVENUES $(22)INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS (25)INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS PER DILUTED SHARE (0.04)NET INCOME (24)NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE (0.04) THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ADOPTING THIS CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE WAS RECORDED TO INCOME REINVESTED IN THE BUSINESS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2009.CONSOLIDATION AND TRANSLATION—THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE COMPANY AND ITS MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST. ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS ARE ELIMINATED FROM THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES’ ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE TRANSLATED TO U.S. DOLLARS AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES FOR THE PERIOD. TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY. DIVESTITURE OF MAJORITY INTEREST IN DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT—ON AUGUST 15, 2012, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT (THE “INVESTMENT AGREEMENT”) TO DIVEST A 51% MAJORITY INTEREST IN ITS DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT TO CERTAIN FUNDS MANAGED BY CLAYTON, DUBILIER & RICE, LLC (“CD&R”). THE TRANSACTION CLOSED ON OCTOBER 31, 2012 RESULTING IN A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $933 MILLION ($632 MILLION AFTER-TAX) IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012. 45UNDER THE TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED THE ASSETS AND STOCK OF THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT TO A NEWLY FORMED JOINT VENTURE, WILSONART INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LLC (“WILSONART”). THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CD&R'S EQUITY INVESTMENT IN WILSONART AND NEW THIRD PARTY BORROWINGS BY A SUBSIDIARY OF WILSONART, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES RECEIVED PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.05 BILLION FROM WILSONART AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AS WELL AS COMMON UNITS (THE “COMMON UNITS”) INITIALLY REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 49% (ON AN AS-CONVERTED BASIS) OF THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING EQUITY OF WILSONART IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION. CD&R CONTRIBUTED $395 MILLION TO WILSONART IN EXCHANGE FOR NEWLY ISSUED CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PARTICIPATING PREFERRED UNITS (THE “PREFERRED UNITS”) OF WILSONART INITIALLY REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 51% (ON AN AS-CONVERTED BASIS) OF THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING EQUITY IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION. THE PREFERRED UNITS RANK SENIOR TO THE COMMON UNITS AS TO DIVIDENDS AND LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE. THE PREFERRED UNITS HAVE AN INITIAL LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF $395 MILLION AND ACCRUE DIVIDENDS AT A RATE OF 10.00% PER ANNUM PAYABLE IN CASH OR IN ADDITIONAL PREFERRED UNITS AT THE OPTION OF WILSONART. IN THE EVENT THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS PAID IN ADDITIONAL PREFERRED UNITS EXCEEDS CERTAIN THRESHOLDS, THE DIVIDENDS MAY ACCUMULATE AS CASH DIVIDENDS TO BE PAID AT A LATER DATE, IN WHICH CASE THE DIVIDEND RATE WILL INCREASE TO 12.00% PER ANNUM. DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON THE PREFERRED UNITS MAY BE ELIMINATED IF WILSONART ACHIEVES CERTAIN PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR THREE TWELVE-MONTH PERIODS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT AGREEMENT, WILSONART INCURRED NEW THIRD PARTY INDEBTEDNESS OF APPROXIMATELY $725 MILLION.AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2012, THE COMPANY CEASED CONSOLIDATING THE RESULTS OF THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT AND NOW REPORTS ITS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN WILSONART USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THE COMPANY RECORDED ITS INITIAL EQUITY INVESTMENT IN WILSONART AT FAIR VALUE. THE FAIR VALUE WAS DETERMINED USING AN IMPLIED EQUITY VALUE APPROACH, WHICH IS A LEVEL 3 VALUATION METHOD. UNDER THIS APPROACH, THE TOTAL EQUITY OF WILSONART WAS VALUED USING AN OPTION PRICING MODEL AND THE VALUE OF THE PREFERRED UNITS WAS DEDUCTED TO ARRIVE AT THE IMPLIED EQUITY VALUE OF THE COMMON UNITS. THE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS UTILIZED IN THIS CALCULATION WERE THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE INVESTMENT AND ASSUMED VOLATILITY DURING THE TERM. THE COMPANY ALSO APPLIED A DISCOUNT FACTOR TO THE IMPLIED EQUITY VALUE OF THE COMMON UNITS DUE TO THE LACK OF MARKETABILITY OF THE COMMON UNITS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S RETAINED OWNERSHIP INTEREST WAS DETERMINED TO BE $204 MILLION AND RESULTED IN A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $51 MILLION RELATED TO THE RETAINED INTEREST WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN THE PRE-TAX GAIN NOTED ABOVE. THE COMPANY'S EQUITY INVESTMENT IN WILSONART IS REPORTED IN OTHER ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION. THE COMPANY'S PROPORTIONATE SHARE IN THE INCOME (LOSS) OF WILSONART IS REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. AS THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT IN WILSONART IS STRUCTURED AS A PARTNERSHIP FOR U.S. TAX PURPOSES, U.S. TAXES ARE RECORDED SEPARATELY FROM THE EQUITY INVESTMENT. FOR THE TWO MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE COMPANY RECORDED A LOSS OF $30 MILLION IN OTHER INCOME(EXPENSE) RELATED TO ITS INTEREST IN WILSONART. WILSONART'S LOSS FOR THE TWO MONTH PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO TRANSACTION COSTS RELATED TO THE FORMATION OF WILSONART AND THE IMPACT OF PURCHASE ACCOUNTING.DUE TO THE COMPANY'S CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT THROUGH ITS 49% INTEREST IN WILSONART, THE HISTORICAL OPERATING RESULTS OF DECORATIVE SURFACES ARE PRESENTED IN CONTINUING OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, AS OF NOVEMBER 1, 2012, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF DECORATIVE SURFACES ARE NO LONGER REVIEWED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY AND THEREFORE DECORATIVE SURFACES IS NO LONGER A REPORTABLE SEGMENT OF THE COMPANY.HISTORICAL OPERATING RESULTS OF DECORATIVE SURFACES FOR 2012, 2011 AND 2010 WERE AS FOLLOWS:DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS—THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY REVIEWS ITS OPERATIONS FOR BUSINESSES WHICH MAY NO LONGER BE ALIGNED WITH ITS LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES.

THE SALE OF THE FINISHING BUSINESS TO GRACO WAS COMPLETED ON APRIL 2, 2012. THE FINISHING BUSINESS WAS CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2011.IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2011, THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED PLANS TO DIVEST A CONSUMER PACKAGING BUSINESS IN THE ALL OTHER SEGMENT AND AN ELECTRONICS COMPONENTS BUSINESS IN THE POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS SEGMENT.

NO SINGLE CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 5% OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN 2012, 2011 OR 2010.IN OCTOBER 2009, NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE WAS ISSUED ON MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS. THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE AMENDS THE ACCOUNTING FOR MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE ARRANGEMENTS TO ENABLE THE VENDOR TO ACCOUNT FOR PRODUCT OR SERVICES SEPARATELY RATHER THAN AS A COMBINED UNIT. THE GUIDANCE ESTABLISHES A HIERARCHY FOR DETERMINING THE SELLING PRICE OF A DELIVERABLE, WHICH IS BASED ON: (1) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE, (2) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OR (3) ESTIMATES.

THE COMPONENTS OF THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES WERE AS SHOWN BELOW:INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES FOR DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS WAS AS FOLLOWS: 49THE RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE AND THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS AS FOLLOWS: 2012 2011 2010U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 %STATE INCOME TAXES, NET OF U.S. FEDERAL TAX BENEFIT 0.9 1.1 1.2DIFFERENCES BETWEEN U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY AND FOREIGN TAX RATES (2.3) (2.7) (2.0)NONTAXABLE FOREIGN INTEREST INCOME (2.5) (3.6) (3.4)AUSTRALIAN COURT DECISION — (6.4) —TAX EFFECT OF FOREIGN DIVIDENDS 0.6 0.4 0.5TAX RELIEF FOR U.S. MANUFACTURERS (1.1) (1.3) (1.3)OTHER, NET 0.1 (0.3) 0.5EFFECTIVE TAX RATE 30.7 % 22.2 % 30.5 %DEFERRED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON THE REMAINING UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES AS THESE EARNINGS ARE CONSIDERED PERMANENTLY INVESTED. UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES WERE APPROXIMATELY $8.3 BILLION AND $6.3 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. UPON REPATRIATION OF THESE EARNINGS TO THE U.S. IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS OR OTHERWISE, THE COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXES AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES. THE ACTUAL U.S. TAX COST WOULD DEPEND ON INCOME TAX LAWS AND CIRCUMSTANCES AT THE TIME OF DISTRIBUTION. DETERMINATION OF THE RELATED TAX LIABILITY IS NOT PRACTICABLE BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE HYPOTHETICAL CALCULATION.THE COMPONENTS OF DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011 WERE AS FOLLOWS:VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED WHEN IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX BENEFIT OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL NOT BE REALIZED. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCES RECORDED AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011 RELATE PRIMARILY TO CERTAIN NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND CAPITAL LOSS CARRYFORWARDS.50AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE COMPANY HAD NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AVAILABLE TO OFFSET FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME IN THE U.S. AND CERTAIN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, WHICH EXPIRE AS FOLLOWS:THE COMPANY HAS FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS OF $31 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR USE BY THE COMPANY BETWEEN 2013 AND 2022.THE CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS DURING 2012, 2011 AND 2010 WERE AS FOLLOWS:INCLUDED IN THE BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 ARE APPROXIMATELY $249 MILLION OF TAX POSITIONS THAT, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD IMPACT THE COMPANY’S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012, THE COMPANY CAME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE ON ISSUES RELATED PREDOMINATELY TO INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND GLOBAL LEGAL STRUCTURE REORGANIZATION TRANSACTIONS IDENTIFIED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE DURING ITS 2008-2009 AUDIT. BASED ON THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY DECREASED ITS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THIS MATTER BY APPROXIMATELY $125 MILLION AND RECORDED AN UNFAVORABLE DISCRETE TAX CHARGE OF $35 MILLION. 51THE COMPANY LITIGATED A DISPUTE WITH THE AUSTRALIAN TAX OFFICE OVER THE TAX TREATMENT OF AN INTERCOMPANY FINANCING TRANSACTION BETWEEN THE U.S. AND AUSTRALIA. THE CASE WAS HEARD BEFORE THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA, VICTORIA, IN SEPTEMBER 2010. THE PROCEEDINGS RESULTED FROM THE COMPANY’S APPEAL OF A DECISION BY THE AUSTRALIAN TAX COMMISSIONER TO DISALLOW INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR THE INCOME TAX YEARS 2002 THROUGH 2005 AND THE ASSESSMENT OF WITHHOLDING TAXES FOR INCOME TAX YEAR 2003. THE COMPANY ALSO CONTESTED THE COMMISSIONER’S SIMILAR DETERMINATION FOR INCOME TAX YEARS 2006 AND 2007; HOWEVER, THE PARTIES AGREED TO FOLLOW THE COURT’S DECISION MADE ON THE EARLIER YEARS. ON FEBRUARY 4, 2011, THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA, VICTORIA, DECIDED IN THE COMPANY’S FAVOR WITH RESPECT TO A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS. THE COURT ISSUED THE FINAL ORDERS ON FEBRUARY 18, 2011. BASED ON THIS DECISION, THE COMPANY DECREASED ITS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THIS MATTER BY APPROXIMATELY $197 MILLION AND RECORDED A FAVORABLE DISCRETE NON-CASH TAX BENEFIT TO REDUCE TAX EXPENSE BY $166 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011. SUBSEQUENT TO THE 2011 RULING, THE AUSTRALIAN TAX OFFICE APPEALED THE TIMING OF CERTAIN OF THE DEDUCTIONS. IN MARCH 2012, THE COURT RULED IN FAVOR OF THE AUSTRALIAN TAX OFFICE REGARDING THE TIMING OF THE DEDUCTIONS, WHICH DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE COMPANY.DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, THE COMPANY RESOLVED AN ISSUE WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE IN THE U.S. RELATED TO A DEDUCTION FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSSES ON AN INTERCOMPANY LOAN THAT RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF APPROXIMATELY $179 MILLION.IN MARCH 2010, THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT WERE SIGNED INTO LAW. AS A RESULT, FUTURE TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR RETIREE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE WILL BE REDUCED BY THE AMOUNT OF SUBSIDIES RECEIVED STARTING IN 2013. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, THE COMPANY RECORDED A DISCRETE TAX CHARGE OF $22 MILLION FOR THE IMPACT OF THE HEALTH CARE REFORM LEGISLATION.THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FILE TAX RETURNS IN THE U.S. AND VARIOUS STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THESE TAX RETURNS ARE ROUTINELY AUDITED BY THE TAX AUTHORITIES IN THESE JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, HER MAJESTY'S REVENUE AND CUSTOMS, GERMAN FISCAL AUTHORITY, FRENCH FISCAL AUTHORITY, AND AUSTRALIAN TAX OFFICE, AND A NUMBER OF THESE AUDITS ARE CURRENTLY ONGOING, WHICH MAY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN FUTURE PERIODS. DUE TO THE ONGOING AUDITS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPANY'S UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS MAY BE DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $39 MILLION RELATED PREDOMINANTLY TO VARIOUS INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED ITS BEST ESTIMATE OF THE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE FOR THESE ISSUES. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE OPEN TAX YEARS FOR THE COMPANY’S MAJOR JURISDICTIONS:THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO INCOME TAX MATTERS IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THE ACCRUAL FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011 WAS $16 MILLION AND $2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. INCOME PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR THE PERIOD. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS PER DILUTED SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES ASSUMING DILUTION FOR STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. DILUTIVE SHARES REFLECT THE POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL SHARES THAT WOULD BE OUTSTANDING IF THE DILUTIVE STOCK OPTIONS OUTSTANDING WERE EXERCISED AND THE UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS VESTED DURING THE PERIOD. THE COMPUTATION OF INCOME PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WAS AS FOLLOWS:52IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS 2012 2011 2010INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS $2,495 $2,017 $1,452INCOME PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS—BASIC: WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COMMON SHARES 469.8 491.4 500.8INCOME PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS—BASIC $5.31 $4.10 $2.90INCOME PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS—DILUTED: WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COMMON SHARES 469.8 491.4 500.8EFFECT OF DILUTIVE STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS 3.4 3.2 2.5WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COMMON SHARES ASSUMING DILUTION 473.2 494.6 503.3INCOME PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS—DILUTED $5.27 $4.08 $2.89OPTIONS THAT WERE CONSIDERED ANTIDILUTIVE WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED INCOME PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

THESE INTEREST-BEARING INSTRUMENTS HAVE MATURITIES OF 90 DAYS OR LESS AND ARE STATED AT COST, WHICH APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE.TRADE RECEIVABLES WERE NET OF ALLOWANCES FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS. THE CHANGES IN THE ALLOWANCES FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS DURING 2012, 2011 AND 2010 WERE AS FOLLOWS: INVENTORIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011 WERE AS FOLLOWS: INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET AND INCLUDE MATERIAL, LABOR AND FACTORY OVERHEAD. THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (“LIFO”) METHOD IS USED TO DETERMINE THE COST OF THE INVENTORIES OF APPROXIMATELY 44% OF THE U.S. INVENTORIES. INVENTORIES PRICED AT LIFO WERE APPROXIMATELY 21% AND 22% OF TOTAL INVENTORIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (“FIFO”) METHOD, WHICH APPROXIMATES CURRENT COST, IS USED FOR ALL OTHER INVENTORIES. IF THE FIFO METHOD WAS USED FOR ALL INVENTORIES, TOTAL INVENTORIES WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $101 MILLION AND $128 MILLION HIGHER THAN REPORTED AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. 53PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011 WERE AS FOLLOWS: NET PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE STATED AT COST, LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION.

MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED.DEPRECIATION WAS $323 MILLION IN 2012, $334 MILLION IN 2011 AND $328 MILLION IN 2010, AND WAS REFLECTED PRIMARILY IN COST OF REVENUES. DEPRECIATION INCLUDED IN INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WAS $2 MILLION IN 2011 AND $7 MILLION IN 2010. THERE WAS NO DEPRECIATION INCLUDED IN INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN 2012. DEPRECIATION OF PLANT AND EQUIPMENT FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES IS COMPUTED ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS FOR U.S. BUSINESSES AND ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FOR A MAJORITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES.NET PLANT AND EQUIPMENT CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011:THE RANGES OF USEFUL LIVES USED TO DEPRECIATE PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS:BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS 5—50 YEARSMACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT 3—12 YEARSEQUIPMENT LEASED TO OTHERS TERM OF LEASEINVESTMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011 CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING:54LEASES OF EQUIPMENTTHE COMPONENTS OF THE INVESTMENT IN LEASES OF EQUIPMENT AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011 WERE AS SHOWN BELOW:IN MILLIONS 2012 2011LEVERAGED AND DIRECT FINANCING LEASES: GROSS LEASE CONTRACTS RECEIVABLE, NET OF NONRECOURSE DEBT SERVICE $— $130ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE OF LEASED ASSETS 28 248UNEARNED INCOME (1) (110) 27 268EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES 6 7 $33 $275DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES RELATED TO LEASES OF EQUIPMENT WERE $38 MILLION AND $54 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY.THE INVESTMENT IN LEASES OF EQUIPMENT AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011 CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF EQUIPMENT:INCOME FROM LEVERAGED LEASES WAS $5 MILLION, $13 MILLION AND $11 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. UNEARNED INCOME RELATED TO LEVERAGED LEASES IS RECOGNIZED AS LEASE INCOME OVER THE LIFE OF THE LEASE BASED ON THE EFFECTIVE YIELD OF THE LEASE. THE COMPANY ADJUSTS RECOGNITION OF LEASE INCOME ON ITS LEVERAGED LEASES WHEN THERE IS A CHANGE IN THE ASSUMPTIONS AFFECTING TOTAL INCOME OR THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEASE. THE RESIDUAL VALUES OF LEASED ASSETS ARE ESTIMATED AT THE INCEPTION OF THE LEASE BASED ON MARKET APPRAISALS AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY.

THE TAX CREDITS ARE CREDITED TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE AS THEY ARE ALLOCATED TO THE COMPANY.55GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS—GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS COST OVER FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS OF PURCHASED BUSINESSES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS.WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE GOODWILL ASSIGNED TO EACH OF ITS 40 REPORTING UNITS FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE RELEVANT REPORTING UNIT TO THE CARRYING VALUE. THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS VALUATION TECHNIQUES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS, INCLUDING DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS BASED ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT REPORTING UNIT, MARKET MULTIPLES FROM SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS AND QUOTED MARKET PRICES OF RELEVANT PUBLIC COMPANIES. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, IF ANY, IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S GOODWILL.THE COMPANY'S INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONSIST OF TRADEMARKS AND BRANDS. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON A RELIEF-OF-ROYALTY INCOME APPROACH DERIVED FROM INTERNALLY FORECASTED REVENUES OF THE RELATED PRODUCTS.
