DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. (THE COMPANY OR ITW) IS A MULTINATIONAL MANUFACTURER OF A DIVERSIFIED RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT WITH OPERATIONS IN 58 COUNTRIES. THESE BUSINESSES ARE INTERNALLY REPORTED AS 52 OPERATING SEGMENTS TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANYS 52 OPERATING SEGMENTS HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED INTO THE FOLLOWING EIGHT EXTERNAL REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: TRANSPORTATION; POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS; INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING; FOOD EQUIPMENT; CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS; POLYMERS & FLUIDS; DECORATIVE SURFACES; AND ALL OTHER. DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF DIVERSE BUSINESSES AND THE COMPANYS DECENTRALIZED OPERATING STYLE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT REQUIRE ITS BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE DETAILED INFORMATION ON OPERATING RESULTS. INSTEAD, THE COMPANYS CORPORATE MANAGEMENT COLLECTS DATA ON SEVERAL KEY MEASUREMENTS: OPERATING REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME, OPERATING MARGINS, OVERHEAD COSTS, NUMBER OF MONTHS ON HAND IN INVENTORY, DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PAST DUE RECEIVABLES AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. THESE KEY MEASURES ARE MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OPERATING RESULTS VERSUS CURRENT TRENDS IN END MARKETS AND VARIANCES FROM FORECASTS ARE DISCUSSED WITH OPERATING UNIT MANAGEMENT. THE RESULTS OF EACH SEGMENT ARE ANALYZED BY IDENTIFYING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN THE RESULTS OF THE BASE BUSINESSES, NEWLY ACQUIRED COMPANIES, RESTRUCTURING COSTS, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AND CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON THE OPERATING REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME OF EACH SEGMENT. BASE BUSINESSES ARE THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR MORE THAN 12 MONTHS. THE CHANGES TO BASE BUSINESS OPERATING INCOME INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF BOTH OPERATING LEVERAGE AND CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS. OPERATING LEVERAGE IS THE ESTIMATED EFFECT OF THE BASE BUSINESS REVENUE CHANGES ON OPERATING INCOME, ASSUMING VARIABLE MARGINS REMAIN THE SAME AS THE PRIOR PERIOD. AS MANUFACTURING AND ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD COSTS USUALLY DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE AS A RESULT OF REVENUES INCREASING OR DECREASING, THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN OPERATING INCOME DUE TO OPERATING LEVERAGE IS USUALLY MORE THAN THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE BASE BUSINESS REVENUES. A KEY ELEMENT OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS STRATEGY IS ITS CONTINUOUS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS FOR BOTH EXISTING BUSINESSES AND NEW ACQUISITIONS. THE BASIC CONCEPT OF THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS IS TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT (THE 20% OF THE ITEMS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 80% OF THE VALUE) AND TO SPEND LESS TIME AND RESOURCES ON THE LESS IMPORTANT (THE 80% OF THE ITEMS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 20% OF THE VALUE). THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS USE THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS TO SIMPLIFY AND FOCUS ON THE KEY PARTS OF THEIR BUSINESS, AND AS A RESULT, REDUCE COMPLEXITY THAT OFTEN DISGUISES WHAT IS TRULY IMPORTANT. THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS UTILIZE THE 80/20 PROCESS IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THEIR BUSINESSES. COMMON APPLICATIONS OF THE 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS INCLUDE:  SIMPLIFYING PRODUCT LINES BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS OFFERED BY COMBINING THE FEATURES OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS, OUTSOURCING PRODUCTS OR, AS A LAST RESORT, ELIMINATING LOW-VALUE PRODUCTS.  SEGMENTING THE CUSTOMER BASE BY FOCUSING ON THE 80/20 CUSTOMERS SEPARATELY AND FINDING ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO SERVE THE 20/80 CUSTOMERS.  SIMPLIFYING THE SUPPLIER BASE BY PARTNERING WITH 80/20 SUPPLIERS AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF 20/80 SUPPLIERS.  DESIGNING BUSINESS PROCESSES, SYSTEMS AND MEASUREMENTS AROUND THE 80/20 ACTIVITIES. THE RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS IS THAT THE COMPANY HAS OVER TIME IMPROVED ITS LONG-TERM OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THESE 80/20 EFFORTS CAN RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS THAT REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE MARGINS. CORPORATE MANAGEMENT WORKS CLOSELY WITH THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE OPERATING RESULTS BELOW EXPECTATIONS TO HELP THOSE BUSINESSES BETTER APPLY THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS AND IMPROVE THEIR RESULTS. 13 INTERNATIONAL REPORTING CHANGE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011, THE COMPANY ELIMINATED THE ONE MONTH LAG FOR THE REPORTING OF ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY NOW REPORTS BOTH NORTH AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL RESULTS ON A CALENDAR YEAR BASIS. PRIOR TO THIS, THE INTERNATIONAL FISCAL REPORTING PERIOD BEGAN ON DECEMBER 1ST AND ENDED ON NOVEMBER 30TH. THE COMPANY HAS APPLIED THIS CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PRIOR PERIOD FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED. REFER TO THE INTERNATIONAL REPORTING LAG NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR DISCUSSION OF THE INTERNATIONAL REPORTING CHANGE. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY REVIEWS ITS OPERATIONS FOR BUSINESSES THAT MAY NO LONGER BE ALIGNED WITH ITS LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES. FOR BUSINESSES REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE STATEMENT OF INCOME, ALL RELATED PRIOR PERIOD INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION HAS BEEN RESTATED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR REPORTING OF THESE BUSINESSES. REFER TO THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT, TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS, TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH AND TO FUND SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE PRIMARY USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE:  DIVIDEND PAYMENTS  THE COMPANYS DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINES ARE 30% TO 45% OF THE AVERAGE OF THE LAST TWO YEARS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW;  ACQUISITIONS; AND  ANY EXCESS LIQUIDITY MAY BE USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES. CASH FLOW THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES.

RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ROIC IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE PERIOD AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. ROIC FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010, AND 2009 WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE 220 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC IN 2011 VERSUS 2010 WAS THE RESULT OF AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME INCREASING 35.6%, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BASE BUSINESS AND A FAVORABLE TAX RATE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL. THE 400 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC IN 2010 VERSUS 2009 WAS THE RESULT OF AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME INCREASING 41.9%, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BASE BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LESS FAVORABLE TAX RATE AND A SLIGHT INCREASE IN AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL. 28 WORKING CAPITAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: CASH AND EQUIVALENTS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND DECEMBER 31, 2010, PRIMARILY ALL OF WHICH WAS HELD BY INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXES AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES IF REPATRIATED TO THE UNITED STATES. CASH BALANCES HELD INTERNATIONALLY ARE TYPICALLY USED FOR INTERNATIONAL OPERATING NEEDS, REINVESTED TO FUND EXPANSION OF EXISTING INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES, OR USED TO FUND NEW INTERNATIONAL ACQUISITIONS. IN THE U.S., THE COMPANY UTILIZES CASH FLOWS FROM DOMESTIC OPERATIONS TO FUND DOMESTIC CASH NEEDS WHICH PRIMARILY CONSIST OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES, SERVICING OF DOMESTIC DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES OF $2.5 BILLION FOR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES CASH GENERATED DOMESTICALLY WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND CASH REQUIREMENTS IN THE U.S. DEBT TOTAL DEBT AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010 WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE COMPANY ISSUES COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FUND GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS AND TO FUND SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE COMPANY HAS COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT OF $2.5 BILLION IN THE U.S. TO SUPPORT THE POTENTIAL ISSUANCES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. OF THIS AMOUNT, $1.0 BILLION IS PROVIDED UNDER A LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 10, 2016 AND $1.0 BILLION IS PROVIDED UNDER A LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 11, 2013. THE REMAINING $500.0 MILLION IS PROVIDED UNDER A REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT TERMINATES ON JUNE 15, 2012. NO AMOUNTS ARE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE THREE FACILITIES. THE COMPANYS FOREIGN OPERATIONS ALSO HAVE UNUSED CAPACITY ON UNCOMMITTED FACILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $329 MILLION. THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OF APPROXIMATELY $192.5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN SHORT-TERM DEBT, AND NO OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE MAXIMUM OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER BALANCE DURING 2011 WAS $1.8 BILLION WHILE THE AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE WAS $744.9 MILLION. 29 IN AUGUST 2011, THE COMPANY ISSUED $350.0 MILLION OF 3.375% NOTES DUE SEPTEMBER 15, 2021 AT 99.552% OF FACE VALUE AND $650.0 MILLION OF 4.875% NOTES DUE SEPTEMBER 15, 2041 AT 98.539% OF FACE VALUE. THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES OF THE NOTES ARE 3.4% AND 4.9%, RESPECTIVELY. THESE NOTES ARE SENIOR UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS, RANKING EQUAL IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT WITH ALL OTHER SENIOR UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS OF THE COMPANY. THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THESE ISSUANCES WERE USED TO REPAY OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED ON ITS CURRENT FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW, DEBT-TO-CAPITALIZATION RATIOS AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY. THE COMPANYS TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO IS 20% TO 30%, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ANY LARGER ACQUISITIONS. TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA THE COMPANY USES THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA TO MEASURE ITS ABILITY TO REPAY ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANYS LONG TERM FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA. THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA REPRESENTS TOTAL DEBT DIVIDED BY INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ON A TRAILING TWELVE MONTH BASIS. TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010 WAS AS FOLLOWS: STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY THE CHANGES TO STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY DURING 2011 AND 2010 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 30 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THE COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 WERE AS FOLLOWS: AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED NONCURRENT LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF $187.8 MILLION. THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE COMPANY HAD OPEN STAND-BY LETTERS OF CREDIT OF APPROXIMATELY $213.0 MILLION, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH EXPIRE IN 2012 AND 2013. THE COMPANY HAD NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2011. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES THE COMPANY HAS SIX ACCOUNTING POLICIES WHICH IT BELIEVES ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND WHICH REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE AS FOLLOWS: REALIZABILITY OF INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. GENERALLY, THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES PERFORM AN ANALYSIS OF THE HISTORICAL SALES USAGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL INVENTORY ITEMS ON HAND AND A RESERVE IS RECORDED TO ADJUST INVENTORY COST TO MARKET VALUE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING USAGE CRITERIA: USAGE CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA RESERVE % ACTIVE QUANTITY ON HAND IS LESS THAN PRIOR 6 MONTHS USAGE 0 % SLOW-MOVING SOME USAGE IN LAST 12 MONTHS, BUT QUANTITY ON HAND EXCEEDS PRIOR 6 MONTHS USAGE 50 % OBSOLETE NO USAGE IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS 90 % IN ADDITION, FOR APPROXIMATELY 44% OF THE U.S. INVENTORIES, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO USE THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD OF INVENTORY COSTING. GENERALLY, THIS METHOD RESULTS IN A LOWER INVENTORY VALUE THAN THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) METHOD DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION. COLLECTIBILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS BASED ON THE GREATER OF A SPECIFIC RESERVE OR A RESERVE CALCULATED BASED ON THE HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF PERCENTAGE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. IN ADDITION, THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS INCLUDES RESERVES FOR CUSTOMER CREDITS AND CASH DISCOUNTS, WHICH ARE ALSO ESTIMATED BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE. DEPRECIATION OF PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  THE COMPANYS U.S. BUSINESSES COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS, AS FOLLOWS: BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS 150% DECLINING BALANCE MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT 200% DECLINING BALANCE THE MAJORITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS TO CONFORM TO THEIR LOCAL STATUTORY ACCOUNTING AND TAX REGULATIONS. 31 INCOME TAXES  THE COMPANY PROVIDES DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX LAWS. THE COMPANYS DEFERRED AND OTHER TAX BALANCES ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS INTERPRETATION OF THE TAX REGULATIONS AND RULINGS IN NUMEROUS TAXING JURISDICTIONS. INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES RECOGNIZED BY THE COMPANY ALSO REFLECT ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE LEVEL OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, THE EFFECT OF THE COMPANYS VARIOUS TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES AND UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. FUTURE TAX AUTHORITY RULINGS AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, CHANGES IN PROJECTED LEVELS OF TAXABLE INCOME AND FUTURE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES COULD AFFECT THE ACTUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND TAX BALANCES RECORDED BY THE COMPANY. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  THE COMPANYS BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS TYPICALLY RESULT IN RECORDING GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH ARE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL ASSETS AND AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT THE COMPANY COULD INCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE GUIDANCE PRESCRIBED IN THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO TEST GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF TRIGGERING EVENTS OCCUR, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ITS 52 REPORTING UNITS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO DETERMINE IF A POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, IF ANY, IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL. IN CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS OR SPECIFIC INTANGIBLE ASSETS, MANAGEMENT RELIES ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OPERATING RESULTS, BUSINESS PLANS, ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS, ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER MARKET DATA. THERE ARE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THESE FACTORS AND MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT IN APPLYING THEM IN THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE COMPANY HAD TOTAL GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $7.4 BILLION ALLOCATED TO ITS 52 REPORTING UNITS. ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ITS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE COMPANY GENERALLY BELIEVES THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IS LESSENED BY THE NUMBER OF DIVERSIFIED BUSINESSES AND END MARKETS REPRESENTED BY ITS 52 REPORTING UNITS THAT HAVE GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES IN MANY OF THE REPORTING UNITS HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, AND IN MANY CASES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPANYS 80/20 BUSINESS SIMPLIFICATION PROCESS. THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL REPORTING UNITS RANGE FROM APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION TO $830 MILLION, WITH THE AVERAGE AMOUNT EQUAL TO $140 MILLION. FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT AND ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE COMPANYS GLOBAL END MARKETS, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ONE OR MORE REPORTING UNITS COULD OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS  THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS COMPANY-SPONSORED DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF U.S. EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON EACH PARTICIPANTS YEARS OF SERVICE, FUTURE COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATES. SEE THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES. THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES AS OF THE DECEMBER 31 MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN. THE DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH THE ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES COULD THEORETICALLY BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. IN ESTIMATING THIS RATE, THE COMPANY LOOKS AT RATES OF RETURN ON HIGH-QUALITY FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS, WITH SIMILAR DURATION TO THE LIABILITIES IN THE PLAN. A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN OBLIGATION BY APPROXIMATELY $32 MILLION. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR SIMILAR INVESTMENT ALLOCATIONS AMONG ASSET CLASSES. FOR THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTION FOR THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 8.0% FOR 2011 AND WILL BE 8.0% FOR 2012. A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WOULD INCREASE THE ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION. SEE THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR INFORMATION ON HOW THIS RATE IS DETERMINED. 32 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK MARKET RISK INTEREST RATE RISK THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK FOR CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANYS DEBT. THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE COMPANYS DEBT FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGING MARKET INTEREST RATES: FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK THE COMPANY OPERATES IN THE UNITED STATES AND 57 OTHER COUNTRIES. IN GENERAL, THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY MANUFACTURED AND SOLD WITHIN THE SAME COUNTRY. THE INITIAL FUNDING FOR THE FOREIGN MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS WAS PROVIDED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE PERMANENT INVESTMENT OF EQUITY CAPITAL FROM THE U.S. PARENT COMPANY. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT ASSETS OR LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT DERIVATIVES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 OR 2010. IN OCTOBER 2007, THE COMPANY ISSUED 750.0 MILLION OF 5.25% EURO NOTES DUE OCTOBER 1, 2014. THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS WITH THE EURO AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EURO CASH FLOWS FROM THESE BUSINESSES WILL BE ADEQUATE TO FUND THE DEBT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE NOTES. 33 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING THE MANAGEMENT OF ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. (THE COMPANY OR ITW) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(F). ITWS INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE TO THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING THE PREPARATION AND FAIR PRESENTATION OF PUBLISHED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALL INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED, HAVE INHERENT LIMITATIONS. THEREFORE, EVEN THOSE SYSTEMS DETERMINED TO BE EFFECTIVE CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION. ITW MANAGEMENT ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011. IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT, IT USED THE CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO) IN INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK. BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT WE BELIEVE THAT, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS EFFECTIVE BASED ON THOSE CRITERIA. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT HEREIN. /S/ DAVID B. SPEER DAVID B. SPEER CHAIRMAN & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER FEBRUARY 17, 2012 /S/ RONALD D. KROPP RONALD D. KROPP SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT & CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER FEBRUARY 17, 2012 34 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC.: WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION OF ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010, AND THE RELATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, INCOME REINVESTED IN THE BUSINESS, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011. WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE. IN OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

INTERNATIONAL REPORTING LAG INTERNATIONAL REPORTING LAG  PRIOR TO 2011, THE COMPANYS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA HAD A FISCAL REPORTING PERIOD THAT BEGAN ON DECEMBER 1 AND ENDED ON NOVEMBER 30. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011, THE COMPANY ELIMINATED THE ONE MONTH LAG FOR THE REPORTING OF ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY IS NOW REPORTING BOTH NORTH AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL RESULTS ON A CALENDAR YEAR BASIS. THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE ELIMINATION OF THE ONE MONTH REPORTING LAG WAS PREFERABLE BECAUSE THE SAME PERIOD-END REPORTING DATE IMPROVES OVERALL FINANCIAL REPORTING AS THE IMPACT OF CURRENT EVENTS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND GLOBAL TRENDS ARE CONSISTENTLY REFLECTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE NORTH AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNITS. THE COMPANY HAS APPLIED THIS CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PRIOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PERIODS PRESENTED.

REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES FOR THE PERIOD. TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY REVIEWS ITS OPERATIONS FOR BUSINESSES WHICH MAY NO LONGER BE ALIGNED WITH ITS LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES. IN APRIL 2011, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO SELL ITS FINISHING GROUP OF BUSINESSES INCLUDED WITHIN THE ALL OTHER SEGMENT TO GRACO INC. IN A $650,000,000 CASH TRANSACTION. IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC) FILED A COMPLAINT CHALLENGING GRACOS ACQUISITION OF THE FINISHING BUSINESS. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO DIVEST THE FINISHING BUSINESS IN 2012. THE FINISHING BUSINESS HAS BEEN CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2011. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2011, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED PLANS TO DIVEST A CONSUMER PACKAGING BUSINESS IN THE ALL OTHER SEGMENT AND AN ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS BUSINESS IN THE POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS SEGMENT. THE ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS BUSINESS WAS SOLD IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO DIVEST THE CONSUMER PACKAGING BUSINESS IN 2012.

ON JANUARY 1, 2009, THE COMPANY ADOPTED NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO RECOGNIZE ASSETS ACQUIRED, LIABILITIES ASSUMED, CONTRACTUAL CONTINGENCIES AND CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION AT THEIR FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE.

THE COMPANY ALSO CONTESTED THE COMMISSIONERS SIMILAR DETERMINATION FOR INCOME TAX YEARS 2006 AND 2007; HOWEVER, THE PARTIES AGREED TO FOLLOW THE COURTS DECISION MADE ON THE EARLIER YEARS. ON FEBRUARY 4, 2011, THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA, VICTORIA, DECIDED IN THE COMPANYS FAVOR WITH RESPECT TO A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS.

THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. ON JANUARY 1, 2009, THE COMPANY ADOPTED NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR ALL NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND NONFINANCIAL LIABILITIES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS. THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE DEFINES FAIR VALUE AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE AND THE NECESSARY DISCLOSURES.

THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS VALUATION TECHNIQUES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS, INCLUDING DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS BASED ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT REPORTING UNIT, MARKET MULTIPLES AND QUOTED MARKET PRICES OF RELEVANT PUBLIC COMPANIES. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, IF ANY, IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL. THE COMPANYS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONSIST OF TRADEMARKS AND BRANDS. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON A RELIEF-OF-ROYALTY INCOME APPROACH DERIVED FROM INTERNALLY FORECASTED REVENUES OF THE RELATED PRODUCTS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TRADEMARK OR BRAND IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND CARRYING VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET.

THE PRSUS PROVIDE FOR FULL CLIFF VESTING AFTER THREE YEARS IF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE CERTIFIES THAT THE PERFORMANCE GOALS SET WITH RESPECT TO THE PRSU HAVE BEEN MET. UPON VESTING, THE HOLDER WILL RECEIVE ONE SHARE OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY FOR EACH VESTED RSU OR PRSU. OPTION EXERCISE PRICES ARE EQUAL TO THE COMMON STOCK FAIR MARKET VALUE ON THE DATE OF GRANT. STOCK OPTIONS WERE GRANTED ON 1,758,420 SHARES AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $55.71 PER SHARE. ADDITIONALLY, 550,308 RSUS AND PRSUS WERE ISSUED AT THE GRANT DATE SHARE PRICE OF $55.71. THE FAIR VALUE OF RSUS AND PRSUS IS DETERMINED BY REDUCING THE CLOSING MARKET PRICE ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT BY THE PRESENT VALUE OF PROJECTED DIVIDENDS OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. THE COMPANY USES A BINOMIAL OPTION PRICING MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED. THE FOLLOWING SUMMARIZES THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE MODELS: LATTICE-BASED OPTION VALUATION MODELS, SUCH AS THE BINOMIAL OPTION PRICING MODEL, INCORPORATE RANGES OF ASSUMPTIONS FOR INPUTS. THE RISK-FREE RATE OF INTEREST FOR PERIODS WITHIN THE CONTRACTUAL LIFE OF THE OPTION IS BASED ON A ZERO-COUPON U.S. GOVERNMENT INSTRUMENT OVER THE CONTRACTUAL TERM OF THE EQUITY INSTRUMENT. EXPECTED VOLATILITY IS BASED ON IMPLIED VOLATILITY FROM TRADED OPTIONS ON THE COMPANYS STOCK AND HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF THE COMPANYS STOCK. THE COMPANY USES HISTORICAL DATA TO ESTIMATE OPTION EXERCISE TIMING AND EMPLOYEE TERMINATION RATES WITHIN THE VALUATION MODEL. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DIVIDEND YIELD IS BASED ON HISTORICAL INFORMATION. THE EXPECTED TERM OF OPTIONS GRANTED IS DERIVED FROM THE OUTPUT OF THE OPTION VALUATION MODEL AND REPRESENTS THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT OPTIONS GRANTED ARE EXPECTED TO BE OUTSTANDING. THE RANGES PRESENTED RESULT FROM SEPARATE GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES ASSUMED TO EXHIBIT DIFFERENT BEHAVIOR. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED DURING 2012, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 WAS $11.48, $12.34, $9.59 AND $10.24 PER SHARE, RESPECTIVELY.

EXHIBITS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES (A)(1) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS INCLUDED AS PART OF DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. (THE COMPANY OR ITW) IS A MULTINATIONAL MANUFACTURER OF A DIVERSIFIED RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT WITH OPERATIONS IN 58 COUNTRIES. THESE BUSINESSES ARE INTERNALLY REPORTED AS 52 OPERATING SEGMENTS TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANYS 52 OPERATING SEGMENTS HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED INTO THE FOLLOWING EIGHT EXTERNAL REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: TRANSPORTATION; POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS; INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING; FOOD EQUIPMENT; CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS; POLYMERS & FLUIDS; DECORATIVE SURFACES; AND ALL OTHER. DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF DIVERSE BUSINESSES AND THE COMPANYS DECENTRALIZED OPERATING STYLE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT REQUIRE ITS BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE DETAILED INFORMATION ON OPERATING RESULTS. INSTEAD, THE COMPANYS CORPORATE MANAGEMENT COLLECTS DATA ON SEVERAL KEY MEASUREMENTS: OPERATING REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME, OPERATING MARGINS, OVERHEAD COSTS, NUMBER OF MONTHS ON HAND IN INVENTORY, DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PAST DUE RECEIVABLES AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. THESE KEY MEASURES ARE MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OPERATING RESULTS VERSUS CURRENT TRENDS IN END MARKETS AND VARIANCES FROM FORECASTS ARE DISCUSSED WITH OPERATING UNIT MANAGEMENT. THE RESULTS OF EACH SEGMENT ARE ANALYZED BY IDENTIFYING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN THE RESULTS OF THE BASE BUSINESSES, NEWLY ACQUIRED COMPANIES, RESTRUCTURING COSTS, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AND CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON THE OPERATING REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME OF EACH SEGMENT. BASE BUSINESSES ARE THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR MORE THAN 12 MONTHS. THE CHANGES TO BASE BUSINESS OPERATING INCOME INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF BOTH OPERATING LEVERAGE AND CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS. OPERATING LEVERAGE IS THE ESTIMATED EFFECT OF THE BASE BUSINESS REVENUE CHANGES ON OPERATING INCOME, ASSUMING VARIABLE MARGINS REMAIN THE SAME AS THE PRIOR PERIOD. AS MANUFACTURING AND ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD COSTS USUALLY DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE AS A RESULT OF REVENUES INCREASING OR DECREASING, THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN OPERATING INCOME DUE TO OPERATING LEVERAGE IS USUALLY MORE THAN THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE BASE BUSINESS REVENUES. A KEY ELEMENT OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS STRATEGY IS ITS CONTINUOUS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS FOR BOTH EXISTING BUSINESSES AND NEW ACQUISITIONS. THE BASIC CONCEPT OF THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS IS TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT (THE 20% OF THE ITEMS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 80% OF THE VALUE) AND TO SPEND LESS TIME AND RESOURCES ON THE LESS IMPORTANT (THE 80% OF THE ITEMS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 20% OF THE VALUE). THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS USE THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS TO SIMPLIFY AND FOCUS ON THE KEY PARTS OF THEIR BUSINESS, AND AS A RESULT, REDUCE COMPLEXITY THAT OFTEN DISGUISES WHAT IS TRULY IMPORTANT. THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS UTILIZE THE 80/20 PROCESS IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THEIR BUSINESSES. COMMON APPLICATIONS OF THE 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS INCLUDE:  SIMPLIFYING PRODUCT LINES BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS OFFERED BY COMBINING THE FEATURES OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS, OUTSOURCING PRODUCTS OR, AS A LAST RESORT, ELIMINATING LOW-VALUE PRODUCTS.  SEGMENTING THE CUSTOMER BASE BY FOCUSING ON THE 80/20 CUSTOMERS SEPARATELY AND FINDING ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO SERVE THE 20/80 CUSTOMERS.  SIMPLIFYING THE SUPPLIER BASE BY PARTNERING WITH 80/20 SUPPLIERS AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF 20/80 SUPPLIERS.  DESIGNING BUSINESS PROCESSES, SYSTEMS AND MEASUREMENTS AROUND THE 80/20 ACTIVITIES. THE RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS IS THAT THE COMPANY HAS OVER TIME IMPROVED ITS LONG-TERM OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THESE 80/20 EFFORTS CAN RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS THAT REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE MARGINS. CORPORATE MANAGEMENT WORKS CLOSELY WITH THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE OPERATING RESULTS BELOW EXPECTATIONS TO HELP THOSE BUSINESSES BETTER APPLY THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS AND IMPROVE THEIR RESULTS. 13 INTERNATIONAL REPORTING CHANGE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011, THE COMPANY ELIMINATED THE ONE MONTH LAG FOR THE REPORTING OF ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY NOW REPORTS BOTH NORTH AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL RESULTS ON A CALENDAR YEAR BASIS. PRIOR TO THIS, THE INTERNATIONAL FISCAL REPORTING PERIOD BEGAN ON DECEMBER 1ST AND ENDED ON NOVEMBER 30TH. THE COMPANY HAS APPLIED THIS CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PRIOR PERIOD FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED. REFER TO THE INTERNATIONAL REPORTING LAG NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR DISCUSSION OF THE INTERNATIONAL REPORTING CHANGE. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY REVIEWS ITS OPERATIONS FOR BUSINESSES THAT MAY NO LONGER BE ALIGNED WITH ITS LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES. FOR BUSINESSES REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE STATEMENT OF INCOME, ALL RELATED PRIOR PERIOD INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION HAS BEEN RESTATED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR REPORTING OF THESE BUSINESSES. REFER TO THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

END MARKETS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSPORTATION, WELDING, INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING, PC BOARD FABRICATION AND ELECTRONICS SHOWED IMPROVEMENT IN 2010. 14 OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 21.2% IN 2011 VERSUS 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES, THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND INCOME FROM ACQUISITIONS. BASE MARGINS INCREASED 120 BASIS POINTS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE POSITIVE LEVERAGE EFFECT OF THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF SELLING PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS. ADDITIONALLY, ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES DILUTED MARGINS BY 40 BASIS POINTS PRIMARILY DUE TO AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 63.0% IN 2010 VERSUS 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES, LOWER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, AND 2009 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. BASE MARGINS INCREASED 300 BASIS POINTS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE POSITIVE LEVERAGE EFFECT OF THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES. ADDITIONALLY, BENEFITS FROM RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE SELLING PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS. LOWER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES IN 2010 VERSUS 2009 REFLECT THE COMPANYS 2009 EFFORTS TO REDUCE COSTS IN RESPONSE TO WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IN 2009, THE COMPANY RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $90.0 MILLION AND $15.6 MILLION AGAINST GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO $1.0 MILLION IN INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN 2010.

BASE MARGINS INCREASED 230 BASIS POINTS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE POSITIVE LEVERAGE EFFECT FROM THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES AND BENEFITS FROM PAST RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE SELLING PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS. IN ADDITION, LOWER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES INCREASED TOTAL OPERATING MARGINS BY 110 BASIS POINTS. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES DILUTED TOTAL OPERATING MARGINS BY 70 BASIS POINTS IN 2010. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMORTIZATION EXPENSE INCREASED TO $255.3 MILLION IN 2011 AND $207.4 MILLION IN 2010, VERSUS $197.5 MILLION IN 2009, DUE TO INTANGIBLE ASSET AMORTIZATION FOR NEWLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. 25 IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN 2011, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT WHICH RESULTED IN NO GOODWILL OR OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. TOTAL GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES BY SEGMENT FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 WERE AS FOLLOWS: IN THOUSANDS 2010 2009 TRANSPORTATION $  $ 12,347 POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS  85,043 INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING  386 FOOD EQUIPMENT  53 POLYMERS & FLUIDS  4,122 ALL OTHER 1,006 3,617 $ 1,006 $ 105,568 THE 2009 CHARGES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO THE PRESSURE SENSITIVE ADHESIVES REPORTING UNIT OF $60.0 MILLION, THE PC BOARD FABRICATION REPORTING UNIT OF $18.0 MILLION AND THE TRUCK REMANUFACTURING AND RELATED PARTS AND SERVICE REPORTING UNIT OF $12.0 MILLION. SEE THE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR FURTHER DETAILS OF THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $192.1 MILLION IN 2011 WHICH INCLUDES INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE 3.375% AND 4.875% NOTES ISSUED IN LATE AUGUST 2011, VERSUS $175.2 MILLION IN 2010. INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $175.2 MILLION IN 2010 VERSUS $164.6 MILLION IN 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEREST ON THE 6.25% AND 5.15% NOTES WHICH WERE ISSUED IN MARCH 2009, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST RELATED TO THE 5.75% NOTES, WHICH WERE REPAID AT MATURITY IN MARCH 2009, AND LOWER COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON COMMERCIAL PAPER WAS 0.1% IN 2011, 0.2% IN 2010 AND 0.3% IN 2009. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) WAS INCOME OF $53.8 MILLION IN 2011 VERSUS $10.0 MILLION IN 2010. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST INCOME OF $40.3 MILLION (VERSUS $24.1 MILLION IN 2010), LOWER LOSSES ON FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS OF $4.3 MILLION (VERSUS $16.7 MILLION IN 2010) AND GAINS ON DISPOSAL OF OPERATING AFFILIATES OF $1.8 MILLION (VERSUS LOSSES OF $8.0 MILLION IN 2010). OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) WAS INCOME OF $10.0 MILLION IN 2010 VERSUS EXPENSE OF $4.5 MILLION IN 2009. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INCOME FROM INVESTMENTS OF $20.8 MILLION (VERSUS $4.9 MILLION IN 2009). INCOME TAXES THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 22.2% IN 2011, 30.5% IN 2010, AND 20.2% IN 2009. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2011 WAS FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY THE DISCRETE NON-CASH TAX BENEFIT OF $165.9 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011 RELATED TO THE DECISION IN THE COMPANYS FAVOR BY THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA, VICTORIA WITH RESPECT TO A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS THAT HAD BEEN CHALLENGED BY THE AUSTRALIAN TAX OFFICE. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2010 WAS UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED BY THE DISCRETE TAX CHARGE OF $21.9 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010 RELATED TO THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2009 WAS FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF $85.5 MILLION RELATED TO A GLOBAL LEGAL STRUCTURE REORGANIZATION AND $77.5 MILLION RELATED TO A FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT REACHED WITH THE GERMAN TAX AUTHORITIES. IN THE ABOVE MENTIONED REORGANIZATION, THE COMPANY REORGANIZED ITS OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE IN CERTAIN U.S. AND FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009 AND MADE AN ELECTION REGARDING THE U.S. TAX TREATMENT OF A FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY. THE COMPANY RECORDED A REDUCTION IN TAX EXPENSE PRIMARILY FOR THE EFFECT OF THE RESULTING FOREIGN TAX CREDITS. ALSO DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009, THE COMPANY FINALIZED A SETTLEMENT WITH THE GERMAN TAX AUTHORITIES PRIMARILY REGARDING THE TREATMENT OF AN INTERCOMPANY FINANCING TRANSACTION WHICH RESULTED IN THE REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED TAX RESERVES AS A REDUCTION OF TAX EXPENSE. SEE THE INCOME TAXES NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THESE DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENTS AND A RECONCILIATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE TO THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN 2011 OF $2.0 BILLION ($4.08 PER DILUTED SHARE) WAS 38.9% HIGHER THAN 2010 INCOME OF $1.5 BILLION ($2.89 PER DILUTED SHARE). INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN 2010 WAS 49.9% HIGHER THAN 2009 INCOME OF $968.6 MILLION ($1.93 PER DILUTED SHARE). 26 FOREIGN CURRENCY THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2011 VERSUS 2010 INCREASED OPERATING REVENUES BY APPROXIMATELY $460 MILLION IN 2011 AND INCREASED INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY 10 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN 2010 VERSUS 2009 INCREASED OPERATING REVENUES BY APPROXIMATELY $70 MILLION IN 2010 AND INCREASED INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY 4 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WAS $54.4 MILLION IN 2011 VERSUS $50.5 MILLION IN 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED OPERATING RESULTS IN THE HELD FOR SALE FINISHING BUSINESSES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN AFTER-TAX LOSS ON THE SALE OF A DISCONTINUED OPERATION IN 2011 VERSUS AN AFTER-TAX GAIN IN 2010. INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WAS $50.5 MILLION IN 2010 VERSUS $4.1 MILLION IN 2009 DUE TO IMPROVED OPERATING RESULTS IN THE HELD FOR SALE FINISHING BUSINESSES AND AN AFTER-TAX GAIN ON THE SALE OF A DISCONTINUED OPERATION IN 2010 VERSUS AFTER-TAX LOSSES IN 2009. SEE THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT, TO CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS, TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH AND TO FUND SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE PRIMARY USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE:  DIVIDEND PAYMENTS  THE COMPANYS DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINES ARE 30% TO 45% OF THE AVERAGE OF THE LAST TWO YEARS FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW;  ACQUISITIONS; AND  ANY EXCESS LIQUIDITY MAY BE USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES. CASH FLOW THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 WAS AS FOLLOWS: 27 ON AUGUST 20, 2007, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME (THE 2007 PROGRAM). UNDER THE 2007 PROGRAM, THE COMPANY MADE REPURCHASES OF APPROXIMATELY 16.3 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $53.51 AND APPROXIMATELY 8.1 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $43.29 DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THERE WERE NO AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THE 2007 PROGRAM. ON MAY 6, 2011, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $4.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME (THE 2011 PROGRAM). THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE COMPANY MADE REPURCHASES OF APPROXIMATELY 1.8 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $43.20. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY $3.9 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THE 2011 PROGRAM. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ROIC IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE PERIOD AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. ROIC FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010, AND 2009 WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE 220 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC IN 2011 VERSUS 2010 WAS THE RESULT OF AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME INCREASING 35.6%, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BASE BUSINESS AND A FAVORABLE TAX RATE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL. THE 400 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC IN 2010 VERSUS 2009 WAS THE RESULT OF AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME INCREASING 41.9%, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BASE BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LESS FAVORABLE TAX RATE AND A SLIGHT INCREASE IN AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL. 28 WORKING CAPITAL NET WORKING CAPITAL AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: CASH AND EQUIVALENTS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND DECEMBER 31, 2010, PRIMARILY ALL OF WHICH WAS HELD BY INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXES AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES IF REPATRIATED TO THE UNITED STATES. CASH BALANCES HELD INTERNATIONALLY ARE TYPICALLY USED FOR INTERNATIONAL OPERATING NEEDS, REINVESTED TO FUND EXPANSION OF EXISTING INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES, OR USED TO FUND NEW INTERNATIONAL ACQUISITIONS. IN THE U.S., THE COMPANY UTILIZES CASH FLOWS FROM DOMESTIC OPERATIONS TO FUND DOMESTIC CASH NEEDS WHICH PRIMARILY CONSIST OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES, SERVICING OF DOMESTIC DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES OF $2.5 BILLION FOR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES CASH GENERATED DOMESTICALLY WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND CASH REQUIREMENTS IN THE U.S. DEBT TOTAL DEBT AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010 WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE COMPANY ISSUES COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FUND GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS AND TO FUND SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE COMPANY HAS COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT OF $2.5 BILLION IN THE U.S. TO SUPPORT THE POTENTIAL ISSUANCES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. OF THIS AMOUNT, $1.0 BILLION IS PROVIDED UNDER A LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 10, 2016 AND $1.0 BILLION IS PROVIDED UNDER A LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 11, 2013. THE REMAINING $500.0 MILLION IS PROVIDED UNDER A REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT TERMINATES ON JUNE 15, 2012. NO AMOUNTS ARE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE THREE FACILITIES. THE COMPANYS FOREIGN OPERATIONS ALSO HAVE UNUSED CAPACITY ON UNCOMMITTED FACILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $329 MILLION. THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OF APPROXIMATELY $192.5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN SHORT-TERM DEBT, AND NO OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE MAXIMUM OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER BALANCE DURING 2011 WAS $1.8 BILLION WHILE THE AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE WAS $744.9 MILLION. 29 IN AUGUST 2011, THE COMPANY ISSUED $350.0 MILLION OF 3.375% NOTES DUE SEPTEMBER 15, 2021 AT 99.552% OF FACE VALUE AND $650.0 MILLION OF 4.875% NOTES DUE SEPTEMBER 15, 2041 AT 98.539% OF FACE VALUE. THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES OF THE NOTES ARE 3.4% AND 4.9%, RESPECTIVELY. THESE NOTES ARE SENIOR UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS, RANKING EQUAL IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT WITH ALL OTHER SENIOR UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS OF THE COMPANY. THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THESE ISSUANCES WERE USED TO REPAY OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED ON ITS CURRENT FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW, DEBT-TO-CAPITALIZATION RATIOS AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY. THE COMPANYS TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO IS 20% TO 30%, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ANY LARGER ACQUISITIONS. TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA THE COMPANY USES THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA TO MEASURE ITS ABILITY TO REPAY ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANYS LONG TERM FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA. THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA REPRESENTS TOTAL DEBT DIVIDED BY INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ON A TRAILING TWELVE MONTH BASIS. TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010 WAS AS FOLLOWS: STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY THE CHANGES TO STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY DURING 2011 AND 2010 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 30 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THE COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 WERE AS FOLLOWS: AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED NONCURRENT LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF $187.8 MILLION. THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE COMPANY HAD OPEN STAND-BY LETTERS OF CREDIT OF APPROXIMATELY $213.0 MILLION, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH EXPIRE IN 2012 AND 2013. THE COMPANY HAD NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2011. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES THE COMPANY HAS SIX ACCOUNTING POLICIES WHICH IT BELIEVES ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND WHICH REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE AS FOLLOWS: REALIZABILITY OF INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. GENERALLY, THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES PERFORM AN ANALYSIS OF THE HISTORICAL SALES USAGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL INVENTORY ITEMS ON HAND AND A RESERVE IS RECORDED TO ADJUST INVENTORY COST TO MARKET VALUE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING USAGE CRITERIA: USAGE CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA RESERVE % ACTIVE QUANTITY ON HAND IS LESS THAN PRIOR 6 MONTHS USAGE 0 % SLOW-MOVING SOME USAGE IN LAST 12 MONTHS, BUT QUANTITY ON HAND EXCEEDS PRIOR 6 MONTHS USAGE 50 % OBSOLETE NO USAGE IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS 90 % IN ADDITION, FOR APPROXIMATELY 44% OF THE U.S. INVENTORIES, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO USE THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD OF INVENTORY COSTING. GENERALLY, THIS METHOD RESULTS IN A LOWER INVENTORY VALUE THAN THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) METHOD DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION. COLLECTIBILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS BASED ON THE GREATER OF A SPECIFIC RESERVE OR A RESERVE CALCULATED BASED ON THE HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF PERCENTAGE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. IN ADDITION, THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS INCLUDES RESERVES FOR CUSTOMER CREDITS AND CASH DISCOUNTS, WHICH ARE ALSO ESTIMATED BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE. DEPRECIATION OF PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  THE COMPANYS U.S. BUSINESSES COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS, AS FOLLOWS: BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS 150% DECLINING BALANCE MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT 200% DECLINING BALANCE THE MAJORITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS TO CONFORM TO THEIR LOCAL STATUTORY ACCOUNTING AND TAX REGULATIONS. 31 INCOME TAXES  THE COMPANY PROVIDES DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX LAWS. THE COMPANYS DEFERRED AND OTHER TAX BALANCES ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS INTERPRETATION OF THE TAX REGULATIONS AND RULINGS IN NUMEROUS TAXING JURISDICTIONS. INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES RECOGNIZED BY THE COMPANY ALSO REFLECT ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE LEVEL OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, THE EFFECT OF THE COMPANYS VARIOUS TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES AND UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. FUTURE TAX AUTHORITY RULINGS AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, CHANGES IN PROJECTED LEVELS OF TAXABLE INCOME AND FUTURE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES COULD AFFECT THE ACTUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND TAX BALANCES RECORDED BY THE COMPANY. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  THE COMPANYS BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS TYPICALLY RESULT IN RECORDING GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH ARE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL ASSETS AND AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT THE COMPANY COULD INCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE GUIDANCE PRESCRIBED IN THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO TEST GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF TRIGGERING EVENTS OCCUR, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ITS 52 REPORTING UNITS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO DETERMINE IF A POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, IF ANY, IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL. IN CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS OR SPECIFIC INTANGIBLE ASSETS, MANAGEMENT RELIES ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OPERATING RESULTS, BUSINESS PLANS, ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS, ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER MARKET DATA. THERE ARE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THESE FACTORS AND MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT IN APPLYING THEM IN THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE COMPANY HAD TOTAL GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $7.4 BILLION ALLOCATED TO ITS 52 REPORTING UNITS. ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ITS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE COMPANY GENERALLY BELIEVES THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IS LESSENED BY THE NUMBER OF DIVERSIFIED BUSINESSES AND END MARKETS REPRESENTED BY ITS 52 REPORTING UNITS THAT HAVE GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES IN MANY OF THE REPORTING UNITS HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, AND IN MANY CASES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPANYS 80/20 BUSINESS SIMPLIFICATION PROCESS. THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL REPORTING UNITS RANGE FROM APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION TO $830 MILLION, WITH THE AVERAGE AMOUNT EQUAL TO $140 MILLION. FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT AND ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE COMPANYS GLOBAL END MARKETS, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ONE OR MORE REPORTING UNITS COULD OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS  THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS COMPANY-SPONSORED DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF U.S. EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON EACH PARTICIPANTS YEARS OF SERVICE, FUTURE COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATES. SEE THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES. THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES AS OF THE DECEMBER 31 MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN. THE DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH THE ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES COULD THEORETICALLY BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. IN ESTIMATING THIS RATE, THE COMPANY LOOKS AT RATES OF RETURN ON HIGH-QUALITY FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS, WITH SIMILAR DURATION TO THE LIABILITIES IN THE PLAN. A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN OBLIGATION BY APPROXIMATELY $32 MILLION. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR SIMILAR INVESTMENT ALLOCATIONS AMONG ASSET CLASSES. FOR THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTION FOR THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 8.0% FOR 2011 AND WILL BE 8.0% FOR 2012. A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WOULD INCREASE THE ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION. SEE THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR INFORMATION ON HOW THIS RATE IS DETERMINED. 32 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK MARKET RISK INTEREST RATE RISK THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK FOR CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANYS DEBT. THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE COMPANYS DEBT FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGING MARKET INTEREST RATES: FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK THE COMPANY OPERATES IN THE UNITED STATES AND 57 OTHER COUNTRIES. IN GENERAL, THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY MANUFACTURED AND SOLD WITHIN THE SAME COUNTRY. THE INITIAL FUNDING FOR THE FOREIGN MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS WAS PROVIDED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE PERMANENT INVESTMENT OF EQUITY CAPITAL FROM THE U.S. PARENT COMPANY. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT ASSETS OR LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT DERIVATIVES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 OR 2010. IN OCTOBER 2007, THE COMPANY ISSUED 750.0 MILLION OF 5.25% EURO NOTES DUE OCTOBER 1, 2014. THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS WITH THE EURO AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EURO CASH FLOWS FROM THESE BUSINESSES WILL BE ADEQUATE TO FUND THE DEBT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE NOTES. 33 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING THE MANAGEMENT OF ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. (THE COMPANY OR ITW) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(F). ITWS INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE TO THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING THE PREPARATION AND FAIR PRESENTATION OF PUBLISHED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALL INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED, HAVE INHERENT LIMITATIONS. THEREFORE, EVEN THOSE SYSTEMS DETERMINED TO BE EFFECTIVE CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION. ITW MANAGEMENT ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011. IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT, IT USED THE CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO) IN INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK. BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT WE BELIEVE THAT, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS EFFECTIVE BASED ON THOSE CRITERIA. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT HEREIN. /S/ DAVID B. SPEER DAVID B. SPEER CHAIRMAN & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER FEBRUARY 17, 2012 /S/ RONALD D. KROPP RONALD D. KROPP SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT & CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER FEBRUARY 17, 2012 34 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC.: WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION OF ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010, AND THE RELATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, INCOME REINVESTED IN THE BUSINESS, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011. WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE. IN OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC.

ON JANUARY 1, 2009, THE COMPANY ADOPTED NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO RECOGNIZE ASSETS ACQUIRED, LIABILITIES ASSUMED, CONTRACTUAL CONTINGENCIES AND CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION AT THEIR FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE. THE NEW GUIDANCE ALSO REQUIRES PROSPECTIVELY THAT (1) ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS BE EXPENSED AS INCURRED; (2) RESTRUCTURING COSTS GENERALLY BE RECOGNIZED AS A POST-ACQUISITION EXPENSE; AND (3) CHANGES IN DEFERRED TAX ASSET VALUATION ALLOWANCES AND INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES AFTER THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD IMPACT INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

THE GUIDANCE ESTABLISHES A HIERARCHY FOR DETERMINING THE SELLING PRICE OF A DELIVERABLE, WHICH IS BASED ON: (1) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE, (2) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OR (3) ESTIMATES.

THE COMPONENTS OF THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES WERE AS SHOWN BELOW: 43 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES FOR DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE AND THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS AS FOLLOWS: 2011 2010 2009 U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % STATE INCOME TAXES, NET OF U.S. FEDERAL TAX BENEFIT 1.1 1.2 0.8 NONDEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT   2.5 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY AND FOREIGN TAX RATES (2.7 ) (2.0 ) (3.3 ) NONTAXABLE FOREIGN INTEREST INCOME (3.6 ) (3.4 ) (4.6 ) FOREIGN TAX CREDIT RELATED TO A GLOBAL LEGAL STRUCTURE REORGANIZATION   (7.0 ) GERMAN TAX AUDIT SETTLEMENT   (4.7 ) AUSTRALIAN COURT DECISION (6.4 )   TAX EFFECT OF FOREIGN DIVIDENDS 0.4 0.5 1.3 TAX RELIEF FOR U.S. MANUFACTURERS (1.3 ) (1.3 ) (0.7 ) OTHER, NET (0.3 ) 0.5 0.9 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE 22.2 % 30.5 % 20.2 % DEFERRED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON THE REMAINING UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES OF APPROXIMATELY $6,300,000,000 AND $5,700,000,000 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY, AS THESE EARNINGS ARE CONSIDERED PERMANENTLY INVESTED. UPON REPATRIATION OF THESE EARNINGS TO THE U.S. IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS OR OTHERWISE, THE COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXES AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES. THE ACTUAL U.S. TAX COST WOULD DEPEND ON INCOME TAX LAWS AND CIRCUMSTANCES AT THE TIME OF DISTRIBUTION. DETERMINATION OF THE RELATED TAX LIABILITY IS NOT PRACTICABLE BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE HYPOTHETICAL CALCULATION. THE COMPONENTS OF DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010 WERE AS FOLLOWS: VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED WHEN IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX BENEFIT OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL NOT BE REALIZED. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCES RECORDED AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010 RELATE PRIMARILY TO CERTAIN NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND CAPITAL LOSS CARRYFORWARDS. 44 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE COMPANY HAD NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AVAILABLE TO OFFSET FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME IN THE U.S. AND CERTAIN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, WHICH EXPIRE AS FOLLOWS: THE COMPANY HAS FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYOVERS OF $871,000 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND $94,100,000 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR USE BY THE COMPANY BETWEEN 2012 AND 2020.

THE CASE WAS HEARD BEFORE THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA, VICTORIA, IN SEPTEMBER 2010. THE PROCEEDINGS RESULTED FROM THE COMPANYS APPEAL OF A DECISION BY THE AUSTRALIAN TAX COMMISSIONER TO DISALLOW INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR THE INCOME TAX YEARS 2002 THROUGH 2005 AND THE ASSESSMENT OF WITHHOLDING TAXES FOR INCOME TAX YEAR 2003. THE COMPANY ALSO CONTESTED THE COMMISSIONERS SIMILAR DETERMINATION FOR INCOME TAX YEARS 2006 AND 2007; HOWEVER, THE PARTIES AGREED TO FOLLOW THE COURTS DECISION MADE ON THE EARLIER YEARS. ON FEBRUARY 4, 2011, THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA, VICTORIA, DECIDED IN THE COMPANYS FAVOR WITH RESPECT TO A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS. THE COURT ISSUED THE FINAL ORDERS ON FEBRUARY 18, 2011. BASED ON THIS DECISION, THE COMPANY DECREASED ITS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THIS MATTER BY APPROXIMATELY $197,000,000 AND RECORDED A FAVORABLE DISCRETE NON-CASH TAX BENEFIT TO REDUCE TAX EXPENSE BY $165,927,000 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011. THE AUSTRALIAN TAX OFFICE HAS APPEALED THE TIMING OF CERTAIN OF THE DEDUCTIONS, THE OUTCOME OF WHICH IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, THE COMPANY RESOLVED AN ISSUE WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE IN THE UNITED STATES RELATED TO A DEDUCTION FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSSES ON AN INTERCOMPANY LOAN THAT RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF APPROXIMATELY $179,000,000. 45 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED) IN MARCH 2010, THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT WERE SIGNED INTO LAW.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, THE COMPANY RECORDED A DISCRETE TAX CHARGE OF $21,881,000 FOR THE IMPACT OF THE HEALTH CARE REFORM LEGISLATION. THE COMPANY SETTLED SEVERAL ITEMS DURING 2009 RELATED TO ITS GERMAN AND U.S. TAX AUDITS.

THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. ON JANUARY 1, 2009, THE COMPANY ADOPTED NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR ALL NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND NONFINANCIAL LIABILITIES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS. THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE DEFINES FAIR VALUE AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE AND THE NECESSARY DISCLOSURES. WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE GOODWILL ASSIGNED TO EACH OF ITS 52 REPORTING UNITS FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE RELEVANT REPORTING UNIT TO THE CARRYING VALUE. THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS VALUATION TECHNIQUES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS, INCLUDING DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS BASED ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT REPORTING UNIT, MARKET MULTIPLES AND QUOTED MARKET PRICES OF RELEVANT PUBLIC COMPANIES. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, IF ANY, IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL. THE COMPANYS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONSIST OF TRADEMARKS AND BRANDS. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON A RELIEF-OF-ROYALTY INCOME APPROACH DERIVED FROM INTERNALLY FORECASTED REVENUES OF THE RELATED PRODUCTS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TRADEMARK OR BRAND IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND CARRYING VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET.
