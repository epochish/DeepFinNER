ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSINTRODUCTIONILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. (THE "COMPANY" OR "ITW") IS A GLOBAL MANUFACTURER OF A DIVERSIFIED RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT WITH 85 DIVISIONS IN 56 COUNTRIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, THE COMPANY EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 50,000 PEOPLE.THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS ARE ORGANIZED AND MANAGED BASED ON SIMILAR PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND END MARKETS, AND ARE REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT AS THE FOLLOWING SEVEN SEGMENTS: AUTOMOTIVE OEM; FOOD EQUIPMENT; TEST & MEASUREMENT AND ELECTRONICS; WELDING; POLYMERS & FLUIDS; CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS; AND SPECIALTY PRODUCTS.DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF DIVERSE BUSINESSES AND THE COMPANY'S DECENTRALIZED OPERATING STRUCTURE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT REQUIRE ITS BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE DETAILED INFORMATION ON OPERATING RESULTS. INSTEAD, THE COMPANY'S CORPORATE MANAGEMENT COLLECTS DATA ON SEVERAL KEY MEASUREMENTS: OPERATING REVENUE, OPERATING INCOME, OPERATING MARGIN, OVERHEAD COSTS, NUMBER OF MONTHS ON HAND IN INVENTORY, DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PAST DUE RECEIVABLES AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. THESE KEY MEASURES ARE MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OPERATING RESULTS VERSUS CURRENT TRENDS IN END MARKETS AND VARIANCES FROM FORECASTS ARE DISCUSSED WITH OPERATING UNIT MANAGEMENT.THE ITW BUSINESS MODELTHE POWERFUL AND HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED ITW BUSINESS MODEL IS THE COMPANY’S CORE SOURCE OF VALUE CREATION. THIS BUSINESS MODEL IS THE COMPANY’S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND DEFINES HOW ITW CREATES VALUE FOR ITS SHAREHOLDERS AND COMPRISES THREE UNIQUE ELEMENTS:•ITW’S 80/20 FRONT TO BACK PROCESS IS THE OPERATING SYSTEM THAT IS APPLIED IN EVERY ITW BUSINESS. INITIALLY INTRODUCED AS A MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY TOOL IN THE 1980S, ITW HAS CONTINUALLY REFINED, IMPROVED AND EXPANDED 80/20 INTO A PROPRIETARY, HOLISTIC BUSINESS MANAGEMENT PROCESS THAT GENERATES SIGNIFICANT VALUE FOR THE COMPANY AND ITS CUSTOMERS. THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF DATA-DRIVEN INSIGHTS GENERATED BY 80/20 PRACTICE, ITW FOCUSES ON ITS LARGEST AND BEST OPPORTUNITIES (THE “80”) AND ELIMINATES COST, COMPLEXITY AND DISTRACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LESS PROFITABLE OPPORTUNITIES (THE “20”). 80/20 ENABLES ITW BUSINESSES TO CONSISTENTLY ACHIEVE WORLD-CLASS OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE IN PRODUCT AVAILABILITY, QUALITY, AND INNOVATION, WHILE GENERATING SUPERIOR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE;•CUSTOMER-BACK INNOVATION HAS FUELED DECADES OF PROFITABLE GROWTH AT ITW. THE COMPANY’S UNIQUE INNOVATION APPROACH IS BUILT ON INSIGHT GATHERED FROM THE 80/20 FRONT TO BACK PROCESS. WORKING FROM THE CUSTOMER BACK, ITW BUSINESSES POSITION THEMSELVES AS THE GO-TO PROBLEM SOLVER FOR THEIR “80” CUSTOMERS. ITW’S INNOVATION EFFORTS ARE FOCUSED ON UNDERSTANDING CUSTOMER NEEDS, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN “80” MARKETS WITH SOLID LONG-TERM GROWTH FUNDAMENTALS, AND SUBSEQUENTLY CREATING UNIQUE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. THESE CUSTOMER INSIGHTS AND LEARNINGS DRIVE INNOVATION AT ITW AND HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A PORTFOLIO OF MORE THAN 17,000 GRANTED AND PENDING PATENTS;•ITW’S DECENTRALIZED, ENTREPRENEURIAL CULTURE ENABLES ITW BUSINESSES TO BE FAST, FOCUSED, AND RESPONSIVE. ITW BUSINESSES HAVE SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL TO CUSTOMIZE THEIR APPROACH IN ORDER TO BEST SERVE THEIR SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS' NEEDS. ITW COLLEAGUES RECOGNIZE THEIR UNIQUE RESPONSIBILITIES TO EXECUTE THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY AND VALUES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A FOCUSED AND SIMPLE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE THAT, COMBINED WITH OUTSTANDING EXECUTION, DELIVERS BEST-IN-CLASS SERVICES ADAPTED TO EACH BUSINESS' CUSTOMERS AND END MARKETS.ENTERPRISE STRATEGYIN LATE 2012, ITW BEGAN THE FIRST PHASE OF ITS STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK, TRANSITIONING THE COMPANY ON ITS CURRENT STRATEGIC PATH TO FULLY LEVERAGE THE COMPELLING PERFORMANCE POTENTIAL OF THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL. SINCE THEN, ITW HAS MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS, AS EVIDENCED BY THE COMPANY’S STRONG FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS.THE ROOTS OF ITW’S ENTERPRISE STRATEGY BEGAN IN LATE 2011 / EARLY 2012, WHEN THE COMPANY UNDERTOOK A COMPLETE REVIEW OF ITS PERFORMANCE. FOCUSING ON ITS BUSINESSES DELIVERING CONSISTENT ABOVE-MARKET GROWTH WITH BEST-IN-CLASS MARGINS AND RETURNS, ITW DEVELOPED A STRATEGY TO REPLICATE THAT PERFORMANCE ACROSS ITS OPERATIONS.19BASED ON THIS RIGOROUS EVALUATION, ITW DETERMINED THAT SOLID AND CONSISTENT ABOVE-MARKET ORGANIC GROWTH MUST BE THE CORE GROWTH ENGINE TO DELIVER WORLD-CLASS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND COMPELLING LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR ITS SHAREHOLDERS. TO SHIFT ITS PRIMARY GROWTH ENGINE TO ORGANIC, THE COMPANY BEGAN EXECUTING A MULTI-STEP APPROACH.•THE FIRST STEP WAS TO NARROW THE FOCUS AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF ITW’S BUSINESS PORTFOLIO. AS PART OF THE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE, ITW EXITED BUSINESSES THAT WERE OPERATING IN COMMODITIZED MARKET SPACES AND PRIORITIZED SUSTAINABLE DIFFERENTIATION AS A MUST-HAVE REQUIREMENT FOR ALL ITW BUSINESSES. THIS PROCESS INCLUDED BOTH DIVESTING ENTIRE BUSINESSES AND EXITING COMMODITIZED PRODUCT LINES AND CUSTOMERS INSIDE OTHERWISE HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED ITW DIVISIONS.AS A RESULT OF THIS WORK, ITW’S BUSINESS PORTFOLIO NOW HAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ORGANIC GROWTH POTENTIAL. ITW SEGMENTS AND DIVISIONS NOW POSSESS ATTRACTIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCT LINES AND END MARKETS AS THEY CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OPERATING MARGINS AND GENERATE PRICE/COST INCREASES. THE COMPANY ACHIEVED THIS THROUGH PRODUCT LINE SIMPLIFICATION, OR ELIMINATING THE COMPLEXITY AND OVERHEAD COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SMALLER PRODUCT LINES AND CUSTOMERS, WHILE SUPPORTING AND GROWING THE BUSINESSES’ LARGEST / MOST PROFITABLE CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCT LINES. WITH THE INITIATIVE NEARLY COMPLETE AND ITW BUSINESSES DEMONSTRATING NOTABLY IMPROVED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE PRODUCT LINE SIMPLIFICATION WORK IS RETURNING TO MORE NORMALIZED LEVELS.•STEP TWO, BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION, WAS IMPLEMENTED TO SIMPLIFY AND SCALE-UP ITW’S OPERATING STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT INCREASED ENGINEERING, MARKETING, AND SALES RESOURCES, AND, AT THE SAME TIME, IMPROVE GLOBAL REACH AND COMPETITIVENESS, ALL OF WHICH WERE CRITICAL TO DRIVING ACCELERATED ORGANIC GROWTH. ITW NOW HAS 85 SCALED-UP DIVISIONS WITH SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED FOCUS ON GROWTH INVESTMENTS, CORE CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCTS, AND CUSTOMER-BACK INNOVATION.•THE STRATEGIC SOURCING INITIATIVE ESTABLISHED SOURCING AS A CORE STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY AT ITW. THE COMPANY’S 80/20-ENABLED SOURCING ORGANIZATION HAS DELIVERED AN AVERAGE OF ONE PERCENT REDUCTION IN SPEND EACH YEAR FROM 2013 THROUGH 2017 AND IS ON TRACK TO DO THE SAME IN 2018.•WITH THE PORTFOLIO REALIGNMENT AND SCALE-UP WORK LARGELY COMPLETE, THE COMPANY SHIFTED ITS FOCUS TO PREPARING FOR AND ACCELERATING, ORGANIC GROWTH, REAPPLYING 80/20 TO OPTIMIZE ITS NEWLY SCALED-UP DIVISIONS FOR GROWTH, FIRST, TO BUILD A FOUNDATION OF OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, AND SECOND, TO IDENTIFY THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES TO DRIVE ORGANIC GROWTH.ITW HAS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR 80/20 MANAGEMENT, RESULTING IN MEANINGFUL INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENT IN MARGINS AND RETURNS AS EVIDENCED BY THE COMPANY’S OPERATING MARGIN AND AFTER-TAX RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. AT THE SAME TIME, THESE 80/20 INITIATIVES CAN ALSO RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES THAT REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS. WITH THIS FIRST PHASE OF THE STRATEGY NEARING COMPLETION, THE COMPANY WILL LOOK AHEAD TO THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND DELIVERING DIFFERENTIATED PERFORMANCE ON A SUSTAINED BASIS.SUSTAINED DIFFERENTIATED PERFORMANCEWHILE THE COMPANY HAS MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS AND ITW’S PERFORMANCE IS NEARING BEST-IN-CLASS LEVELS, THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENT. THE SECOND PHASE OF THE STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK IS FOCUSED ON DELIVERING DIFFERENTIATED PERFORMANCE ON A SUSTAINED BASIS, WITH CONSISTENT ABOVE MARKET ORGANIC GROWTH. MOVING FORWARD, THE COMPANY REMAINS COMMITTED TO THE FOUR STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES THAT HAVE SERVED AS THE FOUNDATION OF ITS PROGRESS OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS AND THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES BEST POSITIONS ITW TO DELIVER CONTINUED DIFFERENTIATED PERFORMANCE OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS:•THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL IS THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE•FOCUS ON QUALITY GROWTH•"DO WHAT WE SAY" EXECUTION IS A CRITICAL DIFFERENTIATOR•INVEST ONLY WHERE ITW HAS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGETHE ITW BUSINESS MODEL IS THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGETHE ITW BUSINESS MODEL IS THE COMBINATION OF A SET OF STRATEGIC, OPERATIONAL, AND CULTURAL APPROACHES AND PRACTICES THAT IS APPLIED TO EVERY ITW BUSINESS. THE BUSINESS MODEL HAS EXISTED INSIDE THE COMPANY FOR OVER 30 YEARS AND IS TRULY ITW'S DIFFERENTIATING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL IS COMPRISED OF THREE ELEMENTS:•80/20 FRONT TO BACK PROCESS = HOW THE COMPANY OPERATES•CUSTOMER-BACK INNOVATION APPROACH = HOW THE COMPANY INNOVATES20•DECENTRALIZED ENTREPRENEURIAL CULTURE = HOW THE COMPANY EXECUTESFOCUS ON QUALITY GROWTHITW PRIORITIZES HIGH-QUALITY REVENUE GROWTH AND, AS SUCH, THE COMPANY’S PRIMARY GROWTH FOCUS IS ORGANIC.LEVERAGING THE BUSINESS MODEL AND THE 80/20 FRONT TO BACK PROCESS PROVIDES A CLEAR VIEW OF WHERE TO FOCUS FOR HIGH- QUALITY GROWTH. THE COMPANY TARGETS DIFFERENTIATED END-MARKETS AND CUSTOMERS WITH CRITICAL NEEDS AND CHALLENGING PAIN POINTS. ITW GENERATES HIGH-QUALITY GROWTH THROUGH CONSISTENT CUSTOMER-BACK INNOVATION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE EXCELLENCE. THE COMPANY ONLY INVESTS AND OPERATES IN INDUSTRIES AND BUSINESSES THAT HAVE THE RIGHT “RAW MATERIAL” TO GENERATE HIGH QUALITY ORGANIC GROWTH THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL. ITW’S CURRENT PORTFOLIO OF SEVEN SEGMENTS OFFERS SOLID GROWTH POTENTIAL AND A HIGH DEGREE OF DIVERSIFICATION IN TERMS OF GEOGRAPHIC AND END MARKET EXPOSURES, ENABLING THE COMPANY TO DELIVER CONSISTENT HIGH-QUALITY GROWTH IN AN INCREASINGLY VOLATILE AND COMPETITIVE GLOBAL MARKET ENVIRONMENT."DO WHAT WE SAY" EXECUTION IS A CRITICAL DIFFERENTIATORITW’S COMMITMENT TO EXECUTION IS A KEY DIFFERENTIATOR FOR ITW. LIVING UP TO THE COMPANY’S COMMITMENTS - “DO WHAT WE SAY” EXECUTION - IS A DEEPLY EMBEDDED CORE ELEMENT OF THE CULTURE. THE CULTURE IS THE ENGINE THAT TRANSLATES ITW'S STRATEGY INTO ACTION, AND ACTION INTO RESULTS.ALL DIVISIONS FUNCTION WITHIN A “FRAMEWORK” THAT DEFINES HOW THE CULTURE OPERATES AND DEFINES THE COMPANY’S VALUES, BUSINESS MODEL AND STRATEGY TO ENSURE ALL DIVISIONS ARE WORKING TOWARD OUR COMMON SET OF GOALS. BUSINESS LEADERS HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DEFINE THE ACTIONS AND CUSTOMIZE THEIR APPROACH TO MEET THOSE GOALS. THIS “FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK” ESTABLISHES AN ENTREPRENEURIAL ENVIRONMENT WHERE DECISIONS ARE MADE “BOTTOM UP” BY THOSE WITH THE GREATEST KNOWLEDGE, CAPABILITY AND PROXIMITY TO THE CUSTOMER, WHICH ENABLES OUR BUSINESSES TO BE NIMBLE AND REACT QUICKLY TO MARKET CONDITIONS AND CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS.ITW IS SIMPLE, STRAIGHTFORWARD AND TRANSPARENT IN EVERYTHING IT DOES. THE COMPANY SETS CLEAR PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS AND FINANCIAL TARGETS, EXECUTES AGAINST THESE AT THE APPROPRIATE PACE, AND ESTABLISHES THE FREEDOM TO DEFINE HOW TO ACHIEVE RESULTS WITHIN THE CONSTRUCT OF THE BUSINESS MODEL.INVEST ONLY WHERE ITW HAS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGETHE COMPANY IS HIGHLY FOCUSED AND DISCIPLINED IN ITS APPROACH TO INVEST ONLY WHERE IT CAN LEVERAGE THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL INTO COMPELLING AND SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT ORGANIC GROWTH AND SUSTAIN ITS HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED CORE BUSINESSES, SUCH AS NEW PRODUCT INNOVATION, MARKETING PROGRAMS, SIMPLIFICATION PROJECTS, AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, ARE ITW’S NUMBER ONE INVESTMENT PRIORITY. TERMS USED BY ITWMANAGEMENT USES THE FOLLOWING TERMS TO DESCRIBE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY:•ORGANIC BUSINESS - ACQUIRED BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR MORE THAN 12 MONTHS ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS.•OPERATING LEVERAGE - THE ESTIMATED EFFECT OF THE ORGANIC REVENUE VOLUME CHANGES ON ORGANIC OPERATING INCOME, ASSUMING VARIABLE MARGINS REMAIN THE SAME AS THE PRIOR PERIOD.•PRICE/COST - REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED NET IMPACT OF INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THE COST OF MATERIALS USED IN THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS VERSUS CHANGES IN THE SELLING PRICE TO THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS.•PRODUCT LINE SIMPLIFICATION (PLS) - FOCUSES BUSINESSES ON ELIMINATING THE COMPLEXITY AND OVERHEAD COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SMALLER PRODUCT LINES AND CUSTOMERS, AND FOCUSES BUSINESSES ON SUPPORTING AND GROWING THEIR LARGEST CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCT LINES; IN THE SHORT-TERM, PLS MAY RESULT IN A DECREASE IN REVENUE AND OVERHEAD COSTS WHILE IMPROVING OPERATING MARGIN. IN THE LONG-TERM, PLS IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN GROWTH IN REVENUE, PROFITABILITY, AND RETURNS.UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED, THE CHANGES IN FINANCIAL RESULTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT REPRESENT THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD VERSUS THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. 21CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSTHE COMPANY'S STRONG FINANCIAL RESULTS IN 2017 DEMONSTRATE THE COMBINATION OF ITW'S HIGH-QUALITY BUSINESS PORTFOLIO WITH CONTINUED FOCUS ON LEVERAGING THE POWERFUL AND HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED ITW BUSINESS MODEL. MEANINGFUL PROGRESS ON ACCELERATING ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH AND STRONG EXECUTION ON ENTERPRISE INITIATIVES RESULTED IN ALL SEVEN SEGMENTS ACHIEVING WORLDWIDE ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH AND HAVING OPERATING MARGIN ABOVE 20% FOR 2017. ON JULY 1, 2016, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF THE ENGINEERED FASTENERS AND COMPONENTS BUSINESS ("EF&C") FROM ZF TRW FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $450 MILLION. EF&C HAD OPERATING REVENUE OF $517 MILLION IN 2017 AND $245 MILLION FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS OF 2016. EF&C DILUTED THE COMPANY'S OPERATING MARGIN IN 2017 AND 2016 DUE TO LOWER OPERATING MARGIN AND ACQUISITION RELATED EXPENSES. THE COMPANY EXPECTS EF&C'S OPERATING MARGIN TO IMPROVE IN LATER YEARS THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPANY'S 80/20 FRONT TO BACK PROCESS. THE OPERATING RESULTS OF EF&C ARE REPORTED WITHIN THE COMPANY'S AUTOMOTIVE OEM SEGMENT.

AMONG THE MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES, THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THAT THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS AFTER ADOPTION OF THE GUIDANCE BE RECOGNIZED THROUGH INCOME TAX EXPENSE RATHER THAN DIRECTLY IN EQUITY. ADDITIONALLY, THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS RELATED TO EXCESS TAX BENEFITS SHOULD BE PRESENTED WITHIN OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS RATHER THAN AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY. EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN EQUITY UNDER THE PRIOR GUIDANCE WERE $29 MILLION AND $20 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE NEW GUIDANCE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2017 AND APPLIED THE NEW GUIDANCE PROSPECTIVELY. EXCESS TAX BENEFITS OF $50 MILLION WERE INCLUDED IN INCOME TAXES IN THE STATEMENT OF INCOME FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE EXPECTED EFFECT ON INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR NET CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES RELATED TO FUTURE STOCK-BASED AWARD SETTLEMENTS WILL VARY EACH PERIOD AND WILL DEPEND ON INPUTS SUCH AS THE STOCK PRICE AT THE TIME OF SETTLEMENT AND THE NUMBER OF AWARDS SETTLED IN THE PERIOD PRESENTED.EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE TO CHANGE THE CRITERIA FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION. THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF THE NEW GUIDANCE IS THAT REVENUE SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION DISCLOSURES WILL BE REQUIRED. THE COMPANY'S SALES ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS ARE PREDOMINATELY SHORT TERM IN NATURE AND GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR TRANSFER OF CONTROL AND REVENUE RECOGNITION AT THE TIME OF PRODUCT SHIPMENT OR DELIVERY OF SERVICE. IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, ARRANGEMENTS MAY INCLUDE SERVICE PERFORMED OVER TIME, OR THERE MAY BE SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS TO THE CUSTOMER THAT ARE UNFULFILLED AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT, TYPICALLY INVOLVING INSTALLATION OF EQUIPMENT AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS NEW GUIDANCE UNDER THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD WHICH REQUIRES THE NEW GUIDANCE TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY TO REVENUE TRANSACTIONS COMPLETED ON OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE. GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE COMPANY’S REVENUE TRANSACTIONS, THE NEW GUIDANCE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S OPERATING REVENUE, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR FINANCIAL POSITION. AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING THE GUIDANCE, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECORD A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT REDUCING RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2018 BY APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION RELATED TO CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE IMPACTED BY THE NEW GUIDANCE. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES IN PERIODS SUBSEQUENT TO ADOPTION.IN OCTOBER 2016, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE REQUIRING THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INTRA-ENTITY TRANSFER OF AN ASSET, OTHER THAN INVENTORY, WHEN THE TRANSFER OCCURS RATHER THAN WHEN TRANSFERRED TO A THIRD PARTY AS REQUIRED UNDER THE CURRENT GUIDANCE. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE NEW GUIDANCE AND WILL APPLY THE NEWLY ADOPTED GUIDANCE TO INTRA-ENTITY ASSET TRANSFERS ON OR AFTER THE DATE OF ADOPTION. AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING THE NEW GUIDANCE, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECORD A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT REDUCING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND RETAINED EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, INTRA-ENTITY ASSET TRANSFERS MAY RESULT IN FUTURE TAX RATE VOLATILITY UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE.IN MARCH 2017, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE WHICH CHANGES THE INCOME STATEMENT PRESENTATION OF THE COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST RELATED TO DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. THE PRIMARY CHANGE UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE IS THAT ONLY THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN OPERATING INCOME AND IS ELIGIBLE FOR CAPITALIZATION AS AN ASSET. THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST, INCLUDING INTEREST COST, EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS, SETTLEMENTS, CURTAILMENTS, AND AMORTIZATION OF ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES AND PRIOR SERVICE COST, SHOULD BE PRESENTED BELOW OPERATING INCOME. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE NEW GUIDANCE AND WILL APPLY THE NEW 33PRESENTATION OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST IN FUTURE PERIODS AND EXPECTS TO RESTATE PRIOR PERIODS FOR COMPARABILITY. THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2016 AND 2015, THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST WERE INCOME OF $9 MILLION, INCOME OF $8 MILLION, AND EXPENSE OF $1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY’S NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST.EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE TO CHANGE THE CRITERIA FOR RECOGNIZING LEASING TRANSACTIONS. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, A LESSEE WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE A LEASE LIABILITY AND LEASE ASSET FOR ALL LEASES, INCLUDING OPERATING LEASES, WITH A LEASE TERM GREATER THAN TWELVE MONTHS IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION. SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT, INCLUDING PRESENTATION OF EXPENSES AND CASH FLOWS, WILL DEPEND ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE LEASE AS EITHER A FINANCING OR OPERATING LEASE. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL NEW DISCLOSURES WILL BE REQUIRED. THIS GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2019, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET COMPLETED ITS EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE WILL HAVE ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECOGNIZE RIGHT OF USE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR ITS OPERATING LEASES IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION UPON ADOPTION.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESTHE COMPANY’S PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE CASH FLOW AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAD $3.1 BILLION OF CASH ON HAND AT DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND ALSO MAINTAINS STRONG ACCESS TO PUBLIC DEBT MARKETS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE SOURCES ARE SUFFICIENT TO SERVICE DEBT AND TO FINANCE THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL ALLOCATION PRIORITIES, WHICH INCLUDE:•INTERNAL INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT ORGANIC GROWTH AND SUSTAIN CORE BUSINESSES;•PAYMENT OF AN ATTRACTIVE DIVIDEND TO SHAREHOLDERS; AND•EXTERNAL INVESTMENTS IN SELECTIVE STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS THAT SUPPORT THE COMPANY'S ORGANIC GROWTH FOCUS AND AN ACTIVE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT, BASED ON ITS OPERATING REVENUE, OPERATING MARGIN, FREE CASH FLOW, AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY.34CASH FLOWTHE COMPANY USES FREE CASH FLOW TO MEASURE CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, ACQUISITIONS AND DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES. FREE CASH FLOW REPRESENTS NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS ADDITIONS TO PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. FREE CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2016 AND 2015 WAS AS FOLLOWS:FREE CASH FLOW FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF AN ADDITIONAL $115 MILLION DISCRETIONARY PENSION CONTRIBUTION RELATED TO THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN.STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMSON AUGUST 2, 2013, THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDED FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $6.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME (THE "2013 PROGRAM").

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY $2.4 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THE 2015 PROGRAM.35ADJUSTED AFTER-TAX RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITALTHE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED AFTER-TAX RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL ("ROIC") TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS’ USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ROIC IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. FOR COMPARABILITY, THE COMPANY EXCLUDED THE $658 MILLION INCOME TAX CHARGE FROM THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND THE $95 MILLION CONFIDENTIAL LEGAL SETTLEMENT FROM THE CALCULATION OF ROIC FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. ADJUSTED AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S EQUITY INVESTMENT IN THE WILSONART BUSINESS (FORMERLY THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT).

IN THE U.S., THE COMPANY UTILIZES CASH FLOWS FROM DOMESTIC OPERATIONS TO FUND DOMESTIC CASH NEEDS, WHICH PRIMARILY CONSIST OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, SHARE REPURCHASES, ACQUISITIONS, SERVICING OF DOMESTIC DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, WHICH IS BACKED BY LONG-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES, FOR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS.

VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS ARE ALSO USED THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.THE COMPANY'S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE AS FOLLOWS:REALIZABILITY OF INVENTORIES— INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY’S BUSINESSES PERFORM AN ANALYSIS OF THE HISTORICAL SALES USAGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL INVENTORY ITEMS ON HAND AND A RESERVE IS RECORDED TO ADJUST INVENTORY COST TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING USAGE CRITERIA:USAGE CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA RESERVE %ACTIVE QUANTITY ON HAND IS LESS THAN PRIOR 6 MONTHS OF USAGE 0%SLOW-MOVING SOME USAGE IN LAST 12 MONTHS, BUT QUANTITY ON HAND EXCEEDS PRIOR 6 MONTHS OF USAGE 50%OBSOLETE NO USAGE IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS 90%IN ADDITION, FOR APPROXIMATELY 21% OF TOTAL INVENTORIES, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO USE THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT ("LIFO") METHOD OF INVENTORY COSTING. GENERALLY, THIS METHOD RESULTS IN A LOWER INVENTORY VALUE THAN THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT ("FIFO") METHOD DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION.39COLLECTIBILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE— THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS BASED ON THE GREATER OF A SPECIFIC RESERVE OR A RESERVE CALCULATED BASED ON THE HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF PERCENTAGE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. IN ADDITION, RESERVES FOR CUSTOMER CREDITS AND CASH DISCOUNTS ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE.DEPRECIATION OF PLANT AND EQUIPMENT— THE COMPANY’S U.S. BUSINESSES PRIMARILY COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS, AS FOLLOWS:BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS150% DECLINING BALANCEMACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT200% DECLINING BALANCETHE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS.INCOME TAXES— THE COMPANY PROVIDES DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX LAWS. THE COMPANY’S DEFERRED AND OTHER TAX BALANCES ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE TAX REGULATIONS AND RULINGS IN NUMEROUS TAXING JURISDICTIONS. INCOME TAX EXPENSE, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECOGNIZED BY THE COMPANY ALSO REFLECT ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE LEVEL OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, THE EFFECT OF THE COMPANY’S VARIOUS TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES AND UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. FUTURE TAX AUTHORITY RULINGS AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, CHANGES IN PROJECTED LEVELS OF TAXABLE INCOME AND FUTURE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES COULD AFFECT THE ACTUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND TAX BALANCES RECORDED BY THE COMPANY.GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS— THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS TYPICALLY RESULT IN RECORDING GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH ARE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY’S TOTAL ASSETS AND AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT THE COMPANY COULD INCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE GUIDANCE PRESCRIBED IN THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO TEST GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF TRIGGERING EVENTS OCCUR, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO DETERMINE IF A POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, IF ANY, IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT’S GOODWILL. IN CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS OR SPECIFIC INTANGIBLE ASSETS, MANAGEMENT RELIES ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING BUSINESS PLANS, ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS, ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER MARKET DATA. THERE ARE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THESE FACTORS AND MANAGEMENT’S JUDGMENT IN APPLYING THEM IN THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, THE COMPANY HAD TOTAL GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY $6.0 BILLION ALLOCATED TO ITS REPORTING UNITS. ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ITS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE COMPANY GENERALLY BELIEVES THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IS LESSENED BY THE NUMBER OF DIVERSIFIED BUSINESSES AND END MARKETS REPRESENTED BY ITS REPORTING UNITS THAT HAVE GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES IN MANY OF THE REPORTING UNITS HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, AND IN MANY CASES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPANY’S 80/20 FRONT TO BACK PROCESS. THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL REPORTING UNITS RANGES FROM APPROXIMATELY $45 MILLION TO $1.3 BILLION, WITH THE AVERAGE AMOUNT EQUAL TO $546 MILLION. FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT AND ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE COMPANY’S GLOBAL END MARKETS, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ONE OR MORE REPORTING UNITS COULD OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS.PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS— THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS COMPANY-SPONSORED DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING A NUMBER OF U.S. EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON EACH PARTICIPANT’S YEARS OF SERVICE, FUTURE COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, LIFE EXPECTANCY, AND HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES. FUTURE CHANGES IN ANY OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE AMOUNTS RECORDED RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. SEE NOTE 9. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES.THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES AS OF THE YEAR-END MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN. THE DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH THE ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES COULD THEORETICALLY BE 40EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. IN ESTIMATING THIS RATE, THE COMPANY LOOKS AT RATES OF RETURN ON HIGH-QUALITY FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS, WITH SIMILAR DURATION TO THE LIABILITIES IN THE PLAN. A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN OBLIGATION BY APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION. BEGINNING IN 2017, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE METHOD USED TO ESTIMATE THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS. THE NEW METHOD PROVIDES A MORE PRECISE MEASURE OF THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST BY APPLYING SPECIFIC SPOT RATES ALONG THE YIELD CURVE TO THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS RATHER THAN A SINGLE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE RATE. SEE NOTE 9. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY'S PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS AND RELATED ASSUMPTIONS.THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR SIMILAR INVESTMENT ALLOCATIONS AMONG ASSET CLASSES. FOR THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN, A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WOULD INCREASE THE ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMARKET RISKTHE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CERTAIN MARKET RISKS THAT EXIST AS PART OF ITS ONGOING BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRICE VOLATILITY FOR CERTAIN COMMODITIES AND CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE OR LEVERAGED TRANSACTIONS AND DOES NOT HOLD OR ISSUE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING PURPOSES.INTEREST RATE RISKTHE COMPANY’S EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK FOR CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY’S FIXED RATE DEBT. REFER TO NOTE 8. DEBT IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL DATA FOR DETAILS RELATED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF COMPANY'S DEBT INSTRUMENTS.FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKTHE COMPANY OPERATES IN THE U.S. AND 55 FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THE FUNDING FOR THE FOREIGN MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS IS PROVIDED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE PERMANENT INVESTMENT OF EQUITY CAPITAL. THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY MANUFACTURED AND SOLD WITHIN THE SAME COUNTRY. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT ASSETS OR LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES.THE COMPANY DESIGNATED €1.0 BILLION OF EURO NOTES ISSUED IN MAY 2014 AND €1.0 BILLION OF EURO NOTES ISSUED IN MAY 2015 AS HEDGES OF A PORTION OF ITS NET INVESTMENT IN EURO-DENOMINATED FOREIGN OPERATIONS TO REDUCE FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTMENT IN THESE OPERATIONS. CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THIS DEBT RESULTING FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN THE EURO TO U.S. DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS WITHIN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS). THE CUMULATIVE UNREALIZED GAIN RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) RELATED TO THE NET INVESTMENT HEDGE WAS $81 MILLION AND $375 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016, RESPECTIVELY.41ITEM 8.

DEFINITION AND LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGA COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE. /S/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLPCHICAGO, ILLINOISFEBRUARY 15, 2018 WE HAVE SERVED AS THE COMPANY'S AUDITOR SINCE 2002.43STATEMENT OF INCOMEILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC.

(THE "COMPANY" OR "ITW") IS A GLOBAL MANUFACTURER OF A DIVERSIFIED RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT WITH APPROXIMATELY 85 DIVISIONS IN 56 COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY PRIMARILY SERVES THE AUTOMOTIVE OEM/TIERS, COMMERCIAL FOOD EQUIPMENT, CONSTRUCTION, GENERAL INDUSTRIAL, AND AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET END MARKETS.CONSOLIDATION AND TRANSLATION— THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE COMPANY AND ITS MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST. INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS ARE ELIMINATED FROM THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES’ ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE TRANSLATED TO U.S. DOLLARS AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES FOR THE PERIOD. TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY.RECLASSIFICATIONS— CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS OF PRIOR YEAR DATA HAVE BEEN MADE TO CONFORM TO CURRENT YEAR REPORTING.USE OF ESTIMATES— THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.ACQUISITIONS— THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ACQUISITIONS UNDER THE ACQUISITION METHOD, IN WHICH ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AS OF THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION.OPERATING REVENUE— OPERATING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, PRODUCT HAS SHIPPED AND THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE TRANSFERRED OR SERVICES HAVE BEEN RENDERED, THE PRICE TO THE CUSTOMER IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED, WHICH IS GENERALLY AT THE TIME OF PRODUCT SHIPMENT. TYPICAL SALES ARRANGEMENTS ARE FOR STANDARD PRODUCTS AND PROVIDE FOR TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP AND RISK OF LOSS AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT. IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS TO THE CUSTOMER ARE UNFULFILLED AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT, TYPICALLY INVOLVING INSTALLATION AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE, REVENUE RECOGNITION IS DEFERRED UNTIL SUCH OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. CUSTOMER ALLOWANCES AND REBATES, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF VOLUME DISCOUNTS AND OTHER SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, ARE ESTIMATED AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND KNOWN TRENDS AND ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN REPORTED REVENUES.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES— RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ARE RECORDED AS EXPENSE IN THE YEAR INCURRED. THESE COSTS WERE $225 MILLION, $223 MILLION AND $218 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY.ADVERTISING EXPENSES— ADVERTISING EXPENSES ARE RECORDED AS EXPENSE IN THE YEAR INCURRED. THESE COSTS WERE $53 MILLION, $58 MILLION AND $58 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY.INCOME TAXES— THE COMPANY UTILIZES THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES GIVEN THE PROVISIONS OF THE ENACTED TAX LAWS. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED WHEN IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX BENEFIT OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL NOT BE REALIZED.CASH AND EQUIVALENTS— CASH AND EQUIVALENTS INCLUDE CASH ON HAND AND INSTRUMENTS HAVING ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS. CASH AND EQUIVALENTS ARE STATED AT COST, WHICH APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE.49TRADE RECEIVABLES— TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE NET OF ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS WHICH INCLUDES RESERVES FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS, CUSTOMER CREDITS AND CASH DISCOUNTS. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS BASED ON THE GREATER OF A SPECIFIC RESERVE OR A RESERVE CALCULATED BASED ON THE HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF PERCENTAGE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. IN ADDITION, RESERVES FOR CUSTOMER CREDITS AND CASH DISCOUNTS ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE. THE CHANGES IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED 2017, 2016 AND 2015 WERE AS FOLLOWS:IN MILLIONS 2017 2016 2015BEGINNING BALANCE $43 $42 $43PROVISION CHARGED TO EXPENSE 3 7 7WRITE-OFFS, NET OF RECOVERIES (6) (6) (5)ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES — 1 —FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION 3 (1) (3)ENDING BALANCE $43 $43 $42INVENTORIES— INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE AND INCLUDE MATERIAL, LABOR AND FACTORY OVERHEAD. THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT ("LIFO") METHOD IS USED TO DETERMINE THE COST OF INVENTORIES AT CERTAIN U.S. BUSINESSES. THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT ("FIFO") METHOD, WHICH APPROXIMATES CURRENT COST, IS USED FOR ALL OTHER INVENTORIES. INVENTORIES PRICED AT LIFO WERE APPROXIMATELY 21% AND 22% OF TOTAL INVENTORIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. IF THE FIFO METHOD WAS USED FOR ALL INVENTORIES, TOTAL INVENTORIES WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $89 MILLION AND $86 MILLION HIGHER THAN REPORTED AT DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THE MAJOR CLASSES OF INVENTORY AT DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016 WERE AS FOLLOWS:NET PLANT AND EQUIPMENT— NET PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE STATED AT COST, LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION. RENEWALS AND IMPROVEMENTS THAT INCREASE THE USEFUL LIFE OF PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE CAPITALIZED. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED. NET PLANT AND EQUIPMENT CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING AT DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016:THE COMPANY’S U.S. BUSINESSES PRIMARILY COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. THE RANGES OF USEFUL LIVES USED TO DEPRECIATE PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS:BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS5—50 YEARSMACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT3—12 YEARSEQUIPMENT LEASED TO OTHERSTERM OF LEASE50DEPRECIATION WAS $256 MILLION, $246 MILLION AND $244 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY.GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS— GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS COST OVER FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE BEING AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF 3 TO 20 YEARS. THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ANNUALLY, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF TRIGGERING EVENTS OCCUR, BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS. WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE GOODWILL ASSIGNED TO EACH OF ITS REPORTING UNITS FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE RELEVANT REPORTING UNIT TO THE CARRYING VALUE. THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS LEVEL 2 AND LEVEL 3 VALUATION TECHNIQUES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS, INCLUDING DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS BASED ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT REPORTING UNIT AND MARKET MULTIPLES OF RELEVANT PUBLIC COMPANIES. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, IF ANY, IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S GOODWILL.THE COMPANY'S INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONSIST OF TRADEMARKS AND BRANDS. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON A LEVEL 3 VALUATION METHOD USING A RELIEF-FROM-ROYALTY INCOME APPROACH DERIVED FROM INTERNALLY FORECASTED REVENUES OF THE RELATED PRODUCTS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TRADEMARK OR BRAND IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND CARRYING VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET.ACCRUED WARRANTIES— THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR PRODUCT WARRANTIES BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. THE CHANGES IN ACCRUED WARRANTIES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2016 AND 2015 WERE AS FOLLOWS:NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSEFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2017IN MARCH 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (THE "FASB") ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE THAT INCLUDES SEVERAL CHANGES TO SIMPLIFY THE ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, INCLUDING THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, FORFEITURES, STATUTORY TAX WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS AND CLASSIFICATION OF TAX BENEFITS IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. AMONG THE MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES, THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THAT THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS AFTER ADOPTION OF THE GUIDANCE BE RECOGNIZED THROUGH INCOME TAX EXPENSE RATHER THAN DIRECTLY IN EQUITY. ADDITIONALLY, THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS RELATED TO EXCESS TAX BENEFITS SHOULD BE PRESENTED WITHIN OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS RATHER THAN AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY. EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN EQUITY UNDER THE PRIOR GUIDANCE WERE $29 MILLION AND $20 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE NEW GUIDANCE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2017 AND APPLIED THE NEW GUIDANCE PROSPECTIVELY. EXCESS TAX BENEFITS OF $50 MILLION WERE INCLUDED IN INCOME TAXES IN THE STATEMENT OF INCOME FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE EXPECTED EFFECT ON INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR NET CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES RELATED TO FUTURE STOCK-BASED AWARD SETTLEMENTS WILL VARY EACH PERIOD AND WILL DEPEND ON INPUTS SUCH AS THE STOCK PRICE AT THE TIME OF SETTLEMENT AND THE NUMBER OF AWARDS SETTLED IN THE PERIOD PRESENTED.51EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE TO CHANGE THE CRITERIA FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION. THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF THE NEW GUIDANCE IS THAT REVENUE SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION DISCLOSURES WILL BE REQUIRED. THE COMPANY'S SALES ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS ARE PREDOMINATELY SHORT TERM IN NATURE AND GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR TRANSFER OF CONTROL AND REVENUE RECOGNITION AT THE TIME OF PRODUCT SHIPMENT OR DELIVERY OF SERVICE. IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, ARRANGEMENTS MAY INCLUDE SERVICE PERFORMED OVER TIME, OR THERE MAY BE SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS TO THE CUSTOMER THAT ARE UNFULFILLED AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT, TYPICALLY INVOLVING INSTALLATION OF EQUIPMENT AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS NEW GUIDANCE UNDER THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD WHICH REQUIRES THE NEW GUIDANCE TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY TO REVENUE TRANSACTIONS COMPLETED ON OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE.

EXHIBITS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES(A)(1) FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTHE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS INCLUDED AS PART OF ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSINTRODUCTIONILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. (THE "COMPANY" OR "ITW") IS A GLOBAL MANUFACTURER OF A DIVERSIFIED RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT WITH 85 DIVISIONS IN 56 COUNTRIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, THE COMPANY EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 50,000 PEOPLE.THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS ARE ORGANIZED AND MANAGED BASED ON SIMILAR PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND END MARKETS, AND ARE REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT AS THE FOLLOWING SEVEN SEGMENTS: AUTOMOTIVE OEM; FOOD EQUIPMENT; TEST & MEASUREMENT AND ELECTRONICS; WELDING; POLYMERS & FLUIDS; CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS; AND SPECIALTY PRODUCTS.DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF DIVERSE BUSINESSES AND THE COMPANY'S DECENTRALIZED OPERATING STRUCTURE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT REQUIRE ITS BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE DETAILED INFORMATION ON OPERATING RESULTS. INSTEAD, THE COMPANY'S CORPORATE MANAGEMENT COLLECTS DATA ON SEVERAL KEY MEASUREMENTS: OPERATING REVENUE, OPERATING INCOME, OPERATING MARGIN, OVERHEAD COSTS, NUMBER OF MONTHS ON HAND IN INVENTORY, DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PAST DUE RECEIVABLES AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. THESE KEY MEASURES ARE MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OPERATING RESULTS VERSUS CURRENT TRENDS IN END MARKETS AND VARIANCES FROM FORECASTS ARE DISCUSSED WITH OPERATING UNIT MANAGEMENT.THE ITW BUSINESS MODELTHE POWERFUL AND HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED ITW BUSINESS MODEL IS THE COMPANY’S CORE SOURCE OF VALUE CREATION. THIS BUSINESS MODEL IS THE COMPANY’S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND DEFINES HOW ITW CREATES VALUE FOR ITS SHAREHOLDERS AND COMPRISES THREE UNIQUE ELEMENTS:•ITW’S 80/20 FRONT TO BACK PROCESS IS THE OPERATING SYSTEM THAT IS APPLIED IN EVERY ITW BUSINESS. INITIALLY INTRODUCED AS A MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY TOOL IN THE 1980S, ITW HAS CONTINUALLY REFINED, IMPROVED AND EXPANDED 80/20 INTO A PROPRIETARY, HOLISTIC BUSINESS MANAGEMENT PROCESS THAT GENERATES SIGNIFICANT VALUE FOR THE COMPANY AND ITS CUSTOMERS. THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF DATA-DRIVEN INSIGHTS GENERATED BY 80/20 PRACTICE, ITW FOCUSES ON ITS LARGEST AND BEST OPPORTUNITIES (THE “80”) AND ELIMINATES COST, COMPLEXITY AND DISTRACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LESS PROFITABLE OPPORTUNITIES (THE “20”). 80/20 ENABLES ITW BUSINESSES TO CONSISTENTLY ACHIEVE WORLD-CLASS OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE IN PRODUCT AVAILABILITY, QUALITY, AND INNOVATION, WHILE GENERATING SUPERIOR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE;•CUSTOMER-BACK INNOVATION HAS FUELED DECADES OF PROFITABLE GROWTH AT ITW. THE COMPANY’S UNIQUE INNOVATION APPROACH IS BUILT ON INSIGHT GATHERED FROM THE 80/20 FRONT TO BACK PROCESS. WORKING FROM THE CUSTOMER BACK, ITW BUSINESSES POSITION THEMSELVES AS THE GO-TO PROBLEM SOLVER FOR THEIR “80” CUSTOMERS. ITW’S INNOVATION EFFORTS ARE FOCUSED ON UNDERSTANDING CUSTOMER NEEDS, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN “80” MARKETS WITH SOLID LONG-TERM GROWTH FUNDAMENTALS, AND SUBSEQUENTLY CREATING UNIQUE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. THESE CUSTOMER INSIGHTS AND LEARNINGS DRIVE INNOVATION AT ITW AND HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A PORTFOLIO OF MORE THAN 17,000 GRANTED AND PENDING PATENTS;•ITW’S DECENTRALIZED, ENTREPRENEURIAL CULTURE ENABLES ITW BUSINESSES TO BE FAST, FOCUSED, AND RESPONSIVE. ITW BUSINESSES HAVE SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL TO CUSTOMIZE THEIR APPROACH IN ORDER TO BEST SERVE THEIR SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS' NEEDS. ITW COLLEAGUES RECOGNIZE THEIR UNIQUE RESPONSIBILITIES TO EXECUTE THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY AND VALUES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A FOCUSED AND SIMPLE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE THAT, COMBINED WITH OUTSTANDING EXECUTION, DELIVERS BEST-IN-CLASS SERVICES ADAPTED TO EACH BUSINESS' CUSTOMERS AND END MARKETS.ENTERPRISE STRATEGYIN LATE 2012, ITW BEGAN THE FIRST PHASE OF ITS STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK, TRANSITIONING THE COMPANY ON ITS CURRENT STRATEGIC PATH TO FULLY LEVERAGE THE COMPELLING PERFORMANCE POTENTIAL OF THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL. SINCE THEN, ITW HAS MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS, AS EVIDENCED BY THE COMPANY’S STRONG FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS.THE ROOTS OF ITW’S ENTERPRISE STRATEGY BEGAN IN LATE 2011 / EARLY 2012, WHEN THE COMPANY UNDERTOOK A COMPLETE REVIEW OF ITS PERFORMANCE. FOCUSING ON ITS BUSINESSES DELIVERING CONSISTENT ABOVE-MARKET GROWTH WITH BEST-IN-CLASS MARGINS AND RETURNS, ITW DEVELOPED A STRATEGY TO REPLICATE THAT PERFORMANCE ACROSS ITS OPERATIONS.19BASED ON THIS RIGOROUS EVALUATION, ITW DETERMINED THAT SOLID AND CONSISTENT ABOVE-MARKET ORGANIC GROWTH MUST BE THE CORE GROWTH ENGINE TO DELIVER WORLD-CLASS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND COMPELLING LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR ITS SHAREHOLDERS. TO SHIFT ITS PRIMARY GROWTH ENGINE TO ORGANIC, THE COMPANY BEGAN EXECUTING A MULTI-STEP APPROACH.•THE FIRST STEP WAS TO NARROW THE FOCUS AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF ITW’S BUSINESS PORTFOLIO. AS PART OF THE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE, ITW EXITED BUSINESSES THAT WERE OPERATING IN COMMODITIZED MARKET SPACES AND PRIORITIZED SUSTAINABLE DIFFERENTIATION AS A MUST-HAVE REQUIREMENT FOR ALL ITW BUSINESSES. THIS PROCESS INCLUDED BOTH DIVESTING ENTIRE BUSINESSES AND EXITING COMMODITIZED PRODUCT LINES AND CUSTOMERS INSIDE OTHERWISE HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED ITW DIVISIONS.AS A RESULT OF THIS WORK, ITW’S BUSINESS PORTFOLIO NOW HAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ORGANIC GROWTH POTENTIAL. ITW SEGMENTS AND DIVISIONS NOW POSSESS ATTRACTIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCT LINES AND END MARKETS AS THEY CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OPERATING MARGINS AND GENERATE PRICE/COST INCREASES. THE COMPANY ACHIEVED THIS THROUGH PRODUCT LINE SIMPLIFICATION, OR ELIMINATING THE COMPLEXITY AND OVERHEAD COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SMALLER PRODUCT LINES AND CUSTOMERS, WHILE SUPPORTING AND GROWING THE BUSINESSES’ LARGEST / MOST PROFITABLE CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCT LINES. WITH THE INITIATIVE NEARLY COMPLETE AND ITW BUSINESSES DEMONSTRATING NOTABLY IMPROVED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE PRODUCT LINE SIMPLIFICATION WORK IS RETURNING TO MORE NORMALIZED LEVELS.•STEP TWO, BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION, WAS IMPLEMENTED TO SIMPLIFY AND SCALE-UP ITW’S OPERATING STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT INCREASED ENGINEERING, MARKETING, AND SALES RESOURCES, AND, AT THE SAME TIME, IMPROVE GLOBAL REACH AND COMPETITIVENESS, ALL OF WHICH WERE CRITICAL TO DRIVING ACCELERATED ORGANIC GROWTH. ITW NOW HAS 85 SCALED-UP DIVISIONS WITH SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED FOCUS ON GROWTH INVESTMENTS, CORE CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCTS, AND CUSTOMER-BACK INNOVATION.•THE STRATEGIC SOURCING INITIATIVE ESTABLISHED SOURCING AS A CORE STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY AT ITW. THE COMPANY’S 80/20-ENABLED SOURCING ORGANIZATION HAS DELIVERED AN AVERAGE OF ONE PERCENT REDUCTION IN SPEND EACH YEAR FROM 2013 THROUGH 2017 AND IS ON TRACK TO DO THE SAME IN 2018.•WITH THE PORTFOLIO REALIGNMENT AND SCALE-UP WORK LARGELY COMPLETE, THE COMPANY SHIFTED ITS FOCUS TO PREPARING FOR AND ACCELERATING, ORGANIC GROWTH, REAPPLYING 80/20 TO OPTIMIZE ITS NEWLY SCALED-UP DIVISIONS FOR GROWTH, FIRST, TO BUILD A FOUNDATION OF OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, AND SECOND, TO IDENTIFY THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES TO DRIVE ORGANIC GROWTH.ITW HAS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR 80/20 MANAGEMENT, RESULTING IN MEANINGFUL INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENT IN MARGINS AND RETURNS AS EVIDENCED BY THE COMPANY’S OPERATING MARGIN AND AFTER-TAX RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. AT THE SAME TIME, THESE 80/20 INITIATIVES CAN ALSO RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES THAT REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS. WITH THIS FIRST PHASE OF THE STRATEGY NEARING COMPLETION, THE COMPANY WILL LOOK AHEAD TO THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND DELIVERING DIFFERENTIATED PERFORMANCE ON A SUSTAINED BASIS.SUSTAINED DIFFERENTIATED PERFORMANCEWHILE THE COMPANY HAS MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS AND ITW’S PERFORMANCE IS NEARING BEST-IN-CLASS LEVELS, THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENT. THE SECOND PHASE OF THE STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK IS FOCUSED ON DELIVERING DIFFERENTIATED PERFORMANCE ON A SUSTAINED BASIS, WITH CONSISTENT ABOVE MARKET ORGANIC GROWTH. MOVING FORWARD, THE COMPANY REMAINS COMMITTED TO THE FOUR STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES THAT HAVE SERVED AS THE FOUNDATION OF ITS PROGRESS OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS AND THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES BEST POSITIONS ITW TO DELIVER CONTINUED DIFFERENTIATED PERFORMANCE OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS:•THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL IS THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE•FOCUS ON QUALITY GROWTH•"DO WHAT WE SAY" EXECUTION IS A CRITICAL DIFFERENTIATOR•INVEST ONLY WHERE ITW HAS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGETHE ITW BUSINESS MODEL IS THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGETHE ITW BUSINESS MODEL IS THE COMBINATION OF A SET OF STRATEGIC, OPERATIONAL, AND CULTURAL APPROACHES AND PRACTICES THAT IS APPLIED TO EVERY ITW BUSINESS. THE BUSINESS MODEL HAS EXISTED INSIDE THE COMPANY FOR OVER 30 YEARS AND IS TRULY ITW'S DIFFERENTIATING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL IS COMPRISED OF THREE ELEMENTS:•80/20 FRONT TO BACK PROCESS = HOW THE COMPANY OPERATES•CUSTOMER-BACK INNOVATION APPROACH = HOW THE COMPANY INNOVATES20•DECENTRALIZED ENTREPRENEURIAL CULTURE = HOW THE COMPANY EXECUTESFOCUS ON QUALITY GROWTHITW PRIORITIZES HIGH-QUALITY REVENUE GROWTH AND, AS SUCH, THE COMPANY’S PRIMARY GROWTH FOCUS IS ORGANIC.LEVERAGING THE BUSINESS MODEL AND THE 80/20 FRONT TO BACK PROCESS PROVIDES A CLEAR VIEW OF WHERE TO FOCUS FOR HIGH- QUALITY GROWTH. THE COMPANY TARGETS DIFFERENTIATED END-MARKETS AND CUSTOMERS WITH CRITICAL NEEDS AND CHALLENGING PAIN POINTS. ITW GENERATES HIGH-QUALITY GROWTH THROUGH CONSISTENT CUSTOMER-BACK INNOVATION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE EXCELLENCE. THE COMPANY ONLY INVESTS AND OPERATES IN INDUSTRIES AND BUSINESSES THAT HAVE THE RIGHT “RAW MATERIAL” TO GENERATE HIGH QUALITY ORGANIC GROWTH THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL. ITW’S CURRENT PORTFOLIO OF SEVEN SEGMENTS OFFERS SOLID GROWTH POTENTIAL AND A HIGH DEGREE OF DIVERSIFICATION IN TERMS OF GEOGRAPHIC AND END MARKET EXPOSURES, ENABLING THE COMPANY TO DELIVER CONSISTENT HIGH-QUALITY GROWTH IN AN INCREASINGLY VOLATILE AND COMPETITIVE GLOBAL MARKET ENVIRONMENT."DO WHAT WE SAY" EXECUTION IS A CRITICAL DIFFERENTIATORITW’S COMMITMENT TO EXECUTION IS A KEY DIFFERENTIATOR FOR ITW. LIVING UP TO THE COMPANY’S COMMITMENTS - “DO WHAT WE SAY” EXECUTION - IS A DEEPLY EMBEDDED CORE ELEMENT OF THE CULTURE. THE CULTURE IS THE ENGINE THAT TRANSLATES ITW'S STRATEGY INTO ACTION, AND ACTION INTO RESULTS.ALL DIVISIONS FUNCTION WITHIN A “FRAMEWORK” THAT DEFINES HOW THE CULTURE OPERATES AND DEFINES THE COMPANY’S VALUES, BUSINESS MODEL AND STRATEGY TO ENSURE ALL DIVISIONS ARE WORKING TOWARD OUR COMMON SET OF GOALS. BUSINESS LEADERS HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DEFINE THE ACTIONS AND CUSTOMIZE THEIR APPROACH TO MEET THOSE GOALS. THIS “FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK” ESTABLISHES AN ENTREPRENEURIAL ENVIRONMENT WHERE DECISIONS ARE MADE “BOTTOM UP” BY THOSE WITH THE GREATEST KNOWLEDGE, CAPABILITY AND PROXIMITY TO THE CUSTOMER, WHICH ENABLES OUR BUSINESSES TO BE NIMBLE AND REACT QUICKLY TO MARKET CONDITIONS AND CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS.ITW IS SIMPLE, STRAIGHTFORWARD AND TRANSPARENT IN EVERYTHING IT DOES. THE COMPANY SETS CLEAR PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS AND FINANCIAL TARGETS, EXECUTES AGAINST THESE AT THE APPROPRIATE PACE, AND ESTABLISHES THE FREEDOM TO DEFINE HOW TO ACHIEVE RESULTS WITHIN THE CONSTRUCT OF THE BUSINESS MODEL.INVEST ONLY WHERE ITW HAS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGETHE COMPANY IS HIGHLY FOCUSED AND DISCIPLINED IN ITS APPROACH TO INVEST ONLY WHERE IT CAN LEVERAGE THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL INTO COMPELLING AND SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT ORGANIC GROWTH AND SUSTAIN ITS HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED CORE BUSINESSES, SUCH AS NEW PRODUCT INNOVATION, MARKETING PROGRAMS, SIMPLIFICATION PROJECTS, AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, ARE ITW’S NUMBER ONE INVESTMENT PRIORITY.

REFER TO NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NOTE 5. INCOME TAXES IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.•THE IMPACT OF THE EURO AND OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCIES AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR INCREASED OPERATING REVENUE AND INCOME BEFORE TAXES BY APPROXIMATELY $77 MILLION AND $13 MILLION IN 2017 VERSUS 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THE IMPACT OF THE EURO AND OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCIES AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR DECREASED OPERATING REVENUE BY APPROXIMATELY $210 MILLION AND INCOME BEFORE TAXES BY APPROXIMATELY $41 MILLION IN 2016 VERSUS 2015, RESPECTIVELY.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSEFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2017IN MARCH 2016, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE THAT INCLUDES SEVERAL CHANGES TO SIMPLIFY THE ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, INCLUDING THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, FORFEITURES, STATUTORY TAX WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS AND CLASSIFICATION OF TAX BENEFITS IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. AMONG THE MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES, THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THAT THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS AFTER ADOPTION OF THE GUIDANCE BE RECOGNIZED THROUGH INCOME TAX EXPENSE RATHER THAN DIRECTLY IN EQUITY. ADDITIONALLY, THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS RELATED TO EXCESS TAX BENEFITS SHOULD BE PRESENTED WITHIN OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS RATHER THAN AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY. EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN EQUITY UNDER THE PRIOR GUIDANCE WERE $29 MILLION AND $20 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE NEW GUIDANCE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2017 AND APPLIED THE NEW GUIDANCE PROSPECTIVELY. EXCESS TAX BENEFITS OF $50 MILLION WERE INCLUDED IN INCOME TAXES IN THE STATEMENT OF INCOME FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE EXPECTED EFFECT ON INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR NET CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES RELATED TO FUTURE STOCK-BASED AWARD SETTLEMENTS WILL VARY EACH PERIOD AND WILL DEPEND ON INPUTS SUCH AS THE STOCK PRICE AT THE TIME OF SETTLEMENT AND THE NUMBER OF AWARDS SETTLED IN THE PERIOD PRESENTED.EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE TO CHANGE THE CRITERIA FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION. THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF THE NEW GUIDANCE IS THAT REVENUE SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION DISCLOSURES WILL BE REQUIRED. THE COMPANY'S SALES ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS ARE PREDOMINATELY SHORT TERM IN NATURE AND GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR TRANSFER OF CONTROL AND REVENUE RECOGNITION AT THE TIME OF PRODUCT SHIPMENT OR DELIVERY OF SERVICE. IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, ARRANGEMENTS MAY INCLUDE SERVICE PERFORMED OVER TIME, OR THERE MAY BE SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS TO THE CUSTOMER THAT ARE UNFULFILLED AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT, TYPICALLY INVOLVING INSTALLATION OF EQUIPMENT AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS NEW GUIDANCE UNDER THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD WHICH REQUIRES THE NEW GUIDANCE TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY TO REVENUE TRANSACTIONS COMPLETED ON OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE. GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE COMPANY’S REVENUE TRANSACTIONS, THE NEW GUIDANCE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S OPERATING REVENUE, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR FINANCIAL POSITION. AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING THE GUIDANCE, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECORD A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT REDUCING RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2018 BY APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION RELATED TO CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE IMPACTED BY THE NEW GUIDANCE. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES IN PERIODS SUBSEQUENT TO ADOPTION.IN OCTOBER 2016, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE REQUIRING THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INTRA-ENTITY TRANSFER OF AN ASSET, OTHER THAN INVENTORY, WHEN THE TRANSFER OCCURS RATHER THAN WHEN TRANSFERRED TO A THIRD PARTY AS REQUIRED UNDER THE CURRENT GUIDANCE. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE NEW GUIDANCE AND WILL APPLY THE NEWLY ADOPTED GUIDANCE TO INTRA-ENTITY ASSET TRANSFERS ON OR AFTER THE DATE OF ADOPTION. AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING THE NEW GUIDANCE, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECORD A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT REDUCING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND RETAINED EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, INTRA-ENTITY ASSET TRANSFERS MAY RESULT IN FUTURE TAX RATE VOLATILITY UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE.IN MARCH 2017, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE WHICH CHANGES THE INCOME STATEMENT PRESENTATION OF THE COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST RELATED TO DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. THE PRIMARY CHANGE UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE IS THAT ONLY THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN OPERATING INCOME AND IS ELIGIBLE FOR CAPITALIZATION AS AN ASSET. THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST, INCLUDING INTEREST COST, EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS, SETTLEMENTS, CURTAILMENTS, AND AMORTIZATION OF ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES AND PRIOR SERVICE COST, SHOULD BE PRESENTED BELOW OPERATING INCOME. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE NEW GUIDANCE AND WILL APPLY THE NEW 33PRESENTATION OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST IN FUTURE PERIODS AND EXPECTS TO RESTATE PRIOR PERIODS FOR COMPARABILITY. THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2016 AND 2015, THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST WERE INCOME OF $9 MILLION, INCOME OF $8 MILLION, AND EXPENSE OF $1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. REFER TO NOTE 9. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY’S NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST.EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE TO CHANGE THE CRITERIA FOR RECOGNIZING LEASING TRANSACTIONS. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, A LESSEE WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE A LEASE LIABILITY AND LEASE ASSET FOR ALL LEASES, INCLUDING OPERATING LEASES, WITH A LEASE TERM GREATER THAN TWELVE MONTHS IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION. SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT, INCLUDING PRESENTATION OF EXPENSES AND CASH FLOWS, WILL DEPEND ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE LEASE AS EITHER A FINANCING OR OPERATING LEASE. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL NEW DISCLOSURES WILL BE REQUIRED. THIS GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2019, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET COMPLETED ITS EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE WILL HAVE ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECOGNIZE RIGHT OF USE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR ITS OPERATING LEASES IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION UPON ADOPTION.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESTHE COMPANY’S PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE CASH FLOW AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAD $3.1 BILLION OF CASH ON HAND AT DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND ALSO MAINTAINS STRONG ACCESS TO PUBLIC DEBT MARKETS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE SOURCES ARE SUFFICIENT TO SERVICE DEBT AND TO FINANCE THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL ALLOCATION PRIORITIES, WHICH INCLUDE:•INTERNAL INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT ORGANIC GROWTH AND SUSTAIN CORE BUSINESSES;•PAYMENT OF AN ATTRACTIVE DIVIDEND TO SHAREHOLDERS; AND•EXTERNAL INVESTMENTS IN SELECTIVE STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS THAT SUPPORT THE COMPANY'S ORGANIC GROWTH FOCUS AND AN ACTIVE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT, BASED ON ITS OPERATING REVENUE, OPERATING MARGIN, FREE CASH FLOW, AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY.34CASH FLOWTHE COMPANY USES FREE CASH FLOW TO MEASURE CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, ACQUISITIONS AND DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES. FREE CASH FLOW REPRESENTS NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS ADDITIONS TO PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. FREE CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2016 AND 2015 WAS AS FOLLOWS:FREE CASH FLOW FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF AN ADDITIONAL $115 MILLION DISCRETIONARY PENSION CONTRIBUTION RELATED TO THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN.STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMSON AUGUST 2, 2013, THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDED FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $6.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME (THE "2013 PROGRAM"). UNDER THE 2013 PROGRAM, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 14.9 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $96.84 DURING 2015. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THERE WERE NO AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THE 2013 PROGRAM.ON FEBRUARY 13, 2015, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDED FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $6.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME (THE "2015 PROGRAM"). UNDER THE 2015 PROGRAM, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 6.1 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $91.78 PER SHARE DURING 2015, APPROXIMATELY 18.7 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $107.17 PER SHARE DURING 2016, AND APPROXIMATELY 7.1 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $140.56 PER SHARE DURING 2017. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY $2.4 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THE 2015 PROGRAM.35ADJUSTED AFTER-TAX RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITALTHE COMPANY USES ADJUSTED AFTER-TAX RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL ("ROIC") TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS’ USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. ROIC IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. FOR COMPARABILITY, THE COMPANY EXCLUDED THE $658 MILLION INCOME TAX CHARGE FROM THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND THE $95 MILLION CONFIDENTIAL LEGAL SETTLEMENT FROM THE CALCULATION OF ROIC FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. ADJUSTED AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S EQUITY INVESTMENT IN THE WILSONART BUSINESS (FORMERLY THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT). AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE PERIOD AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. ROIC FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2016, AND 2015 WAS AS FOLLOWS:ROIC INCREASED 230 BASIS POINTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD AS A RESULT OF A 13.7% IMPROVEMENT IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME VERSUS A 3.3% INCREASE IN ADJUSTED AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL. THE DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IMPROVED AFTER-TAX ROIC BY 50 BASIS POINTS IN 2017. ROIC INCREASED 170 BASIS POINTS IN 2016 VERSUS 2015 AS A RESULT OF A 7.1% IMPROVEMENT IN AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME AND A 1.3% DECREASE IN ADJUSTED AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL. 36A RECONCILIATION OF THE 2017 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE EXCLUDING THE DISCRETE TAX CHARGE RELATED TO THE 2017 U.S. TAX LEGISLATION IS AS FOLLOWS:WORKING CAPITALMANAGEMENT USES WORKING CAPITAL AS A MEASUREMENT OF THE SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY. NET WORKING CAPITAL AT DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS:THE INCREASE IN NET WORKING CAPITAL AT DECEMBER 31, 2017 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER CASH AND EQUIVALENTS.CASH AND EQUIVALENTS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $3.1 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND $2.5 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, PRIMARILY ALL OF WHICH WAS HELD BY INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES. CASH AND EQUIVALENTS HELD INTERNATIONALLY MAY BE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES IF REPATRIATED TO THE U.S. A PORTION OF THE CASH AND EQUIVALENTS BALANCES HELD INTERNATIONALLY IS TYPICALLY USED FOR INTERNATIONAL OPERATING NEEDS, REINVESTED TO FUND EXPANSION OF EXISTING INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES, USED TO FUND NEW INTERNATIONAL ACQUISITIONS, OR USED TO REPAY DEBT HELD INTERNATIONALLY. IN THE U.S., THE COMPANY UTILIZES CASH FLOWS FROM DOMESTIC OPERATIONS TO FUND DOMESTIC CASH NEEDS, WHICH PRIMARILY CONSIST OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, SHARE REPURCHASES, ACQUISITIONS, SERVICING OF DOMESTIC DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, WHICH IS BACKED BY LONG-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES, FOR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES CASH GENERATED DOMESTICALLY AND LIQUIDITY PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY'S COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND CASH REQUIREMENTS IN THE U.S.ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE "TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT" (THE “ACT”) WAS ENACTED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE PROVISIONS OF THE ACT SIGNIFICANTLY REVISE THE U.S. CORPORATE INCOME TAX RULES, INCLUDING A ONE-TIME REPATRIATION TAX ON THE DEEMED REPATRIATION OF POST-1986 UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017, THE COMPANY RECORDED A ONE-TIME ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $658 MILLION RELATED TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE ACT WHICH, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, INCLUDED THE ONE-TIME DEEMED REPATRIATION TAX. AS A RESULT OF THE ONE-TIME REPATRIATION PROVISIONS OF THE ACT, THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. TAXES ON THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF ITS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND EXPECTS TO REPATRIATE APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION OF FOREIGN HELD CASH AND EQUIVALENTS. SEE NOTE 5. INCOME TAXES IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.37DEBTTOTAL DEBT AT DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016 WAS AS FOLLOWS:AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, SHORT-TERM DEBT INCLUDED COMMERCIAL PAPER OF $849 MILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, SHORT-TERM DEBT INCLUDED $650 MILLION RELATED TO THE 0.90% NOTES DUE FEBRUARY 25, 2017, WHICH WERE REPAID ON THE DUE DATE. THERE WAS NO COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016.THE COMPANY MAY ISSUE COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FUND GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, AND SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2016, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $2.5 BILLION, FIVE-YEAR LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF MAY 9, 2021 TO SUPPORT THE POTENTIAL ISSUANCES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. THIS AGREEMENT REPLACED THE PREVIOUSLY EXISTING $1.5 BILLION LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 8, 2017 AND THE $1.0 BILLION LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF AUGUST 15, 2018. NO AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THE NEW LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT AT DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE MAXIMUM OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER BALANCE DURING 2017 WAS $1.1 BILLION, WHILE THE AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE WAS $691 MILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN OPERATIONS HAD AUTHORIZED CREDIT FACILITIES WITH UNUSED CAPACITY OF $206 MILLION.IN NOVEMBER 2016, THE COMPANY ISSUED $1.0 BILLION OF 2.65% NOTES DUE NOVEMBER 15, 2026 AT 99.685% OF FACE VALUE. NET PROCEEDS FROM THE NOVEMBER 2016 DEBT ISSUANCE WERE USED TO REPAY COMMERCIAL PAPER AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDATHE COMPANY USES THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA TO MEASURE ITS ABILITY TO REPAY ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY'S LONG TERM FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA. EBITDA AND THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA REPRESENTS TOTAL DEBT DIVIDED BY INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ON A TRAILING TWELVE MONTH BASIS. TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2016 AND 2015 WAS AS FOLLOWS:38STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITYTHE CHANGES TO STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY DURING 2017 AND 2016 WERE AS FOLLOWS:CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSTHE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 WERE AS FOLLOWS:AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, THE COMPANY HAD RECORDED NONCURRENT LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF $167 MILLION. THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2017.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESTHE COMPANY HAS SIX ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT IT BELIEVES ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND WHICH REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND IN SOME CASES ON OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION. VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS ARE ALSO USED THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.THE COMPANY'S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE AS FOLLOWS:REALIZABILITY OF INVENTORIES— INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY’S BUSINESSES PERFORM AN ANALYSIS OF THE HISTORICAL SALES USAGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL INVENTORY ITEMS ON HAND AND A RESERVE IS RECORDED TO ADJUST INVENTORY COST TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING USAGE CRITERIA:USAGE CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA RESERVE %ACTIVE QUANTITY ON HAND IS LESS THAN PRIOR 6 MONTHS OF USAGE 0%SLOW-MOVING SOME USAGE IN LAST 12 MONTHS, BUT QUANTITY ON HAND EXCEEDS PRIOR 6 MONTHS OF USAGE 50%OBSOLETE NO USAGE IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS 90%IN ADDITION, FOR APPROXIMATELY 21% OF TOTAL INVENTORIES, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO USE THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT ("LIFO") METHOD OF INVENTORY COSTING. GENERALLY, THIS METHOD RESULTS IN A LOWER INVENTORY VALUE THAN THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT ("FIFO") METHOD DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION.39COLLECTIBILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE— THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS BASED ON THE GREATER OF A SPECIFIC RESERVE OR A RESERVE CALCULATED BASED ON THE HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF PERCENTAGE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. IN ADDITION, RESERVES FOR CUSTOMER CREDITS AND CASH DISCOUNTS ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE.DEPRECIATION OF PLANT AND EQUIPMENT— THE COMPANY’S U.S. BUSINESSES PRIMARILY COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS, AS FOLLOWS:BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS150% DECLINING BALANCEMACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT200% DECLINING BALANCETHE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS.INCOME TAXES— THE COMPANY PROVIDES DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX LAWS. THE COMPANY’S DEFERRED AND OTHER TAX BALANCES ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE TAX REGULATIONS AND RULINGS IN NUMEROUS TAXING JURISDICTIONS. INCOME TAX EXPENSE, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECOGNIZED BY THE COMPANY ALSO REFLECT ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE LEVEL OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, THE EFFECT OF THE COMPANY’S VARIOUS TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES AND UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. FUTURE TAX AUTHORITY RULINGS AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, CHANGES IN PROJECTED LEVELS OF TAXABLE INCOME AND FUTURE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES COULD AFFECT THE ACTUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND TAX BALANCES RECORDED BY THE COMPANY.GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS— THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS TYPICALLY RESULT IN RECORDING GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH ARE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY’S TOTAL ASSETS AND AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT THE COMPANY COULD INCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE GUIDANCE PRESCRIBED IN THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO TEST GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF TRIGGERING EVENTS OCCUR, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO DETERMINE IF A POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, IF ANY, IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT’S GOODWILL. IN CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS OR SPECIFIC INTANGIBLE ASSETS, MANAGEMENT RELIES ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING BUSINESS PLANS, ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS, ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER MARKET DATA. THERE ARE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THESE FACTORS AND MANAGEMENT’S JUDGMENT IN APPLYING THEM IN THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, THE COMPANY HAD TOTAL GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY $6.0 BILLION ALLOCATED TO ITS REPORTING UNITS. ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ITS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE COMPANY GENERALLY BELIEVES THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IS LESSENED BY THE NUMBER OF DIVERSIFIED BUSINESSES AND END MARKETS REPRESENTED BY ITS REPORTING UNITS THAT HAVE GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES IN MANY OF THE REPORTING UNITS HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, AND IN MANY CASES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPANY’S 80/20 FRONT TO BACK PROCESS. THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL REPORTING UNITS RANGES FROM APPROXIMATELY $45 MILLION TO $1.3 BILLION, WITH THE AVERAGE AMOUNT EQUAL TO $546 MILLION. FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT AND ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE COMPANY’S GLOBAL END MARKETS, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ONE OR MORE REPORTING UNITS COULD OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS.PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS— THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS COMPANY-SPONSORED DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING A NUMBER OF U.S. EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON EACH PARTICIPANT’S YEARS OF SERVICE, FUTURE COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, LIFE EXPECTANCY, AND HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES. FUTURE CHANGES IN ANY OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE AMOUNTS RECORDED RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. SEE NOTE 9. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES.THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES AS OF THE YEAR-END MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN. THE DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH THE ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES COULD THEORETICALLY BE 40EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. IN ESTIMATING THIS RATE, THE COMPANY LOOKS AT RATES OF RETURN ON HIGH-QUALITY FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS, WITH SIMILAR DURATION TO THE LIABILITIES IN THE PLAN. A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN OBLIGATION BY APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION. BEGINNING IN 2017, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE METHOD USED TO ESTIMATE THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS. THE NEW METHOD PROVIDES A MORE PRECISE MEASURE OF THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST BY APPLYING SPECIFIC SPOT RATES ALONG THE YIELD CURVE TO THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS RATHER THAN A SINGLE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE RATE. SEE NOTE 9. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY'S PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS AND RELATED ASSUMPTIONS.THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR SIMILAR INVESTMENT ALLOCATIONS AMONG ASSET CLASSES. FOR THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN, A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WOULD INCREASE THE ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMARKET RISKTHE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CERTAIN MARKET RISKS THAT EXIST AS PART OF ITS ONGOING BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRICE VOLATILITY FOR CERTAIN COMMODITIES AND CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE OR LEVERAGED TRANSACTIONS AND DOES NOT HOLD OR ISSUE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING PURPOSES.INTEREST RATE RISKTHE COMPANY’S EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK FOR CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY’S FIXED RATE DEBT. REFER TO NOTE 8. DEBT IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL DATA FOR DETAILS RELATED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF COMPANY'S DEBT INSTRUMENTS.FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKTHE COMPANY OPERATES IN THE U.S. AND 55 FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THE FUNDING FOR THE FOREIGN MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS IS PROVIDED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE PERMANENT INVESTMENT OF EQUITY CAPITAL. THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY MANUFACTURED AND SOLD WITHIN THE SAME COUNTRY. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT ASSETS OR LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES.THE COMPANY DESIGNATED €1.0 BILLION OF EURO NOTES ISSUED IN MAY 2014 AND €1.0 BILLION OF EURO NOTES ISSUED IN MAY 2015 AS HEDGES OF A PORTION OF ITS NET INVESTMENT IN EURO-DENOMINATED FOREIGN OPERATIONS TO REDUCE FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTMENT IN THESE OPERATIONS. CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THIS DEBT RESULTING FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN THE EURO TO U.S. DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS WITHIN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS). THE CUMULATIVE UNREALIZED GAIN RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) RELATED TO THE NET INVESTMENT HEDGE WAS $81 MILLION AND $375 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016, RESPECTIVELY.41ITEM 8.

(THE "COMPANY" OR "ITW") IS A GLOBAL MANUFACTURER OF A DIVERSIFIED RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT WITH APPROXIMATELY 85 DIVISIONS IN 56 COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY PRIMARILY SERVES THE AUTOMOTIVE OEM/TIERS, COMMERCIAL FOOD EQUIPMENT, CONSTRUCTION, GENERAL INDUSTRIAL, AND AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET END MARKETS.CONSOLIDATION AND TRANSLATION— THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE COMPANY AND ITS MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST. INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS ARE ELIMINATED FROM THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES’ ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE TRANSLATED TO U.S. DOLLARS AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES FOR THE PERIOD. TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY.RECLASSIFICATIONS— CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS OF PRIOR YEAR DATA HAVE BEEN MADE TO CONFORM TO CURRENT YEAR REPORTING.USE OF ESTIMATES— THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.ACQUISITIONS— THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ACQUISITIONS UNDER THE ACQUISITION METHOD, IN WHICH ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AS OF THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION.OPERATING REVENUE— OPERATING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, PRODUCT HAS SHIPPED AND THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE TRANSFERRED OR SERVICES HAVE BEEN RENDERED, THE PRICE TO THE CUSTOMER IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED, WHICH IS GENERALLY AT THE TIME OF PRODUCT SHIPMENT. TYPICAL SALES ARRANGEMENTS ARE FOR STANDARD PRODUCTS AND PROVIDE FOR TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP AND RISK OF LOSS AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT. IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS TO THE CUSTOMER ARE UNFULFILLED AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT, TYPICALLY INVOLVING INSTALLATION AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE, REVENUE RECOGNITION IS DEFERRED UNTIL SUCH OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. CUSTOMER ALLOWANCES AND REBATES, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF VOLUME DISCOUNTS AND OTHER SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, ARE ESTIMATED AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND KNOWN TRENDS AND ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN REPORTED REVENUES.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES— RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ARE RECORDED AS EXPENSE IN THE YEAR INCURRED. THESE COSTS WERE $225 MILLION, $223 MILLION AND $218 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY.ADVERTISING EXPENSES— ADVERTISING EXPENSES ARE RECORDED AS EXPENSE IN THE YEAR INCURRED. THESE COSTS WERE $53 MILLION, $58 MILLION AND $58 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY.INCOME TAXES— THE COMPANY UTILIZES THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES GIVEN THE PROVISIONS OF THE ENACTED TAX LAWS. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED WHEN IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX BENEFIT OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL NOT BE REALIZED.CASH AND EQUIVALENTS— CASH AND EQUIVALENTS INCLUDE CASH ON HAND AND INSTRUMENTS HAVING ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS. CASH AND EQUIVALENTS ARE STATED AT COST, WHICH APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE.49TRADE RECEIVABLES— TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE NET OF ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS WHICH INCLUDES RESERVES FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS, CUSTOMER CREDITS AND CASH DISCOUNTS. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS BASED ON THE GREATER OF A SPECIFIC RESERVE OR A RESERVE CALCULATED BASED ON THE HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF PERCENTAGE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. IN ADDITION, RESERVES FOR CUSTOMER CREDITS AND CASH DISCOUNTS ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE. THE CHANGES IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED 2017, 2016 AND 2015 WERE AS FOLLOWS:IN MILLIONS 2017 2016 2015BEGINNING BALANCE $43 $42 $43PROVISION CHARGED TO EXPENSE 3 7 7WRITE-OFFS, NET OF RECOVERIES (6) (6) (5)ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES — 1 —FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION 3 (1) (3)ENDING BALANCE $43 $43 $42INVENTORIES— INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE AND INCLUDE MATERIAL, LABOR AND FACTORY OVERHEAD. THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT ("LIFO") METHOD IS USED TO DETERMINE THE COST OF INVENTORIES AT CERTAIN U.S. BUSINESSES. THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT ("FIFO") METHOD, WHICH APPROXIMATES CURRENT COST, IS USED FOR ALL OTHER INVENTORIES. INVENTORIES PRICED AT LIFO WERE APPROXIMATELY 21% AND 22% OF TOTAL INVENTORIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. IF THE FIFO METHOD WAS USED FOR ALL INVENTORIES, TOTAL INVENTORIES WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $89 MILLION AND $86 MILLION HIGHER THAN REPORTED AT DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THE MAJOR CLASSES OF INVENTORY AT DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016 WERE AS FOLLOWS:NET PLANT AND EQUIPMENT— NET PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE STATED AT COST, LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION. RENEWALS AND IMPROVEMENTS THAT INCREASE THE USEFUL LIFE OF PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE CAPITALIZED. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED. NET PLANT AND EQUIPMENT CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING AT DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016:THE COMPANY’S U.S. BUSINESSES PRIMARILY COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. THE RANGES OF USEFUL LIVES USED TO DEPRECIATE PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS:BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS5—50 YEARSMACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT3—12 YEARSEQUIPMENT LEASED TO OTHERSTERM OF LEASE50DEPRECIATION WAS $256 MILLION, $246 MILLION AND $244 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY.GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS— GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS COST OVER FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE BEING AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF 3 TO 20 YEARS. THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ANNUALLY, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF TRIGGERING EVENTS OCCUR, BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS. WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE GOODWILL ASSIGNED TO EACH OF ITS REPORTING UNITS FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE RELEVANT REPORTING UNIT TO THE CARRYING VALUE. THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS LEVEL 2 AND LEVEL 3 VALUATION TECHNIQUES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS, INCLUDING DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS BASED ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT REPORTING UNIT AND MARKET MULTIPLES OF RELEVANT PUBLIC COMPANIES. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, IF ANY, IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S GOODWILL.THE COMPANY'S INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONSIST OF TRADEMARKS AND BRANDS. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON A LEVEL 3 VALUATION METHOD USING A RELIEF-FROM-ROYALTY INCOME APPROACH DERIVED FROM INTERNALLY FORECASTED REVENUES OF THE RELATED PRODUCTS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TRADEMARK OR BRAND IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND CARRYING VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET.ACCRUED WARRANTIES— THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR PRODUCT WARRANTIES BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. THE CHANGES IN ACCRUED WARRANTIES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2016 AND 2015 WERE AS FOLLOWS:NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSEFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2017IN MARCH 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (THE "FASB") ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE THAT INCLUDES SEVERAL CHANGES TO SIMPLIFY THE ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, INCLUDING THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, FORFEITURES, STATUTORY TAX WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS AND CLASSIFICATION OF TAX BENEFITS IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. AMONG THE MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES, THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THAT THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS AFTER ADOPTION OF THE GUIDANCE BE RECOGNIZED THROUGH INCOME TAX EXPENSE RATHER THAN DIRECTLY IN EQUITY. ADDITIONALLY, THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS RELATED TO EXCESS TAX BENEFITS SHOULD BE PRESENTED WITHIN OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS RATHER THAN AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY. EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN EQUITY UNDER THE PRIOR GUIDANCE WERE $29 MILLION AND $20 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE NEW GUIDANCE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2017 AND APPLIED THE NEW GUIDANCE PROSPECTIVELY. EXCESS TAX BENEFITS OF $50 MILLION WERE INCLUDED IN INCOME TAXES IN THE STATEMENT OF INCOME FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE EXPECTED EFFECT ON INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR NET CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES RELATED TO FUTURE STOCK-BASED AWARD SETTLEMENTS WILL VARY EACH PERIOD AND WILL DEPEND ON INPUTS SUCH AS THE STOCK PRICE AT THE TIME OF SETTLEMENT AND THE NUMBER OF AWARDS SETTLED IN THE PERIOD PRESENTED.51EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE TO CHANGE THE CRITERIA FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION. THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF THE NEW GUIDANCE IS THAT REVENUE SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION DISCLOSURES WILL BE REQUIRED. THE COMPANY'S SALES ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS ARE PREDOMINATELY SHORT TERM IN NATURE AND GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR TRANSFER OF CONTROL AND REVENUE RECOGNITION AT THE TIME OF PRODUCT SHIPMENT OR DELIVERY OF SERVICE. IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, ARRANGEMENTS MAY INCLUDE SERVICE PERFORMED OVER TIME, OR THERE MAY BE SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS TO THE CUSTOMER THAT ARE UNFULFILLED AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT, TYPICALLY INVOLVING INSTALLATION OF EQUIPMENT AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS NEW GUIDANCE UNDER THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD WHICH REQUIRES THE NEW GUIDANCE TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY TO REVENUE TRANSACTIONS COMPLETED ON OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE. GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE COMPANY’S REVENUE TRANSACTIONS, THE NEW GUIDANCE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S OPERATING REVENUE, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR FINANCIAL POSITION. AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING THE GUIDANCE, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECORD A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT REDUCING RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2018 BY APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION RELATED TO CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE IMPACTED BY THE NEW GUIDANCE. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES IN PERIODS SUBSEQUENT TO ADOPTION.IN OCTOBER 2016, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE REQUIRING THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INTRA-ENTITY TRANSFER OF AN ASSET, OTHER THAN INVENTORY, WHEN THE TRANSFER OCCURS RATHER THAN WHEN TRANSFERRED TO A THIRD PARTY AS REQUIRED UNDER THE CURRENT GUIDANCE. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE NEW GUIDANCE AND WILL APPLY THE NEWLY ADOPTED GUIDANCE TO INTRA-ENTITY ASSET TRANSFERS ON OR AFTER THE DATE OF ADOPTION. AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING THE NEW GUIDANCE, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECORD A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT REDUCING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND RETAINED EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, INTRA-ENTITY ASSET TRANSFERS MAY RESULT IN FUTURE TAX RATE VOLATILITY UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE.IN MARCH 2017, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE WHICH CHANGES THE INCOME STATEMENT PRESENTATION OF THE COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST RELATED TO DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. THE PRIMARY CHANGE UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE IS THAT ONLY THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN OPERATING INCOME AND IS ELIGIBLE FOR CAPITALIZATION AS AN ASSET. THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST, INCLUDING INTEREST COST, EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS, SETTLEMENTS, CURTAILMENTS, AND AMORTIZATION OF ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES AND PRIOR SERVICE COST, SHOULD BE PRESENTED BELOW OPERATING INCOME. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE NEW GUIDANCE AND WILL APPLY THE NEW PRESENTATION OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST IN FUTURE PERIODS AND EXPECTS TO RESTATE PRIOR PERIODS FOR COMPARABILITY. THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2016 AND 2015, THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST WERE INCOME OF $9 MILLION, INCOME OF $8 MILLION, AND EXPENSE OF $1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. REFER TO NOTE 9. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY’S NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST.EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE TO CHANGE THE CRITERIA FOR RECOGNIZING LEASING TRANSACTIONS. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, A LESSEE WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE A LEASE LIABILITY AND LEASE ASSET FOR ALL LEASES, INCLUDING OPERATING LEASES, WITH A LEASE TERM GREATER THAN TWELVE MONTHS IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION. SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT, INCLUDING PRESENTATION OF EXPENSES AND CASH FLOWS, WILL DEPEND ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE LEASE AS EITHER A FINANCING OR OPERATING LEASE. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL NEW DISCLOSURES WILL BE REQUIRED. THIS GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2019, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET COMPLETED ITS EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE WILL HAVE ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECOGNIZE RIGHT OF USE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR ITS OPERATING LEASES IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION UPON ADOPTION.(2) ACQUISITIONSNET CASH PAID FOR ACQUISITIONS DURING 2017, 2016 AND 2015 WAS $3 MILLION, $453 MILLION AND $6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ACQUISITIONS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, DID NOT MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION FOR ANY PERIOD PRESENTED.THE NET CASH PAID FOR ACQUISITIONS IN 2016 PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE ENGINEERED FASTENERS AND COMPONENTS ("EF&C") BUSINESS FROM ZF TRW ON JULY 1, 2016 FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $450 MILLION. EF&C HAD OPERATING REVENUE OF $517 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND $245 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 522016, WHICH WAS REPORTED WITHIN THE COMPANY’S AUTOMOTIVE OEM SEGMENT. AS A RESULT OF THE EF&C TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY RECORDED $187 MILLION OF GOODWILL AND $134 MILLION OF AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY RELATED TO CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND TECHNOLOGY. APPROXIMATELY $104 MILLION OF THE ACQUIRED GOODWILL BALANCE IS TAX DEDUCTIBLE. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE ESTIMATED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW AND MARKET-BASED VALUATION MODELS USING LEVEL 2 AND LEVEL 3 INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS. THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO BE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES RANGING FROM 4 TO 17 YEARS, WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE AMORTIZATION PERIOD OF 16 YEARS.(3) LEGAL SETTLEMENTIN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $95 MILLION CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TO RESOLVE A LITIGATION MATTER. BASED ON THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY RECEIVED THE SETTLEMENT WITHIN 120 DAYS OF THE EXECUTION OF THE AGREEMENT.
