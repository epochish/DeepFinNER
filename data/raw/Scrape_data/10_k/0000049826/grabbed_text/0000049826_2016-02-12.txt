ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSINTRODUCTIONILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. (THE "COMPANY" OR "ITW") IS A GLOBAL MANUFACTURER OF A DIVERSIFIED RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT WITH 84 DIVISIONS IN 57 COUNTRIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 48,000 PERSONS.THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS ARE ORGANIZED AND MANAGED BASED ON SIMILAR PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND SIMILAR END MARKETS, AND ARE REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT AS THE FOLLOWING SEVEN SEGMENTS: AUTOMOTIVE OEM; TEST & MEASUREMENT AND ELECTRONICS; FOOD EQUIPMENT; POLYMERS & FLUIDS; WELDING; CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS; AND SPECIALTY PRODUCTS.DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF DIVERSE BUSINESSES AND THE COMPANY'S DECENTRALIZED OPERATING STRUCTURE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT REQUIRE ITS BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE DETAILED INFORMATION ON OPERATING RESULTS. INSTEAD, THE COMPANY'S CORPORATE MANAGEMENT COLLECTS DATA ON SEVERAL KEY MEASUREMENTS: OPERATING REVENUE, OPERATING INCOME, OPERATING MARGIN, OVERHEAD COSTS, NUMBER OF MONTHS ON HAND IN INVENTORY, DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PAST DUE RECEIVABLES AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. THESE KEY MEASURES ARE MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OPERATING RESULTS VERSUS CURRENT TRENDS IN END MARKETS AND VARIANCES FROM FORECASTS ARE DISCUSSED WITH OPERATING UNIT MANAGEMENT.THE ITW BUSINESS MODELTHE POWERFUL AND HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED ITW BUSINESS MODEL IS THE COMPANY’S CORE SOURCE OF VALUE CREATION. THIS BUSINESS MODEL IS THE COMPANY’S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND DEFINES HOW ITW CREATES VALUE FOR ITS SHAREHOLDERS AND COMPRISES THREE UNIQUE ELEMENTS:•ITW’S 80/20 MANAGEMENT PROCESS IS THE OPERATING SYSTEM THAT IS APPLIED IN EVERY ITW BUSINESS. INITIALLY INTRODUCED AS A MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY TOOL IN THE 1980’S, ITW HAS CONTINUALLY REFINED, IMPROVED AND EXPANDED 80/20 INTO A PROPRIETARY, HOLISTIC BUSINESS MANAGEMENT PROCESS THAT GENERATES SIGNIFICANT VALUE FOR THE COMPANY. THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF DATA-DRIVEN INSIGHTS GENERATED BY 80/20 PRACTICE, ITW FOCUSES ON ITS LARGEST AND BEST OPPORTUNITIES (THE “80”) AND ELIMINATES COMPLEXITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE LESS PROFITABLE OPPORTUNITIES (THE “20”). 80/20 ENABLES ITW BUSINESSES TO CONSISTENTLY DELIVER WORLD-CLASS OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE IN REGARDS TO PRODUCT AVAILABILITY, QUALITY, AND INNOVATION, WHILE GENERATING SUPERIOR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE;•CUSTOMER-BACK INNOVATION HAS FUELED DECADES OF PROFITABLE GROWTH AT ITW. THE COMPANY’S UNIQUE INNOVATION APPROACH IS BUILT ON THE INSIGHT GATHERED FROM THE 80/20 MANAGEMENT PROCESS. WORKING FROM THE CUSTOMER BACK, ITW BUSINESSES POSITION THEMSELVES AS THE GO-TO PROBLEM SOLVER FOR THEIR “80” CUSTOMERS. ITW’S INNOVATION EFFORTS ARE FOCUSED ON UNDERSTANDING CUSTOMER NEEDS, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN “80” MARKETS WITH SOLID LONG-TERM GROWTH FUNDAMENTALS, AND THEN CREATING UNIQUE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. THESE CUSTOMER INSIGHTS AND LEARNINGS DRIVE INNOVATION AT ITW AND HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A PORTFOLIO OF MORE THAN 16,000 GRANTED AND PENDING PATENTS;•ITW’S DECENTRALIZED, ENTREPRENEURIAL CULTURE ALLOWS ITW BUSINESSES TO BE FAST, FOCUSED, AND RESPONSIVE. ITW BUSINESSES HAVE SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL TO CUSTOMIZE THEIR APPROACH IN ORDER TO BEST SERVE THEIR CUSTOMERS. ITW COLLEAGUES ARE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THEM WITH REGARD TO ITW’S BUSINESS MODEL, STRATEGY, AND VALUES. THIS LEADS TO A FOCUSED AND SIMPLE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE THAT, COMBINED WITH OUTSTANDING EXECUTION, DELIVERS OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE ADAPTED TO THEIR SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS AND END MARKETS.ENTERPRISE STRATEGYIN 2013, ITW BEGAN THE PROCESS OF TRANSITIONING THE COMPANY ONTO ITS CURRENT STRATEGIC PATH TO FULLY LEVERAGE THE COMPELLING PERFORMANCE POTENTIAL OF THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL. SINCE THEN, ITW HAS MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS, AS EVIDENCED BY THE COMPANY’S STRONG FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS.THE ROOTS OF ITW’S ENTERPRISE STRATEGY BEGAN IN 2011-2012, WHEN THE COMPANY UNDERTOOK A COMPLETE REVIEW OF ITS PERFORMANCE. ITW GATHERED DEEP INSIGHTS FROM ITS BUSINESSES THAT WERE DELIVERING CONSISTENT ABOVE-MARKET GROWTH WITH BEST-IN-CLASS MARGINS AND RETURNS, AND DEFINED A STRATEGY TO REPLICATE THAT PERFORMANCE THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY.18BASED ON THIS RIGOROUS AND THOROUGH EVALUATION, ITW DETERMINED TWO PATHS TO DELIVER WORLD-CLASS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND COMPELLING LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR ITS SHAREHOLDERS. ONE, ITW NEEDED TO SHIFT THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY GROWTH ENGINE TO ORGANIC; AND TWO, THE COMPANY NEEDED TO LEVERAGE THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL TO DELIVER BEST-IN-CLASS MARGINS AND RETURNS.SHIFT THE COMPANY’S CORE GROWTH ENGINE TO ORGANICIN ORDER TO PIVOT TO FULLY FOCUS ON ORGANIC GROWTH, THE COMPANY NEEDED TO FIRST ACCOMPLISH SEVERAL PREPARATORY STEPS. THESE KEY INITIATIVES WERE A MAJOR FOCUS OF THE COMPANY IN 2012-2015, WHICH INCLUDED PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION AND STRATEGIC SOURCING.THE FIRST STEP, PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, WAS TO CONSTRUCT AND MAINTAIN A BUSINESS PORTFOLIO CAPABLE OF DELIVERING CONSISTENT ABOVE-MARKET ORGANIC GROWTH. AS PART OF THIS INITIATIVE TO REALIGN THE PORTFOLIO, ITW EXITED BUSINESSES THAT WERE OPERATING IN COMMODITIZED MARKET SPACES AND PRIORITIZED SUSTAINABLE DIFFERENTIATION AS A MUST-HAVE REQUIREMENT FOR ALL ITW BUSINESSES. THIS PROCESS INCLUDED BOTH DIVESTING ENTIRE BUSINESSES AND EXITING COMMODITIZED PRODUCT LINES AND CUSTOMERS INSIDE OTHERWISE HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED ITW DIVISIONS.AS A RESULT OF THIS WORK, ITW’S BUSINESS PORTFOLIO NOW HAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ORGANIC GROWTH POTENTIAL. ITW SEGMENTS AND DIVISIONS NOW POSSESS ATTRACTIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCT LINES AND END MARKETS AS THEY CONTINUE TO IMPROVE MARGINS AND GENERATE PRICE/COST INCREASES. THIS WAS ACHIEVED THROUGH PRODUCT LINE SIMPLIFICATION WHICH FOCUSES ON ELIMINATING THE COMPLEXITY AND OVERHEAD COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SMALLER PRODUCT LINES AND CUSTOMERS, AND FOCUSES BUSINESSES ON SUPPORTING AND GROWING THEIR LARGEST CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCT LINES. MOST OF THIS INITIATIVE IS COMPLETE AND ITW BUSINESSES ARE DEMONSTRATING NOTABLY IMPROVED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE REMAINING PRODUCT LINE SIMPLIFICATION WORK TO LARGELY BE ACCOMPLISHED IN 2016.THE SECOND STEP, BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION, WAS TO SCALE-UP ITW’S OPERATING STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT INCREASED ENGINEERING, MARKETING, AND SALES RESOURCES, AND TO IMPROVE GLOBAL REACH AND COMPETITIVENESS, ALL OF WHICH WERE CRITICAL TO ITW’S ABILITY TO DRIVE ACCELERATED ORGANIC GROWTH. ITW NOW HAS 84 SCALED-UP DIVISIONS WITH SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED FOCUS ON GROWTH INVESTMENTS, CORE CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCTS, AND CUSTOMER-BACK INNOVATION.WITH THE PORTFOLIO REALIGNMENT AND SCALE-UP WORK LARGELY COMPLETE, THE COMPANY IS NOW ABLE TO SHIFT ITS FOCUS TO PREPARING FOR, AND ACCELERATING, ORGANIC GROWTH.AS A THIRD PREPARATORY STEP, ITW IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF REAPPLYING 80/20 TO OPTIMIZE ITS NEWLY SCALED-UP DIVISIONS FOR GROWTH. THIS PROCESS INVOLVES FIRST USING 80/20 TO BUILD A FOUNDATION OF OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, AND THEN APPLYING 80/20-DRIVEN INSIGHTS TO IDENTIFY THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES TO DRIVE ORGANIC GROWTH.ONCE THE BUSINESS IS OPERATIONALLY EXCELLENT AND HAS IDENTIFIED THE RIGHT GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, THE FINAL STEP IS TO ACCELERATE ORGANIC GROWTH. THE PROCESS OF PREPARING FOR ACCELERATED ORGANIC GROWTH GENERALLY TAKES 18 TO 24 MONTHS.BASED ON THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE DIVISIONS THAT ARE FURTHER ALONG IN THIS PROCESS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THIS FRAMEWORK IS CAPABLE OF DELIVERING ABOVE MARKET ORGANIC GROWTH IN ALL ITW SEGMENTS. MANY ITW DIVISIONS ARE READY TO GROW AND GROWING ABOVE THEIR RESPECTIVE MARKETS, WHILE THE REST OF THE COMPANY’S DIVISIONS ARE AT VARIOUS PHASES OF PREPARING TO GROW. ITW MANAGEMENT IS FULLY ALIGNED ON THIS PLAN AND VERY FOCUSED ON EXECUTING IT. BY THE END OF 2016, THE COMPANY EXPECTS APPROXIMATELY 85 PERCENT OF ITS BUSINESSES TO BE READY TO GROW.LEVERAGE THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL TO DELIVER BEST-IN-CLASS MARGINS AND RETURNSTHE COMPANY’S WORK TO DELIVER BEST-IN-CLASS MARGINS AND RETURNS IS FOCUSED ON TWO KEY AREAS OF ONGOING ACTIVITY. THE FIRST IS STRATEGIC SOURCING, WHERE THE COMPANY SEEKS TO BENEFIT FROM ITS SIZE AND SCALE IN PROCUREMENT PROCESSES. SOURCING IS NOW A CORE STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY AND THIS IMPROVED COMPETITIVENESS SUPPORTS ITW’S ORGANIC GROWTH FRAMEWORK. THE COMPANY’S 80/20-ENABLED SOURCING ORGANIZATION HAS DELIVERED AN AVERAGE OF 1 PERCENT REDUCTION IN SPEND EACH YEAR IN 2013-2015 AND IS ON TRACK TO DO THE SAME IN 2016 AND 2017.THE SECOND ELEMENT OF THE MARGIN AND RETURN AREA OF FOCUS IS TO BETTER LEVERAGE THE FULL POWER OF THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL THROUGH A MUCH MORE CONSISTENT AND FOCUSED APPROACH TO 80/20 BEST PRACTICE IMPLEMENTATION ACROSS THE COMPANY. ITW HAS CLEARLY DEFINED WHAT EXCELLENCE IN THE PRACTICE OF ITW’S 80/20 MANAGEMENT PROCESS LOOKS LIKE AND THE RESULT IS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE MEANINGFUL INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENT IN MARGINS AND RETURNS AS EVIDENCED BY THE 19COMPANY’S IMPROVEMENT IN BOTH OPERATING MARGIN AND AFTER-TAX RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. THESE 80/20 INITIATIVES CAN RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES THAT REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE PROFITABILITY AND RETURNS.TERMS USED BY ITWMANAGEMENT USES THE FOLLOWING TERMS TO DESCRIBE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY:•ORGANIC BUSINESS - ACQUIRED BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR MORE THAN 12 MONTHS ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS.•OPERATING LEVERAGE - THE ESTIMATED EFFECT OF THE ORGANIC REVENUE VOLUME CHANGES ON ORGANIC OPERATING INCOME, ASSUMING VARIABLE MARGINS REMAIN THE SAME AS THE PRIOR PERIOD.•PRICE/COST - REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED NET IMPACT OF INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THE COST OF MATERIALS USED IN THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS VERSUS CHANGES IN THE SELLING PRICE TO THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS.•PRODUCT LINE SIMPLIFICATION (PLS) - FOCUSES BUSINESSES ON ELIMINATING THE COMPLEXITY AND OVERHEAD COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SMALLER PRODUCT LINES AND CUSTOMERS, AND FOCUSES BUSINESSES ON SUPPORTING AND GROWING THEIR LARGEST CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCT LINES; IN THE SHORT-TERM, PLS MAY RESULT IN A DECREASE IN REVENUE AND OVERHEAD COSTS WHILE IMPROVING OPERATING MARGIN.

MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND IN SOME CASES ON OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION. VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS ARE ALSO USED THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.THE COMPANY'S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE AS FOLLOWS:REALIZABILITY OF INVENTORIES—INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY’S BUSINESSES PERFORM AN ANALYSIS OF THE HISTORICAL SALES USAGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL INVENTORY ITEMS ON HAND AND A RESERVE IS RECORDED TO ADJUST INVENTORY COST TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING USAGE CRITERIA:USAGE CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA RESERVE %ACTIVE QUANTITY ON HAND IS LESS THAN PRIOR 6 MONTHS OF USAGE 0%SLOW-MOVING SOME USAGE IN LAST 12 MONTHS, BUT QUANTITY ON HAND EXCEEDS PRIOR 6 MONTHS OF USAGE 50%OBSOLETE NO USAGE IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS 90%IN ADDITION, FOR APPROXIMATELY 22% OF TOTAL INVENTORIES, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO USE THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT ("LIFO") METHOD OF INVENTORY COSTING. GENERALLY, THIS METHOD RESULTS IN A LOWER INVENTORY VALUE THAN THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT ("FIFO") METHOD DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION.COLLECTIBILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE—THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS BASED ON THE GREATER OF A SPECIFIC RESERVE OR A RESERVE CALCULATED BASED ON THE HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF PERCENTAGE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS.

THE COMPANY’S DEFERRED AND OTHER TAX BALANCES ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE TAX REGULATIONS AND RULINGS IN NUMEROUS TAXING JURISDICTIONS. INCOME TAX EXPENSE, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECOGNIZED BY THE COMPANY ALSO REFLECT ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE LEVEL OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, THE EFFECT OF THE COMPANY’S VARIOUS TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES AND UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS.

THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE GUIDANCE PRESCRIBED IN THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO TEST GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF TRIGGERING EVENTS OCCUR, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO DETERMINE IF A POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, IF ANY, IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT’S GOODWILL. IN CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS OR SPECIFIC INTANGIBLE ASSETS, MANAGEMENT RELIES ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING BUSINESS PLANS, ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS, ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER MARKET DATA. THERE ARE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THESE FACTORS AND MANAGEMENT’S JUDGMENT IN APPLYING THEM IN THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY HAD TOTAL GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $6.0 BILLION ALLOCATED TO ITS REPORTING UNITS. ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ITS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE COMPANY GENERALLY BELIEVES THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IS LESSENED BY THE NUMBER OF DIVERSIFIED BUSINESSES AND END MARKETS REPRESENTED BY ITS REPORTING UNITS THAT HAVE GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES IN MANY OF THE REPORTING UNITS HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, AND IN MANY CASES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPANY’S 80/20 MANAGEMENT PROCESS. THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL REPORTING UNITS RANGES FROM APPROXIMATELY $58 MILLION TO $1.5 BILLION, WITH THE AVERAGE AMOUNT EQUAL TO $428 MILLION. FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT AND ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE COMPANY’S GLOBAL END MARKETS, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ONE OR MORE REPORTING UNITS COULD OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS.PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS—THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS COMPANY-SPONSORED DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF U.S. EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON EACH PARTICIPANT’S YEARS OF SERVICE, FUTURE COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, LIFE EXPECTANCY, AND HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES. FUTURE CHANGES IN ANY OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE AMOUNTS RECORDED RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. SEE THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES.THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES AS OF THE YEAR-END MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN. THE DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH THE ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES COULD THEORETICALLY BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. IN ESTIMATING THIS RATE, THE COMPANY LOOKS AT RATES OF RETURN ON HIGH-QUALITY FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS, WITH SIMILAR DURATION TO THE LIABILITIES IN THE PLAN. A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN OBLIGATION BY APPROXIMATELY $37 MILLION.THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR SIMILAR INVESTMENT ALLOCATIONS AMONG ASSET CLASSES. FOR THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN, A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WOULD INCREASE THE ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMARKET RISKTHE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CERTAIN MARKET RISKS THAT EXIST AS PART OF ITS ONGOING BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRICE VOLATILITY FOR CERTAIN COMMODITIES AND CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE OR LEVERAGED TRANSACTIONS AND DOES NOT HOLD OR ISSUE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING PURPOSES.INTEREST RATE RISKTHE COMPANY’S EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK FOR CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY’S FIXED RATE DEBT. THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE COMPANY’S DEBT FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGING MARKET INTEREST RATES:FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKTHE COMPANY OPERATES IN THE U.S. AND 56 FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THE INITIAL FUNDING FOR THE FOREIGN MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS WAS PROVIDED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE PERMANENT INVESTMENT OF EQUITY CAPITAL FROM THE U.S. PARENT COMPANY. THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY MANUFACTURED AND SOLD WITHIN THE SAME COUNTRY. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT ASSETS OR LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES.THE COMPANY DESIGNATED €1.0 BILLION OF EURO NOTES ISSUED IN MAY 2014 AND €1.0 BILLION OF EURO NOTES ISSUED IN MAY 2015 AS HEDGES OF A PORTION OF ITS NET INVESTMENT IN EURO-DENOMINATED FOREIGN OPERATIONS TO REDUCE FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTMENT IN THESE OPERATIONS. CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THIS DEBT RESULTING FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN THE EURO TO U.S. DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS WITHIN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS). THE CUMULATIVE UNREALIZED GAIN RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) RELATED TO THE NET INVESTMENT HEDGE WAS $308 MILLION AND $158 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014, RESPECTIVELY.39ITEM 8.

OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AN OPINION ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDITS.WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS.

THE COMPANY PRIMARILY SERVES THE AUTOMOTIVE OEM/TIERS, AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET, GENERAL INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL FOOD EQUIPMENT, AND CONSTRUCTION END MARKETS.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES OF THE COMPANY ARE IN ITALICS. CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS OF PRIOR YEAR DATA HAVE BEEN MADE TO CONFORM TO CURRENT YEAR REPORTING.THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. THE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES INCLUDED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE RELATED TO INVENTORIES, TRADE RECEIVABLES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INCOME TAXES, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PRODUCT LIABILITY MATTERS, LITIGATION, PRODUCT WARRANTIES, PENSIONS, OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.CONSOLIDATION AND TRANSLATION—THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE COMPANY AND ITS MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST. INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS ARE ELIMINATED FROM THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES’ ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE TRANSLATED TO U.S. DOLLARS AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES FOR THE PERIOD. TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSIN APRIL 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ("FASB") ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE TO CHANGE THE CRITERIA FOR REPORTING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, ONLY DISPOSALS REPRESENTING A STRATEGIC SHIFT IN A COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS SHOULD BE REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, DISCLOSURE OF THE PRE-TAX INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DISPOSAL OF A SIGNIFICANT PART OF AN ORGANIZATION THAT DOES NOT QUALIFY AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION IS REQUIRED. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS NEW GUIDANCE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2015. THE NEW GUIDANCE APPLIES PROSPECTIVELY TO NEW DISPOSALS AND NEW CLASSIFICATIONS OF DISPOSAL GROUPS HELD FOR SALE AFTER SUCH DATE. THERE WERE NO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS DURING 2015 UNDER THIS NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. FOR BUSINESSES REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE STATEMENT OF INCOME PRIOR TO ADOPTION, ALL RELATED PRIOR PERIOD INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION HAS BEEN RESTATED.THIRD QUARTER 2013 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS-IN FEBRUARY 2013, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS INITIATING A REVIEW PROCESS TO EXPLORE STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES FOR ITS INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENT. IN SEPTEMBER 2013, THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A PLAN TO COMMENCE A SALE PROCESS FOR THE INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENT. THE COMPANY CLASSIFIED THE INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENT AS HELD FOR SALE BEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013 AND NO LONGER PRESENTED THIS SEGMENT AS PART OF ITS CONTINUING OPERATIONS.ON FEBRUARY 6, 2014, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO SELL ITS INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING BUSINESS TO THE CARLYLE GROUP FOR $3.2 BILLION. THE TRANSACTION WAS COMPLETED ON MAY 1, 2014, RESULTING IN A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $1.7 BILLION ($1.1 BILLION AFTER-TAX) IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014 WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013, THE COMPANY ALSO COMMITTED TO PLANS FOR THE DIVESTITURE OF A CONSTRUCTION DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS SEGMENT AND A SPECIALTY COATINGS BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE POLYMERS & FLUIDS SEGMENT.

THE CONSTRUCTION DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS WAS SOLD IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014.FIRST QUARTER 2013 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS-IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013, THE COMPANY COMMITTED TO PLANS FOR THE DIVESTITURE OF TWO TRANSPORTATION RELATED BUSINESSES AND A MACHINE COMPONENTS BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE SPECIALTY PRODUCTS SEGMENT, TWO CONSTRUCTION DISTRIBUTION BUSINESSES PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS SEGMENT, AND A CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE POLYMERS & FLUIDS SEGMENT. THESE BUSINESSES WERE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013.46IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2013, THE COMPANY DIVESTED ONE OF THE HELD FOR SALE TRANSPORTATION RELATED BUSINESSES, THE MACHINE COMPONENTS BUSINESS, AND THE CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING BUSINESS. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013, THE COMPANY DIVESTED THE SECOND HELD FOR SALE TRANSPORTATION RELATED BUSINESS. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013, THE COMPANY DIVESTED ONE CONSTRUCTION DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS AND THE REMAINING CONSTRUCTION DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS WAS SOLD IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014.THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE BUSINESSES DISCUSSED ABOVE ARE REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE STATEMENT OF INCOME FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. RESULTS OF THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013 WERE AS FOLLOWS:INCLUDED IN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ARE NET GAIN ON DISPOSAL OF $1.7 BILLION IN 2014 AND NET LOSSES ON DISPOSAL OF $91 MILLION IN 2013. THE NET GAIN IN 2014 INCLUDED A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $1.7 BILLION ($1.1 BILLION AFTER-TAX) ON THE SALE OF THE INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING BUSINESS. THE NET LOSSES IN 2013 INCLUDED A $39 MILLION PRE-TAX LOSS RELATED TO THE SALE OF ONE OF THE CONSTRUCTION DISTRIBUTION BUSINESSES AND A $20 MILLION PRE-TAX LOSS RELATED TO THE SALE OF ONE OF THE TRANSPORTATION RELATED BUSINESSES. ALSO INCLUDED IN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN 2013 WAS A $42 MILLION GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RECORDED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ANTICIPATED SALE OF ONE OF THE TRANSPORTATION RELATED BUSINESSES.IN 2014, INCOME TAX EXPENSE FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS INCLUDED $175 MILLION OF U.S. INCOME TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO THE REPATRIATION OF APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION OF INTERNATIONAL PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING BUSINESS. IN 2013, INCOME TAX EXPENSE FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS INCLUDED $42 MILLION OF TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO THE LEGAL RESTRUCTURING OF THE INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING BUSINESS.THERE WERE NO BUSINESSES CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014.ACQUISITIONS—THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ACQUISITIONS UNDER THE ACQUISITION METHOD, IN WHICH ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AS OF THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. ACQUISITIONS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, DID NOT MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION FOR ANY PERIOD PRESENTED. NET CASH PAID FOR ACQUISITIONS DURING 2015, 2014, AND 2013 WAS $6 MILLION, $45 MILLION, AND $369 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.THE PREMIUM OVER TANGIBLE NET ASSETS RECORDED FOR ACQUISITIONS BASED ON PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATIONS DURING 2015, 2014 AND 2013 WAS AS FOLLOWS: 2015 2014 2013IN MILLIONS EXCEPT WEIGHTED-AVERAGE LIVES (YEARS) WEIGHTED-AVERAGELIFE PREMIUMRECORDED WEIGHTED-AVERAGELIFE PREMIUMRECORDED WEIGHTED-AVERAGELIFE PREMIUMRECORDEDGOODWILL $2 $18 $247AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS: PATENTS AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY 6.4 2 15.4 8 9.8 34TRADEMARKS AND BRANDS — — 12.9 3 15.5 35CUSTOMER LISTS AND RELATIONSHIPS — — 11.4 12 11.2 100OTHER — — — — 5.0 12TOTAL AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS 6.4 2 12.9 23 11.4 181INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS: TRADEMARKS AND BRANDS — — —TOTAL PREMIUM RECORDED $4 $41 $42847NO GOODWILL RECORDED FOR ACQUISITIONS DURING 2015 WILL BE TAX DEDUCTIBLE. OF THE TOTAL GOODWILL RECORDED FOR ACQUISITIONS IN 2014 AND 2013, THE COMPANY EXPECTS GOODWILL OF $14 MILLION AND $25 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WILL BE TAX DEDUCTIBLE.OPERATING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, PRODUCT HAS SHIPPED AND THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE TRANSFERRED OR SERVICES HAVE BEEN RENDERED, THE PRICE TO THE CUSTOMER IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED, WHICH IS GENERALLY AT THE TIME OF PRODUCT SHIPMENT. TYPICAL SALES ARRANGEMENTS ARE FOR STANDARD PRODUCTS AND PROVIDE FOR TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP AND RISK OF LOSS AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT. IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS TO THE CUSTOMER ARE UNFULFILLED AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT, TYPICALLY INVOLVING INSTALLATION AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE, REVENUE RECOGNITION IS DEFERRED UNTIL SUCH OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. CUSTOMER ALLOWANCES AND REBATES, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF VOLUME DISCOUNTS AND OTHER SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, ARE ESTIMATED AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND KNOWN TRENDS AND ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN REPORTED REVENUES.IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE TO CHANGE THE CRITERIA FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION. THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF THE NEW STANDARD IS THAT REVENUE SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION DISCLOSURES WILL BE REQUIRED. THIS GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2018. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THE GUIDANCE WILL HAVE UPON ADOPTION.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ARE RECORDED AS EXPENSE IN THE YEAR INCURRED. THESE COSTS WERE $218 MILLION IN 2015, $227 MILLION IN 2014 AND $240 MILLION IN 2013.RENTAL EXPENSE WAS $117 MILLION IN 2015, $130 MILLION IN 2014 AND $138 MILLION IN 2013. FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS UNDER NON-CANCELABLE LEASES FOR THE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31 ARE AS FOLLOWS:ADVERTISING EXPENSES ARE RECORDED AS EXPENSE IN THE YEAR INCURRED.

THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $30 MILLION IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013 AS A RESULT OF REMEASURING THE COMPANY'S EXISTING EQUITY INTEREST TO FAIR VALUE BY DETERMINING THE IMPLIED EQUITY VALUE USING A LEVEL 3 VALUATION METHOD.48EQUITY INCOME (LOSS) IN WILSONART IS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S 49% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN WILSONART INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LLC ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. REFER TO THE OTHER ASSETS NOTE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THIS INVESTMENT.INCOME TAXES—THE COMPANY UTILIZES THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES GIVEN THE PROVISIONS OF THE ENACTED TAX LAWS. THE COMPONENTS OF THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES WERE AS SHOWN BELOW:INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES FOR DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS WAS AS FOLLOWS:THE RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE AND THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS AS FOLLOWS:DEFERRED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON THE REMAINING UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES AS THESE EARNINGS ARE CONSIDERED PERMANENTLY INVESTED. UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES WERE APPROXIMATELY $8.7 BILLION AND $7.1 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY. UPON REPATRIATION OF THESE EARNINGS TO THE U.S. IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS OR OTHER DISTRIBUTION OF EARNINGS, THE COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXES AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES. THE ACTUAL U.S. TAX COST WOULD DEPEND ON INCOME TAX LAWS AND CIRCUMSTANCES AT THE TIME OF DISTRIBUTION. DETERMINATION OF THE RELATED TAX LIABILITY IS NOT PRACTICABLE BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE HYPOTHETICAL CALCULATION.49IN NOVEMBER 2015, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE TO SIMPLIFY THE PRESENTATION OF DEFERRED TAXES. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, ALL DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE PRESENTED AS NONCURRENT IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION. THE COMPANY EARLY ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2015 AND APPLIED IT RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. DUE TO THE RESTATEMENT OF CURRENT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO NONCURRENT, ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE RESULTED IN AN INCREASE OF NONCURRENT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF $37 MILLION AND A DECREASE OF NONCURRENT DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES OF $167 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014.THE COMPONENTS OF DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014 WERE AS FOLLOWS:VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED WHEN IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX BENEFIT OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL NOT BE REALIZED.

EXHIBITS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES(A)(1) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS INCLUDED AS PART OF ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSINTRODUCTIONILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. (THE "COMPANY" OR "ITW") IS A GLOBAL MANUFACTURER OF A DIVERSIFIED RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT WITH 84 DIVISIONS IN 57 COUNTRIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 48,000 PERSONS.THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS ARE ORGANIZED AND MANAGED BASED ON SIMILAR PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND SIMILAR END MARKETS, AND ARE REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT AS THE FOLLOWING SEVEN SEGMENTS: AUTOMOTIVE OEM; TEST & MEASUREMENT AND ELECTRONICS; FOOD EQUIPMENT; POLYMERS & FLUIDS; WELDING; CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS; AND SPECIALTY PRODUCTS.DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF DIVERSE BUSINESSES AND THE COMPANY'S DECENTRALIZED OPERATING STRUCTURE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT REQUIRE ITS BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE DETAILED INFORMATION ON OPERATING RESULTS. INSTEAD, THE COMPANY'S CORPORATE MANAGEMENT COLLECTS DATA ON SEVERAL KEY MEASUREMENTS: OPERATING REVENUE, OPERATING INCOME, OPERATING MARGIN, OVERHEAD COSTS, NUMBER OF MONTHS ON HAND IN INVENTORY, DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PAST DUE RECEIVABLES AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. THESE KEY MEASURES ARE MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OPERATING RESULTS VERSUS CURRENT TRENDS IN END MARKETS AND VARIANCES FROM FORECASTS ARE DISCUSSED WITH OPERATING UNIT MANAGEMENT.THE ITW BUSINESS MODELTHE POWERFUL AND HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED ITW BUSINESS MODEL IS THE COMPANY’S CORE SOURCE OF VALUE CREATION. THIS BUSINESS MODEL IS THE COMPANY’S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND DEFINES HOW ITW CREATES VALUE FOR ITS SHAREHOLDERS AND COMPRISES THREE UNIQUE ELEMENTS:•ITW’S 80/20 MANAGEMENT PROCESS IS THE OPERATING SYSTEM THAT IS APPLIED IN EVERY ITW BUSINESS. INITIALLY INTRODUCED AS A MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY TOOL IN THE 1980’S, ITW HAS CONTINUALLY REFINED, IMPROVED AND EXPANDED 80/20 INTO A PROPRIETARY, HOLISTIC BUSINESS MANAGEMENT PROCESS THAT GENERATES SIGNIFICANT VALUE FOR THE COMPANY. THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF DATA-DRIVEN INSIGHTS GENERATED BY 80/20 PRACTICE, ITW FOCUSES ON ITS LARGEST AND BEST OPPORTUNITIES (THE “80”) AND ELIMINATES COMPLEXITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE LESS PROFITABLE OPPORTUNITIES (THE “20”). 80/20 ENABLES ITW BUSINESSES TO CONSISTENTLY DELIVER WORLD-CLASS OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE IN REGARDS TO PRODUCT AVAILABILITY, QUALITY, AND INNOVATION, WHILE GENERATING SUPERIOR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE;•CUSTOMER-BACK INNOVATION HAS FUELED DECADES OF PROFITABLE GROWTH AT ITW. THE COMPANY’S UNIQUE INNOVATION APPROACH IS BUILT ON THE INSIGHT GATHERED FROM THE 80/20 MANAGEMENT PROCESS. WORKING FROM THE CUSTOMER BACK, ITW BUSINESSES POSITION THEMSELVES AS THE GO-TO PROBLEM SOLVER FOR THEIR “80” CUSTOMERS. ITW’S INNOVATION EFFORTS ARE FOCUSED ON UNDERSTANDING CUSTOMER NEEDS, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN “80” MARKETS WITH SOLID LONG-TERM GROWTH FUNDAMENTALS, AND THEN CREATING UNIQUE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. THESE CUSTOMER INSIGHTS AND LEARNINGS DRIVE INNOVATION AT ITW AND HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A PORTFOLIO OF MORE THAN 16,000 GRANTED AND PENDING PATENTS;•ITW’S DECENTRALIZED, ENTREPRENEURIAL CULTURE ALLOWS ITW BUSINESSES TO BE FAST, FOCUSED, AND RESPONSIVE. ITW BUSINESSES HAVE SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL TO CUSTOMIZE THEIR APPROACH IN ORDER TO BEST SERVE THEIR CUSTOMERS. ITW COLLEAGUES ARE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THEM WITH REGARD TO ITW’S BUSINESS MODEL, STRATEGY, AND VALUES. THIS LEADS TO A FOCUSED AND SIMPLE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE THAT, COMBINED WITH OUTSTANDING EXECUTION, DELIVERS OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE ADAPTED TO THEIR SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS AND END MARKETS.ENTERPRISE STRATEGYIN 2013, ITW BEGAN THE PROCESS OF TRANSITIONING THE COMPANY ONTO ITS CURRENT STRATEGIC PATH TO FULLY LEVERAGE THE COMPELLING PERFORMANCE POTENTIAL OF THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL. SINCE THEN, ITW HAS MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS, AS EVIDENCED BY THE COMPANY’S STRONG FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS.THE ROOTS OF ITW’S ENTERPRISE STRATEGY BEGAN IN 2011-2012, WHEN THE COMPANY UNDERTOOK A COMPLETE REVIEW OF ITS PERFORMANCE. ITW GATHERED DEEP INSIGHTS FROM ITS BUSINESSES THAT WERE DELIVERING CONSISTENT ABOVE-MARKET GROWTH WITH BEST-IN-CLASS MARGINS AND RETURNS, AND DEFINED A STRATEGY TO REPLICATE THAT PERFORMANCE THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY.18BASED ON THIS RIGOROUS AND THOROUGH EVALUATION, ITW DETERMINED TWO PATHS TO DELIVER WORLD-CLASS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND COMPELLING LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR ITS SHAREHOLDERS. ONE, ITW NEEDED TO SHIFT THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY GROWTH ENGINE TO ORGANIC; AND TWO, THE COMPANY NEEDED TO LEVERAGE THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL TO DELIVER BEST-IN-CLASS MARGINS AND RETURNS.SHIFT THE COMPANY’S CORE GROWTH ENGINE TO ORGANICIN ORDER TO PIVOT TO FULLY FOCUS ON ORGANIC GROWTH, THE COMPANY NEEDED TO FIRST ACCOMPLISH SEVERAL PREPARATORY STEPS. THESE KEY INITIATIVES WERE A MAJOR FOCUS OF THE COMPANY IN 2012-2015, WHICH INCLUDED PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION AND STRATEGIC SOURCING.THE FIRST STEP, PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, WAS TO CONSTRUCT AND MAINTAIN A BUSINESS PORTFOLIO CAPABLE OF DELIVERING CONSISTENT ABOVE-MARKET ORGANIC GROWTH. AS PART OF THIS INITIATIVE TO REALIGN THE PORTFOLIO, ITW EXITED BUSINESSES THAT WERE OPERATING IN COMMODITIZED MARKET SPACES AND PRIORITIZED SUSTAINABLE DIFFERENTIATION AS A MUST-HAVE REQUIREMENT FOR ALL ITW BUSINESSES. THIS PROCESS INCLUDED BOTH DIVESTING ENTIRE BUSINESSES AND EXITING COMMODITIZED PRODUCT LINES AND CUSTOMERS INSIDE OTHERWISE HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED ITW DIVISIONS.AS A RESULT OF THIS WORK, ITW’S BUSINESS PORTFOLIO NOW HAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ORGANIC GROWTH POTENTIAL. ITW SEGMENTS AND DIVISIONS NOW POSSESS ATTRACTIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCT LINES AND END MARKETS AS THEY CONTINUE TO IMPROVE MARGINS AND GENERATE PRICE/COST INCREASES. THIS WAS ACHIEVED THROUGH PRODUCT LINE SIMPLIFICATION WHICH FOCUSES ON ELIMINATING THE COMPLEXITY AND OVERHEAD COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SMALLER PRODUCT LINES AND CUSTOMERS, AND FOCUSES BUSINESSES ON SUPPORTING AND GROWING THEIR LARGEST CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCT LINES. MOST OF THIS INITIATIVE IS COMPLETE AND ITW BUSINESSES ARE DEMONSTRATING NOTABLY IMPROVED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE REMAINING PRODUCT LINE SIMPLIFICATION WORK TO LARGELY BE ACCOMPLISHED IN 2016.THE SECOND STEP, BUSINESS STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION, WAS TO SCALE-UP ITW’S OPERATING STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT INCREASED ENGINEERING, MARKETING, AND SALES RESOURCES, AND TO IMPROVE GLOBAL REACH AND COMPETITIVENESS, ALL OF WHICH WERE CRITICAL TO ITW’S ABILITY TO DRIVE ACCELERATED ORGANIC GROWTH. ITW NOW HAS 84 SCALED-UP DIVISIONS WITH SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED FOCUS ON GROWTH INVESTMENTS, CORE CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCTS, AND CUSTOMER-BACK INNOVATION.WITH THE PORTFOLIO REALIGNMENT AND SCALE-UP WORK LARGELY COMPLETE, THE COMPANY IS NOW ABLE TO SHIFT ITS FOCUS TO PREPARING FOR, AND ACCELERATING, ORGANIC GROWTH.AS A THIRD PREPARATORY STEP, ITW IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF REAPPLYING 80/20 TO OPTIMIZE ITS NEWLY SCALED-UP DIVISIONS FOR GROWTH. THIS PROCESS INVOLVES FIRST USING 80/20 TO BUILD A FOUNDATION OF OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, AND THEN APPLYING 80/20-DRIVEN INSIGHTS TO IDENTIFY THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES TO DRIVE ORGANIC GROWTH.ONCE THE BUSINESS IS OPERATIONALLY EXCELLENT AND HAS IDENTIFIED THE RIGHT GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, THE FINAL STEP IS TO ACCELERATE ORGANIC GROWTH. THE PROCESS OF PREPARING FOR ACCELERATED ORGANIC GROWTH GENERALLY TAKES 18 TO 24 MONTHS.BASED ON THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE DIVISIONS THAT ARE FURTHER ALONG IN THIS PROCESS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THIS FRAMEWORK IS CAPABLE OF DELIVERING ABOVE MARKET ORGANIC GROWTH IN ALL ITW SEGMENTS. MANY ITW DIVISIONS ARE READY TO GROW AND GROWING ABOVE THEIR RESPECTIVE MARKETS, WHILE THE REST OF THE COMPANY’S DIVISIONS ARE AT VARIOUS PHASES OF PREPARING TO GROW. ITW MANAGEMENT IS FULLY ALIGNED ON THIS PLAN AND VERY FOCUSED ON EXECUTING IT. BY THE END OF 2016, THE COMPANY EXPECTS APPROXIMATELY 85 PERCENT OF ITS BUSINESSES TO BE READY TO GROW.LEVERAGE THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL TO DELIVER BEST-IN-CLASS MARGINS AND RETURNSTHE COMPANY’S WORK TO DELIVER BEST-IN-CLASS MARGINS AND RETURNS IS FOCUSED ON TWO KEY AREAS OF ONGOING ACTIVITY. THE FIRST IS STRATEGIC SOURCING, WHERE THE COMPANY SEEKS TO BENEFIT FROM ITS SIZE AND SCALE IN PROCUREMENT PROCESSES.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS 32IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES. FREE CASH FLOW REPRESENTS NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS ADDITIONS TO PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. FREE CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014 AND 2013 WAS AS FOLLOWS:THE 2014 NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCLUDED $724 MILLION OF TAX PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE DISPOSITION OF THE INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING BUSINESS.

ROIC IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. ADJUSTED AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S NET INVESTMENT IN THE FORMER INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENT AND THE EQUITY INVESTMENT IN 33THE WILSONART BUSINESS (FORMERLY THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT). AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE PERIOD AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER.ROIC FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013 WAS AS FOLLOWS:ROIC INCREASED 140 BASIS POINTS IN 2015 VERSUS 2014 AS A RESULT OF A DECREASE IN ADJUSTED AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL OF 7.7%.

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS HELD INTERNATIONALLY MAY BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXES AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES IF REPATRIATED TO THE U.S. CASH AND EQUIVALENTS BALANCES HELD INTERNATIONALLY ARE TYPICALLY USED FOR INTERNATIONAL OPERATING NEEDS, REINVESTED TO FUND EXPANSION OF EXISTING INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES, USED TO FUND NEW INTERNATIONAL ACQUISITIONS, OR USED TO REPAY DEBT HELD INTERNATIONALLY. IN THE U.S., THE COMPANY UTILIZES CASH FLOWS FROM DOMESTIC OPERATIONS TO FUND DOMESTIC CASH NEEDS, WHICH PRIMARILY CONSIST OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, SHARE REPURCHASES, ACQUISITIONS, SERVICING OF DOMESTIC DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, WHICH IS BACKED BY LONG-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES, FOR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES CASH GENERATED DOMESTICALLY AND LIQUIDITY PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY'S COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND CASH REQUIREMENTS IN THE U.S.DEBTTOTAL DEBT AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014 WAS AS FOLLOWS:SHORT-TERM DEBT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014 INCLUDED COMMERCIAL PAPER OF $0.5 BILLION AND $1.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.IN MAY 2015, THE COMPANY ISSUED €500 MILLION OF 1.25% EURO NOTES DUE MAY 22, 2023 AT 99.239% OF FACE VALUE AND €500 MILLION OF 2.125% EURO NOTES DUE MAY 22, 2030 AT 99.303% OF FACE VALUE. NET PROCEEDS FROM THE MAY 2015 DEBT ISSUANCES WERE USED TO REPAY COMMERCIAL PAPER AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.THE COMPANY MAY ISSUE COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FUND GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, AND SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE COMPANY HAS COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT OF $2.5 BILLION IN THE U.S. TO SUPPORT THE POTENTIAL ISSUANCES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. OF THIS AMOUNT, $1.5 BILLION IS PROVIDED UNDER A LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 8, 352017 AND $1.0 BILLION IS PROVIDED UNDER A LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF AUGUST 15, 2018. NO AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE TWO FACILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2015. THE MAXIMUM OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER BALANCE DURING 2015 WAS $2.4 BILLION, WHILE THE AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE WAS $1.4 BILLION.AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN OPERATIONS HAD AUTHORIZED CREDIT FACILITIES WITH UNUSED CAPACITY OF $296 MILLION.TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDATHE COMPANY USES THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA TO MEASURE ITS ABILITY TO REPAY ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY'S LONG TERM FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA. EBITDA AND THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA REPRESENTS TOTAL DEBT DIVIDED BY INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ON A TRAILING TWELVE MONTH BASIS.TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014 AND 2013 WAS AS FOLLOWS:STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITYTHE CHANGES TO STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY DURING 2015 AND 2014 WERE AS FOLLOWS:36CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSTHE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 WERE AS FOLLOWS:AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY HAD RECORDED NONCURRENT LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF $171 MILLION. THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2015.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESTHE COMPANY HAS SIX ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT IT BELIEVES ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND WHICH REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND IN SOME CASES ON OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION. VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS ARE ALSO USED THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.THE COMPANY'S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE AS FOLLOWS:REALIZABILITY OF INVENTORIES—INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY’S BUSINESSES PERFORM AN ANALYSIS OF THE HISTORICAL SALES USAGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL INVENTORY ITEMS ON HAND AND A RESERVE IS RECORDED TO ADJUST INVENTORY COST TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING USAGE CRITERIA:USAGE CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA RESERVE %ACTIVE QUANTITY ON HAND IS LESS THAN PRIOR 6 MONTHS OF USAGE 0%SLOW-MOVING SOME USAGE IN LAST 12 MONTHS, BUT QUANTITY ON HAND EXCEEDS PRIOR 6 MONTHS OF USAGE 50%OBSOLETE NO USAGE IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS 90%IN ADDITION, FOR APPROXIMATELY 22% OF TOTAL INVENTORIES, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO USE THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT ("LIFO") METHOD OF INVENTORY COSTING. GENERALLY, THIS METHOD RESULTS IN A LOWER INVENTORY VALUE THAN THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT ("FIFO") METHOD DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION.COLLECTIBILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE—THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS BASED ON THE GREATER OF A SPECIFIC RESERVE OR A RESERVE CALCULATED BASED ON THE HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF PERCENTAGE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. IN ADDITION, THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS INCLUDES RESERVES FOR CUSTOMER CREDITS AND CASH DISCOUNTS, WHICH ARE ALSO ESTIMATED BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE.DEPRECIATION OF PLANT AND EQUIPMENT — THE COMPANY’S U.S. BUSINESSES PRIMARILY COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS, AS FOLLOWS:BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS150% DECLINING BALANCEMACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT200% DECLINING BALANCETHE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS.37INCOME TAXES—THE COMPANY PROVIDES DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX LAWS. THE COMPANY’S DEFERRED AND OTHER TAX BALANCES ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE TAX REGULATIONS AND RULINGS IN NUMEROUS TAXING JURISDICTIONS. INCOME TAX EXPENSE, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECOGNIZED BY THE COMPANY ALSO REFLECT ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE LEVEL OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, THE EFFECT OF THE COMPANY’S VARIOUS TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES AND UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. FUTURE TAX AUTHORITY RULINGS AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, CHANGES IN PROJECTED LEVELS OF TAXABLE INCOME AND FUTURE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES COULD AFFECT THE ACTUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND TAX BALANCES RECORDED BY THE COMPANY.GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS—THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS TYPICALLY RESULT IN RECORDING GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH ARE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY’S TOTAL ASSETS AND AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT THE COMPANY COULD INCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE GUIDANCE PRESCRIBED IN THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO TEST GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF TRIGGERING EVENTS OCCUR, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO DETERMINE IF A POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, IF ANY, IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT’S GOODWILL. IN CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS OR SPECIFIC INTANGIBLE ASSETS, MANAGEMENT RELIES ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING BUSINESS PLANS, ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS, ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER MARKET DATA. THERE ARE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THESE FACTORS AND MANAGEMENT’S JUDGMENT IN APPLYING THEM IN THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY HAD TOTAL GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $6.0 BILLION ALLOCATED TO ITS REPORTING UNITS. ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ITS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE COMPANY GENERALLY BELIEVES THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IS LESSENED BY THE NUMBER OF DIVERSIFIED BUSINESSES AND END MARKETS REPRESENTED BY ITS REPORTING UNITS THAT HAVE GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES IN MANY OF THE REPORTING UNITS HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, AND IN MANY CASES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPANY’S 80/20 MANAGEMENT PROCESS. THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL REPORTING UNITS RANGES FROM APPROXIMATELY $58 MILLION TO $1.5 BILLION, WITH THE AVERAGE AMOUNT EQUAL TO $428 MILLION. FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT AND ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE COMPANY’S GLOBAL END MARKETS, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ONE OR MORE REPORTING UNITS COULD OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS.PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS—THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS COMPANY-SPONSORED DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF U.S. EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON EACH PARTICIPANT’S YEARS OF SERVICE, FUTURE COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, LIFE EXPECTANCY, AND HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES. FUTURE CHANGES IN ANY OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE AMOUNTS RECORDED RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. SEE THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES.THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES AS OF THE YEAR-END MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN. THE DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH THE ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES COULD THEORETICALLY BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. IN ESTIMATING THIS RATE, THE COMPANY LOOKS AT RATES OF RETURN ON HIGH-QUALITY FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS, WITH SIMILAR DURATION TO THE LIABILITIES IN THE PLAN. A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN OBLIGATION BY APPROXIMATELY $37 MILLION.THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR SIMILAR INVESTMENT ALLOCATIONS AMONG ASSET CLASSES. FOR THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN, A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WOULD INCREASE THE ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION.

THE INITIAL FUNDING FOR THE FOREIGN MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS WAS PROVIDED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE PERMANENT INVESTMENT OF EQUITY CAPITAL FROM THE U.S. PARENT COMPANY. THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY MANUFACTURED AND SOLD WITHIN THE SAME COUNTRY. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT ASSETS OR LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES.THE COMPANY DESIGNATED €1.0 BILLION OF EURO NOTES ISSUED IN MAY 2014 AND €1.0 BILLION OF EURO NOTES ISSUED IN MAY 2015 AS HEDGES OF A PORTION OF ITS NET INVESTMENT IN EURO-DENOMINATED FOREIGN OPERATIONS TO REDUCE FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTMENT IN THESE OPERATIONS. CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THIS DEBT RESULTING FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN THE EURO TO U.S. DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS WITHIN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS). THE CUMULATIVE UNREALIZED GAIN RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) RELATED TO THE NET INVESTMENT HEDGE WAS $308 MILLION AND $158 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014, RESPECTIVELY.39ITEM 8.

THE COMPANY PRIMARILY SERVES THE AUTOMOTIVE OEM/TIERS, AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET, GENERAL INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL FOOD EQUIPMENT, AND CONSTRUCTION END MARKETS.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES OF THE COMPANY ARE IN ITALICS. CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS OF PRIOR YEAR DATA HAVE BEEN MADE TO CONFORM TO CURRENT YEAR REPORTING.THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. THE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES INCLUDED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE RELATED TO INVENTORIES, TRADE RECEIVABLES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INCOME TAXES, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PRODUCT LIABILITY MATTERS, LITIGATION, PRODUCT WARRANTIES, PENSIONS, OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.CONSOLIDATION AND TRANSLATION—THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE COMPANY AND ITS MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST. INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS ARE ELIMINATED FROM THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES’ ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE TRANSLATED TO U.S. DOLLARS AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES FOR THE PERIOD. TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSIN APRIL 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ("FASB") ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE TO CHANGE THE CRITERIA FOR REPORTING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, ONLY DISPOSALS REPRESENTING A STRATEGIC SHIFT IN A COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS SHOULD BE REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, DISCLOSURE OF THE PRE-TAX INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DISPOSAL OF A SIGNIFICANT PART OF AN ORGANIZATION THAT DOES NOT QUALIFY AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION IS REQUIRED. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS NEW GUIDANCE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2015. THE NEW GUIDANCE APPLIES PROSPECTIVELY TO NEW DISPOSALS AND NEW CLASSIFICATIONS OF DISPOSAL GROUPS HELD FOR SALE AFTER SUCH DATE. THERE WERE NO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS DURING 2015 UNDER THIS NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. FOR BUSINESSES REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE STATEMENT OF INCOME PRIOR TO ADOPTION, ALL RELATED PRIOR PERIOD INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION HAS BEEN RESTATED.THIRD QUARTER 2013 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS-IN FEBRUARY 2013, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS INITIATING A REVIEW PROCESS TO EXPLORE STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES FOR ITS INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENT. IN SEPTEMBER 2013, THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A PLAN TO COMMENCE A SALE PROCESS FOR THE INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENT. THE COMPANY CLASSIFIED THE INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING SEGMENT AS HELD FOR SALE BEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013 AND NO LONGER PRESENTED THIS SEGMENT AS PART OF ITS CONTINUING OPERATIONS.ON FEBRUARY 6, 2014, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO SELL ITS INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING BUSINESS TO THE CARLYLE GROUP FOR $3.2 BILLION. THE TRANSACTION WAS COMPLETED ON MAY 1, 2014, RESULTING IN A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $1.7 BILLION ($1.1 BILLION AFTER-TAX) IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014 WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013, THE COMPANY ALSO COMMITTED TO PLANS FOR THE DIVESTITURE OF A CONSTRUCTION DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS SEGMENT AND A SPECIALTY COATINGS BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE POLYMERS & FLUIDS SEGMENT. THESE BUSINESSES WERE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE BEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013. THE SPECIALTY COATINGS BUSINESS WAS SOLD IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013. THE CONSTRUCTION DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS WAS SOLD IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014.FIRST QUARTER 2013 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS-IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013, THE COMPANY COMMITTED TO PLANS FOR THE DIVESTITURE OF TWO TRANSPORTATION RELATED BUSINESSES AND A MACHINE COMPONENTS BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE SPECIALTY PRODUCTS SEGMENT, TWO CONSTRUCTION DISTRIBUTION BUSINESSES PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS SEGMENT, AND A CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE POLYMERS & FLUIDS SEGMENT. THESE BUSINESSES WERE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013.46IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2013, THE COMPANY DIVESTED ONE OF THE HELD FOR SALE TRANSPORTATION RELATED BUSINESSES, THE MACHINE COMPONENTS BUSINESS, AND THE CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING BUSINESS. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013, THE COMPANY DIVESTED THE SECOND HELD FOR SALE TRANSPORTATION RELATED BUSINESS. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013, THE COMPANY DIVESTED ONE CONSTRUCTION DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS AND THE REMAINING CONSTRUCTION DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS WAS SOLD IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014.THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE BUSINESSES DISCUSSED ABOVE ARE REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE STATEMENT OF INCOME FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. RESULTS OF THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013 WERE AS FOLLOWS:INCLUDED IN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ARE NET GAIN ON DISPOSAL OF $1.7 BILLION IN 2014 AND NET LOSSES ON DISPOSAL OF $91 MILLION IN 2013. THE NET GAIN IN 2014 INCLUDED A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $1.7 BILLION ($1.1 BILLION AFTER-TAX) ON THE SALE OF THE INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING BUSINESS. THE NET LOSSES IN 2013 INCLUDED A $39 MILLION PRE-TAX LOSS RELATED TO THE SALE OF ONE OF THE CONSTRUCTION DISTRIBUTION BUSINESSES AND A $20 MILLION PRE-TAX LOSS RELATED TO THE SALE OF ONE OF THE TRANSPORTATION RELATED BUSINESSES. ALSO INCLUDED IN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN 2013 WAS A $42 MILLION GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RECORDED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ANTICIPATED SALE OF ONE OF THE TRANSPORTATION RELATED BUSINESSES.IN 2014, INCOME TAX EXPENSE FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS INCLUDED $175 MILLION OF U.S. INCOME TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO THE REPATRIATION OF APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION OF INTERNATIONAL PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING BUSINESS. IN 2013, INCOME TAX EXPENSE FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS INCLUDED $42 MILLION OF TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO THE LEGAL RESTRUCTURING OF THE INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING BUSINESS.THERE WERE NO BUSINESSES CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014.ACQUISITIONS—THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ACQUISITIONS UNDER THE ACQUISITION METHOD, IN WHICH ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AS OF THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. ACQUISITIONS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, DID NOT MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION FOR ANY PERIOD PRESENTED. NET CASH PAID FOR ACQUISITIONS DURING 2015, 2014, AND 2013 WAS $6 MILLION, $45 MILLION, AND $369 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.THE PREMIUM OVER TANGIBLE NET ASSETS RECORDED FOR ACQUISITIONS BASED ON PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATIONS DURING 2015, 2014 AND 2013 WAS AS FOLLOWS: 2015 2014 2013IN MILLIONS EXCEPT WEIGHTED-AVERAGE LIVES (YEARS) WEIGHTED-AVERAGELIFE PREMIUMRECORDED WEIGHTED-AVERAGELIFE PREMIUMRECORDED WEIGHTED-AVERAGELIFE PREMIUMRECORDEDGOODWILL $2 $18 $247AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS: PATENTS AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY 6.4 2 15.4 8 9.8 34TRADEMARKS AND BRANDS — — 12.9 3 15.5 35CUSTOMER LISTS AND RELATIONSHIPS — — 11.4 12 11.2 100OTHER — — — — 5.0 12TOTAL AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS 6.4 2 12.9 23 11.4 181INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS: TRADEMARKS AND BRANDS — — —TOTAL PREMIUM RECORDED $4 $41 $42847NO GOODWILL RECORDED FOR ACQUISITIONS DURING 2015 WILL BE TAX DEDUCTIBLE. OF THE TOTAL GOODWILL RECORDED FOR ACQUISITIONS IN 2014 AND 2013, THE COMPANY EXPECTS GOODWILL OF $14 MILLION AND $25 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WILL BE TAX DEDUCTIBLE.OPERATING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, PRODUCT HAS SHIPPED AND THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE TRANSFERRED OR SERVICES HAVE BEEN RENDERED, THE PRICE TO THE CUSTOMER IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED, WHICH IS GENERALLY AT THE TIME OF PRODUCT SHIPMENT. TYPICAL SALES ARRANGEMENTS ARE FOR STANDARD PRODUCTS AND PROVIDE FOR TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP AND RISK OF LOSS AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT. IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS TO THE CUSTOMER ARE UNFULFILLED AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT, TYPICALLY INVOLVING INSTALLATION AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE, REVENUE RECOGNITION IS DEFERRED UNTIL SUCH OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. CUSTOMER ALLOWANCES AND REBATES, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF VOLUME DISCOUNTS AND OTHER SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, ARE ESTIMATED AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND KNOWN TRENDS AND ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN REPORTED REVENUES.IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE TO CHANGE THE CRITERIA FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION. THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF THE NEW STANDARD IS THAT REVENUE SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION DISCLOSURES WILL BE REQUIRED. THIS GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2018. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THE GUIDANCE WILL HAVE UPON ADOPTION.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ARE RECORDED AS EXPENSE IN THE YEAR INCURRED. THESE COSTS WERE $218 MILLION IN 2015, $227 MILLION IN 2014 AND $240 MILLION IN 2013.RENTAL EXPENSE WAS $117 MILLION IN 2015, $130 MILLION IN 2014 AND $138 MILLION IN 2013. FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS UNDER NON-CANCELABLE LEASES FOR THE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31 ARE AS FOLLOWS:ADVERTISING EXPENSES ARE RECORDED AS EXPENSE IN THE YEAR INCURRED.

THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $30 MILLION IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013 AS A RESULT OF REMEASURING THE COMPANY'S EXISTING EQUITY INTEREST TO FAIR VALUE BY DETERMINING THE IMPLIED EQUITY VALUE USING A LEVEL 3 VALUATION METHOD.48EQUITY INCOME (LOSS) IN WILSONART IS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S 49% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN WILSONART INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LLC ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. REFER TO THE OTHER ASSETS NOTE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THIS INVESTMENT.INCOME TAXES—THE COMPANY UTILIZES THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES GIVEN THE PROVISIONS OF THE ENACTED TAX LAWS. THE COMPONENTS OF THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES WERE AS SHOWN BELOW:INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES FOR DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS WAS AS FOLLOWS:THE RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE AND THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS AS FOLLOWS:DEFERRED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON THE REMAINING UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES AS THESE EARNINGS ARE CONSIDERED PERMANENTLY INVESTED. UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES WERE APPROXIMATELY $8.7 BILLION AND $7.1 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY. UPON REPATRIATION OF THESE EARNINGS TO THE U.S. IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS OR OTHER DISTRIBUTION OF EARNINGS, THE COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXES AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES. THE ACTUAL U.S. TAX COST WOULD DEPEND ON INCOME TAX LAWS AND CIRCUMSTANCES AT THE TIME OF DISTRIBUTION. DETERMINATION OF THE RELATED TAX LIABILITY IS NOT PRACTICABLE BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE HYPOTHETICAL CALCULATION.49IN NOVEMBER 2015, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE TO SIMPLIFY THE PRESENTATION OF DEFERRED TAXES. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, ALL DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE PRESENTED AS NONCURRENT IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION. THE COMPANY EARLY ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2015 AND APPLIED IT RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. DUE TO THE RESTATEMENT OF CURRENT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO NONCURRENT, ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE RESULTED IN AN INCREASE OF NONCURRENT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF $37 MILLION AND A DECREASE OF NONCURRENT DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES OF $167 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014.THE COMPONENTS OF DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014 WERE AS FOLLOWS:VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED WHEN IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX BENEFIT OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL NOT BE REALIZED. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCES RECORDED AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014 RELATED PRIMARILY TO CERTAIN NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND CAPITAL LOSS CARRYFORWARDS.AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY HAD NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AVAILABLE TO OFFSET FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME IN THE U.S. AND CERTAIN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, WHICH EXPIRE AS FOLLOWS:THE COMPANY HAS FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS OF $216 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR USE BY THE COMPANY BETWEEN 2016 AND 2025.50THE CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS DURING 2015, 2014 AND 2013 WERE AS FOLLOWS:INCLUDED IN THE BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 WERE APPROXIMATELY $227 MILLION OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS THAT, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD IMPACT THE COMPANY’S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013, THE COMPANY RECORDED A DISCRETE TAX CHARGE OF $40 MILLION RELATED TO THE TAX TREATMENT OF INTERCOMPANY FINANCING TRANSACTIONS THAT IMPACT THE TAXABILITY OF FOREIGN EARNINGS.THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FILE TAX RETURNS IN THE U.S. AND VARIOUS STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THESE TAX RETURNS ARE ROUTINELY AUDITED BY THE TAX AUTHORITIES IN THESE JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, HER MAJESTY'S REVENUE AND CUSTOMS, GERMAN FISCAL AUTHORITY, FRENCH FISCAL AUTHORITY, AND AUSTRALIAN TAX OFFICE, AND A NUMBER OF THESE AUDITS ARE CURRENTLY ONGOING, WHICH MAY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN FUTURE PERIODS. DUE TO THE ONGOING AUDITS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPANY'S UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS MAY BE DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $113 MILLION RELATED PREDOMINANTLY TO VARIOUS INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED ITS BEST ESTIMATE OF THE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE FOR THESE ISSUES. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE OPEN TAX YEARS FOR THE COMPANY’S MAJOR JURISDICTIONS:THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO INCOME TAX MATTERS IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THE ACCRUAL FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014 WAS $32 MILLION AND $30 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.ON FEBRUARY 18, 2014, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A NOTICE OF DEFICIENCY ("NOD") FROM THE IRS ASSERTING THAT A NON-TAXABLE RETURN OF CAPITAL RECEIVED FROM A SUBSIDIARY WAS A TAXABLE DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION. THE NOD ASSESSES ADDITIONAL TAXES OF $70 MILLION FOR THE 2006 TAX YEAR, PLUS INTEREST AND PENALTIES. IN MAY 2014, THE COMPANY PETITIONED THE UNITED STATES TAX COURT TO CHALLENGE THE NOD. THE COMPANY'S PETITION WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DENIED AND THE CASE WILL PROCEED TO COURT WITH TRIAL SET FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2016. ALTHOUGH THE OUTCOME OF THIS PROCESS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING ITS POSITIONS. ACCORDINGLY, NO RESERVE HAS BEEN RECORDED RELATED TO THIS MATTER.51INCOME PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR THE PERIOD. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS PER DILUTED SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES ASSUMING DILUTION FOR STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. DILUTIVE SHARES REFLECT THE POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL SHARES THAT WOULD BE OUTSTANDING IF THE DILUTIVE STOCK OPTIONS OUTSTANDING WERE EXERCISED AND THE UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS VESTED DURING THE PERIOD. THE COMPUTATION OF INCOME PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WAS AS FOLLOWS:IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS 2015 2014 2013INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS $1,899 $1,890 $1,630INCOME PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS—BASIC: WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COMMON SHARES 367.9 401.7 446.2INCOME PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS—BASIC $5.16 $4.70 $3.65INCOME PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS—DILUTED: WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COMMON SHARES 367.9 401.7 446.2EFFECT OF DILUTIVE STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS 2.2 2.9 3.1WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COMMON SHARES ASSUMING DILUTION 370.1 404.6 449.3INCOME PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS—DILUTED $5.13 $4.67 $3.63OPTIONS THAT WERE CONSIDERED ANTIDILUTIVE WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED INCOME PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT ("LIFO") METHOD IS USED TO DETERMINE THE COST OF THE INVENTORIES AT CERTAIN U.S. BUSINESSES. THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT ("FIFO") METHOD, WHICH APPROXIMATES CURRENT COST, IS USED FOR ALL OTHER INVENTORIES. INVENTORIES PRICED AT LIFO WERE APPROXIMATELY 22% OF TOTAL INVENTORIES AS OF BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014. IF THE FIFO METHOD WAS USED FOR ALL INVENTORIES, TOTAL INVENTORIES WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $81 MILLION AND $88 MILLION HIGHER THAN REPORTED AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY.52PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014 WERE AS FOLLOWS:NET PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE STATED AT COST, LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION. RENEWALS AND IMPROVEMENTS THAT INCREASE THE USEFUL LIFE OF PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE CAPITALIZED. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED. DEPRECIATION OF PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IS PRIMARILY COMPUTED ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS FOR U.S. BUSINESSES AND ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FOR A MAJORITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES.DEPRECIATION WAS $244 MILLION IN 2015, $262 MILLION IN 2014 AND $270 MILLION IN 2013. THERE WAS NO DEPRECIATION INCLUDED IN INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN 2015 AND 2014. DEPRECIATION INCLUDED IN INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN 2013 WAS $29 MILLION.NET PLANT AND EQUIPMENT CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014:THE RANGES OF USEFUL LIVES USED TO DEPRECIATE PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS:BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS5—50 YEARSMACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT3—12 YEARSEQUIPMENT LEASED TO OTHERSTERM OF LEASEGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS—GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS COST OVER FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS OF PURCHASED BUSINESSES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ANNUALLY, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF TRIGGERING EVENTS OCCUR, BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS.WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE GOODWILL ASSIGNED TO EACH OF ITS REPORTING UNITS FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE RELEVANT REPORTING UNIT TO THE CARRYING VALUE. THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS LEVEL 2 AND LEVEL 3 VALUATION TECHNIQUES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS, INCLUDING DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS BASED ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT REPORTING UNIT AND MARKET MULTIPLES OF RELEVANT PUBLIC COMPANIES.
