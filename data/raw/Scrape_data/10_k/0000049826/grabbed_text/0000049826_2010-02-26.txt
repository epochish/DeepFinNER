DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. (THE COMPANY OR ITW) IS A MULTINATIONAL MANUFACTURER OF A DIVERSIFIED RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT WITH APPROXIMATELY 840 OPERATIONS IN 57 COUNTRIES. THESE 840 BUSINESSES ARE INTERNALLY REPORTED AS 60 OPERATING SEGMENTS TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANYS 60 OPERATING SEGMENTS HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED INTO THE FOLLOWING EIGHT EXTERNAL REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: TRANSPORTATION; INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING; FOOD EQUIPMENT; POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS; CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS; POLYMERS & FLUIDS; DECORATIVE SURFACES; AND ALL OTHER. IN AUGUST 2008, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE DIVESTITURE OF THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY CLASSIFIED AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION. IN MAY 2009, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS RESCINDED ITS EARLIER RESOLUTION TO DIVEST THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT AND, ACCORDINGLY, ALL PERIODS PRESENTED HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO PRESENT THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT AS A CONTINUING OPERATION. DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF DIVERSE BUSINESSES AND THE COMPANYS HIGHLY DECENTRALIZED OPERATING STYLE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT REQUIRE ITS BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE DETAILED INFORMATION ON OPERATING RESULTS. INSTEAD, THE COMPANYS CORPORATE MANAGEMENT COLLECTS DATA ON SEVERAL KEY MEASUREMENTS: OPERATING REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME, OPERATING MARGINS, OVERHEAD COSTS, NUMBER OF MONTHS ON HAND IN INVENTORY, DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PAST DUE RECEIVABLES AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. THESE KEY MEASURES ARE MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OPERATING RESULTS VERSUS CURRENT TRENDS IN END MARKETS AND VARIANCES FROM FORECASTS ARE DISCUSSED WITH OPERATING UNIT MANAGEMENT. THE RESULTS OF EACH SEGMENT ARE ANALYZED BY IDENTIFYING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN THE RESULTS OF THE BASE BUSINESSES, NEWLY ACQUIRED COMPANIES, RESTRUCTURING COSTS, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AND CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON THE OPERATING REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME OF EACH SEGMENT. BASE BUSINESSES ARE THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR MORE THAN 12 MONTHS. THE CHANGES TO BASE BUSINESS OPERATING INCOME INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF BOTH OPERATING LEVERAGE AND CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS. OPERATING LEVERAGE IS THE ESTIMATED EFFECT OF THE BASE BUSINESS REVENUE CHANGES ON OPERATING INCOME, ASSUMING VARIABLE MARGINS REMAIN THE SAME AS THE PRIOR PERIOD. AS MANUFACTURING AND ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD COSTS USUALLY DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE AS A RESULT OF REVENUES INCREASING OR DECREASING, THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN OPERATING INCOME DUE TO OPERATING LEVERAGE IS USUALLY MORE THAN THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE BASE BUSINESS REVENUES. A KEY ELEMENT OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS STRATEGY IS ITS CONTINUOUS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS FOR BOTH EXISTING BUSINESSES AND NEW ACQUISITIONS. THE BASIC CONCEPT OF THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS IS TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT (THE 20% OF THE ITEMS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 80% OF THE VALUE) AND TO SPEND LESS TIME AND RESOURCES ON THE LESS IMPORTANT (THE 80% OF THE ITEMS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 20% OF THE VALUE). THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS USE THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS TO SIMPLIFY AND FOCUS ON THE KEY PARTS OF THEIR BUSINESS, AND AS A RESULT, REDUCE COMPLEXITY THAT OFTEN DISGUISES WHAT IS TRULY IMPORTANT. THE COMPANYS 840 OPERATIONS UTILIZE THE 80/20 PROCESS IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THEIR BUSINESS. COMMON APPLICATIONS OF THE 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS INCLUDE:  SIMPLIFYING PRODUCT LINES BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS OFFERED BY COMBINING THE FEATURES OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS, OUTSOURCING PRODUCTS OR, AS A LAST RESORT, ELIMINATING LOW-VALUE PRODUCTS.  SEGMENTING THE CUSTOMER BASE BY FOCUSING ON THE 80/20 CUSTOMERS SEPARATELY AND FINDING ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO SERVE THE 20/80 CUSTOMERS.  SIMPLIFYING THE SUPPLIER BASE BY PARTNERING WITH 80/20 SUPPLIERS AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF 20/80 SUPPLIERS.  DESIGNING BUSINESS PROCESSES, SYSTEMS AND MEASUREMENTS AROUND THE 80/20 ACTIVITIES. THE RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS IS THAT THE COMPANY HAS OVER TIME IMPROVED ITS LONG-TERM OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THESE 80/20 EFFORTS CAN RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS THAT REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE MARGINS. CORPORATE MANAGEMENT WORKS CLOSELY WITH THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE OPERATING RESULTS BELOW EXPECTATIONS TO HELP THOSE BUSINESSES BETTER APPLY THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS AND IMPROVE THEIR RESULTS. 15 TABLE OF CONTENTS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2009, 2008 AND 2007 ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS 2009 2008 2007 OPERATING REVENUES $ 13,877,068 $ 17,100,341 $ 16,110,267 OPERATING INCOME 1,385,979 2,501,286 2,627,766 MARGIN % 10.0 % 14.6 % 16.3 % IN 2009 AND 2008, THE CHANGES IN REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGINS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 % POINT INCREASE % POINT INCREASE % INCREASE (DECREASE) (DECREASE) % INCREASE (DECREASE) (DECREASE) OPERATING OPERATING OPERATING OPERATING OPERATING OPERATING REVENUES INCOME MARGINS REVENUES INCOME MARGINS BASE BUSINESS: REVENUE CHANGE/OPERATING LEVERAGE (18.4 )% (51.8 )% (6.0 )% (2.6 )% (6.0 )% (0.6 )% CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS  21.2 3.8  (1.7 ) (0.3 ) (18.4 ) (30.6 ) (2.2 ) (2.6 ) (7.7 ) (0.9 ) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 4.2  (0.6 ) 6.0 1.4 (0.7 ) RESTRUCTURING COSTS  (4.1 ) (0.7 )  (1.0 ) (0.2 ) IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES  (4.1 ) (0.7 )    TRANSLATION (4.8 ) (5.8 ) (0.4 ) 2.8 2.5  OTHER 0.2   (0.1 )  0.1 (18.8 )% (44.6 )% (4.6 )% 6.1 % (4.8 )% (1.7 )% OPERATING REVENUES REVENUES DECREASED 18.8% IN 2009 VERSUS 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER BASE REVENUES AND THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION, MAINLY DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE DOLLAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REVENUES FROM ACQUISITIONS. TOTAL BASE REVENUES DECLINED 18.4% IN 2009 VERSUS 2008. BASE REVENUES DECLINED 21.6% AND 14.9% FOR NORTH AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES, RESPECTIVELY, AS BOTH WERE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE GLOBAL RECESSION AND WEAK INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION IN RELATED END MARKETS THROUGHOUT 2009. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES MODEST EXPANSION IN A VARIETY OF WORLDWIDE END MARKETS IN 2010. REVENUES INCREASED 6.1% IN 2008 OVER 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUES FROM ACQUISITIONS AND THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF 2008, DUE TO A WEAKENED DOLLAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN BASE REVENUES. DURING 2008, 50 BUSINESSES WERE ACQUIRED WORLDWIDE WITH INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 39% OF THE ANNUALIZED ACQUIRED REVENUES. BASE REVENUES DECREASED IN 2008 VERSUS 2007 DUE TO A 4.8% DECLINE IN NORTH AMERICAN BASE REVENUES AND FLAT INTERNATIONAL BASE REVENUES. NORTH AMERICAN BASE BUSINESSES WERE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY STEEP DECLINES IN MACRO ECONOMIC TRENDS AND RELATED WEAK INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, AND A CONTINUED DECLINE IN THE CONSTRUCTION AND AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS. IN ADDITION, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN INTERNATIONAL INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME DECLINED 44.6% IN 2009 VERSUS 2008 DUE TO THE DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES, THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION, INCREASED RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND INCREASED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE 16 TABLE OF CONTENTS IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. IN 2009, THE COMPANY RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $90.0 MILLION AND $15.6 MILLION AGAINST GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES, RESPECTIVELY. THE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENTS WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO NEW REPORTING UNITS WHICH WERE ACQUIRED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS BEFORE THE RECENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THESE CHARGES WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER CURRENT FORECASTS COMPARED TO THE EXPECTED FORECASTS AT THE TIME THE REPORTING UNITS WERE ACQUIRED. THE HIGHER RESTRUCTURING CHARGES REFLECT THE COMPANYS EFFORTS TO REDUCE COSTS IN RESPONSE TO WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IMPROVEMENTS IN BASE VARIABLE MARGINS AND LOWER OVERHEAD COSTS INCREASED BASE MARGINS 3.8% IN 2009, AS THE CUMULATIVE BENEFITS OF RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS BEGAN TO BE REALIZED AND SELLING PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS WERE FAVORABLE. TOTAL MARGINS DECLINED BY 4.6% IN 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINES IN BASE REVENUES, RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND THE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. OPERATING INCOME IN 2008 DECLINED 4.8% VERSUS 2007 DUE TO THE DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES AND INCREASED RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND INCOME FROM ACQUISITIONS. TOTAL MARGINS DECLINED 1.7% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINES IN BASE REVENUES AND THE LOWER MARGINS OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES INCLUDING ACQUISITION-RELATED EXPENSES, WHICH REDUCED OVERALL MARGINS. RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS AND OTHER COST CONTROL MEASURES WERE IMPLEMENTED IN 2008 TO BETTER ALIGN OPERATING BUSINESSES WITH DECLINING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH HELPED KEEP OVERHEAD EXPENSES FAVORABLE TO 2007 AND PARTIALLY OFFSET DECLINES IN VARIABLE MARGINS. TRANSPORTATION BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT PRODUCE COMPONENTS, FASTENERS, FLUIDS AND POLYMERS, AS WELL AS TRUCK REMANUFACTURING AND RELATED PARTS AND SERVICE. IN THE TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDE:  METAL AND PLASTIC COMPONENTS, FASTENERS AND ASSEMBLIES FOR AUTOMOBILES AND LIGHT TRUCKS;  FLUIDS AND POLYMERS FOR AUTO AFTERMARKET MAINTENANCE AND APPEARANCE;  FILLERS AND PUTTIES FOR AUTO BODY REPAIR;  POLYESTER COATINGS AND PATCH AND REPAIR PRODUCTS FOR THE MARINE INDUSTRY; AND  TRUCK REMANUFACTURING AND RELATED PARTS AND SERVICE.

ACQUISITION REVENUES PARTIALLY MITIGATED THE BASE REVENUE DECREASE AND WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF A NORTH AMERICAN TRUCK REMANUFACTURING AND RELATED PARTS AND SERVICE BUSINESS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008. WORLDWIDE AUTOMOTIVE BASE REVENUES DECLINED 19.4% FOR THE FULL YEAR. NORTH AMERICAN AUTOMOTIVE BASE REVENUES DECLINED 24.0% IN 2009 DUE TO A DECLINE IN CAR BUILDS OF 32%. INTERNATIONAL AUTOMOTIVE BASE REVENUES DECLINED 14.6% IN 2009 DUE TO A 24% DECLINE IN EUROPEAN CAR BUILDS. THE AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET BUSINESSES, WHICH WERE LESS IMPACTED BY THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, DECLINED 7.8%. REVENUES INCREASED 6.0% IN 2008 OVER 2007 DUE TO ACQUISITIONS AND THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN 8.5% DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES. ACQUISITION REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF A NORTH AMERICAN TRUCK REMANUFACTURING AND RELATED PARTS AND SERVICE BUSINESS AND A WORLDWIDE COMPONENTS BUSINESS. BASE REVENUES FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESSES DECLINED 15.2% PRIMARILY DUE TO A 16% DECLINE IN AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTION BY THE NORTH AMERICAN AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS. THE DECLINE IN AUTOMOTIVE BUILDS WAS DRIVEN BY LOW CONSUMER DEMAND AND EXISTING HIGH INVENTORY LEVELS. INTERNATIONAL BASE AUTOMOTIVE REVENUES DECLINED 6.3% DUE TO UNFAVORABLE CUSTOMER MIX AND A 3% DECLINE IN EUROPEAN VEHICLE PRODUCTION. BASE REVENUES FOR THE AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT INCREASED 2.3% MAINLY DUE TO STRONG SALES OF AUTOMOTIVE ADDITIVES FROM NORTH AMERICAN BUSINESSES TO CHINESE END MARKETS. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 44.5% IN 2009 VERSUS 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND HIGHER RESTRUCTURING CHARGES. IN ADDITION, A $12.0 MILLION GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS RECORDED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009 RELATED TO THE NORTH AMERICAN TRUCK REMANUFACTURING AND RELATED PARTS AND SERVICE BUSINESS. THE INCREASE IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES IS PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED EFFORTS TO REDUCE COSTS IN RESPONSE TO THE DECLINE IN WORLDWIDE AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTION. TOTAL OPERATING MARGINS DECLINED BY 4.4% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES DESCRIBED ABOVE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS IN OVERHEAD EXPENSES, FAVORABLE SELLING PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS AND BENEFITS OF RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS. 18 TABLE OF CONTENTS OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 25.7% IN 2008 VERSUS 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NEGATIVE LEVERAGE EFFECT OF THE DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES DESCRIBED ABOVE, LOWER BASE MARGINS AND HIGHER RESTRUCTURING CHARGES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES IS PRIMARILY DUE TO UNRECOVERED RAW MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES AND COMPETITIVE PRICING PRESSURE. BASE MARGINS DECLINED 3.4% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN BASE REVENUES, START UP COSTS TO SUPPORT PRODUCTION AT FOREIGN-OWNED MANUFACTURERS OPERATING IN NORTH AMERICA AND ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BAD DEBT RESERVES.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS IN OCTOBER 2009, NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE WAS ISSUED ON MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS. THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE AMENDS THE ACCOUNTING FOR MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE ARRANGEMENTS TO ENABLE THE VENDOR TO ACCOUNT FOR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SEPARATELY RATHER THAN AS A COMBINED UNIT. THE GUIDANCE ESTABLISHES A HIERARCHY FOR DETERMINING THE SELLING PRICE OF A DELIVERABLE, WHICH IS BASED ON: (1) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE, (2) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OR (3) ESTIMATES. THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ON JANUARY 1, 2011 AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THE CHANGE WILL MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT, CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS, TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH AND TO FUND SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE PRIMARY USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE:  DIVIDEND PAYMENTS  THE COMPANYS DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINES ARE 25% TO 35% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS AVERAGE INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS;  ACQUISITIONS; AND  ANY EXCESS LIQUIDITY MAY BE USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES. THE COMPANYS OPEN-ENDED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ALLOWS IT FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING THE TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO. CASH FLOW THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

THIS STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS COMPLETED IN NOVEMBER 2007. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. WE BELIEVE THAT ROIC IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC.

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT OF $2.5 BILLION IN THE U.S. TO SUPPORT THE ISSUANCES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. OF THIS AMOUNT, $2.0 BILLION IS PROVIDED UNDER A LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 11, 2010 AND THE REMAINING $500.0 MILLION IS UNDER A REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT TERMINATES ON JUNE 15, 2012. NO AMOUNTS ARE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE TWO FACILITIES. THE COMPANYS FOREIGN OPERATIONS ALSO HAVE UNUSED CAPACITY ON UNCOMMITTED FACILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $370 MILLION. THE COMPANY HAD $500.0 MILLION OF 5.75% REDEEMABLE NOTES DUE MARCH 1, 2009, WHICH WERE OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THAT WERE REPAID AT MATURITY. IN 2009, THE COMPANY ISSUED $800.0 MILLION OF 5.15% REDEEMABLE NOTES DUE APRIL 1, 2014 AT 99.92% OF FACE VALUE AND $700.0 MILLION OF 6.25% REDEEMABLE NOTES DUE APRIL 1, 2019 AT 99.98% OF FACE VALUE. THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING WERE USED TO PAY DOWN THE COMPANYS COMMERCIAL PAPER BALANCE. 33 TABLE OF CONTENTS THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED ON ITS CURRENT FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW, DEBT-TO-CAPITALIZATION RATIOS AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY. THE COMPANYS TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO IS 20% TO 30%, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ANY LARGER ACQUISITIONS.

THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE NON-CURRENT TAX OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED GUARANTEES RELATED TO THE DEBT OF CERTAIN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES OF $24.0 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. IN THE EVENT ONE OF THESE AFFILIATES DEFAULTS ON ITS DEBT, THE COMPANY WOULD BE LIABLE FOR THE DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED LIABILITIES RELATED TO THESE GUARANTEES OF $17.0 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY HAD OPEN STAND-BY LETTERS OF CREDIT OF $173.0 MILLION, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH EXPIRE IN 2010. THE COMPANY HAD NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THE COMPANY HAS SIX ACCOUNTING POLICIES WHICH IT BELIEVES ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND WHICH REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. 34 TABLE OF CONTENTS THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE AS FOLLOWS: REALIZABILITY OF INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. GENERALLY, THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES PERFORM AN ANALYSIS OF THE HISTORICAL SALES USAGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL INVENTORY ITEMS ON HAND AND A RESERVE IS RECORDED TO ADJUST INVENTORY COST TO MARKET VALUE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING USAGE CRITERIA: USAGE CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA RESERVE % ACTIVE QUANTITY ON HAND IS LESS THAN PRIOR 6 MONTHS USAGE 0 % SLOW-MOVING SOME USAGE IN LAST 12 MONTHS, BUT QUANTITY ON HAND EXCEEDS PRIOR 6 MONTHS USAGE 50 % OBSOLETE NO USAGE IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS 90 % IN ADDITION, FOR APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE U.S. OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO USE THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD OF INVENTORY COSTING. GENERALLY, THIS METHOD RESULTS IN A LOWER INVENTORY VALUE THAN THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) METHOD DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION. COLLECTIBILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS BASED ON THE GREATER OF A SPECIFIC RESERVE OR A RESERVE CALCULATED BASED ON THE HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF PERCENTAGE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. IN ADDITION, THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS INCLUDES RESERVES FOR CUSTOMER CREDITS AND CASH DISCOUNTS, WHICH ARE ALSO ESTIMATED BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE. DEPRECIATION OF PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  THE COMPANYS U.S. BUSINESSES COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS, AS FOLLOWS: BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS 150% DECLINING BALANCE MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT 200% DECLINING BALANCE THE MAJORITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS TO CONFORM TO THEIR LOCAL STATUTORY ACCOUNTING AND TAX REGULATIONS. INCOME TAXES  THE COMPANY PROVIDES DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX LAWS. THE COMPANYS DEFERRED AND OTHER TAX BALANCES ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS INTERPRETATION OF THE TAX REGULATIONS AND RULINGS IN NUMEROUS TAXING JURISDICTIONS. INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES RECOGNIZED BY THE COMPANY ALSO REFLECT ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE LEVEL OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND EFFECT OF THE COMPANYS VARIOUS TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. FUTURE TAX AUTHORITY RULINGS AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, CHANGES IN PROJECTED LEVELS OF TAXABLE INCOME AND FUTURE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES COULD AFFECT THE ACTUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND TAX BALANCES RECORDED BY THE COMPANY. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  THE COMPANYS BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS TYPICALLY RESULT IN RECORDING GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AND POSSIBLY IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE THAT THE COMPANY WILL INCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE GUIDANCE PRESCRIBED IN THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO TEST GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF TRIGGERING EVENTS OCCUR, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ITS 60 REPORTING UNITS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO DETERMINE IF A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, IF ANY, IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL. IN CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS, MANAGEMENT RELIES ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OPERATING RESULTS, BUSINESS PLANS, ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS, ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER MARKET DATA. THERE ARE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THESE FACTORS AND MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT IN APPLYING THEM IN THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE DATE OF ITS ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT FROM THE FIRST QUARTER TO THE THIRD QUARTER. THIS CONSTITUTES A CHANGE IN METHOD OF APPLYING AN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS PREFERABLE. THE CHANGE WAS MADE TO BETTER ALIGN THE TIMING OF THE 35 TABLE OF CONTENTS COMPANYS GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT WITH THE COMPANYS ANNUAL BUSINESS PLANNING AND FORECASTING PROCESS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY HAD GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $6.6 BILLION ALLOCATED TO ITS 60 REPORTING UNITS. THE COMPANYS RISK OF SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IS MITIGATED BY THE NUMBER OF DIVERSIFIED BUSINESSES AND END MARKETS REPRESENTED BY ITS 60 REPORTING UNITS. IN ADDITION, THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES IN MOST OF ITS REPORTING UNITS HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, AND THEREFORE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPANYS 80/20 BUSINESS SIMPLIFICATION PROCESS. THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL REPORTING UNITS RANGE FROM APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION TO $700 MILLION, WITH THE AVERAGE AMOUNT EQUAL TO $110 MILLION. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $105.6 MILLION IN 2009, $1.6 MILLION IN 2008 AND $2.2 MILLION IN 2007. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES DURING 2009 WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO NEW REPORTING UNITS WHICH WERE ACQUIRED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS BEFORE THE RECENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THESE CHARGES WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER CURRENT FORECASTS COMPARED TO THE EXPECTED FORECASTS AT THE TIME THE REPORTING UNITS WERE ACQUIRED. SEE THE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE RELATIVE CARRYING VALUES AND FAIR VALUES OF THE REPORTING UNITS RELATED TO THESE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT AND ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE COMPANYS GLOBAL END MARKETS, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ONE OR MORE REPORTING UNITS COULD OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS  THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS COMPANY-SPONSORED DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF U.S. EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON EACH PARTICIPANTS YEARS OF SERVICE, FUTURE COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATES. SEE THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES. THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES AS OF THE DECEMBER 31 MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE U.S. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. THE DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH THE ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES COULD THEORETICALLY BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. IN ESTIMATING THIS RATE, THE COMPANY LOOKS AT RATES OF RETURN ON HIGH-QUALITY FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS, WITH SIMILAR DURATION TO THE LIABILITIES IN THE PLAN. A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN OBLIGATION BY APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR SIMILAR INVESTMENT ALLOCATIONS AMONG ASSET CLASSES. FOR THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTION FOR THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 8.5% FOR 2009 AND WILL BE 8.0% FOR 2010. A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WOULD INCREASE THE ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION. SEE THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR INFORMATION ON HOW THIS RATE IS DETERMINED. 36 TABLE OF CONTENTS ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK MARKET RISK INTEREST RATE RISK THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK FOR CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANYS DEBT. THE COMPANY HAD COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING OF $135.5 MILLION AND $1.8 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

IN GENERAL, THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY MANUFACTURED AND SOLD WITHIN THE SAME COUNTRY. THE INITIAL FUNDING FOR THE FOREIGN MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS WAS PROVIDED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE PERMANENT INVESTMENT OF EQUITY CAPITAL FROM THE U.S. PARENT COMPANY. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT ASSETS OR LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT DERIVATIVES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 OR 2008. IN OCTOBER 2007, THE COMPANY ISSUED 750.0 MILLION OF 5.25% EURO NOTES DUE OCTOBER 1, 2014. THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS WITH THE EURO AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EURO CASH FLOWS FROM THESE BUSINESSES WILL BE ADEQUATE TO FUND THE DEBT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE NOTES. 37 TABLE OF CONTENTS ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING THE MANAGEMENT OF ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. (THE COMPANY OR ITW) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(F). ITWS INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE TO THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING THE PREPARATION AND FAIR PRESENTATION OF PUBLISHED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALL INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED, HAVE INHERENT LIMITATIONS. THEREFORE, EVEN THOSE SYSTEMS DETERMINED TO BE EFFECTIVE CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION. ITW MANAGEMENT ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT, IT USED THE CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO) IN INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK. BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT WE BELIEVE THAT, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS EFFECTIVE BASED ON THOSE CRITERIA. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT HEREIN. /S/ DAVID B.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL LEASE TRANSACTIONS, THE LESSEES HAVE MADE UPFRONT PAYMENTS TO THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE ACTING AS PAYMENT UNDERTAKERS. THESE PAYMENT UNDERTAKERS ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE THE REQUIRED SCHEDULED PAYMENTS DIRECTLY TO THE NONRECOURSE DEBT HOLDERS AND TO THE LESSORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY. IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE LESSEES, THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO RECOVER ITS NET INVESTMENT FROM THE 52 TABLE OF CONTENTS NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) PAYMENT UNDERTAKERS. IN ADDITION, THE LESSEES ARE REQUIRED TO PURCHASE RESIDUAL VALUE INSURANCE FROM A CREDITWORTHY THIRD PARTY AT A DATE NEAR THE END OF THE LEASE TERM. INCOME FROM LEVERAGED, DIRECT FINANCING AND SALES-TYPE LEASES WAS $7,636,000 FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009. EXPENSE FROM LEVERAGED, DIRECT FINANCING AND SALES-TYPE LEASES WAS $10,158,000 FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008. INCOME FROM LEVERAGED, DIRECT FINANCING AND SALES-TYPE LEASES WAS $8,280,000 FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007. UNEARNED INCOME RELATED TO LEVERAGED LEASES IS RECOGNIZED AS LEASE INCOME OVER THE LIFE OF THE LEASE BASED ON THE EFFECTIVE YIELD OF THE LEASE. THE COMPANY ADJUSTS RECOGNITION OF LEASE INCOME ON ITS LEVERAGED LEASES WHEN THERE IS A CHANGE IN THE ASSUMPTIONS AFFECTING TOTAL INCOME OR THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEASE. THE RESIDUAL VALUES OF LEASED ASSETS ARE ESTIMATED AT THE INCEPTION OF THE LEASE BASED ON MARKET APPRAISALS AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. ON JANUARY 1, 2007, THE COMPANY ADOPTED NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE THAT ADDRESSES HOW A CHANGE OR PROJECTED CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES GENERATED BY A LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTION AFFECTS THE ACCOUNTING BY A LESSOR FOR THAT LEASE. UPON ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE TO EQUITY OF $22,559,000, RESULTING FROM A CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS RELATED TO INCOME TAX BENEFITS OF THE COMPANYS LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTIONS. OTHER INVESTMENTS THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO SEVERAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS PRIMARILY TO RECEIVE TAX BENEFITS IN THE FORM OF TAX CREDITS AND TAX DEDUCTIONS FROM OPERATING LOSSES. THESE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EFFECTIVE YIELD METHOD, IN WHICH THE INVESTMENT IS AMORTIZED TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE AS THE TAX BENEFITS ARE RECEIVED. THE TAX CREDITS ARE CREDITED TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE AS THEY ARE ALLOCATED TO THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A VENTURE CAPITAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP IN 2001 THAT INVESTS PRIMARILY IN LATE-STAGE VENTURE CAPITAL OPPORTUNITIES. THE COMPANY HAS A 25% LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTEREST AND ACCOUNTS FOR THIS INVESTMENT USING THE EQUITY METHOD, WHEREBY THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE PARTNERSHIPS INCOME OR LOSS. THE PARTNERSHIPS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED ON A MARK-TO-MARKET BASIS. THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED IN PROPERTY DEVELOPMENTS WITH A RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION DEVELOPER THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A 50% INTEREST. THESE PARTNERSHIP INVESTMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD, WHEREBY THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE PARTNERSHIPS INCOME OR LOSS. THE COMPANY NEITHER BEARS THE MAJORITY OF THE RISK OF LOSS NOR ENJOYS THE MAJORITY OF ANY RESIDUAL RETURNS RELATIVE TO THE PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENTS, THEREFORE IT DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THOSE ENTITIES. THE COMPANYS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS RELATED TO THE PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENTS IS $32,253,000 AND $59,986,000, RESPECTIVELY, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. 53 TABLE OF CONTENTS NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) CASH FLOWS CASH FLOWS RELATED TO INVESTMENTS DURING 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WERE AS FOLLOWS: IN THOUSANDS 2009 2008 2007 CASH USED TO PURCHASE INVESTMENTS: AFFORDABLE HOUSING LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS $ (15,679 ) $ (16,078 ) $ (16,789 ) PROPERTY DEVELOPMENTS (1,166 ) (1,739 ) (3,414 ) VENTURE CAPITAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (741 ) (1,566 ) (8,252 ) OTHER  (200 ) (279 ) $ (17,586 ) $ (19,583 ) $ (28,734 ) CASH PROCEEDS FROM INVESTMENTS: AFFORDABLE HOUSING LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS $ 8,025 $ 2,552 $  PROPERTIES HELD FOR SALE 5,207 4,933 5,149 LEASES OF EQUIPMENT 3,985 5,746 7,085 VENTURE CAPITAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 2,407 12,723 44,792 PROPERTY DEVELOPMENTS 575 972 2,506 PREPAID FORWARD CONTRACT   31,629 OTHER 16 6 23 $ 20,215 $ 26,932 $ 91,184 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS COST OVER FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS OF PURCHASED BUSINESSES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. ON JANUARY 1, 2009, THE COMPANY ADOPTED NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR ALL NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND NONFINANCIAL LIABILITIES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS. THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE DEFINES FAIR VALUE AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE AND THE NECESSARY DISCLOSURES. WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF ITS 60 REPORTING UNITS TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT REPORTING UNIT. THE COMPANY ALSO CONSIDERS ADDITIONAL VALUATION TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS MARKET MULTIPLES FROM SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS AND QUOTED MARKET PRICES OF RELEVANT PUBLIC COMPANIES. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, IF ANY, IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL. THE COMPANYS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES CONSIST OF TRADEMARKS AND BRANDS. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THESE INTANGIBLES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON A RELIEF-OF-ROYALTY INCOME APPROACH DERIVED FROM INTERNALLY FORECASTED REVENUES OF THE RELATED PRODUCTS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TRADEMARK OR BRAND IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND CARRYING VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET. 54 TABLE OF CONTENTS NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED) AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WERE AS FOLLOWS: IN THOUSANDS 2009 2008 2007 GOODWILL: IMPAIRMENT $ 90,000 $ 137 $ 988 INTANGIBLE ASSETS: AMORTIZATION 203,230 184,410 145,702 IMPAIRMENT 15,568 1,438 1,166 $ 308,798 $ 185,985 $ 147,856 INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS INCLUDED GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $132,563,000 IN 2008 AND AMORTIZATION OF $5,744,000 IN 2008 AND $13,187,000 IN 2007.

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE DATE OF ITS ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT FROM THE FIRST QUARTER TO THE THIRD QUARTER. THIS CONSTITUTES A CHANGE IN THE METHOD OF APPLYING AN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS PREFERABLE, AS IT BETTER ALIGNS THE TIMING OF THE COMPANYS GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT WITH THE COMPANYS ANNUAL BUSINESS PLANNING AND FORECASTING PROCESS. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT WHICH RESULTED IN A CHARGE OF $12,000,000 RELATED TO THE TRUCK REMANUFACTURING AND RELATED PARTS AND SERVICE REPORTING UNIT IN THE TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT. ALSO IN 2009, INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OF $15,568,000 WERE RECORDED TO REDUCE TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THE CARRYING VALUE OF CERTAIN TRADEMARKS, BRANDS AND PATENTS. APPROXIMATELY $5,800,000 OF THIS TOTAL CHARGE RELATED TO THE PC BOARD FABRICATION REPORTING UNIT AND THE REMAINDER TO VARIOUS TRADEMARKS, BRANDS AND PATENTS OF OTHER REPORTING UNITS. THE ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS DURING 2008 AND 2007 RESULTED IN IMMATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS. THE IMPAIRMENTS DURING 2009 WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO NEW REPORTING UNITS WHICH WERE ACQUIRED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS BEFORE THE RECENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN.

EXHIBITS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES (A)(1) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS INCLUDED AS PART OF DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. (THE COMPANY OR ITW) IS A MULTINATIONAL MANUFACTURER OF A DIVERSIFIED RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT WITH APPROXIMATELY 840 OPERATIONS IN 57 COUNTRIES. THESE 840 BUSINESSES ARE INTERNALLY REPORTED AS 60 OPERATING SEGMENTS TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANYS 60 OPERATING SEGMENTS HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED INTO THE FOLLOWING EIGHT EXTERNAL REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: TRANSPORTATION; INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING; FOOD EQUIPMENT; POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS; CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS; POLYMERS & FLUIDS; DECORATIVE SURFACES; AND ALL OTHER. IN AUGUST 2008, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE DIVESTITURE OF THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY CLASSIFIED AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION. IN MAY 2009, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS RESCINDED ITS EARLIER RESOLUTION TO DIVEST THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT AND, ACCORDINGLY, ALL PERIODS PRESENTED HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO PRESENT THE DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT AS A CONTINUING OPERATION. DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF DIVERSE BUSINESSES AND THE COMPANYS HIGHLY DECENTRALIZED OPERATING STYLE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT REQUIRE ITS BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE DETAILED INFORMATION ON OPERATING RESULTS. INSTEAD, THE COMPANYS CORPORATE MANAGEMENT COLLECTS DATA ON SEVERAL KEY MEASUREMENTS: OPERATING REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME, OPERATING MARGINS, OVERHEAD COSTS, NUMBER OF MONTHS ON HAND IN INVENTORY, DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PAST DUE RECEIVABLES AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. THESE KEY MEASURES ARE MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OPERATING RESULTS VERSUS CURRENT TRENDS IN END MARKETS AND VARIANCES FROM FORECASTS ARE DISCUSSED WITH OPERATING UNIT MANAGEMENT. THE RESULTS OF EACH SEGMENT ARE ANALYZED BY IDENTIFYING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN THE RESULTS OF THE BASE BUSINESSES, NEWLY ACQUIRED COMPANIES, RESTRUCTURING COSTS, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AND CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON THE OPERATING REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME OF EACH SEGMENT. BASE BUSINESSES ARE THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR MORE THAN 12 MONTHS. THE CHANGES TO BASE BUSINESS OPERATING INCOME INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF BOTH OPERATING LEVERAGE AND CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS. OPERATING LEVERAGE IS THE ESTIMATED EFFECT OF THE BASE BUSINESS REVENUE CHANGES ON OPERATING INCOME, ASSUMING VARIABLE MARGINS REMAIN THE SAME AS THE PRIOR PERIOD. AS MANUFACTURING AND ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD COSTS USUALLY DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE AS A RESULT OF REVENUES INCREASING OR DECREASING, THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN OPERATING INCOME DUE TO OPERATING LEVERAGE IS USUALLY MORE THAN THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE BASE BUSINESS REVENUES. A KEY ELEMENT OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS STRATEGY IS ITS CONTINUOUS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS FOR BOTH EXISTING BUSINESSES AND NEW ACQUISITIONS. THE BASIC CONCEPT OF THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS IS TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT (THE 20% OF THE ITEMS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 80% OF THE VALUE) AND TO SPEND LESS TIME AND RESOURCES ON THE LESS IMPORTANT (THE 80% OF THE ITEMS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 20% OF THE VALUE). THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS USE THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS TO SIMPLIFY AND FOCUS ON THE KEY PARTS OF THEIR BUSINESS, AND AS A RESULT, REDUCE COMPLEXITY THAT OFTEN DISGUISES WHAT IS TRULY IMPORTANT. THE COMPANYS 840 OPERATIONS UTILIZE THE 80/20 PROCESS IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THEIR BUSINESS. COMMON APPLICATIONS OF THE 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS INCLUDE:  SIMPLIFYING PRODUCT LINES BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS OFFERED BY COMBINING THE FEATURES OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS, OUTSOURCING PRODUCTS OR, AS A LAST RESORT, ELIMINATING LOW-VALUE PRODUCTS.  SEGMENTING THE CUSTOMER BASE BY FOCUSING ON THE 80/20 CUSTOMERS SEPARATELY AND FINDING ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO SERVE THE 20/80 CUSTOMERS.  SIMPLIFYING THE SUPPLIER BASE BY PARTNERING WITH 80/20 SUPPLIERS AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF 20/80 SUPPLIERS.  DESIGNING BUSINESS PROCESSES, SYSTEMS AND MEASUREMENTS AROUND THE 80/20 ACTIVITIES. THE RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS IS THAT THE COMPANY HAS OVER TIME IMPROVED ITS LONG-TERM OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THESE 80/20 EFFORTS CAN RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS THAT REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE MARGINS. CORPORATE MANAGEMENT WORKS CLOSELY WITH THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE OPERATING RESULTS BELOW EXPECTATIONS TO HELP THOSE BUSINESSES BETTER APPLY THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS AND IMPROVE THEIR RESULTS. 15 TABLE OF CONTENTS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2009, 2008 AND 2007 ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS 2009 2008 2007 OPERATING REVENUES $ 13,877,068 $ 17,100,341 $ 16,110,267 OPERATING INCOME 1,385,979 2,501,286 2,627,766 MARGIN % 10.0 % 14.6 % 16.3 % IN 2009 AND 2008, THE CHANGES IN REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGINS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 % POINT INCREASE % POINT INCREASE % INCREASE (DECREASE) (DECREASE) % INCREASE (DECREASE) (DECREASE) OPERATING OPERATING OPERATING OPERATING OPERATING OPERATING REVENUES INCOME MARGINS REVENUES INCOME MARGINS BASE BUSINESS: REVENUE CHANGE/OPERATING LEVERAGE (18.4 )% (51.8 )% (6.0 )% (2.6 )% (6.0 )% (0.6 )% CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS  21.2 3.8  (1.7 ) (0.3 ) (18.4 ) (30.6 ) (2.2 ) (2.6 ) (7.7 ) (0.9 ) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 4.2  (0.6 ) 6.0 1.4 (0.7 ) RESTRUCTURING COSTS  (4.1 ) (0.7 )  (1.0 ) (0.2 ) IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES  (4.1 ) (0.7 )    TRANSLATION (4.8 ) (5.8 ) (0.4 ) 2.8 2.5  OTHER 0.2   (0.1 )  0.1 (18.8 )% (44.6 )% (4.6 )% 6.1 % (4.8 )% (1.7 )% OPERATING REVENUES REVENUES DECREASED 18.8% IN 2009 VERSUS 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER BASE REVENUES AND THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION, MAINLY DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE DOLLAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REVENUES FROM ACQUISITIONS. TOTAL BASE REVENUES DECLINED 18.4% IN 2009 VERSUS 2008. BASE REVENUES DECLINED 21.6% AND 14.9% FOR NORTH AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES, RESPECTIVELY, AS BOTH WERE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE GLOBAL RECESSION AND WEAK INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION IN RELATED END MARKETS THROUGHOUT 2009. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES MODEST EXPANSION IN A VARIETY OF WORLDWIDE END MARKETS IN 2010. REVENUES INCREASED 6.1% IN 2008 OVER 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUES FROM ACQUISITIONS AND THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF 2008, DUE TO A WEAKENED DOLLAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN BASE REVENUES. DURING 2008, 50 BUSINESSES WERE ACQUIRED WORLDWIDE WITH INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 39% OF THE ANNUALIZED ACQUIRED REVENUES. BASE REVENUES DECREASED IN 2008 VERSUS 2007 DUE TO A 4.8% DECLINE IN NORTH AMERICAN BASE REVENUES AND FLAT INTERNATIONAL BASE REVENUES. NORTH AMERICAN BASE BUSINESSES WERE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY STEEP DECLINES IN MACRO ECONOMIC TRENDS AND RELATED WEAK INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, AND A CONTINUED DECLINE IN THE CONSTRUCTION AND AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS. IN ADDITION, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN INTERNATIONAL INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME DECLINED 44.6% IN 2009 VERSUS 2008 DUE TO THE DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES, THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION, INCREASED RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND INCREASED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE 16 TABLE OF CONTENTS IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. IN 2009, THE COMPANY RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $90.0 MILLION AND $15.6 MILLION AGAINST GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES, RESPECTIVELY. THE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENTS WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO NEW REPORTING UNITS WHICH WERE ACQUIRED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS BEFORE THE RECENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THESE CHARGES WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER CURRENT FORECASTS COMPARED TO THE EXPECTED FORECASTS AT THE TIME THE REPORTING UNITS WERE ACQUIRED. THE HIGHER RESTRUCTURING CHARGES REFLECT THE COMPANYS EFFORTS TO REDUCE COSTS IN RESPONSE TO WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IMPROVEMENTS IN BASE VARIABLE MARGINS AND LOWER OVERHEAD COSTS INCREASED BASE MARGINS 3.8% IN 2009, AS THE CUMULATIVE BENEFITS OF RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS BEGAN TO BE REALIZED AND SELLING PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS WERE FAVORABLE. TOTAL MARGINS DECLINED BY 4.6% IN 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINES IN BASE REVENUES, RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND THE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. OPERATING INCOME IN 2008 DECLINED 4.8% VERSUS 2007 DUE TO THE DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES AND INCREASED RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND INCOME FROM ACQUISITIONS. TOTAL MARGINS DECLINED 1.7% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINES IN BASE REVENUES AND THE LOWER MARGINS OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES INCLUDING ACQUISITION-RELATED EXPENSES, WHICH REDUCED OVERALL MARGINS. RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS AND OTHER COST CONTROL MEASURES WERE IMPLEMENTED IN 2008 TO BETTER ALIGN OPERATING BUSINESSES WITH DECLINING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH HELPED KEEP OVERHEAD EXPENSES FAVORABLE TO 2007 AND PARTIALLY OFFSET DECLINES IN VARIABLE MARGINS. TRANSPORTATION BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT PRODUCE COMPONENTS, FASTENERS, FLUIDS AND POLYMERS, AS WELL AS TRUCK REMANUFACTURING AND RELATED PARTS AND SERVICE. IN THE TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDE:  METAL AND PLASTIC COMPONENTS, FASTENERS AND ASSEMBLIES FOR AUTOMOBILES AND LIGHT TRUCKS;  FLUIDS AND POLYMERS FOR AUTO AFTERMARKET MAINTENANCE AND APPEARANCE;  FILLERS AND PUTTIES FOR AUTO BODY REPAIR;  POLYESTER COATINGS AND PATCH AND REPAIR PRODUCTS FOR THE MARINE INDUSTRY; AND  TRUCK REMANUFACTURING AND RELATED PARTS AND SERVICE. IN 2009, THIS SEGMENT PRIMARILY SERVED THE AUTOMOTIVE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS AND TIERS (56%) AND AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET (28%) MARKETS. THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT FOR 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WERE AS FOLLOWS: DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS 2009 2008 2007 OPERATING REVENUES $ 2,070,938 $ 2,347,366 $ 2,214,413 OPERATING INCOME 153,674 276,900 372,567 MARGIN % 7.4 % 11.8 % 16.8 % 17 TABLE OF CONTENTS IN 2009 AND 2008, THE CHANGES IN REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGINS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 % POINT INCREASE % POINT INCREASE % INCREASE (DECREASE) (DECREASE) % INCREASE (DECREASE) (DECREASE) OPERATING OPERATING OPERATING OPERATING OPERATING OPERATING REVENUES INCOME MARGINS REVENUES INCOME MARGINS BASE BUSINESS: REVENUE CHANGE/OPERATING LEVERAGE (15.8 )% (49.2 )% (4.7 )% (8.5 )% (19.6 )% (2.0 )% CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS  23.1 3.3  (7.8 ) (1.4 ) (15.8 ) (26.1 ) (1.4 ) (8.5 ) (27.4 ) (3.4 ) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 9.1 (0.5 ) (1.0 ) 10.9 0.2 (1.4 ) RESTRUCTURING COSTS  (4.0 ) (0.6 )  (1.9 ) (0.4 ) IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES  (5.2 ) (0.7 )    TRANSLATION (5.1 ) (8.6 ) (0.7 ) 3.6 3.5 0.2 OTHER  (0.1 )   (0.1 )  (11.8 )% (44.5 )% (4.4 )% 6.0 % (25.7 )% (5.0 )% OPERATING REVENUES REVENUES DECLINED 11.8% IN 2009 VERSUS 2008 DUE TO DECLINES IN BASE REVENUES AND THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION. ACQUISITION REVENUES PARTIALLY MITIGATED THE BASE REVENUE DECREASE AND WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF A NORTH AMERICAN TRUCK REMANUFACTURING AND RELATED PARTS AND SERVICE BUSINESS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008. WORLDWIDE AUTOMOTIVE BASE REVENUES DECLINED 19.4% FOR THE FULL YEAR. NORTH AMERICAN AUTOMOTIVE BASE REVENUES DECLINED 24.0% IN 2009 DUE TO A DECLINE IN CAR BUILDS OF 32%. INTERNATIONAL AUTOMOTIVE BASE REVENUES DECLINED 14.6% IN 2009 DUE TO A 24% DECLINE IN EUROPEAN CAR BUILDS. THE AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET BUSINESSES, WHICH WERE LESS IMPACTED BY THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, DECLINED 7.8%. REVENUES INCREASED 6.0% IN 2008 OVER 2007 DUE TO ACQUISITIONS AND THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN 8.5% DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES. ACQUISITION REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF A NORTH AMERICAN TRUCK REMANUFACTURING AND RELATED PARTS AND SERVICE BUSINESS AND A WORLDWIDE COMPONENTS BUSINESS. BASE REVENUES FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESSES DECLINED 15.2% PRIMARILY DUE TO A 16% DECLINE IN AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTION BY THE NORTH AMERICAN AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS. THE DECLINE IN AUTOMOTIVE BUILDS WAS DRIVEN BY LOW CONSUMER DEMAND AND EXISTING HIGH INVENTORY LEVELS. INTERNATIONAL BASE AUTOMOTIVE REVENUES DECLINED 6.3% DUE TO UNFAVORABLE CUSTOMER MIX AND A 3% DECLINE IN EUROPEAN VEHICLE PRODUCTION. BASE REVENUES FOR THE AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT INCREASED 2.3% MAINLY DUE TO STRONG SALES OF AUTOMOTIVE ADDITIVES FROM NORTH AMERICAN BUSINESSES TO CHINESE END MARKETS. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 44.5% IN 2009 VERSUS 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND HIGHER RESTRUCTURING CHARGES. IN ADDITION, A $12.0 MILLION GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS RECORDED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009 RELATED TO THE NORTH AMERICAN TRUCK REMANUFACTURING AND RELATED PARTS AND SERVICE BUSINESS. THE INCREASE IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES IS PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED EFFORTS TO REDUCE COSTS IN RESPONSE TO THE DECLINE IN WORLDWIDE AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTION. TOTAL OPERATING MARGINS DECLINED BY 4.4% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES DESCRIBED ABOVE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS IN OVERHEAD EXPENSES, FAVORABLE SELLING PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS AND BENEFITS OF RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS. 18 TABLE OF CONTENTS OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 25.7% IN 2008 VERSUS 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NEGATIVE LEVERAGE EFFECT OF THE DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES DESCRIBED ABOVE, LOWER BASE MARGINS AND HIGHER RESTRUCTURING CHARGES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES IS PRIMARILY DUE TO UNRECOVERED RAW MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES AND COMPETITIVE PRICING PRESSURE. BASE MARGINS DECLINED 3.4% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN BASE REVENUES, START UP COSTS TO SUPPORT PRODUCTION AT FOREIGN-OWNED MANUFACTURERS OPERATING IN NORTH AMERICA AND ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BAD DEBT RESERVES. INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT PRODUCE STEEL, PLASTIC AND PAPER PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT USED FOR BUNDLING, SHIPPING AND PROTECTING GOODS IN TRANSIT.

BASE REVENUES DECLINED 34.6% FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN STRAPPING BUSINESSES LARGELY DUE TO DECLINES IN CONSUMABLE AND EQUIPMENT VOLUME IN KEY END MARKETS SUCH AS PRIMARY METALS, 19 TABLE OF CONTENTS CONSTRUCTION AND GENERAL INDUSTRIAL. THE INTERNATIONAL STRAPPING BUSINESSES DECLINED 25.4% WHICH WERE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE CONTINUED GLOBAL DECLINE IN THE INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND CONSTRUCTION END MARKETS. WORLDWIDE STRETCH AND PROTECTIVE PACKAGING DECLINED 20.0% AND 4.7%, RESPECTIVELY. REVENUES INCREASED 8.5% IN 2008 OVER 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUES FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION. THE INCREASE IN ACQUISITION REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PURCHASE OF A EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING BUSINESS, A EUROPEAN STRETCH PACKAGING BUSINESS, A U.S. PROTECTIVE PACKAGING BUSINESS AND A U.S. EQUIPMENT BUSINESS. TOTAL BASE REVENUES WERE VIRTUALLY FLAT AS A 1.2% AND 30.9% INCREASE RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL STRAPPING AND WORLDWIDE INSULATION SYSTEMS, RESPECTIVELY, WERE OFFSET BY A 6.0% AND 2.7% DECREASE RELATED TO NORTH AMERICAN STRAPPING AND WORLDWIDE PROTECTIVE PACKAGING, RESPECTIVELY. THESE BUSINESSES WERE ESPECIALLY AFFECTED BY WEAKNESS IN THE NORTH AMERICAN PRIMARY METALS AND CONSTRUCTION END MARKETS. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 68.4% IN 2009 VERSUS 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NEGATIVE LEVERAGE EFFECT OF THE DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND HIGHER RESTRUCTURING CHARGES. BASE MARGINS DECLINED 4.6% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES DISCUSSED ABOVE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FAVORABLE SELLING PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS AND REDUCED OVERHEAD COSTS AS THE BENEFITS OF RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS BEGAN TO BE REALIZED. OPERATING INCOME DECLINED 6.7% IN 2008 VERSUS 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN BASE VARIABLE MARGINS AND INCREASED RESTRUCTURING CHARGES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCOME FROM ACQUISITIONS AND THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION. THE DECREASE IN BASE VARIABLE MARGINS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO UNFAVORABLE SELLING PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS AND UNFAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX.

TOTAL OPERATING MARGINS DECLINED 0.7% PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER MARGINS FOR BOTH BASE BUSINESS AND ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. BASE OPERATING MARGINS DECREASED 0.2% AS THE GAINS FROM TIGHT COST CONTROLS AND THE BENEFITS OF PRIOR YEAR RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS WERE OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF LOWER REVENUES. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMORTIZATION EXPENSE INCREASED TO $203.2 MILLION IN 2009 AND $184.4 MILLION IN 2008, VERSUS $145.7 MILLION IN 2007, DUE TO INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION RELATED TO NEWLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS TOTAL GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES BY SEGMENT FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WERE AS FOLLOWS: IN THOUSANDS 2009 2008 2007 TRANSPORTATION $ 14,414 $ 13 $ 258 INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING 386   FOOD EQUIPMENT 46   POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS 28,337 824  CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS   394 POLYMERS & FLUIDS 60,416 251 884 ALL OTHER 1,969 487 618 $ 105,568 $ 1,575 $ 2,154 IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCREASED TO $105.6 MILLION IN 2009 VERSUS $1.6 MILLION IN 2008, PRIMARILY DUE TO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO THE PRESSURE SENSITIVE ADHESIVES REPORTING UNIT OF $60.0 MILLION, THE PC BOARD FABRICATION REPORTING UNIT OF $18.0 MILLION AND THE TRUCK REMANUFACTURING AND RELATED PARTS AND SERVICE REPORTING UNIT OF $12.0 MILLION. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WAS $1.6 MILLION IN 2008 VERSUS $2.2 MILLION IN 2007. SEE THE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR FURTHER DETAILS OF THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. 29 TABLE OF CONTENTS INTEREST EXPENSE INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $164.8 MILLION IN 2009 VERSUS $154.5 MILLION IN 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEREST ON THE 6.25% AND 5.15% NOTES WHICH WERE ISSUED IN MARCH 2009, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST RELATED TO THE 5.75% NOTES AND 6.875% NOTES REPAID AT MATURITY IN MARCH 2009 AND NOVEMBER 2008, RESPECTIVELY, AND LOWER COMMERCIAL PAPER RATES AND BORROWINGS. INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $154.5 MILLION IN 2008 VERSUS $102.1 MILLION IN 2007 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE 5.25% EURO NOTES ISSUED IN OCTOBER 2007 AND HIGHER AVERAGE BORROWINGS OF SHORT-TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MARKET RATES IN 2008. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON COMMERCIAL PAPER WAS 0.3% IN 2009, 2.4% IN 2008 AND 5.2% IN 2007. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) WAS EXPENSE OF $7.4 MILLION IN 2009 VERSUS INCOME OF $4.7 MILLION IN 2008. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO 2009 LOSSES ON FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS OF $24.9 MILLION, LOWER INCOME FROM INVESTMENTS OF $4.9 MILLION (VERSUS $17.0 MILLION IN 2008) AND LOWER INTEREST INCOME OF $17.6 MILLION (VERSUS $29.4 MILLION IN 2008), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF THE GERMAN TRANSFER TAX CHARGE OF $44.0 MILLION IN 2008. OTHER INCOME DECREASED TO $4.7 MILLION IN 2008 FROM $58.3 MILLION IN 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO A GERMAN TRANSFER TAX CHARGE OF $44.0 MILLION IN 2008. ADDITIONALLY, INCOME FROM A VENTURE CAPITAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIP WAS $0.2 MILLION IN 2008 VERSUS INCOME OF $25.3 MILLION IN 2007 RELATED TO MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS; AND THE COMPANY INCURRED A CHARGE OF $18.8 MILLION RELATED TO THE TIMING OF TAX DEDUCTIONS OF LEVERAGED LEASES IN 2008. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INCOME OF $10.7 MILLION RELATED TO A MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITY AND A $9.4 MILLION INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME. INCOME TAXES THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 20.1% IN 2009, 28.1% IN 2008 AND 29.3% IN 2007. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2009 WAS FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF $85.5 MILLION RELATED TO A GLOBAL LEGAL STRUCTURE REORGANIZATION AND $77.5 MILLION RELATED TO A FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT REACHED WITH THE GERMAN TAX AUTHORITIES. IN THE ABOVE MENTIONED REORGANIZATION, THE COMPANY REORGANIZED ITS OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE IN CERTAIN U.S. AND FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009 AND MADE AN ELECTION REGARDING THE U.S. TAX TREATMENT OF A FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY. THE COMPANY RECORDED A REDUCTION IN TAX EXPENSE PRIMARILY FOR THE EFFECT OF THE RESULTING FOREIGN TAX CREDITS. ALSO DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009, THE COMPANY FINALIZED A SETTLEMENT WITH THE GERMAN TAX AUTHORITIES PRIMARILY REGARDING THE TREATMENT OF AN INTERCOMPANY FINANCING TRANSACTION WHICH RESULTED IN THE REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED TAX RESERVES AS A REDUCTION OF TAX EXPENSE. SEE THE INCOME TAXES NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR A RECONCILIATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE TO THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN 2009 OF $969.5 MILLION ($1.93 PER DILUTED SHARE) WAS 42.7% LOWER THAN 2008 INCOME OF $1.7 BILLION ($3.24 PER DILUTED SHARE). INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN 2008 WAS 7.5% LOWER THAN 2007 INCOME OF $1.8 BILLION ($3.29 PER DILUTED SHARE). FOREIGN CURRENCY THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES DECREASED OPERATING REVENUES BY APPROXIMATELY $653 MILLION IN 2009 AND DECREASED INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY 10 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES INCREASED OPERATING REVENUES BY APPROXIMATELY $425 MILLION IN 2008 AND INCREASED INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY 8 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WAS $22.5 MILLION IN 2009 VERSUS $172.1 MILLION IN 2008, PRIMARILY DUE TO 2008 IMPAIRMENT ON GOODWILL OF $132.6 MILLION, LOSS RESERVE ON ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OF $64.0 MILLION PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GAINS ON SALES OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN 2008 VERSUS LOSSES IN 2009. THE RESULTS FROM DISCONTINUED 30 TABLE OF CONTENTS OPERATIONS WAS A LOSS OF $172.1 MILLION IN 2008 VERSUS INCOME OF $42.2 MILLION IN 2007. SEE THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS IN OCTOBER 2009, NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE WAS ISSUED ON MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS. THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE AMENDS THE ACCOUNTING FOR MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE ARRANGEMENTS TO ENABLE THE VENDOR TO ACCOUNT FOR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SEPARATELY RATHER THAN AS A COMBINED UNIT. THE GUIDANCE ESTABLISHES A HIERARCHY FOR DETERMINING THE SELLING PRICE OF A DELIVERABLE, WHICH IS BASED ON: (1) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE, (2) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OR (3) ESTIMATES. THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ON JANUARY 1, 2011 AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THE CHANGE WILL MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT, CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS, TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH AND TO FUND SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE PRIMARY USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE:  DIVIDEND PAYMENTS  THE COMPANYS DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINES ARE 25% TO 35% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS AVERAGE INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS;  ACQUISITIONS; AND  ANY EXCESS LIQUIDITY MAY BE USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES. THE COMPANYS OPEN-ENDED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ALLOWS IT FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING THE TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO. CASH FLOW THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WAS AS FOLLOWS: IN THOUSANDS 2009 2008 2007 NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES $ 2,146,589 $ 2,222,224 $ 2,484,297 ADDITIONS TO PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (247,102 ) (362,312 ) (353,355 ) FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW $ 1,899,487 $ 1,859,912 $ 2,130,942 CASH DIVIDENDS PAID $ (619,681 ) $ (598,690 ) $ (502,430 ) ACQUISITIONS (281,674 ) (1,546,982 ) (812,757 ) REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK  (1,390,594 ) (1,757,761 ) PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS (17,586 ) (19,583 ) (28,734 ) PROCEEDS FROM INVESTMENTS 20,215 26,932 91,184 NET PROCEEDS (REPAYMENTS) OF DEBT (736,470 ) 1,467,613 777,386 EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH AND EQUIVALENTS 183,722 (82,002 ) 66,996 OTHER 127,809 198,820 272,491 NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH AND EQUIVALENTS $ 575,822 $ (84,574 ) $ 237,317 ON AUGUST 20, 2007, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD 31 TABLE OF CONTENTS OF TIME. THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 39.8 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK UNDER THIS PROGRAM AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $44.72 PER SHARE. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. ON AUGUST 4, 2006, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDED FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO 35.0 MILLION SHARES. THIS STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS COMPLETED IN NOVEMBER 2007. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. WE BELIEVE THAT ROIC IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. ROIC FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WAS AS FOLLOWS: DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS 2009 2008 2007 OPERATING INCOME $ 1,385,979 $ 2,501,286 $ 2,627,766 TAXES (20.1%, 28.1% AND 29.3%, RESPECTIVELY) (278,998 ) (702,611 ) (769,147 ) OPERATING INCOME AFTER TAXES $ 1,106,981 $ 1,798,675 $ 1,858,619 INVESTED CAPITAL: TRADE RECEIVABLES $ 2,491,492 $ 2,571,987 $ 2,915,546 INVENTORIES 1,356,233 1,774,697 1,625,820 NET PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 2,136,527 2,109,432 2,194,010 INVESTMENTS 451,293 465,894 507,567 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 6,584,149 6,297,219 5,683,341 ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES (2,048,966 ) (1,999,097 ) (2,190,121 ) NET ASSETS HELD FOR SALE  61,525 137,685 OTHER, NET (343,069 ) (667,660 ) (43,790 ) TOTAL INVESTED CAPITAL $ 10,627,659 $ 10,613,997 $ 10,830,058 AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL $ 10,390,424 $ 11,235,625 $ 10,331,512 RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL 10.7 % 16.0 % 18.0 % THE 530 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN ROIC IN 2009 VERSUS 2008 WAS THE RESULT OF AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME DECREASING 38.5%, RESULTING FROM THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, WHILE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL DECREASED 7.5%.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY $135.5 MILLION OUTSTANDING UNDER ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT OF $2.5 BILLION IN THE U.S. TO SUPPORT THE ISSUANCES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. OF THIS AMOUNT, $2.0 BILLION IS PROVIDED UNDER A LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 11, 2010 AND THE REMAINING $500.0 MILLION IS UNDER A REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT TERMINATES ON JUNE 15, 2012. NO AMOUNTS ARE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE TWO FACILITIES. THE COMPANYS FOREIGN OPERATIONS ALSO HAVE UNUSED CAPACITY ON UNCOMMITTED FACILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $370 MILLION. THE COMPANY HAD $500.0 MILLION OF 5.75% REDEEMABLE NOTES DUE MARCH 1, 2009, WHICH WERE OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THAT WERE REPAID AT MATURITY. IN 2009, THE COMPANY ISSUED $800.0 MILLION OF 5.15% REDEEMABLE NOTES DUE APRIL 1, 2014 AT 99.92% OF FACE VALUE AND $700.0 MILLION OF 6.25% REDEEMABLE NOTES DUE APRIL 1, 2019 AT 99.98% OF FACE VALUE. THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING WERE USED TO PAY DOWN THE COMPANYS COMMERCIAL PAPER BALANCE. 33 TABLE OF CONTENTS THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED ON ITS CURRENT FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW, DEBT-TO-CAPITALIZATION RATIOS AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY. THE COMPANYS TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO IS 20% TO 30%, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ANY LARGER ACQUISITIONS.

THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE NON-CURRENT TAX OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED GUARANTEES RELATED TO THE DEBT OF CERTAIN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES OF $24.0 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. IN THE EVENT ONE OF THESE AFFILIATES DEFAULTS ON ITS DEBT, THE COMPANY WOULD BE LIABLE FOR THE DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED LIABILITIES RELATED TO THESE GUARANTEES OF $17.0 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY HAD OPEN STAND-BY LETTERS OF CREDIT OF $173.0 MILLION, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH EXPIRE IN 2010. THE COMPANY HAD NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THE COMPANY HAS SIX ACCOUNTING POLICIES WHICH IT BELIEVES ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND WHICH REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. 34 TABLE OF CONTENTS THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE AS FOLLOWS: REALIZABILITY OF INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. GENERALLY, THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES PERFORM AN ANALYSIS OF THE HISTORICAL SALES USAGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL INVENTORY ITEMS ON HAND AND A RESERVE IS RECORDED TO ADJUST INVENTORY COST TO MARKET VALUE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING USAGE CRITERIA: USAGE CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA RESERVE % ACTIVE QUANTITY ON HAND IS LESS THAN PRIOR 6 MONTHS USAGE 0 % SLOW-MOVING SOME USAGE IN LAST 12 MONTHS, BUT QUANTITY ON HAND EXCEEDS PRIOR 6 MONTHS USAGE 50 % OBSOLETE NO USAGE IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS 90 % IN ADDITION, FOR APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE U.S. OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO USE THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD OF INVENTORY COSTING. GENERALLY, THIS METHOD RESULTS IN A LOWER INVENTORY VALUE THAN THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) METHOD DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION. COLLECTIBILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS BASED ON THE GREATER OF A SPECIFIC RESERVE OR A RESERVE CALCULATED BASED ON THE HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF PERCENTAGE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. IN ADDITION, THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS INCLUDES RESERVES FOR CUSTOMER CREDITS AND CASH DISCOUNTS, WHICH ARE ALSO ESTIMATED BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE. DEPRECIATION OF PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  THE COMPANYS U.S. BUSINESSES COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS, AS FOLLOWS: BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS 150% DECLINING BALANCE MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT 200% DECLINING BALANCE THE MAJORITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS TO CONFORM TO THEIR LOCAL STATUTORY ACCOUNTING AND TAX REGULATIONS. INCOME TAXES  THE COMPANY PROVIDES DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX LAWS. THE COMPANYS DEFERRED AND OTHER TAX BALANCES ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS INTERPRETATION OF THE TAX REGULATIONS AND RULINGS IN NUMEROUS TAXING JURISDICTIONS. INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES RECOGNIZED BY THE COMPANY ALSO REFLECT ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE LEVEL OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND EFFECT OF THE COMPANYS VARIOUS TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. FUTURE TAX AUTHORITY RULINGS AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, CHANGES IN PROJECTED LEVELS OF TAXABLE INCOME AND FUTURE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES COULD AFFECT THE ACTUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND TAX BALANCES RECORDED BY THE COMPANY. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  THE COMPANYS BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS TYPICALLY RESULT IN RECORDING GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AND POSSIBLY IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE THAT THE COMPANY WILL INCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE GUIDANCE PRESCRIBED IN THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO TEST GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF TRIGGERING EVENTS OCCUR, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ITS 60 REPORTING UNITS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO DETERMINE IF A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, IF ANY, IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL. IN CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS, MANAGEMENT RELIES ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OPERATING RESULTS, BUSINESS PLANS, ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS, ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER MARKET DATA. THERE ARE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THESE FACTORS AND MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT IN APPLYING THEM IN THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE DATE OF ITS ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT FROM THE FIRST QUARTER TO THE THIRD QUARTER. THIS CONSTITUTES A CHANGE IN METHOD OF APPLYING AN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS PREFERABLE. THE CHANGE WAS MADE TO BETTER ALIGN THE TIMING OF THE 35 TABLE OF CONTENTS COMPANYS GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT WITH THE COMPANYS ANNUAL BUSINESS PLANNING AND FORECASTING PROCESS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY HAD GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $6.6 BILLION ALLOCATED TO ITS 60 REPORTING UNITS. THE COMPANYS RISK OF SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IS MITIGATED BY THE NUMBER OF DIVERSIFIED BUSINESSES AND END MARKETS REPRESENTED BY ITS 60 REPORTING UNITS. IN ADDITION, THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES IN MOST OF ITS REPORTING UNITS HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, AND THEREFORE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPANYS 80/20 BUSINESS SIMPLIFICATION PROCESS. THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL REPORTING UNITS RANGE FROM APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION TO $700 MILLION, WITH THE AVERAGE AMOUNT EQUAL TO $110 MILLION. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $105.6 MILLION IN 2009, $1.6 MILLION IN 2008 AND $2.2 MILLION IN 2007. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES DURING 2009 WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO NEW REPORTING UNITS WHICH WERE ACQUIRED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS BEFORE THE RECENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THESE CHARGES WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER CURRENT FORECASTS COMPARED TO THE EXPECTED FORECASTS AT THE TIME THE REPORTING UNITS WERE ACQUIRED. SEE THE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE RELATIVE CARRYING VALUES AND FAIR VALUES OF THE REPORTING UNITS RELATED TO THESE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT AND ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE COMPANYS GLOBAL END MARKETS, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ONE OR MORE REPORTING UNITS COULD OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS  THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS COMPANY-SPONSORED DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF U.S. EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON EACH PARTICIPANTS YEARS OF SERVICE, FUTURE COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATES. SEE THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES. THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES AS OF THE DECEMBER 31 MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE U.S. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. THE DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH THE ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES COULD THEORETICALLY BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. IN ESTIMATING THIS RATE, THE COMPANY LOOKS AT RATES OF RETURN ON HIGH-QUALITY FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS, WITH SIMILAR DURATION TO THE LIABILITIES IN THE PLAN. A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN OBLIGATION BY APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR SIMILAR INVESTMENT ALLOCATIONS AMONG ASSET CLASSES. FOR THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTION FOR THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 8.5% FOR 2009 AND WILL BE 8.0% FOR 2010. A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WOULD INCREASE THE ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION. SEE THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR INFORMATION ON HOW THIS RATE IS DETERMINED. 36 TABLE OF CONTENTS ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK MARKET RISK INTEREST RATE RISK THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK FOR CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANYS DEBT.

(THE COMPANY OR ITW) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(F). ITWS INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE TO THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING THE PREPARATION AND FAIR PRESENTATION OF PUBLISHED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALL INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED, HAVE INHERENT LIMITATIONS. THEREFORE, EVEN THOSE SYSTEMS DETERMINED TO BE EFFECTIVE CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION. ITW MANAGEMENT ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT, IT USED THE CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO) IN INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK. BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT WE BELIEVE THAT, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS EFFECTIVE BASED ON THOSE CRITERIA.

OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS.

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES. THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSET. ON JANUARY 1, 2009, THE COMPANY ADOPTED NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR ALL NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND NONFINANCIAL LIABILITIES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS. THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE DEFINES FAIR VALUE AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE AND THE NECESSARY DISCLOSURES. WHEN PERFORMING ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF ITS 60 REPORTING UNITS TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY BY DISCOUNTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS BASED EITHER ON CURRENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR ON A DETAILED CASH FLOW FORECAST PREPARED BY THE RELEVANT REPORTING UNIT. THE COMPANY ALSO CONSIDERS ADDITIONAL VALUATION TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS MARKET MULTIPLES FROM SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS AND QUOTED MARKET PRICES OF RELEVANT PUBLIC COMPANIES. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, IF ANY, IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL.
