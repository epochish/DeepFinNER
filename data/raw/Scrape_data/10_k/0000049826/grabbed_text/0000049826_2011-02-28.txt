DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. (THE COMPANY OR ITW) IS A MULTINATIONAL MANUFACTURER OF A DIVERSIFIED RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT WITH OPERATIONS IN 57 COUNTRIES. THESE BUSINESSES ARE INTERNALLY REPORTED AS 60 OPERATING SEGMENTS TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANYS 60 OPERATING SEGMENTS HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED INTO THE FOLLOWING EIGHT EXTERNAL REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: TRANSPORTATION; INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING; POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS; FOOD EQUIPMENT; CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS; POLYMERS & FLUIDS; DECORATIVE SURFACES; AND ALL OTHER. 14 TABLE OF CONTENTS DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF DIVERSE BUSINESSES AND THE COMPANYS HIGHLY DECENTRALIZED OPERATING STYLE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT REQUIRE ITS BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE DETAILED INFORMATION ON OPERATING RESULTS. INSTEAD, THE COMPANYS CORPORATE MANAGEMENT COLLECTS DATA ON SEVERAL KEY MEASUREMENTS: OPERATING REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME, OPERATING MARGINS, OVERHEAD COSTS, NUMBER OF MONTHS ON HAND IN INVENTORY, DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PAST DUE RECEIVABLES AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. THESE KEY MEASURES ARE MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OPERATING RESULTS VERSUS CURRENT TRENDS IN END MARKETS AND VARIANCES FROM FORECASTS ARE DISCUSSED WITH OPERATING UNIT MANAGEMENT. THE RESULTS OF EACH SEGMENT ARE ANALYZED BY IDENTIFYING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN THE RESULTS OF THE BASE BUSINESSES, NEWLY ACQUIRED COMPANIES, RESTRUCTURING COSTS, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AND CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON THE OPERATING REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME OF EACH SEGMENT. BASE BUSINESSES ARE THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR MORE THAN 12 MONTHS. THE CHANGES TO BASE BUSINESS OPERATING INCOME INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF BOTH OPERATING LEVERAGE AND CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS. OPERATING LEVERAGE IS THE ESTIMATED EFFECT OF THE BASE BUSINESS REVENUE CHANGES ON OPERATING INCOME, ASSUMING VARIABLE MARGINS REMAIN THE SAME AS THE PRIOR PERIOD. AS MANUFACTURING AND ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD COSTS USUALLY DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE AS A RESULT OF REVENUES INCREASING OR DECREASING, THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN OPERATING INCOME DUE TO OPERATING LEVERAGE IS USUALLY MORE THAN THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE BASE BUSINESS REVENUES. A KEY ELEMENT OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS STRATEGY IS ITS CONTINUOUS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS FOR BOTH EXISTING BUSINESSES AND NEW ACQUISITIONS. THE BASIC CONCEPT OF THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS IS TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT (THE 20% OF THE ITEMS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 80% OF THE VALUE) AND TO SPEND LESS TIME AND RESOURCES ON THE LESS IMPORTANT (THE 80% OF THE ITEMS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 20% OF THE VALUE). THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS USE THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS TO SIMPLIFY AND FOCUS ON THE KEY PARTS OF THEIR BUSINESS, AND AS A RESULT, REDUCE COMPLEXITY THAT OFTEN DISGUISES WHAT IS TRULY IMPORTANT. THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS UTILIZE THE 80/20 PROCESS IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THEIR BUSINESSES. COMMON APPLICATIONS OF THE 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS INCLUDE:  SIMPLIFYING PRODUCT LINES BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS OFFERED BY COMBINING THE FEATURES OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS, OUTSOURCING PRODUCTS OR, AS A LAST RESORT, ELIMINATING LOW-VALUE PRODUCTS.  SEGMENTING THE CUSTOMER BASE BY FOCUSING ON THE 80/20 CUSTOMERS SEPARATELY AND FINDING ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO SERVE THE 20/80 CUSTOMERS.  SIMPLIFYING THE SUPPLIER BASE BY PARTNERING WITH 80/20 SUPPLIERS AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF 20/80 SUPPLIERS.  DESIGNING BUSINESS PROCESSES, SYSTEMS AND MEASUREMENTS AROUND THE 80/20 ACTIVITIES. THE RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS IS THAT THE COMPANY HAS OVER TIME IMPROVED ITS LONG-TERM OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THESE 80/20 EFFORTS CAN RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS THAT REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE MARGINS. CORPORATE MANAGEMENT WORKS CLOSELY WITH THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE OPERATING RESULTS BELOW EXPECTATIONS TO HELP THOSE BUSINESSES BETTER APPLY THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS AND IMPROVE THEIR RESULTS. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2010, 2009 AND 2008 ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS 2010 2009 2008 OPERATING REVENUES $ 15,870,376 $ 13,877,068 $ 17,100,341 OPERATING INCOME 2,356,678 1,385,979 2,501,286 MARGIN % 14.8 % 10.0 % 14.6 % 15 TABLE OF CONTENTS IN 2010 AND 2009, THE CHANGES IN REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGINS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 % POINT INCREASE % POINT INCREASE % INCREASE (DECREASE) (DECREASE) % INCREASE (DECREASE) (DECREASE) OPERATING OPERATING OPERATING OPERATING OPERATING OPERATING REVENUES INCOME MARGINS REVENUES INCOME MARGINS BASE BUSINESS: REVENUE CHANGE/OPERATING LEVERAGE 10.8 % 44.2 % 3.0 % (18.4 )% (51.8 )% (6.0 )% CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS  6.0 0.6  21.2 3.8 10.8 50.2 3.6 (18.4 ) (30.6 ) (2.2 ) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 3.0 1.9 (0.2 ) 4.2  (0.6 ) RESTRUCTURING COSTS  8.9 0.8  (4.1 ) (0.7 ) IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES  7.5 0.7  (4.1 ) (0.7 ) TRANSLATION 0.8 1.5  (4.8 ) (5.8 ) (0.4 ) OTHER (0.2 )  (0.1 ) 0.2   14.4 % 70.0 % 4.8 % (18.8 )% (44.6 )% (4.6 )% OPERATING REVENUES REVENUES INCREASED 14.4% IN 2010 VERSUS 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER BASE REVENUES AND REVENUES FROM ACQUISITIONS. BASE REVENUES INCREASED 10.8% IN 2010 VERSUS 2009 AS THE COMPANY SAW IMPROVEMENT IN MACROECONOMIC INDICES ACROSS MANY GEOGRAPHIES AS WORLDWIDE END MARKETS BEGAN TO RECOVER FROM THE GLOBAL RECESSION. NORTH AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL BASE REVENUES INCREASED 10.9% AND 10.4%, RESPECTIVELY, IN 2010 VERSUS 2009. END MARKETS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSPORTATION, WELDING, INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING AND PC BOARD/ELECTRONICS SHOWED IMPROVEMENT IN 2010. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES CONTINUED MACROECONOMIC IMPROVEMENT IN 2011. REVENUES DECREASED 18.8% IN 2009 VERSUS 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER BASE REVENUES AND THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION, MAINLY DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE DOLLAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REVENUES FROM ACQUISITIONS. TOTAL BASE REVENUES DECLINED 18.4% IN 2009 VERSUS 2008. BASE REVENUES DECLINED 21.6% AND 14.9% FOR NORTH AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES, RESPECTIVELY, AS BOTH WERE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE GLOBAL RECESSION AND WEAK INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION IN RELATED END MARKETS THROUGHOUT 2009. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 70.0% IN 2010 VERSUS 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES, LOWER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, AND 2009 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. BASE MARGINS INCREASED 360 BASIS POINTS PRIMARILY DUE TO POSITIVE LEVERAGE FROM THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES. ADDITIONALLY, BENEFITS FROM RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE SELLING PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS. LOWER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES IN 2010 VERSUS 2009 REFLECT THE COMPANYS 2009 EFFORTS TO REDUCE COSTS IN RESPONSE TO WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IN 2009, THE COMPANY RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $90.0 MILLION AND $15.6 MILLION AGAINST GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO $1.0 MILLION IN INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN 2010. OPERATING INCOME DECLINED 44.6% IN 2009 VERSUS 2008 DUE TO THE DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES, THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION, INCREASED RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES AND INCREASED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. IN 2009, THE COMPANY RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $90.0 MILLION AND $15.6 MILLION AGAINST GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES, RESPECTIVELY. THE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO NEW REPORTING UNITS WHICH WERE ACQUIRED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS BEFORE THE RECENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THESE CHARGES WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER CURRENT FORECASTS COMPARED TO THE EXPECTED 16 TABLE OF CONTENTS FORECASTS AT THE TIME THE REPORTING UNITS WERE ACQUIRED. THE HIGHER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES REFLECTED THE COMPANYS EFFORTS TO REDUCE COSTS IN RESPONSE TO WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IMPROVEMENTS IN BASE VARIABLE MARGINS AND LOWER OVERHEAD COSTS INCREASED BASE MARGINS 380 BASIS POINTS IN 2009, AS THE CUMULATIVE BENEFITS OF RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS BEGAN TO BE REALIZED AND SELLING PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS WERE FAVORABLE. TOTAL MARGINS DECLINED BY 460 BASIS POINTS IN 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINES IN BASE REVENUES, RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES AND THE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

THE COMPANY ALSO CONTESTED THE COMMISSIONERS SIMILAR DETERMINATION FOR INCOME TAX YEARS 2006 AND 2007; HOWEVER, THE PARTIES AGREED TO DEFER THE APPEAL OF THAT DETERMINATION UNTIL A DECISION WAS MADE ON THE EARLIER YEARS. ON FEBRUARY 4, 2011, THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA DECIDED IN THE COMPANYS FAVOR WITH RESPECT TO A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS. THE COURT ISSUED THE FINAL ORDERS ON FEBRUARY 18, 2011. BASED ON THIS DECISION, THE COMPANY EXPECTS IN 2011 TO DECREASE ITS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THIS MATTER BY APPROXIMATELY $186 MILLION AND DECREASE TAX EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $166 MILLION. THE AUSTRALIAN TAX OFFICE HAS 21 DAYS FROM THE DATE THE COURT ISSUED ITS FINAL ORDERS TO APPEAL THE DECISION. SEE THE INCOME TAXES NOTE IN ITEM 8.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT, CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS, TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH AND TO FUND SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE PRIMARY USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE:  DIVIDEND PAYMENTS  THE COMPANYS DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINES ARE 30% TO 45% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS AVERAGE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW;  ACQUISITIONS; AND  ANY EXCESS LIQUIDITY MAY BE USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES. CASH FLOW THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 47.9 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK UNDER THIS PROGRAM AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $44.48 PER SHARE. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY $871 MILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ROIC IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE YEAR AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAD NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. THE COMPANY HAS COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT OF $2.5 BILLION IN THE U.S. TO SUPPORT THE POTENTIAL ISSUANCES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. OF THIS AMOUNT, $1.0 BILLION IS PROVIDED UNDER A LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 10, 2011 AND $1.0 BILLION IS PROVIDED UNDER A LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 11, 2013. THE REMAINING $500 MILLION IS PROVIDED UNDER A REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT TERMINATES ON JUNE 15, 2012. NO AMOUNTS ARE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE THREE FACILITIES. THE COMPANYS FOREIGN OPERATIONS ALSO HAVE UNUSED CAPACITY ON UNCOMMITTED FACILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $318 MILLION. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED ON ITS CURRENT FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW, DEBT-TO-CAPITALIZATION RATIOS AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY. THE COMPANYS TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO IS 20% TO 30%, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ANY LARGER ACQUISITIONS. 33 TABLE OF CONTENTS STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY THE CHANGES TO STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY DURING 2010 AND 2009 WERE AS FOLLOWS: IN THOUSANDS 2010 2009 BEGINNING BALANCE $ 8,817,876 $ 7,675,091 NET INCOME 1,527,193 947,009 CASH DIVIDENDS DECLARED (649,709 ) (620,679 ) REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK (350,000 )  STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK ACTIVITY 186,818 165,007 CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS (180,149 ) 716,208 OTHER 29,217 (64,760 ) ENDING BALANCE $ 9,381,246 $ 8,817,876 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THE COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 2016 AND IN THOUSANDS 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 FUTURE YEARS TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT $ 252,236 $ 16,572 $ 6,132 $ 1,776,592 $ 2,688 $ 709,975 INTEREST PAYMENTS ON NOTES AND PREFERRED DEBT SECURITIES 153,509 136,873 136,635 107,305 43,982 154,006 MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS 150,509 109,472 83,673 58,649 43,952 73,956 $ 556,254 $ 262,917 $ 226,440 $ 1,942,546 $ 90,622 $ 937,937 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED INCOME TAXES PAYABLE, INCLUDING LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, OF $459.1 MILLION. THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAD OPEN STAND-BY LETTERS OF CREDIT OF APPROXIMATELY $181 MILLION, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH EXPIRE IN 2011. THE COMPANY HAD NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THE COMPANY HAS SIX ACCOUNTING POLICIES WHICH IT BELIEVES ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND WHICH REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE AS FOLLOWS: REALIZABILITY OF INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. GENERALLY, THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES PERFORM AN ANALYSIS OF THE HISTORICAL SALES USAGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL INVENTORY ITEMS ON HAND AND A RESERVE IS RECORDED TO ADJUST INVENTORY COST TO MARKET VALUE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING USAGE CRITERIA: USAGE CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA RESERVE % ACTIVE QUANTITY ON HAND IS LESS THAN PRIOR 6 MONTHS USAGE 0 % SLOW-MOVING SOME USAGE IN LAST 12 MONTHS, BUT QUANTITY ON HAND EXCEEDS PRIOR 6 MONTHS USAGE 50 % OBSOLETE NO USAGE IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS 90 % 34 TABLE OF CONTENTS IN ADDITION, FOR APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE U.S. INVENTORIES, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO USE THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD OF INVENTORY COSTING. GENERALLY, THIS METHOD RESULTS IN A LOWER INVENTORY VALUE THAN THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) METHOD DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION. COLLECTIBILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS BASED ON THE GREATER OF A SPECIFIC RESERVE OR A RESERVE CALCULATED BASED ON THE HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF PERCENTAGE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. IN ADDITION, THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS INCLUDES RESERVES FOR CUSTOMER CREDITS AND CASH DISCOUNTS, WHICH ARE ALSO ESTIMATED BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE. DEPRECIATION OF PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  THE COMPANYS U.S. BUSINESSES COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS, AS FOLLOWS: BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS 150% DECLINING BALANCE MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT 200% DECLINING BALANCE THE MAJORITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS TO CONFORM TO THEIR LOCAL STATUTORY ACCOUNTING AND TAX REGULATIONS. INCOME TAXES  THE COMPANY PROVIDES DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX LAWS. THE COMPANYS DEFERRED AND OTHER TAX BALANCES ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS INTERPRETATION OF THE TAX REGULATIONS AND RULINGS IN NUMEROUS TAXING JURISDICTIONS. INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES RECOGNIZED BY THE COMPANY ALSO REFLECT ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE LEVEL OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND EFFECT OF THE COMPANYS VARIOUS TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. FUTURE TAX AUTHORITY RULINGS AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, CHANGES IN PROJECTED LEVELS OF TAXABLE INCOME AND FUTURE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES COULD AFFECT THE ACTUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND TAX BALANCES RECORDED BY THE COMPANY. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  THE COMPANYS BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS TYPICALLY RESULT IN RECORDING GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH ARE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL ASSETS AND AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT THE COMPANY COULD INCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE GUIDANCE PRESCRIBED IN THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO TEST GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF TRIGGERING EVENTS OCCUR, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ITS 60 REPORTING UNITS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO DETERMINE IF A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, IF ANY, IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL. IN CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS, MANAGEMENT RELIES ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OPERATING RESULTS, BUSINESS PLANS, ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS, ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER MARKET DATA. THERE ARE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THESE FACTORS AND MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT IN APPLYING THEM IN THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE DATE OF ITS ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT FROM THE FIRST QUARTER TO THE THIRD QUARTER. THIS CONSTITUTED A CHANGE IN METHOD OF APPLYING AN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS PREFERABLE. THE CHANGE WAS MADE TO BETTER ALIGN THE TIMING OF THE COMPANYS GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT WITH THE COMPANYS ANNUAL BUSINESS PLANNING AND FORECASTING PROCESS. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $1.0 MILLION IN 2010, $105.6 MILLION IN 2009 AND $1.6 MILLION IN 2008. THE IMPAIRMENTS DURING 2009 WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO NEW REPORTING UNITS WHICH WERE ACQUIRED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS BEFORE THE RECENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THESE CHARGES WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER CURRENT FORECASTS COMPARED TO THE EXPECTED FORECASTS AT THE TIME THE REPORTING UNITS WERE ACQUIRED. SEE THE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE RELATIVE CARRYING VALUES AND FAIR VALUES OF THE REPORTING UNITS RELATED TO THESE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. 35 TABLE OF CONTENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAD GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $6.6 BILLION ALLOCATED TO ITS 60 REPORTING UNITS. ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE COMPANY GENERALLY BELIEVES THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IS LESSENED BY THE NUMBER OF DIVERSIFIED BUSINESSES AND END MARKETS REPRESENTED BY ITS 60 REPORTING UNITS THAT HAVE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES IN MANY OF THE REPORTING UNITS HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, AND THEREFORE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPANYS 80/20 BUSINESS SIMPLIFICATION PROCESS. THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL REPORTING UNITS RANGE FROM APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION TO $740 MILLION, WITH THE AVERAGE AMOUNT EQUAL TO $110 MILLION. FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT AND ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE COMPANYS GLOBAL END MARKETS, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ONE OR MORE REPORTING UNITS COULD OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS  THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS COMPANY-SPONSORED DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF U.S. EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON EACH PARTICIPANTS YEARS OF SERVICE, FUTURE COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATES. SEE THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES. THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES AS OF THE DECEMBER 31 MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE U.S. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. THE DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH THE ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES COULD THEORETICALLY BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. IN ESTIMATING THIS RATE, THE COMPANY LOOKS AT RATES OF RETURN ON HIGH-QUALITY FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS, WITH SIMILAR DURATION TO THE LIABILITIES IN THE PLAN. A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN OBLIGATION BY APPROXIMATELY $32 MILLION. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR SIMILAR INVESTMENT ALLOCATIONS AMONG ASSET CLASSES. FOR THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTION FOR THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 8.0% FOR 2010 AND WILL BE 8.0% FOR 2011. A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WOULD INCREASE THE ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION. SEE THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR INFORMATION ON HOW THIS RATE IS DETERMINED. 36 TABLE OF CONTENTS ITEM 7A.

IN GENERAL, THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY MANUFACTURED AND SOLD WITHIN THE SAME COUNTRY. THE INITIAL FUNDING FOR THE FOREIGN MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS WAS PROVIDED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE PERMANENT INVESTMENT OF EQUITY CAPITAL FROM THE U.S. PARENT COMPANY. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT ASSETS OR LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT DERIVATIVES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 OR 2009. IN OCTOBER 2007, THE COMPANY ISSUED 750.0 MILLION OF 5.25% EURO NOTES DUE OCTOBER 1, 2014. THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS WITH THE EURO AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EURO CASH FLOWS FROM THESE BUSINESSES WILL BE ADEQUATE TO FUND THE DEBT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE NOTES. 37 TABLE OF CONTENTS ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING THE MANAGEMENT OF ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. (THE COMPANY OR ITW) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(F). ITWS INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE TO THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING THE PREPARATION AND FAIR PRESENTATION OF PUBLISHED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALL INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED, HAVE INHERENT LIMITATIONS. THEREFORE, EVEN THOSE SYSTEMS DETERMINED TO BE EFFECTIVE CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION. ITW MANAGEMENT ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010. IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT, IT USED THE CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO) IN INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK. BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT WE BELIEVE THAT, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS EFFECTIVE BASED ON THOSE CRITERIA. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT HEREIN. /S/ DAVID B.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE. IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC.

EXHIBITS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES (A)(1) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS INCLUDED AS PART OF DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. (THE COMPANY OR ITW) IS A MULTINATIONAL MANUFACTURER OF A DIVERSIFIED RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT WITH OPERATIONS IN 57 COUNTRIES. THESE BUSINESSES ARE INTERNALLY REPORTED AS 60 OPERATING SEGMENTS TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANYS 60 OPERATING SEGMENTS HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED INTO THE FOLLOWING EIGHT EXTERNAL REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: TRANSPORTATION; INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING; POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS; FOOD EQUIPMENT; CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS; POLYMERS & FLUIDS; DECORATIVE SURFACES; AND ALL OTHER. 14 TABLE OF CONTENTS DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF DIVERSE BUSINESSES AND THE COMPANYS HIGHLY DECENTRALIZED OPERATING STYLE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT REQUIRE ITS BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE DETAILED INFORMATION ON OPERATING RESULTS. INSTEAD, THE COMPANYS CORPORATE MANAGEMENT COLLECTS DATA ON SEVERAL KEY MEASUREMENTS: OPERATING REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME, OPERATING MARGINS, OVERHEAD COSTS, NUMBER OF MONTHS ON HAND IN INVENTORY, DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PAST DUE RECEIVABLES AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. THESE KEY MEASURES ARE MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OPERATING RESULTS VERSUS CURRENT TRENDS IN END MARKETS AND VARIANCES FROM FORECASTS ARE DISCUSSED WITH OPERATING UNIT MANAGEMENT. THE RESULTS OF EACH SEGMENT ARE ANALYZED BY IDENTIFYING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN THE RESULTS OF THE BASE BUSINESSES, NEWLY ACQUIRED COMPANIES, RESTRUCTURING COSTS, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AND CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON THE OPERATING REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME OF EACH SEGMENT. BASE BUSINESSES ARE THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR MORE THAN 12 MONTHS. THE CHANGES TO BASE BUSINESS OPERATING INCOME INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF BOTH OPERATING LEVERAGE AND CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS. OPERATING LEVERAGE IS THE ESTIMATED EFFECT OF THE BASE BUSINESS REVENUE CHANGES ON OPERATING INCOME, ASSUMING VARIABLE MARGINS REMAIN THE SAME AS THE PRIOR PERIOD. AS MANUFACTURING AND ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD COSTS USUALLY DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE AS A RESULT OF REVENUES INCREASING OR DECREASING, THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN OPERATING INCOME DUE TO OPERATING LEVERAGE IS USUALLY MORE THAN THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE BASE BUSINESS REVENUES. A KEY ELEMENT OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS STRATEGY IS ITS CONTINUOUS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS FOR BOTH EXISTING BUSINESSES AND NEW ACQUISITIONS. THE BASIC CONCEPT OF THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS IS TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT (THE 20% OF THE ITEMS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 80% OF THE VALUE) AND TO SPEND LESS TIME AND RESOURCES ON THE LESS IMPORTANT (THE 80% OF THE ITEMS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 20% OF THE VALUE). THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS USE THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS TO SIMPLIFY AND FOCUS ON THE KEY PARTS OF THEIR BUSINESS, AND AS A RESULT, REDUCE COMPLEXITY THAT OFTEN DISGUISES WHAT IS TRULY IMPORTANT. THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS UTILIZE THE 80/20 PROCESS IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THEIR BUSINESSES. COMMON APPLICATIONS OF THE 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS INCLUDE:  SIMPLIFYING PRODUCT LINES BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS OFFERED BY COMBINING THE FEATURES OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS, OUTSOURCING PRODUCTS OR, AS A LAST RESORT, ELIMINATING LOW-VALUE PRODUCTS.  SEGMENTING THE CUSTOMER BASE BY FOCUSING ON THE 80/20 CUSTOMERS SEPARATELY AND FINDING ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO SERVE THE 20/80 CUSTOMERS.  SIMPLIFYING THE SUPPLIER BASE BY PARTNERING WITH 80/20 SUPPLIERS AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF 20/80 SUPPLIERS.  DESIGNING BUSINESS PROCESSES, SYSTEMS AND MEASUREMENTS AROUND THE 80/20 ACTIVITIES. THE RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS IS THAT THE COMPANY HAS OVER TIME IMPROVED ITS LONG-TERM OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THESE 80/20 EFFORTS CAN RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS THAT REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE MARGINS. CORPORATE MANAGEMENT WORKS CLOSELY WITH THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE OPERATING RESULTS BELOW EXPECTATIONS TO HELP THOSE BUSINESSES BETTER APPLY THIS 80/20 BUSINESS PROCESS AND IMPROVE THEIR RESULTS. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2010, 2009 AND 2008 ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS 2010 2009 2008 OPERATING REVENUES $ 15,870,376 $ 13,877,068 $ 17,100,341 OPERATING INCOME 2,356,678 1,385,979 2,501,286 MARGIN % 14.8 % 10.0 % 14.6 % 15 TABLE OF CONTENTS IN 2010 AND 2009, THE CHANGES IN REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGINS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 % POINT INCREASE % POINT INCREASE % INCREASE (DECREASE) (DECREASE) % INCREASE (DECREASE) (DECREASE) OPERATING OPERATING OPERATING OPERATING OPERATING OPERATING REVENUES INCOME MARGINS REVENUES INCOME MARGINS BASE BUSINESS: REVENUE CHANGE/OPERATING LEVERAGE 10.8 % 44.2 % 3.0 % (18.4 )% (51.8 )% (6.0 )% CHANGES IN VARIABLE MARGINS AND OVERHEAD COSTS  6.0 0.6  21.2 3.8 10.8 50.2 3.6 (18.4 ) (30.6 ) (2.2 ) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 3.0 1.9 (0.2 ) 4.2  (0.6 ) RESTRUCTURING COSTS  8.9 0.8  (4.1 ) (0.7 ) IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES  7.5 0.7  (4.1 ) (0.7 ) TRANSLATION 0.8 1.5  (4.8 ) (5.8 ) (0.4 ) OTHER (0.2 )  (0.1 ) 0.2   14.4 % 70.0 % 4.8 % (18.8 )% (44.6 )% (4.6 )% OPERATING REVENUES REVENUES INCREASED 14.4% IN 2010 VERSUS 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER BASE REVENUES AND REVENUES FROM ACQUISITIONS. BASE REVENUES INCREASED 10.8% IN 2010 VERSUS 2009 AS THE COMPANY SAW IMPROVEMENT IN MACROECONOMIC INDICES ACROSS MANY GEOGRAPHIES AS WORLDWIDE END MARKETS BEGAN TO RECOVER FROM THE GLOBAL RECESSION. NORTH AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL BASE REVENUES INCREASED 10.9% AND 10.4%, RESPECTIVELY, IN 2010 VERSUS 2009. END MARKETS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSPORTATION, WELDING, INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING AND PC BOARD/ELECTRONICS SHOWED IMPROVEMENT IN 2010. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES CONTINUED MACROECONOMIC IMPROVEMENT IN 2011. REVENUES DECREASED 18.8% IN 2009 VERSUS 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER BASE REVENUES AND THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION, MAINLY DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE DOLLAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REVENUES FROM ACQUISITIONS. TOTAL BASE REVENUES DECLINED 18.4% IN 2009 VERSUS 2008. BASE REVENUES DECLINED 21.6% AND 14.9% FOR NORTH AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES, RESPECTIVELY, AS BOTH WERE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE GLOBAL RECESSION AND WEAK INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION IN RELATED END MARKETS THROUGHOUT 2009. OPERATING INCOME OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 70.0% IN 2010 VERSUS 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES, LOWER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, AND 2009 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. BASE MARGINS INCREASED 360 BASIS POINTS PRIMARILY DUE TO POSITIVE LEVERAGE FROM THE INCREASE IN BASE REVENUES. ADDITIONALLY, BENEFITS FROM RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE SELLING PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS. LOWER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES IN 2010 VERSUS 2009 REFLECT THE COMPANYS 2009 EFFORTS TO REDUCE COSTS IN RESPONSE TO WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IN 2009, THE COMPANY RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $90.0 MILLION AND $15.6 MILLION AGAINST GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO $1.0 MILLION IN INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN 2010. OPERATING INCOME DECLINED 44.6% IN 2009 VERSUS 2008 DUE TO THE DECLINE IN BASE REVENUES, THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION, INCREASED RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES AND INCREASED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. IN 2009, THE COMPANY RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $90.0 MILLION AND $15.6 MILLION AGAINST GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES, RESPECTIVELY. THE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO NEW REPORTING UNITS WHICH WERE ACQUIRED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS BEFORE THE RECENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THESE CHARGES WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER CURRENT FORECASTS COMPARED TO THE EXPECTED 16 TABLE OF CONTENTS FORECASTS AT THE TIME THE REPORTING UNITS WERE ACQUIRED. THE HIGHER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES REFLECTED THE COMPANYS EFFORTS TO REDUCE COSTS IN RESPONSE TO WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IMPROVEMENTS IN BASE VARIABLE MARGINS AND LOWER OVERHEAD COSTS INCREASED BASE MARGINS 380 BASIS POINTS IN 2009, AS THE CUMULATIVE BENEFITS OF RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS BEGAN TO BE REALIZED AND SELLING PRICE VERSUS MATERIAL COST COMPARISONS WERE FAVORABLE. TOTAL MARGINS DECLINED BY 460 BASIS POINTS IN 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINES IN BASE REVENUES, RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES AND THE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. 30 TABLE OF CONTENTS NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS IN OCTOBER 2009, NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE WAS ISSUED ON MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS. THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE AMENDS THE ACCOUNTING FOR MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE ARRANGEMENTS TO ENABLE THE VENDOR TO ACCOUNT FOR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SEPARATELY RATHER THAN AS A COMBINED UNIT. THE GUIDANCE ESTABLISHES A HIERARCHY FOR DETERMINING THE SELLING PRICE OF A DELIVERABLE, WHICH IS BASED ON: (1) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE, (2) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OR (3) ESTIMATES. THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ON JANUARY 1, 2011 AND DOES NOT EXPECT THE NEW GUIDANCE TO MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 2011 INTERNATIONAL REPORTING CHANGE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011, THE COMPANY WILL BE ELIMINATING THE ONE MONTH LAG FOR THE REPORTING OF ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY WILL REPORT BOTH NORTH AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL RESULTS ON A CALENDAR YEAR BASIS. PRIOR TO THIS, THE INTERNATIONAL FISCAL REPORTING PERIOD BEGAN IN DECEMBER AND ENDED IN NOVEMBER. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE COMPANYS PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SERVICE DEBT, CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS, TO FINANCE INTERNAL GROWTH AND TO FUND SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED ACQUISITIONS. THE PRIMARY USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE:  DIVIDEND PAYMENTS  THE COMPANYS DIVIDEND PAYOUT GUIDELINES ARE 30% TO 45% OF THE LAST TWO YEARS AVERAGE FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW;  ACQUISITIONS; AND  ANY EXCESS LIQUIDITY MAY BE USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES. CASH FLOW THE COMPANY USES FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEASURE CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, ACQUISITIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH INTERNALLY TO FUND COMPANY INITIATIVES. FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PER THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SUMMARIZED CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008 WAS AS FOLLOWS: IN THOUSANDS 2010 2009 2008 NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES $ 1,560,790 $ 2,146,589 $ 2,222,224 ADDITIONS TO PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (286,172 ) (247,102 ) (362,312 ) FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW $ 1,274,618 $ 1,899,487 $ 1,859,912 CASH DIVIDENDS PAID $ (636,200 ) $ (619,681 ) $ (598,690 ) ACQUISITIONS (433,403 ) (281,674 ) (1,546,982 ) REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK (350,000 )  (1,390,594 ) NET PROCEEDS (REPAYMENTS) OF DEBT (185,364 ) (736,470 ) 1,467,613 EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH AND EQUIVALENTS (34,747 ) 183,722 (82,002 ) OTHER 236,362 130,438 206,169 NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH AND EQUIVALENTS $ (128,734 ) $ 575,822 $ (84,574 ) 31 TABLE OF CONTENTS ON AUGUST 20, 2007, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE BUYBACK OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK OVER AN OPEN-ENDED PERIOD OF TIME. THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 47.9 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK UNDER THIS PROGRAM AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $44.48 PER SHARE. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY $871 MILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASES REMAINING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL THE COMPANY USES RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS OPERATIONS USE OF INVESTED CAPITAL TO GENERATE PROFITS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ROIC IS A MEANINGFUL METRIC TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE METHOD USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE ROIC. INVESTED CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE NET ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS. AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL IS CALCULATED USING BALANCES AT THE START OF THE YEAR AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. ROIC FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009, AND 2008 WAS AS FOLLOWS: DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS 2010 2009 2008 OPERATING INCOME $ 2,356,678 $ 1,385,979 $ 2,501,286 TAXES (31.0%, 20.1% AND 28.1%, RESPECTIVELY) (729,628 ) (278,998 ) (702,611 ) OPERATING INCOME AFTER TAXES $ 1,627,050 $ 1,106,981 $ 1,798,675 INVESTED CAPITAL: TRADE RECEIVABLES $ 2,678,084 $ 2,491,492 $ 2,571,987 INVENTORIES 1,547,447 1,356,233 1,774,697 NET PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 2,023,045 2,136,527 2,109,432 INVESTMENTS 441,606 451,293 465,894 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 6,573,943 6,584,149 6,297,219 ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES (2,147,516 ) (2,048,966 ) (1,999,097 ) NET ASSETS HELD FOR SALE   61,525 OTHER, NET (95,655 ) (343,069 ) (667,660 ) TOTAL INVESTED CAPITAL $ 11,020,954 $ 10,627,659 $ 10,613,997 AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL $ 10,645,278 $ 10,390,424 $ 11,235,625 RETURN ON AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL 15.3 % 10.7 % 16.0 % THE 460 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ROIC IN 2010 VERSUS 2009 WAS THE RESULT OF AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME INCREASING 47.0%, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BASE BUSINESS, WHILE AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASED SLIGHTLY.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAD NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. THE COMPANY HAS COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT OF $2.5 BILLION IN THE U.S. TO SUPPORT THE POTENTIAL ISSUANCES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. OF THIS AMOUNT, $1.0 BILLION IS PROVIDED UNDER A LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 10, 2011 AND $1.0 BILLION IS PROVIDED UNDER A LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 11, 2013. THE REMAINING $500 MILLION IS PROVIDED UNDER A REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT TERMINATES ON JUNE 15, 2012. NO AMOUNTS ARE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE THREE FACILITIES. THE COMPANYS FOREIGN OPERATIONS ALSO HAVE UNUSED CAPACITY ON UNCOMMITTED FACILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $318 MILLION. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED ON ITS CURRENT FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW, DEBT-TO-CAPITALIZATION RATIOS AND CREDIT RATINGS, IT COULD READILY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IF NECESSARY. THE COMPANYS TARGETED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO IS 20% TO 30%, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ANY LARGER ACQUISITIONS. 33 TABLE OF CONTENTS STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY THE CHANGES TO STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY DURING 2010 AND 2009 WERE AS FOLLOWS: IN THOUSANDS 2010 2009 BEGINNING BALANCE $ 8,817,876 $ 7,675,091 NET INCOME 1,527,193 947,009 CASH DIVIDENDS DECLARED (649,709 ) (620,679 ) REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK (350,000 )  STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK ACTIVITY 186,818 165,007 CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS (180,149 ) 716,208 OTHER 29,217 (64,760 ) ENDING BALANCE $ 9,381,246 $ 8,817,876 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THE COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 2016 AND IN THOUSANDS 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 FUTURE YEARS TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT $ 252,236 $ 16,572 $ 6,132 $ 1,776,592 $ 2,688 $ 709,975 INTEREST PAYMENTS ON NOTES AND PREFERRED DEBT SECURITIES 153,509 136,873 136,635 107,305 43,982 154,006 MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS 150,509 109,472 83,673 58,649 43,952 73,956 $ 556,254 $ 262,917 $ 226,440 $ 1,942,546 $ 90,622 $ 937,937 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED INCOME TAXES PAYABLE, INCLUDING LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, OF $459.1 MILLION. THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAD OPEN STAND-BY LETTERS OF CREDIT OF APPROXIMATELY $181 MILLION, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH EXPIRE IN 2011. THE COMPANY HAD NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THE COMPANY HAS SIX ACCOUNTING POLICIES WHICH IT BELIEVES ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND WHICH REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE AS FOLLOWS: REALIZABILITY OF INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. GENERALLY, THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES PERFORM AN ANALYSIS OF THE HISTORICAL SALES USAGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL INVENTORY ITEMS ON HAND AND A RESERVE IS RECORDED TO ADJUST INVENTORY COST TO MARKET VALUE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING USAGE CRITERIA: USAGE CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA RESERVE % ACTIVE QUANTITY ON HAND IS LESS THAN PRIOR 6 MONTHS USAGE 0 % SLOW-MOVING SOME USAGE IN LAST 12 MONTHS, BUT QUANTITY ON HAND EXCEEDS PRIOR 6 MONTHS USAGE 50 % OBSOLETE NO USAGE IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS 90 % 34 TABLE OF CONTENTS IN ADDITION, FOR APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE U.S. INVENTORIES, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO USE THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD OF INVENTORY COSTING. GENERALLY, THIS METHOD RESULTS IN A LOWER INVENTORY VALUE THAN THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) METHOD DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION. COLLECTIBILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS BASED ON THE GREATER OF A SPECIFIC RESERVE OR A RESERVE CALCULATED BASED ON THE HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF PERCENTAGE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. IN ADDITION, THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS INCLUDES RESERVES FOR CUSTOMER CREDITS AND CASH DISCOUNTS, WHICH ARE ALSO ESTIMATED BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE. DEPRECIATION OF PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  THE COMPANYS U.S. BUSINESSES COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS, AS FOLLOWS: BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS 150% DECLINING BALANCE MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT 200% DECLINING BALANCE THE MAJORITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES COMPUTE DEPRECIATION ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS TO CONFORM TO THEIR LOCAL STATUTORY ACCOUNTING AND TAX REGULATIONS. INCOME TAXES  THE COMPANY PROVIDES DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX LAWS. THE COMPANYS DEFERRED AND OTHER TAX BALANCES ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS INTERPRETATION OF THE TAX REGULATIONS AND RULINGS IN NUMEROUS TAXING JURISDICTIONS. INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES RECOGNIZED BY THE COMPANY ALSO REFLECT ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE LEVEL OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND EFFECT OF THE COMPANYS VARIOUS TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. FUTURE TAX AUTHORITY RULINGS AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, CHANGES IN PROJECTED LEVELS OF TAXABLE INCOME AND FUTURE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES COULD AFFECT THE ACTUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND TAX BALANCES RECORDED BY THE COMPANY. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  THE COMPANYS BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS TYPICALLY RESULT IN RECORDING GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH ARE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL ASSETS AND AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT THE COMPANY COULD INCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE GUIDANCE PRESCRIBED IN THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO TEST GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF TRIGGERING EVENTS OCCUR, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ITS 60 REPORTING UNITS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO DETERMINE IF A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, IF ANY, IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL. IN CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS, MANAGEMENT RELIES ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OPERATING RESULTS, BUSINESS PLANS, ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS, ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER MARKET DATA. THERE ARE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THESE FACTORS AND MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT IN APPLYING THEM IN THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE DATE OF ITS ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT FROM THE FIRST QUARTER TO THE THIRD QUARTER. THIS CONSTITUTED A CHANGE IN METHOD OF APPLYING AN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS PREFERABLE. THE CHANGE WAS MADE TO BETTER ALIGN THE TIMING OF THE COMPANYS GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT WITH THE COMPANYS ANNUAL BUSINESS PLANNING AND FORECASTING PROCESS. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $1.0 MILLION IN 2010, $105.6 MILLION IN 2009 AND $1.6 MILLION IN 2008. THE IMPAIRMENTS DURING 2009 WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO NEW REPORTING UNITS WHICH WERE ACQUIRED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS BEFORE THE RECENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THESE CHARGES WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER CURRENT FORECASTS COMPARED TO THE EXPECTED FORECASTS AT THE TIME THE REPORTING UNITS WERE ACQUIRED. SEE THE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE RELATIVE CARRYING VALUES AND FAIR VALUES OF THE REPORTING UNITS RELATED TO THESE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. 35 TABLE OF CONTENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAD GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $6.6 BILLION ALLOCATED TO ITS 60 REPORTING UNITS. ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE COMPANY GENERALLY BELIEVES THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IS LESSENED BY THE NUMBER OF DIVERSIFIED BUSINESSES AND END MARKETS REPRESENTED BY ITS 60 REPORTING UNITS THAT HAVE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES IN MANY OF THE REPORTING UNITS HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, AND THEREFORE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPANYS 80/20 BUSINESS SIMPLIFICATION PROCESS. THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL REPORTING UNITS RANGE FROM APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION TO $740 MILLION, WITH THE AVERAGE AMOUNT EQUAL TO $110 MILLION. FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT AND ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE COMPANYS GLOBAL END MARKETS, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ONE OR MORE REPORTING UNITS COULD OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS  THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS COMPANY-SPONSORED DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF U.S. EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON EACH PARTICIPANTS YEARS OF SERVICE, FUTURE COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATES. SEE THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES. THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES AS OF THE DECEMBER 31 MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE U.S. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. THE DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH THE ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES COULD THEORETICALLY BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. IN ESTIMATING THIS RATE, THE COMPANY LOOKS AT RATES OF RETURN ON HIGH-QUALITY FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS, WITH SIMILAR DURATION TO THE LIABILITIES IN THE PLAN. A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN OBLIGATION BY APPROXIMATELY $32 MILLION. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR SIMILAR INVESTMENT ALLOCATIONS AMONG ASSET CLASSES. FOR THE U.S. PRIMARY PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTION FOR THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 8.0% FOR 2010 AND WILL BE 8.0% FOR 2011. A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WOULD INCREASE THE ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION. SEE THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS NOTE IN ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA FOR INFORMATION ON HOW THIS RATE IS DETERMINED. 36 TABLE OF CONTENTS ITEM 7A.

IN GENERAL, THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY MANUFACTURED AND SOLD WITHIN THE SAME COUNTRY. THE INITIAL FUNDING FOR THE FOREIGN MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS WAS PROVIDED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE PERMANENT INVESTMENT OF EQUITY CAPITAL FROM THE U.S. PARENT COMPANY. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT ASSETS OR LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT DERIVATIVES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 OR 2009. IN OCTOBER 2007, THE COMPANY ISSUED 750.0 MILLION OF 5.25% EURO NOTES DUE OCTOBER 1, 2014. THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS WITH THE EURO AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EURO CASH FLOWS FROM THESE BUSINESSES WILL BE ADEQUATE TO FUND THE DEBT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE NOTES. 37 TABLE OF CONTENTS ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING THE MANAGEMENT OF ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. (THE COMPANY OR ITW) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(F). ITWS INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE TO THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING THE PREPARATION AND FAIR PRESENTATION OF PUBLISHED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALL INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED, HAVE INHERENT LIMITATIONS. THEREFORE, EVEN THOSE SYSTEMS DETERMINED TO BE EFFECTIVE CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION. ITW MANAGEMENT ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010. IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT, IT USED THE CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO) IN INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK. BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT WE BELIEVE THAT, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS EFFECTIVE BASED ON THOSE CRITERIA. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT HEREIN. /S/ DAVID B.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE. IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC.
