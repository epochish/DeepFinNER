The basic concept of this 80/20 business     process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the     items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time     and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which     account for 20% of the value). The Companys operations use     this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key     parts of their business, and as a result, reduce complexity that     often disguises what is truly important. The Companys 840     operations utilize the 80/20 process in various aspects of their     business. Common applications of the 80/20 business process     include:                         Simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products     offered by combining the features of similar products,     outsourcing products or, as a last resort, eliminating low-value     products.                  Segmenting the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers     separately and finding alternative ways to serve the 20/80     customers.                  Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers     and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.                  Designing business processes, systems and measurements around     the 80/20 activities.           3    Table of Contents          The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is     that the Company has over time improved its long-term operating     and financial performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in     restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins.     Corporate management works closely with those businesses that     have operating results below expectations to help those     businesses better apply this 80/20 business process and improve     their results.     Discontinued     Operations         In August 2008, the Companys Board of Directors authorized     the divestiture of the Click Commerce industrial software     business which was previously reported in the All Other segment.     In the second quarter of 2009, the Company completed the sale of     the Click Commerce business.         In 2006, the Company divested a construction business. In 2007,     the Company divested an automotive machinery business and a     consumer packaging business. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the     Company classified an automotive components business and a     second consumer packaging business as held for sale. The second     consumer packaging business was sold in 2008. The Company     completed the divestiture of the automotive components business     in 2009.         Additionally, in August 2008, the Companys Board of     Directors authorized the divestiture of the Decorative Surfaces     segment which was subsequently classified as a discontinued     operation. In May 2009, the Companys Board of Directors     rescinded its earlier resolution to divest the Decorative     Surfaces segment and, accordingly, all periods presented have     been restated to present the Decorative Surfaces segment as a     continuing operation.

relatively short delivery periods     and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of its     products. Backlog by segment as of December 31, 2009 and     2008 is summarized as follows:                                        In Thousands        2009           2008                    Transportation            $       231,000               $       237,000              Industrial Packaging                123,000                   158,000              Food Equipment                179,000                   220,000              Power Systems & Electronics                129,000                   124,000              Construction Products                24,000                   32,000              Polymers & Fluids                73,000                   81,000              Decorative Surfaces                19,000                   28,000              All Other                341,000                   351,000                                                    Total            $       1,119,000               $       1,231,000                                                       Backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond calendar year 2010     were not material as of December 31, 2009.         The information set forth below is applicable to all industry     segments of the Company unless otherwise noted:     Competition         With approximately 840 business units operating in 57 countries,     the Company has a wide diversity of products in a myriad of     markets, many of which are fragmented, and we encounter a wide     variety of competitors that vary by product line, end market and     geographic area. Our competitors include many regional or     specialized companies, as well as large U.S. and     non-U.S. companies     or divisions of large companies. Each of our segments generally     has several main competitors and numerous smaller ones in most     of their end markets and geographic areas. In addition, our     Decorative Surfaces and Power Systems & Electronics     segments each has one global competitor and numerous smaller     regional competitors.         In virtually all segments, we compete on the basis of product     innovation, product quality, brand preference, delivery service     and price. Technical capability is also a competitive factor in     most of our segments. We believe that for each of our segments,     our primary competitive advantages derive from our decentralized     operating structure, which creates a strong focus on end markets     and customers at the local level, enabling our businesses to     respond rapidly to market dynamics. This structure enables our     business units to drive operational excellence utilizing our     80/20 business process and leverages our product innovation     capabilities. We also believe that our global footprint is a     competitive advantage in many of our markets, especially in our     Transportation and Decorative Surfaces segments.     Raw     Materials         The Company uses raw materials of various types, primarily     steel, resins, chemicals and paper, that are available from     numerous commercial sources. The availability of materials and     energy has not resulted in any significant business     interruptions or other major problems, and no such problems are     currently anticipated.     Research     and Development         The Companys growth has resulted from developing new and     improved products, broadening the application of established     products, continuing efforts to improve and develop new methods,     processes and equipment, and from acquisitions. Many new     products are designed to reduce customers costs by     eliminating steps in their manufacturing processes, reducing the     number of parts in an assembly, or by          5    Table of Contents        improving the quality of customers assembled products.     Typically, the development of such products is accomplished by     working closely with customers on specific applications.     Research and development expenses were $198,536,000 in 2009,     $212,658,000 in 2008 and $197,595,000 in 2007.         The Company owns approximately 3,800 unexpired United States     patents covering articles, methods and machines. Many     counterparts of these patents have also been obtained in various     foreign countries. In addition, the Company has approximately     1,700 applications for patents pending in the United States     Patent Office, but there is no assurance that any patent will be     issued. The Company maintains an active patent department for     the administration of patents and processing of patent     applications.         The Company believes that many of its patents are valuable and     important. Nevertheless, the Company credits its leadership in     the markets it serves to engineering capability; manufacturing     techniques; skills and efficiency; marketing and sales     promotion; and service and delivery of quality products to its     customers. The expiration of any one of the Companys     patents would not have a material effect on the Companys     results of operations or financial position.     Trademarks         Many of the Companys products are sold under various owned     or licensed trademarks, which are important to the Company.     Among the most significant are: ITW, Acme, Alpine, Anaerobicos,     Angleboard, Apex, Arborite, Ark-Les, Avery Berkel, Avery     Weigh-Tronix, Bernard, Betaprint, Binks, Buehler, Buildex,     Bycotest, Chemtronics, Covid, Cullen, Deltar, Densit, Devcon,     DeVilbiss, Dymon, Dynatec, Dynatruss, Electrocal, Euromere,     Evercoat,     E-Z Anchor,     Fastex, Filtertek, Foilmark, Forte, Foster, Franklynn, Futura     Coatings, Gamko, Gema, GSE, Gymcol, Hartness, Hi-Cone, Hobart,     Instron, Intellibuild, Keps, Kester, Krafft, Lachenmeier, Lebo,     Loma, LPS, Luvex, Magna, Magnaflux, Meyercord, Miller, Mima,     Minigrip, Nexus, NorDen, Nylex, Orbitalum, Orgapack, Pacific     Polymers, Paktron, Paslode, Peerless, Permatex, Plexus,     Polymark, Polyrey, Pro/Mark, Pryda, QMI, QSA, Quipp, Racor,     Ramset, Ransburg, Red Head, Resopal, Reyflex, Riderite, Rippey,     Rockwell, Rocol, Sentinel, Shakeproof, Shore, Signode, Simco,     Solplas, Sonotech, Space Bag, Spectrum, Speedline, Spiroid,     SPIT, Spray Nine, Stero, Stokvis, Strapex, Tapcon, Teks, Tempil,     Tenax, Texwipe, Traulsen, Tregaskiss, Truswal Systems, Trymer,     Valeron, Versachem, Vitronics Soltec, Vulcan, Wachs, WERCS,     Wilsonart, Wynns and Zip-Pak.     Environmental         The Company believes that its plants and equipment are in     substantial compliance with all applicable environmental     regulations. Additional measures to maintain compliance are not     expected to materially affect the Companys capital     expenditures, competitive position, financial position or     results of operations.         Various legislative and administrative regulations concerning     environmental issues have become effective or are under     consideration in many parts of the world relating to     manufacturing processes and the sale or use of certain products.     To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse     impact on the Companys revenues or earnings. The Company     has made considerable efforts to develop and sell     environmentally compatible products.     Employees         The Company employed approximately 59,000 persons as of     December 31, 2009 and considers its employee relations to     be excellent.     International         The Companys international operations include subsidiaries     and joint ventures in 56 foreign countries on six continents.     These operations serve such end markets as construction, general     industrial, automotive, food institutional/restaurant and     service, food and beverage, electronics, consumer durables,     primary metals, and others on a worldwide basis. The     Companys revenues from sales to customers outside the     United States were approximately 57% of revenues in 2009, 58% of     revenues in 2008 and 55% of revenues in 2007.         6    Table of Contents        Refer to Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis     of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Segment     Information note in Item 8. Financial Statements and     Supplementary Data for additional information on international     activities. International operations are subject to certain     risks inherent in conducting business in foreign countries,     including price controls, exchange controls, limitations on     participation in local enterprises, nationalization,     expropriation and other governmental action, and changes in     currency exchange rates. Additional risks of our international     operations are described under Item 1A.

ITEM 1A.    Risk     Factors           The Companys business, financial condition, results of     operations and cash flows are subject to various risks,     including, but not limited to those set forth below, which could     cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or     from anticipated future results. These risk factors should be     considered together with information included elsewhere in this     Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     A     downturn or further downturn in the markets served by the     Company could materially adversely affect results.         Substantially all of the Companys businesses directly or     indirectly serve markets that were adversely impacted by the     recent global economic crisis. Although improvement is expected,     the timing of any economic recovery in the markets we serve     remains uncertain. A further downturn in one or more of our     significant markets could have a material adverse effect on the     Companys business, results of operations or financial     condition.     The     global nature of our operations subjects the Company to     political and economic risks that could adversely affect our     business, results of operations or financial     condition.         The Company currently operates in 57 countries. In 2009,     approximately 57% of the Companys revenues were generated     from sales to customers outside of the United States. As the     Company continues to expand its global footprint, these sales     may represent an increasing portion of the Companys     revenues. The risks inherent in our global operations include:                         fluctuation in currency exchange rates;                  limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings;           8    Table of Contents                        transportation delays and interruptions;                  political, social and economic instability and disruptions;                  government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions;                  the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;                  import and export controls;                  labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;                  the potential for nationalization of enterprises;                  difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;                  limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and     remedies; and                  potentially adverse tax consequences.           If the Company is unable to successfully manage these and other     risks associated with managing and expanding its international     businesses, the risks could have a material adverse effect on     the Companys business, results of operations or financial     condition.     Our     acquisition of businesses could negatively impact our     profitability and return on invested capital.         As part of our business strategy, we acquire businesses in the     ordinary course. Our acquisitions involve a number of risks and     financial, accounting, managerial and operational challenges,     including the following, any of which could adversely affect our     growth and profitability:                         Any acquired business, technology, service or product could     under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we     paid for it, or not perform in accordance with our anticipated     timetable.                  Acquisitions could cause our financial results to differ from     our expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long     term.                  Acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact     operating results, particularly in light of the adoption of the     new accounting guidance related to business combinations, which     applies to any acquisition completed in 2009 or later. Under the     new accounting guidance, we are required to expense a number of     acquisition-related items that under previous accounting rules     did not impact our income statement.                  Acquisitions could place unanticipated demands on our     management, operational resources and financial and internal     control systems.                  We may assume by acquisition unknown liabilities, known     contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities     that prove greater than anticipated. The realization of any of     these liabilities may increase our expenses or adversely affect     our financial position.                  As a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded significant     goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on our balance     sheet. If we are not able to realize the value of these assets,     we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment     of these assets.       Our     defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market     risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and     cash flows.         The performance of the financial markets and interest rates     impact our funding obligations under our defined benefit pension     plans. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases     in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan     assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact     our results of operations and cash flows.     A     significant fluctuation between the U.S. dollar and other     currencies could adversely impact our operating     income.         Although the Companys financial results are reported in     U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our sales and     operating costs are realized in other currencies, with the     largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in Europe. The     Companys profitability is affected by movements of the     U.S. dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies     in which we generate revenues and incur expenses. Significant     long-term fluctuations in          9    Table of Contents        relative currency values, in particular an increase in the value     of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, could have     an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.     Further     diminished credit availability could adversely impact our     ability to readily obtain financing.         A further deterioration in world financial markets and decreases     in credit availability could make it more difficult for us to     obtain financing when desired or cause the cost of financing to     increase.     Raw     material price increases and supply shortages could adversely     affect results.         The supply of raw materials to the Company and to its component     parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons,     including availability and pricing. Prices for raw materials     necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the     past and significant increases could adversely affect the     Companys results of operations and profit margins. Due to     pricing pressure or other factors, the Company may not be able     to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices     to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability     to do so could be delayed. Consequently, its results of     operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.     If the     Company is unable to successfully introduce new products or     adequately protect its intellectual property, its future growth     may be impaired.         The Companys ability to develop new products based on     innovation can affect its competitive position and often     requires the investment of significant resources. Difficulties     or delays in research, development or production of new products     and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new     products and technologies may reduce future revenues and     adversely affect the Companys competitive position.         Protecting the Companys intellectual property is critical     to its innovation efforts. The Company owns a number of patents,     trademarks and licenses related to its products and has     exclusive and non-exclusive rights under patents owned by     others. The Companys intellectual property may be     challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in     countries where property rights are not highly developed or     protected, or the Company may be unable to maintain, renew or     enter into new license agreements with third party owners of     intellectual property on reasonable terms. Unauthorized use of     the Companys intellectual property rights or inability to     preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely     impact the Companys competitive position and results of     operations.     An     unfavorable environment for making acquisitions may adversely     affect the Companys growth rate.         The Company has historically followed a strategy of identifying     and acquiring businesses with complementary products and     services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential     new platforms. There can be no assurance that the Company will     be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or     that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable     terms. If the Company is unsuccessful in its efforts, its growth     rate could be adversely affected.     Unfavorable     tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect     results.         The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and     in various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax     liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among     various tax jurisdictions. The Companys effective tax rate     could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings     among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in     the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws. The     amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing     audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and     by     non-U.S. authorities.     If these audits result in assessments different from amounts     recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax     adjustments.         10    Table of Contents    Potential     adverse outcome in legal proceedings may adversely affect     results.         The Companys businesses expose it to potential toxic tort     and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in     the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the     products of third-party vendors. The Company currently maintains     insurance programs consisting of self insurance up to certain     limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established     limits. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able     to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance     programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses.     In addition, the Company is subject to the risk that one or more     of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay     claims that may be made in the future. Even if it maintains     adequate insurance programs, successful claims could have a     material adverse effect on the Companys financial     condition, liquidity and results of operations and on the     ability to obtain suitable or adequate insurance in the future.

On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted new accounting     guidance related to business combinations. The new accounting     guidance requires an entity to recognize assets acquired,     liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent     consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date. This     new guidance also requires prospectively that     (1) acquisition-related costs be expensed as incurred;     (2) restructuring costs generally be recognized as     post-acquisition expenses; and (3) changes in deferred tax     asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after     the measurement period impact income tax expense. Refer to the     Acquisitions note in Item 8. Financial Statements and     Supplementary Data for discussion of the change in accounting     principle.         On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted new accounting     guidance on fair value measurements for all nonfinancial assets     and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at     fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The new accounting guidance     defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell     an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly     transaction between market participants and provides guidance     for measuring fair values and the necessary disclosures. Refer     to the Goodwill and Intangible Assets note in Item 8.     Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of     the change in accounting principle.         On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted new accounting     guidance related to defined benefit plans which required the     Company to change its measurement date to correspond with the     Companys fiscal year-end. The Company previously used a     September 30 measurement date. Refer to the Pension and Other     Postretirement Benefits note in Item 8. Financial     Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the effect     of the change in accounting principle.         On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted new accounting     guidance that addresses how a change or projected change in the     timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a     leveraged lease transaction affects the accounting by a lessor     for that lease. Refer to the Investments note in Item 8.     Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of     the change in accounting principle.         On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted new accounting     guidance that requires employers to recognize the overfunded or     underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other     postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its statement     of financial position and previously unrecognized changes in     that funded status through accumulated other comprehensive     income.

Managements     Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of     Operations       INTRODUCTION         Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the Company or     ITW) is a multinational manufacturer of a     diversified range of industrial products and equipment with     approximately 840 operations in 57 countries. These 840     businesses are internally reported as 60 operating segments to     senior management. The Companys 60 operating segments have     been aggregated into the following eight external reportable     segments: Transportation; Industrial Packaging; Food Equipment;     Power Systems & Electronics; Construction Products;     Polymers & Fluids; Decorative Surfaces; and All Other.         In August 2008, the Companys Board of Directors authorized     the divestiture of the Decorative Surfaces segment which was     subsequently classified as a discontinued operation. In May     2009, the Companys Board of Directors rescinded its     earlier resolution to divest the Decorative Surfaces segment     and, accordingly, all periods presented have been restated to     present the Decorative Surfaces segment as a continuing     operation.         Due to the large number of diverse businesses and the     Companys highly decentralized operating style, the Company     does not require its businesses to provide detailed information     on operating results. Instead, the Companys corporate     management collects data on several key measurements: operating     revenues, operating income, operating margins, overhead costs,     number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in     accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested     capital. These key measures are monitored by management and     significant changes in operating results versus current trends     in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with     operating unit management.         The results of each segment are analyzed by identifying the     effects of changes in the results of the base businesses, newly     acquired companies, restructuring costs, goodwill and intangible     impairment charges, and currency translation on the operating     revenues and operating income of each segment. Base businesses     are those businesses that have been included in the     Companys results of operations for more than     12 months. The changes to base business operating income     include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and     changes in variable margins and overhead costs. Operating     leverage is the estimated effect of the base business revenue     changes on operating income, assuming variable margins remain     the same as the prior period. As manufacturing and     administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly     change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing, the     percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage     is usually more than the percentage change in the base business     revenues.         A key element of the Companys business strategy is its     continuous 80/20 business process for both existing businesses     and new acquisitions. The basic concept of this 80/20 business     process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the     items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time     and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which     account for 20% of the value). The Companys operations use     this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key     parts of their business, and as a result, reduce complexity that     often disguises what is truly important. The Companys 840     operations utilize the 80/20 process in various aspects of their     business. Common applications of the 80/20 business process     include:                         Simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products     offered by combining the features of similar products,     outsourcing products or, as a last resort, eliminating low-value     products.                  Segmenting the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers     separately and finding alternative ways to serve the 20/80     customers.                  Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers     and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.                  Designing business processes, systems and measurements around     the 80/20 activities.           The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is     that the Company has over time improved its long-term operating     and financial performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in     restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins.     Corporate management works closely with those businesses that     have operating results below expectations to help those     businesses better apply this 80/20 business process and improve     their results.         15    Table of Contents    CONSOLIDATED     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS         The Companys consolidated results of operations for 2009,     2008 and 2007 are summarized as follows:                                                    Dollars in thousands        2009           2008           2007                    Operating revenues            $       13,877,068               $       17,100,341               $       16,110,267              Operating income                1,385,979                   2,501,286                   2,627,766              Margin %                10.0       %               14.6       %               16.3       %             In 2009 and 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and     operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the     following factors:                                                                                               2009 Compared to 2008           2008 Compared to 2007                                         % Point Increase                                    % Point Increase                  % Increase (Decrease)           (Decrease)           % Increase (Decrease)           (Decrease)                 Operating            Operating            Operating            Operating            Operating            Operating                  Revenues           Income           Margins           Revenues           Income           Margins                    Base business:                                                                                                           Revenue change/Operating leverage                (18.4       )%               (51.8       )%               (6.0       )%               (2.6       )%               (6.0       )%               (0.6       )%          Changes in variable margins and overhead costs                                   21.2                   3.8                                      (1.7       )               (0.3       )                                                                                                                           (18.4       )               (30.6       )               (2.2       )               (2.6       )               (7.7       )               (0.9       )                                                                                                                Acquisitions and divestitures                4.2                                      (0.6       )               6.0                   1.4                   (0.7       )          Restructuring costs                                   (4.1       )               (0.7       )                                  (1.0       )               (0.2       )          Impairment of goodwill and intangibles                                   (4.1       )               (0.7       )                                                                   Translation                (4.8       )               (5.8       )               (0.4       )               2.8                   2.5                                 Other                0.2                                                         (0.1       )                                  0.1                                                                                                                               (18.8       )%               (44.6       )%               (4.6       )%               6.1       %               (4.8       )%               (1.7       )%                                                                                                               Operating     Revenues         Revenues decreased 18.8% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to     lower base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency     translation, mainly due to the strengthening of the dollar,     partially offset by revenues from acquisitions.  Total base     revenues declined 18.4% in 2009 versus 2008. Base revenues     declined 21.6% and 14.9% for North American and international     businesses, respectively, as both were adversely affected by the     global recession and weak industrial production in related end     markets throughout 2009. The Company anticipates modest     expansion in a variety of worldwide end markets in 2010.         Revenues increased 6.1% in 2008 over 2007 primarily due to     revenues from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency     translation in the first three quarters of 2008, due to a     weakened dollar, partially offset by a decrease in base     revenues. During 2008, 50 businesses were acquired worldwide     with international businesses representing approximately 39% of     the annualized acquired revenues. Base revenues decreased in     2008 versus 2007 due to a 4.8% decline in North American base     revenues and flat international base revenues. North American     base businesses were adversely affected by steep declines in     macro economic trends and related weak industrial production,     and a continued decline in the construction and automotive     markets. In addition, there was a significant decrease in     international industrial production in the fourth quarter of     2008.     Operating     Income         Operating income declined 44.6% in 2009 versus 2008 due to the     decline in base revenues, the negative effect of currency     translation, increased restructuring charges and increased     goodwill and intangible          16    Table of Contents        impairment charges. In 2009, the Company recorded impairment     charges of $90.0 million and $15.6 million against     goodwill and intangibles, respectively. The goodwill and     intangible impairments were primarily related to new reporting     units which were acquired over the last few years before the     recent economic downturn. These charges were driven primarily by     lower current forecasts compared to the expected forecasts at     the time the reporting units were acquired. The higher     restructuring charges reflect the Companys efforts to     reduce costs in response to weak economic conditions.     Improvements in base variable margins and lower overhead costs     increased base margins 3.8% in 2009, as the cumulative benefits     of restructuring projects began to be realized and selling price     versus material cost comparisons were favorable. Total margins     declined by 4.6% in 2009 primarily due to the declines in base     revenues, restructuring charges and the goodwill and intangible     impairment charges.         Operating income in 2008 declined 4.8% versus 2007 due to the     decline in base revenues and increased restructuring charges,     partially offset by the positive effect of currency translation     and income from acquisitions. Total margins declined 1.7%     primarily due to the declines in base revenues and the lower     margins of acquired companies including acquisition-related     expenses, which reduced overall margins. Restructuring projects     and other cost control measures were implemented in 2008 to     better align operating businesses with declining economic     conditions, which helped keep overhead expenses favorable to     2007 and partially offset declines in variable margins.     TRANSPORTATION         Businesses in this segment produce components, fasteners, fluids     and polymers, as well as truck remanufacturing and related parts     and service.         In the Transportation segment, products and services include:                         metal and plastic components, fasteners and assemblies for     automobiles and light trucks;                  fluids and polymers for auto aftermarket maintenance and     appearance;                  fillers and putties for auto body repair;                  polyester coatings and patch and repair products for the marine     industry; and                  truck remanufacturing and related parts and service.           In 2009, this segment primarily served the automotive original     equipment manufacturers and tiers (56%) and automotive     aftermarket (28%) markets.

Acquisition revenues partially mitigated the base     revenue decrease and was primarily related to the purchase of a     North American truck remanufacturing and related parts and     service business in the third quarter of 2008. Worldwide     automotive base revenues declined 19.4% for the full year. North     American automotive base revenues declined 24.0% in 2009 due to     a decline in car builds of 32%. International automotive base     revenues declined 14.6% in 2009 due to a 24% decline in European     car builds. The automotive aftermarket businesses, which were     less impacted by the economic downturn, declined 7.8%.         Revenues increased 6.0% in 2008 over 2007 due to acquisitions     and the favorable effect of currency translation partially     offset by an 8.5% decline in base revenues. Acquisition revenue     was primarily related to the purchase of a North American truck     remanufacturing and related parts and service business and a     worldwide components business. Base revenues for the North     American automotive businesses declined 15.2% primarily due to a     16% decline in automotive production by the North American     automotive manufacturers. The decline in automotive builds was     driven by low consumer demand and existing high inventory     levels. International base automotive revenues declined 6.3% due     to unfavorable customer mix and a 3% decline in European vehicle     production. Base revenues for the automotive aftermarket     businesses in this segment increased 2.3% mainly due to strong     sales of automotive additives from North American businesses to     Chinese end markets.     Operating     Income         Operating income decreased 44.5% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily     due to the decline in base revenues described above, the     unfavorable effect of currency translation and higher     restructuring charges. In addition, a $12.0 million     goodwill impairment charge was recorded in the third quarter of     2009 related to the North American truck remanufacturing and     related parts and service business. The increase in     restructuring charges is primarily due to continued efforts to     reduce costs in response to the decline in worldwide automotive     production. Total operating margins declined by 4.4% primarily     due to the decline in base revenues described above, partially     offset by reductions in overhead expenses, favorable selling     price versus material cost comparisons and benefits of     restructuring projects.         18    Table of Contents        Operating income decreased 25.7% in 2008 versus 2007 primarily     due to the negative leverage effect of the decline in base     revenues described above, lower base margins and higher     restructuring charges partially offset by the favorable impact     of currency translation. The increase in operating expenses is     primarily due to unrecovered raw material price increases and     competitive pricing pressure. Base margins declined 3.4%     primarily due to the reduction in base revenues, start up costs     to support production at foreign-owned manufacturers operating     in North America and additional accounts receivable bad debt     reserves.     INDUSTRIAL     PACKAGING         Businesses in this segment produce steel, plastic and paper     products and equipment used for bundling, shipping and     protecting goods in transit.         In the Industrial Packaging segment, products include:                         steel and plastic strapping and related tools and equipment;                  plastic stretch film and related equipment;                  paper and plastic products that protect goods in     transit; and                  metal jacketing and other insulation products.           In 2009, this segment primarily served the general industrial     (29%), primary metals (20%), food and beverage (12%) and     construction (10%) markets.         The results of operations for the Industrial Packaging segment     for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:                                                    Dollars in thousands        2009           2008           2007                    Operating revenues            $       1,895,704               $       2,618,922               $       2,414,860              Operating income                88,755                   281,134                   301,251              Margin %                4.7       %               10.7       %               12.5       %             In 2009 and 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and     operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the     following factors:                                                                                               2009 Compared to 2008           2008 Compared to 2007                                         % Point Increase                                    % Point Increase                  % Increase (Decrease)           (Decrease)           % Increase (Decrease)           (Decrease)                 Operating            Operating            Operating            Operating            Operating            Operating                  Revenues           Income           Margins           Revenues           Income           Margins                    Base business:                                                                                                           Revenue change/Operating leverage                (22.8       )%               (86.4       )%               (8.9       )%               0.2       %               0.2       %                      %          Changes in variable margins and overhead costs                                   30.7                   4.3                                      (9.1       )               (1.1       )                                                                                                                           (22.8       )               (55.7       )               (4.6       )               0.2                   (8.9       )               (1.1       )                                                                                                                Acquisitions                1.2                   (0.2       )               (0.1       )               4.8                   2.9                   (0.2       )          Restructuring costs                                   (4.4       )               (0.6       )                                  (3.7       )               (0.5       )          Impairment of goodwill and intangibles                                                                                            0.1                                 Translation                (6.0       )               (8.1       )               (0.8       )               3.5                   2.8                                 Other                                                      0.1                                      0.1                                                                                                                                                  (27.6       )%               (68.4       )%               (6.0       )%               8.5       %               (6.7       )%               (1.8       )%                                                                                                               Operating     Revenues         Revenues decreased 27.6% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to     lower base revenues and the unfavorable impact of currency     translation. Base revenues declined 34.6% for the North American     strapping businesses largely due to declines in consumable and     equipment volume in key end markets such as primary metals,          19    Table of Contents        construction and general industrial. The international strapping     businesses declined 25.4% which were adversely affected by the     continued global decline in the industrial production and     construction end markets. Worldwide stretch and protective     packaging declined 20.0% and 4.7%, respectively.         Revenues increased 8.5% in 2008 over 2007 primarily due to     revenues from acquired companies and the favorable effect of     currency translation. The increase in acquisition revenue was     primarily due to the purchase of a European industrial packaging     business, a European stretch packaging business, a     U.S. protective packaging business and a     U.S. equipment business. Total base revenues were virtually     flat as a 1.2% and 30.9% increase related to international     strapping and worldwide insulation systems, respectively, were     offset by a 6.0% and 2.7% decrease related to North American     strapping and worldwide protective packaging, respectively.     These businesses were especially affected by weakness in the     North American primary metals and construction end markets.     Operating     Income         Operating income decreased 68.4% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily     due to the negative leverage effect of the decline in base     revenues described above, the negative effect of currency     translation and higher restructuring charges. Base margins     declined 4.6% primarily due to the decline in base revenues     discussed above, partially offset by favorable selling price     versus material cost comparisons and reduced overhead costs as     the benefits of restructuring projects began to be realized.         Operating income declined 6.7% in 2008 versus 2007 primarily due     to a decrease in base variable margins and increased     restructuring charges partially offset by income from     acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation.     The decrease in base variable margins is primarily due to     unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons and     unfavorable product mix.     FOOD     EQUIPMENT         Businesses in this segment produce commercial food equipment and     related service.

The     acquired revenues were attributable to the acquisition of a     European food equipment business. North American food equipment     base revenues declined 11.2% while international food equipment     base revenues declined 7.9% in 2009 as a result of weak demand     across all worldwide markets. Base revenues for the North     American institutional/restaurant businesses declined 14.7% as     customers delayed equipment purchases. Base service revenues     declined a moderate 1.2% as customers continued to maintain     existing equipment.         Revenues increased 10.5% in 2008 over 2007 due to revenues from     acquisitions, the favorable effect of currency translation and     base revenue growth. The acquired revenues were primarily     attributable to the acquisition of two food processing     businesses and two European food equipment businesses.     Internationally, base revenues increased 3.2% primarily due to     strong institutional and service revenue growth in Asia-Pacific     and Europe. North American base revenues were flat over 2007 as     increased service revenues and retail sales were offset by lower     demand for equipment in areas such as casual dining restaurants,     hotels and airports.     Operating     Income         Operating income declined 20.5% in 2009 versus 2008 due to the     decrease in base revenues described above and the unfavorable     effect of currency translation and restructuring charges. Base     margins decreased 0.4% primarily due to the decline in base     revenues, partially offset by margin gains from favorable     selling price versus material cost comparisons, benefits from     restructuring projects and favorable product mix.         Operating income increased 5.8% in 2008 over 2007 due to the     positive effect of leverage from the revenue increase described     above, the favorable effect of currency translation and income     from acquisitions, partially offset by higher restructuring     charges. Operating margins decreased 0.7% due to lower margins     of acquired businesses and higher restructuring charges     partially offset by margin gains from growth in base revenues.

Revenues fell as end market demand continued to     decline across the broad spectrum of industries that this     segment serves, including key end markets such as commercial     construction and general industrial. The revenue decrease was     partially offset by 2008 acquisitions, including a welding     equipment business and a PC board fabrication business.     Worldwide base welding revenues declined 32.7% in 2009. North     American welding base businesses declined 36.3% while     international welding base businesses declined 23.5%. Base     revenues for the electronics businesses fell 30.0% while base     revenues in the PC board fabrication businesses fell 44.7%, both     largely due to the decline in consumer demand for electronics     during 2009.         22    Table of Contents        Revenues increased 5.0% in 2008 over 2007 primarily due to     revenues from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency     translation. Acquisitions included a worldwide PC board     fabrication business and a welding accessories business. Overall     base revenues grew a modest 0.2% mainly due to a 19.7% growth in     international welding base businesses driven by strong demand in     the energy, heavy fabrications and ship building end markets.     North American welding base business declined 3.6% primarily due     to weak North American industrial production and falling end     market demand in key areas such as fabrication, construction,     automotive and general industrial. Base revenues for the ground     support businesses grew 4.4% related to higher worldwide demand     for both military and commercial airport products. Base revenues     for the PC board fabrication and electronics related businesses     declined 9.4% and 2.4%, respectively, due to lower worldwide     market demand, especially in consumer electronics.     Operating     Income         Operating income decreased 53.3% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily     due to the declines in base revenues described above, 2009     impairment charges, higher restructuring charges and the     negative effect of currency translation. Goodwill and intangible     asset impairment charges of $18.0 million and     $6.7 million, respectively, were incurred in the PC board     fabrication and welding accessories businesses in the first     quarter of 2009. Base margins decreased 2.7% primarily due to     the declines in base revenues, partially offset by favorable     selling price versus material cost comparisons, benefits of     restructuring projects and lower overhead costs.         Operating income increased 2.8% in 2008 over 2007 primarily due     to lower operating expenses and reduced overhead spending within     the PC board fabrication businesses as a result of 2007 and 2008     restructuring projects, and the favorable effect of currency     translation. Total operating margins decreased 0.4% primarily     due to lower margins from acquisitions after acquisition-related     expenses.     CONSTRUCTION     PRODUCTS         Businesses in this segment produce tools, fasteners and other     products for construction applications.

Base revenues for the North     American, European and Asia-Pacific regions decreased 26.7%,     22.9% and 1.1%, respectively, primarily due to ongoing weakness     in the residential and commercial construction markets in North     America and Europe. U.S. housing starts declined 14% on an     annualized basis in 2009. In addition, U.S. commercial     construction square footage activity fell 46% for the year     versus 2008. The Asia-Pacific region outperformed other regions     largely due to better customer activity in Australia and New     Zealand.         Revenues declined 3.6% in 2008 versus 2007 largely as a result     of a 7.3% decline in base business partially offset by the     favorable effect of currency translation. Base revenues for the     North American and European businesses declined 14.6% and 7.0%,     respectively, in 2008 while revenues for the Asia-Pacific region     increased 4.4% on strong first half 2008 market demand and new     product introductions. This decline in base revenues was a     result of weakness in the residential and commercial     construction markets in North America and Europe as indicated by     a 31% and 19% decline in U.S. housing starts and commercial     construction square footage activity, respectively, in 2008.     European construction activity slowed substantially in the     fourth quarter of 2008.     Operating     Income         Operating income decreased 60.0% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily     due to the base revenue decline described above. In addition,     the unfavorable effect of currency translation and higher     restructuring charges contributed to the lower income and     margins. Base margins declined 4.3% as reduced operating     expenses, including favorable selling price versus material cost     comparisons and benefits from restructuring projects were more     than offset by the effect of lower base revenues.         Operating income and margins decreased 15.3% and 1.7%,     respectively, in 2008 versus 2007 primarily due to the revenue     decline described above partially offset by the favorable effect     of currency translation, lower restructuring charges and lower     operating costs resulting from prior year restructuring projects     and tight cost controls.         24    Table of Contents    POLYMERS &     FLUIDS         Businesses in this segment produce adhesives, sealants,     lubrication and cutting fluids and hygiene products.

Acquisition     revenue was primarily the result of the purchase of a pressure     sensitive adhesives business and two construction adhesives     businesses in 2008. Total base revenues declined 12.4% primarily     due to continued weakness in worldwide industrial production and     construction end markets. Worldwide base revenues for the fluids     businesses declined 10.1% while base revenues for the polymers     businesses declined 15.0% in 2009.         Revenues increased 32.3% in 2008 over 2007 primarily due to     revenues from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency     translation. Acquisition revenue was primarily the result of the     purchase of two pressure          25    Table of Contents        sensitive adhesives businesses, an international fluid products     business, two polymers businesses, two North American     construction adhesives businesses and a South American sealant     business. Total base revenues were essentially flat as a 2.2%     increase in worldwide polymers revenues was offset by a 3.6%     decline in worldwide fluids revenues. Strong growth in North     American polymers and industrial adhesives businesses, as well     as increased demand in Brazil, India and China, was offset by     substantially weaker demand for fluid products in North American     and European industrial based end markets.     Operating     Income         Operating income decreased 60.9% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily     due to the decline in base revenues and a $60.0 million     goodwill impairment charge against the pressure sensitive     adhesives business in the first quarter of 2009. Base margins     decreased 0.2% as favorable selling price versus material cost     comparisons and the benefits of restructuring projects were more     than offset by the effect of lower base revenues. The first     quarter 2009 goodwill impairment charge reduced margins by 5.5%.     Additionally, acquisitions diluted margins 1.2% for the year.         Operating income increased 13.4% in 2008 over 2007 primarily due     to income from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency     translation. Total operating margins declined 2.4% primarily due     to the dilutive effect of the lower margins of acquired     businesses. Variable margins decreased slightly due to higher     material costs and unfavorable product mix, offset by overhead     cost reductions.

North American laminate base revenues declined 18.9% as a result     of the continued downturn in North American commercial and     residential construction. These declines were partially offset     by product penetration in the premium high-definition laminate     product market. International base revenues declined 9.7% due to     European volume declines.         Revenues declined 0.7% in 2008 versus 2007 due to the decline in     base revenues partially offset by the favorable effect of     currency translation. North American laminate revenues decreased     3.4% as a result of laminate volume drop off in the second half     of 2008 partially offset by a customer shift to higher priced     premium products. Flooring revenues decreased 28.3% on steep     volume declines. International laminate revenues decreased 2.0%     over the prior year as new product introductions partially     offset lower volumes.     Operating     Income         Operating income decreased 20.2% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily     due to the decline in base revenues, increased restructuring     charges and the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Base     margins increased 0.4% primarily due to favorable selling price     versus material cost comparisons, benefits from restructuring     projects and higher margins on the high-definition laminate     product, partially offset by the effect of lower base revenues.         Operating income decreased 11.4% in 2008 versus 2007 primarily     due to the negative leverage effect of the decline in base     revenues described above. Lower selling expenses in 2008 versus     2007 were more than offset by significant raw material increases     which contributed to an overall reduction in variable margins.     Base margins declined 1.2% due to both the revenue decline and     cost increases.     ALL     OTHER         This segment includes all other operating segments.

The acquisition revenue was     primarily related to the purchase of two test and measurement     businesses in 2008. Base revenues declined 15.7%, 12.1%, 19.6%     and 32.0%, for the test and measurement, consumer packaging,     industrial plastics and metals and finishing businesses,     respectively, due to negative industrial production trends and     the related impact of weak end market and capital equipment     demand across the broad spectrum of industries this segment     serves.         28    Table of Contents        Revenues increased 4.0% in 2008 versus 2007 primarily due to     revenues from acquired companies and the favorable effect of     currency translation partially offset by a decline in base     revenues. The increase in acquisition revenue was primarily due     to the purchase of three test and measurement businesses and a     label business. Base revenues declined 7.8%, 3.2% and 3.0% for     the industrial plastics and metals, consumer packaging and     finishing businesses, respectively, due to a notable decrease in     end market demand in the second half of the year. These     decreases were partially offset by an 8.0% base business     increase in test and measurement due to strong sales of     equipment used in the materials and structural testing markets,     particularly in Asia.     Operating     Income         Operating income declined 34.0% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily     due to the decline in base revenues described above, higher     restructuring charges and the unfavorable effect of currency     translation, partially offset by increased income from     acquisitions. Base margins decreased 1.9% as favorable selling     price versus material cost comparisons and benefits from     restructuring projects were more than offset by the effect of     lower base revenues. Additionally, acquisitions diluted total     margins by 0.8%.         Operating income was essentially flat in 2008 over 2007     primarily due to the negative leverage effect of the decrease in     revenues described above, partially offset by the favorable     effect of currency translation and income from acquired     companies. Total operating margins declined 0.7% primarily due     to lower margins for both base business and acquired businesses.     Base operating margins decreased 0.2% as the gains from tight     cost controls and the benefits of prior year restructuring     projects were offset by the impact of lower revenues.     AMORTIZATION     OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS         Amortization expense increased to $203.2 million in 2009     and $184.4 million in 2008, versus $145.7 million in     2007, due to intangible amortization related to newly acquired     businesses.     IMPAIRMENT     OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS         Total goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges by     segment for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and     2007 were as follows:                                                    In Thousands        2009           2008           2007                    Transportation            $       14,414               $       13               $       258              Industrial Packaging                386                                                    Food Equipment                46                                                    Power Systems & Electronics                28,337                   824                                 Construction Products                                                      394              Polymers & Fluids                60,416                   251                   884              All Other                1,969                   487                   618                                                                           $       105,568               $       1,575               $       2,154                                                                       Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets increased to     $105.6 million in 2009 versus $1.6 million in 2008,     primarily due to goodwill impairment charges related to the     pressure sensitive adhesives reporting unit of     $60.0 million, the PC board fabrication reporting unit of     $18.0 million and the truck remanufacturing and related     parts and service reporting unit of $12.0 million.     Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets was     $1.6 million in 2008 versus $2.2 million in 2007. See     the Goodwill and Intangible Assets note in Item 8.     Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details     of the impairment charges.         29    Table of Contents      INTEREST     EXPENSE         Interest expense increased to $164.8 million in 2009 versus     $154.5 million in 2008 primarily due to interest on the     6.25% and 5.15% notes which were issued in March 2009,     partially offset by lower interest related to the     5.75% notes and 6.875% notes repaid at maturity in     March 2009 and November 2008, respectively, and lower commercial     paper rates and borrowings. Interest expense increased to     $154.5 million in 2008 versus $102.1 million in 2007     primarily as a result of interest expense on the 5.25% Euro     notes issued in October 2007 and higher average borrowings of     short-term commercial paper, partially offset by lower market     rates in 2008. The weighted-average interest rate on commercial     paper was 0.3% in 2009, 2.4% in 2008 and 5.2% in 2007.     OTHER     INCOME (EXPENSE)         Other income (expense) was expense of $7.4 million in 2009     versus income of $4.7 million in 2008. The decrease was     primarily due to 2009 losses on foreign currency transactions of     $24.9 million, lower income from investments of     $4.9 million (versus $17.0 million in 2008) and     lower interest income of $17.6 million (versus     $29.4 million in 2008), partially offset by the impact of     the German transfer tax charge of $44.0 million in 2008.         Other income decreased to $4.7 million in 2008 from     $58.3 million in 2007, primarily due to a German transfer     tax charge of $44.0 million in 2008. Additionally, income     from a venture capital limited partnership was $0.2 million     in 2008 versus income of $25.3 million in 2007 related to     mark-to-market     adjustments; and the Company incurred a charge of     $18.8 million related to the timing of tax deductions of     leveraged leases in 2008. This was partially offset by higher     income of $10.7 million related to a mortgage-backed     security and a $9.4 million increase in interest income.     INCOME     TAXES         The effective tax rate was 20.1% in 2009, 28.1% in 2008 and     29.3% in 2007. The effective tax rate for 2009 was favorably     impacted by discrete tax adjustments in the fourth quarter of     $85.5 million related to a global legal structure     reorganization and $77.5 million related to a favorable     settlement reached with the German tax authorities. In the above     mentioned reorganization, the Company reorganized its ownership     structure in certain U.S. and foreign subsidiaries in the fourth     quarter of 2009 and made an election regarding the U.S. tax     treatment of a foreign subsidiary. The Company recorded a     reduction in tax expense primarily for the effect of the     resulting foreign tax credits. Also during the fourth quarter of     2009, the Company finalized a settlement with the German tax     authorities primarily regarding the treatment of an intercompany     financing transaction which resulted in the reversal of     previously established tax reserves as a reduction of tax     expense.         See the Income Taxes note in Item 8. Financial Statements and     Supplementary Data for a reconciliation of the U.S. Federal     statutory rate to the effective tax rate.     INCOME     FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS         Income from continuing operations in 2009 of $969.5 million     ($1.93 per diluted share) was 42.7% lower than 2008 income of     $1.7 billion ($3.24 per diluted share). Income from     continuing operations in 2008 was 7.5% lower than 2007 income of     $1.8 billion ($3.29 per diluted share).     FOREIGN     CURRENCY         The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign     currencies decreased operating revenues by approximately     $653 million in 2009 and decreased income from continuing     operations by approximately 10 cents per diluted share. The     weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies     increased operating revenues by approximately $425 million     in 2008 and increased income from continuing operations by     approximately 8 cents per diluted share.     DISCONTINUED     OPERATIONS         Loss from discontinued operations was $22.5 million in 2009     versus $172.1 million in 2008, primarily due to 2008     impairment on goodwill of $132.6 million, loss reserve on     assets held for sale of $64.0 million partially offset by     gains on sales of discontinued operations in 2008 versus losses     in 2009. The results from discontinued          30    Table of Contents        operations was a loss of $172.1 million in 2008 versus     income of $42.2 million in 2007. See the Discontinued     Operations note in Item 8. Financial Statements and     Supplementary Data for further information.     NEW     ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS         In October 2009, new accounting guidance was issued on     multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. The new accounting     guidance amends the accounting for multiple-deliverable     arrangements to enable the vendor to account for products or     services separately rather than as a combined unit. The guidance     establishes a hierarchy for determining the selling price of a     deliverable, which is based on: (1) vendor-specific     objective evidence, (2) third-party evidence or     (3) estimates. The Company will adopt the new accounting     guidance on January 1, 2011 and does not anticipate the     change will materially affect the Companys financial     position or results of operations.     LIQUIDITY     AND CAPITAL RESOURCES         The Companys primary sources of liquidity are free     operating cash flows and short-term credit facilities.     Management continues to believe that internally generated cash     flows will be adequate to service debt, continue to pay     dividends, to finance internal growth and to fund small to     medium-sized acquisitions.         The primary uses of liquidity are:                         dividend payments  the Companys dividend payout     guidelines are 25% to 35% of the last two years average     income from continuing operations;                  acquisitions; and                  any excess liquidity may be used for share repurchases. The     Companys open-ended share repurchase program allows it     flexibility in achieving the targeted     debt-to-capital     ratio.       Cash     Flow         The Company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow     generated by operations that is available for dividends,     acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. Free     operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net     cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash     flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures     used by other companies.         Summarized cash flow information for the three years ended     December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was as follows:                                                    In Thousands        2009           2008           2007                    Net cash provided by operating activities            $       2,146,589               $       2,222,224               $       2,484,297              Additions to plant and equipment                (247,102       )               (362,312       )               (353,355       )                                                                Free operating cash flow            $       1,899,487               $       1,859,912               $       2,130,942                                                                    Cash dividends paid            $       (619,681       )           $       (598,690       )           $       (502,430       )          Acquisitions                (281,674       )               (1,546,982       )               (812,757       )          Repurchases of common stock                                   (1,390,594       )               (1,757,761       )          Purchases of investments                (17,586       )               (19,583       )               (28,734       )          Proceeds from investments                20,215                   26,932                   91,184              Net proceeds (repayments) of debt                (736,470       )               1,467,613                   777,386              Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and equivalents                183,722                   (82,002       )               66,996              Other                127,809                   198,820                   272,491                                                                    Net increase (decrease) in cash and equivalents            $       575,822               $       (84,574       )           $       237,317                                                                       On August 20, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors     authorized a stock repurchase program, which provides for the     buyback of up to $3.0 billion of the Companys common     stock over an open-ended period          31    Table of Contents        of time. Through December 31, 2009, the Company repurchased     39.8 million shares of its common stock under this program     at an average price of $44.72 per share. There are approximately     $1.2 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under this     program.         On August 4, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors     authorized a stock repurchase program which provided for the     buyback of up to 35.0 million shares. This stock repurchase     program was completed in November 2007.     Return     on Average Invested Capital         The Company uses return on average invested capital     (ROIC) to measure the effectiveness of its     operations use of invested capital to generate profits. We     believe that ROIC is a meaningful metric to investors and may be     different than the method used by other companies to calculate     ROIC. ROIC for the three years ended December 31, 2009,     2008 and 2007 was as follows:                                                    Dollars in thousands        2009           2008           2007                    Operating income            $       1,385,979               $       2,501,286               $       2,627,766              Taxes (20.1%, 28.1% and 29.3%, respectively)                (278,998       )               (702,611       )               (769,147       )                                                                Operating income after taxes            $       1,106,981               $       1,798,675               $       1,858,619                                                                    Invested Capital:                                                           Trade receivables            $       2,491,492               $       2,571,987               $       2,915,546              Inventories                1,356,233                   1,774,697                   1,625,820              Net plant and equipment                2,136,527                   2,109,432                   2,194,010              Investments                451,293                   465,894                   507,567              Goodwill and intangible assets                6,584,149                   6,297,219                   5,683,341              Accounts payable and accrued expenses                (2,048,966       )               (1,999,097       )               (2,190,121       )          Net assets held for sale                                   61,525                   137,685              Other, net                (343,069       )               (667,660       )               (43,790       )                                                                Total invested capital            $       10,627,659               $       10,613,997               $       10,830,058                                                                    Average invested capital            $       10,390,424               $       11,235,625               $       10,331,512                                                                    Return on average invested capital                10.7       %               16.0       %               18.0       %                                                                   The 530 basis point decrease in ROIC in 2009 versus 2008     was the result of after-tax operating income decreasing 38.5%,     resulting from the economic downturn, while average invested     capital decreased 7.5%.         The 200 basis point decrease in ROIC in 2008 versus 2007     was the result of average invested capital increasing 8.8%,     primarily due to acquisitions, while after-tax operating income     decreased 3.2%, primarily due to a decrease in base business     operating income.         32    Table of Contents    Working     Capital         Net working capital at December 31, 2009 and 2008 is     summarized as follows:                                                                                   Increase           Dollars in thousands        2009           2008           (Decrease)                    Current Assets:                                                           Cash and equivalents            $       1,318,772               $       742,950               $       575,822              Trade receivables                2,491,492                   2,571,987                   (80,495       )          Inventories                1,356,233                   1,774,697                   (418,464       )          Other                508,098                   582,274                   (74,176       )          Assets held for sale                                   82,071                   (82,071       )                                                                           5,674,595                   5,753,979                   (79,384       )                                                                Current Liabilities:                                                           Short-term debt                213,681                   2,433,973                   (2,220,292       )          Accounts payable and accrued expenses                2,048,966                   1,999,097                   49,869              Other                572,991                   371,477                   201,514              Liabilities held for sale                                   20,546                   (20,546       )                                                                           2,835,638                   4,825,093                   (1,989,455       )                                                                Net Working Capital            $       2,838,957               $       928,886               $       1,910,071                                                                    Current Ratio                2.00                   1.19                                                                                       Net working capital increased primarily due to the pay down of     commercial paper and repayment of the 5.75% notes.     Debt         Total debt at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was as follows:                                                                                   Increase           Dollars in thousands        2009           2008           (Decrease)                    Short-term debt            $       213,681               $       2,433,973               $       (2,220,292       )          Long-term debt                2,914,874                   1,247,883                   1,666,991                                                                    Total debt            $       3,128,555               $       3,681,856               $       (553,301       )                                                                Total debt to total capitalization                26.2       %               32.4       %                                                                                   The Company issues commercial paper to fund general corporate     needs and to fund small and medium-sized acquisitions. As of     December 31, 2009, the Company had approximately     $135.5 million outstanding under its commercial paper     program. The Company also has committed lines of credit of     $2.5 billion in the U.S. to support the issuances of     commercial paper. Of this amount, $2.0 billion is provided     under a line of credit agreement with a termination date of     June 11, 2010 and the remaining $500.0 million is     under a revolving credit facility that terminates on     June 15, 2012. No amounts are outstanding under these two     facilities. The Companys foreign operations also have     unused capacity on uncommitted facilities of approximately     $370 million.         The Company had $500.0 million of 5.75% redeemable notes     due March 1, 2009, which were outstanding at     December 31, 2008, that were repaid at maturity.         In 2009, the Company issued $800.0 million of 5.15%     redeemable notes due April 1, 2014 at 99.92% of face value     and $700.0 million of 6.25% redeemable notes due     April 1, 2019 at 99.98% of face value. The net proceeds     from the offering were used to pay down the Companys     commercial paper balance.         33    Table of Contents        The Company believes that based on its current free operating     cash flow,     debt-to-capitalization     ratios and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional     financing if necessary. The Companys targeted     debt-to-capital     ratio is 20% to 30%, excluding the impact of any larger     acquisitions.     Stockholders     Equity         The changes to stockholders equity during 2009 and 2008     were as follows:                                        In Thousands        2009           2008                    Beginning balance            $       7,675,091               $       9,358,231              Net income                947,009                   1,519,003              Cash dividends declared                (620,679       )               (604,988       )          Repurchases of common stock                                   (1,390,594       )          Stock option and restricted stock activity                168,111                   105,514              Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments, net of tax                (62,271       )               (432,618       )          Noncontrolling interest                (4,538       )               4,710              Currency translation adjustments                716,208                   (874,952       )          Cumulative effect of adopting new accounting guidance, net of tax                (1,055       )               (9,215       )                                                Ending balance            $       8,817,876               $       7,675,091                                                   CONTRACTUAL     OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS         The Companys significant contractual obligations as of     December 31, 2009 were as follows:                                                                                                                                                           2015 and           In Thousands        2010           2011           2012           2013           2014           Future Years                    Total debt            $       8,120               $       258,475               $       7,076               $       6,193               $       1,929,012               $       714,118              Interest payments on notes and preferred debt securities                161,805                   161,526                   144,890                   144,651                   113,986                   197,988              Minimum lease payments                150,881                   106,430                   75,920                   56,747                   43,864                   68,249                                                                                                                           $       320,806               $       526,431               $       227,886               $       207,591               $       2,086,862               $       980,355                                                                                                                       The Company has recorded current income taxes payable of     $417.3 million and non-current tax liabilities of     $198.0 million including liabilities for unrecognized tax     benefits. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the     timing of payments related to the non-current tax obligations.         The Company has provided guarantees related to the debt of     certain unconsolidated affiliates of $24.0 million at     December 31, 2009. In the event one of these affiliates     defaults on its debt, the Company would be liable for the debt     repayment. The Company has recorded liabilities related to these     guarantees of $17.0 million at December 31, 2009. At     December 31, 2009, the Company had open stand-by letters of     credit of $173.0 million, substantially all of which expire     in 2010. The Company had no other significant off-balance sheet     commitments at December 31, 2009.     CRITICAL     ACCOUNTING POLICIES         The Company has six accounting policies which it believes are     most important to the Companys financial condition and     results of operations, and which require the Company to make     estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.     Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on     various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the     circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making     judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities     that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results     may differ from these estimates.         34    Table of Contents        These critical accounting policies are as follows:     Realizability of Inventories      Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.     Generally, the Companys businesses perform an analysis of     the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on     hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to     market value based on the following usage criteria:                                  Usage Classification         Criteria        Reserve %                Active            Quantity on hand is less than prior 6 months usage               0       %          Slow-moving            Some usage in last 12 months, but quantity on hand exceeds     prior 6 months usage               50       %          Obsolete            No usage in the last 12 months               90       %             In addition, for approximately half of the U.S. operations,     the Company has elected to use the     last-in,     first-out (LIFO) method of inventory costing.     Generally, this method results in a lower inventory value than     the     first-in,     first-out (FIFO) method due to the effects of     inflation.     Collectibility of Accounts Receivable      The Company estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts     based on the greater of a specific reserve or a reserve     calculated based on the historical write-off percentage over the     last two years. In addition, the allowance for uncollectible     accounts includes reserves for customer credits and cash     discounts, which are also estimated based on past experience.     Depreciation of Plant and Equipment      The Companys U.S. businesses compute depreciation on     an accelerated basis, as follows:                           Buildings and improvements            150% declining balance          Machinery and equipment            200% declining balance             The majority of the international businesses compute     depreciation on a straight-line basis to conform to their local     statutory accounting and tax regulations.     Income Taxes  The Company provides     deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the     estimated future tax effects of differences between the     financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on     currently enacted tax laws. The Companys deferred and     other tax balances are based on managements interpretation     of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing     jurisdictions. Income tax expense and liabilities recognized by     the Company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions     regarding, among other things, the level of future taxable     income and effect of the Companys various tax planning     strategies. Future tax authority rulings and changes in tax     laws, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future     tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax     rate and tax balances recorded by the Company.     Goodwill and Intangible Assets  The     Companys business acquisitions typically result in     recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the     amount of amortization expense and possibly impairment expense     that the Company will incur in future periods. The Company     follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to     test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. On an annual     basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the     Company compares the estimated fair value of its 60 reporting     units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine     if a goodwill impairment exists. If the fair value of a     reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment     loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied     fair value and the carrying value of the reporting units     goodwill. In calculating the fair value of the reporting units,     management relies on a number of factors, including operating     results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated     future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market     data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors     and managements judgment in applying them in the     impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets.         In the third quarter of 2009, the Company changed the date of     its annual goodwill impairment assessment from the first quarter     to the third quarter. This constitutes a change in method of     applying an accounting principle that the Company believes is     preferable. The change was made to better align the timing of     the          35    Table of Contents        Companys goodwill impairment assessment with the     Companys annual business planning and forecasting process.         As of December 31, 2009, the Company had goodwill and     intangible assets of $6.6 billion allocated to its 60     reporting units. The Companys risk of significant     impairment charges is mitigated by the number of diversified     businesses and end markets represented by its 60 reporting     units. In addition, the individual businesses in most of its     reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time,     and therefore have been able to improve their performance,     primarily as a result of the application of the Companys     80/20 business simplification process. The amount of goodwill     and intangibles allocated to individual reporting units range     from approximately $5 million to $700 million, with     the average amount equal to $110 million.         Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges related to     continuing operations were $105.6 million in 2009,     $1.6 million in 2008 and $2.2 million in 2007. The     impairment charges during 2009 were primarily related to new     reporting units which were acquired over the last few years     before the recent economic downturn. These charges were driven     primarily by lower current forecasts compared to the expected     forecasts at the time the reporting units were acquired. See the     Goodwill and Intangible Assets note in Item 8. Financial     Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion of the     relative carrying values and fair values of the reporting units     related to these impairment charges.         Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are     sensitive to changes in the factors described above. Due to the     inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and     economic conditions in the Companys global end markets,     impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could     occur in future periods.     Pension and Other Postretirement     Benefits  The Company has various     company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a     substantial portion of U.S. employees and many employees     outside the United States. Pension and other postretirement     expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial     valuations. Pension benefit obligations are generally based on     each participants years of service, future compensation,     and age at retirement or termination. Important assumptions in     determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations     are the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan     assets and healthcare cost trend rates. See the Pension and     Other Postretirement Benefits note in Item 8. Financial     Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion of     actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and     postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.         The Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan     liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the     U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans. The discount     rate reflects the current rate at which the associated     liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the     end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company looks at     rates of return on high-quality fixed income investments, with     similar duration to the liabilities in the plan. A 25 basis     point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present     value of the U.S. primary pension plan obligation by     approximately $30 million.         The expected long-term return on plan assets is based on     historical and expected long-term returns for similar investment     allocations among asset classes. For the U.S. primary     pension plan, the Companys assumption for the expected     return on plan assets was 8.5% for 2009 and will be 8.0% for     2010. A 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on     plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by     approximately $3 million. See the Pension and Other     Postretirement Benefits note in Item 8. Financial     Statements and Supplementary Data for information on how this     rate is determined.         36    Table of Contents              ITEM 7A.    Quantitative     and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       MARKET     RISK     Interest     Rate Risk         The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in     interest rates relates primarily to the Companys debt.         The Company had commercial paper outstanding of     $135.5 million and $1.8 billion as of     December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The weighted     average interest rate on commercial paper was 0.1% at     December 31, 2009 and 1.4% at December 31, 2008.

In general, the Companys products are primarily     manufactured and sold within the same country. The initial     funding for the foreign manufacturing operations was provided     primarily through the permanent investment of equity capital     from the U.S. parent company. Therefore, the Company and     its subsidiaries do not have significant assets or liabilities     denominated in currencies other than their functional     currencies. As such, the Company does not have any significant     derivatives or other financial instruments that are subject to     foreign currency risk at December 31, 2009 or 2008.         In October 2007, the Company issued 750.0 million of     5.25% Euro notes due October 1, 2014. The Company has     significant operations with the Euro as their functional     currency. The Company believes that the Euro cash flows from     these businesses will be adequate to fund the debt obligations     under these notes.         37    Table of Contents              ITEM 8.    Financial     Statements and Supplementary Data         MANAGEMENT     REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING         The management of Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the     Company or ITW) is responsible for     establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over     financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act     Rule 13a-15(f).     ITWs internal control system was designed to provide     reasonable assurance to the Companys management and Board     of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of     published financial statements.         All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have     inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined     to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with     respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.         ITW management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys     internal control over financial reporting as of     December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, it used the     criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations     of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal     Control  Integrated Framework. Based on our     assessment we believe that, as of December 31, 2009, the     Companys internal control over financial reporting is     effective based on those criteria.         The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over     financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been     audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent     registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report     herein.                       /s/  David     B. Speer        /s/  Ronald     D. Kropp      David B. Speer        Ronald D. Kropp     Chairman & Chief Executive Officer     February 26, 2010       Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer     February 26, 2010             38    Table of Contents        REPORT OF     INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM         To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Illinois Tool     Works Inc.:         We have audited the accompanying statement of financial position     of Illinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries (the     Company) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and     the related statements of income, income reinvested in the     business, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the     three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. We also     have audited the Companys internal control over financial     reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria     established in Internal Control  Integrated     Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring     Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys     management is responsible for these financial statements, for     maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,     and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control     over financial reporting, included in the accompanying     management report on internal control over financial reporting.     Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial     statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control     over financial reporting based on our audits.         We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the     Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those     standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain     reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are     free of material misstatement and whether effective internal     control over financial reporting was maintained in all material     respects. Our audits of the financial statements included     examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and     disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the     accounting principles used and significant estimates made by     management, and evaluating the overall financial statement     presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial     reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal     control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a     material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design     and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the     assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other     procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We     believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our     opinions.         A companys internal control over financial reporting is a     process designed by, or under the supervision of, the     companys principal executive and principal financial     officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected     by the companys board of directors, management, and other     personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the     reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of     financial statements for external purposes in accordance with     generally accepted accounting principles. A companys     internal control over financial reporting includes those     policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance     of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly     reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the     company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions     are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial     statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting     principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company     are being made only in accordance with authorizations of     management and directors of the company; and (3) provide     reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of     unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the     companys assets that could have a material effect on the     financial statements.         Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over     financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or     improper management override of controls, material misstatements     due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a     timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the     effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting     to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may     become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the     degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may     deteriorate.         In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above     present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position     of Illinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries as of     December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their     operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in     the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with     accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of     America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all     material respects, effective internal control over financial     reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria     established in Internal Control  Integrated     Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring     Organizations of the Treadway Commission.     /s/  Deloitte &     Touche LLP       Deloitte & Touche LLP

(the Company or     ITW) is a multinational manufacturer of a     diversified range of industrial products and equipment with     approximately 840 operations in 57 countries. The Company     primarily serves the construction, general industrial,     automotive and food institutional/restaurant markets.     Significant Accounting Policies           Significant accounting principles and policies of the Company     are in italics. Certain reclassifications of prior years     data have been made to conform to current year reporting.          The preparation of the Companys financial statements in     conformity with generally accepted accounting principles     requires management to make estimates and assumptions that     affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the     notes to financial statements. Actual results could differ from     those estimates. The significant estimates included in the     preparation of the financial statements are related to     inventories, trade receivables, plant and equipment, income     taxes, goodwill and intangible assets, product liability     matters, litigation, product warranties, pensions, other     postretirement benefits, environmental matters and stock options.     Consolidation and Translation       Consolidation and Translation  The     financial statements include the Company and substantially all     of its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany     transactions are eliminated from the financial statements.     Substantially all of the Companys foreign subsidiaries     outside North America have November 30 fiscal year-ends to     facilitate inclusion of their financial statements in the     December 31 consolidated financial statements.     Foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities are     translated to U.S. dollars at     end-of-period     exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at average     rates for the period. Translation adjustments are reported as a     component of accumulated other comprehensive income in     stockholders equity.     Discontinued Operations       Discontinued Operations  The Company     periodically reviews its 840 operations for businesses which may     no longer be aligned with its long-term objectives. In August     2008, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the     divestiture of the Click Commerce industrial software business     which was previously reported in the All Other segment. In the     second quarter of 2009, the Company completed the sale of the     Click Commerce business.         In 2007, the Company divested an automotive machinery business     and a consumer packaging business. In the fourth quarter of     2007, the Company classified an automotive components business     and a second consumer packaging business as held for sale. The     consumer packaging business was sold in 2008. The Company     completed the sale of the automotive components business in the     third quarter of 2009.         In May 2009, the Companys Board of Directors rescinded a     resolution from August 2008 to divest the Decorative Surfaces     segment. The consolidated financial statements and related notes     for all periods have been restated to present the results     related to the Decorative Surfaces segment as continuing     operations.         Results of the discontinued operations for the years ended     December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:                                                    In Thousands        2009           2008           2007                    Operating revenues            $       26,498               $       117,553               $       168,597                                                                    Income (loss) before taxes            $       (33,678       )           $       (171,629       )           $       35,928              Income tax (expense) benefit                11,197                   (461       )               6,243                                                                    Income (loss) from discontinued operations            $       (22,481       )           $       (172,090       )           $       42,171                                                                       In 2009, income (loss) before taxes includes losses on disposals     of $27,665,000 on the Click Commerce and automotive components     businesses.         44    Table of Contents      Notes to     Financial Statements  (Continued)          In 2008, income (loss) before taxes includes goodwill impairment     charges of $132,563,000 related to the Click Commerce business     and losses on anticipated sale of $64,000,000 related to the     Click Commerce and the automotive components businesses.

On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted new accounting     guidance related to business combinations. The new accounting     guidance requires an entity to recognize assets acquired,     liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent     consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date. The     new guidance also requires prospectively that     (1) acquisition-related costs be expensed as incurred;     (2) restructuring costs generally be recognized as a     post-acquisition expense; and (3) changes in deferred tax     asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after     the measurement period impact income tax expense. Upon adoption     of the new guidance, the Company recorded an after-tax charge to     equity of $1,055,000.     Operating Revenues       Operating Revenues are recognized when the risks and     rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, which     is generally at the time of product shipment.

The Company settled several items during 2009 related to its     German and U.S. tax audits. The most significant of which     related to a financing transaction, leveraged leases and     mortgage-backed securities.         The Company is litigating its dispute with the Australian Tax     Office over the treatment of an intercompany financing     transaction between the U.S. and Australia. The Company has     recorded its best estimate of the exposure for this audit;     however, it is reasonably possible that the Company will resolve     the Australian          49    Table of Contents      Notes to     Financial Statements  (Continued)          financing issue within the next 12 months and that the     amount of the Companys unrecognized tax benefits may     decrease by approximately $159,000,000.         The Company files numerous consolidated and separate tax returns     in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction and in many state and     foreign jurisdictions.

The accrual for interest and     penalties as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $45,000,000     and $7,000,000, respectively.     Income from Continuing Operations Per Share       Income from Continuing Operations Per Share is     computed by dividing income from continuing operations by the     weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period.     Income from continuing operations per diluted share is computed     by dividing income from continuing operations by the     weighted-average number of shares assuming dilution for stock     options and restricted stock. Dilutive shares reflect the     potential additional shares that would be outstanding if the     dilutive stock options outstanding were exercised and the     unvested restricted stock vested during the period. The     computation of income from continuing operations per share was     as follows:                                                    In Thousands except per share amounts        2009           2008           2007                    Income from continuing operations            $       969,490               $       1,691,093               $       1,827,691                                                                    Income from continuing operations per share  Basic:                                                           Weighted-average common shares                500,177                   518,609                   551,549                                                                    Income from continuing operations per share  Basic            $       1.94               $       3.26               $       3.31                                                                    Income from continuing operations per share  Diluted:                                                           Weighted-average common shares                500,177                   518,609                   551,549              Effect of dilutive stock options and restricted stock                1,744                   2,604                   4,481                                                                    Weighted-average common shares assuming dilution                501,921                   521,213                   556,030                                                                    Income from continuing operations per share  Diluted            $       1.93               $       3.24               $       3.29                                                                   Options that were considered antidilutive were not included     in the computation of diluted income from continuing operations     per share.

The     last-in,     first-out (LIFO) method is used to determine the     cost of the inventories of approximately half of the     U.S. operations. Inventories priced at LIFO were 22%     and 25% of total inventories as of December 31, 2009 and     2008, respectively. The     first-in,     first-out (FIFO) method, which approximates current     cost, is used for all other inventories. If the FIFO method     was used for all inventories, total inventories would have been     approximately $115,090,000 and $159,721,000 higher than reported     at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Renewals and improvements that     increase the useful life of plant and equipment are capitalized.     Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.         Depreciation was $365,372,000 in 2009, $366,711,000 in 2008 and     $359,076,000 in 2007, and was reflected primarily in cost of     revenues. Discontinued operations depreciation was $755,000 in     2009, $904,000 in 2008 and $4,625,000 in 2007 and was reflected     in income (loss) from discontinued operations. Depreciation     of plant and equipment for financial reporting purposes is     computed on an accelerated basis for U.S. businesses and on     a straight-line basis for a majority of the international     businesses.         51    Table of Contents      Notes to     Financial Statements  (Continued)          The range of useful lives used to depreciate plant and equipment     is as follows:                           Buildings and improvements            10  50 years          Machinery and equipment            3  20 years          Equipment leased to others            Term of lease         Investments       Investments as of December 31, 2009 and 2008     consisted of the following:                                        In Thousands        2009           2008                    Leases of equipment            $       271,725               $       265,278              Affordable housing limited partnerships                59,986                   79,161              Venture capital limited partnership                59,046                   69,053              Properties held for sale                35,908                   28,876              Property developments                24,628                   23,526                                                           $       451,293               $       465,894                                                   Leases     of Equipment         The components of the investment in leases of equipment at     December 31, 2009 and 2008 were as shown below:                                        In Thousands        2009           2008                    Leveraged, direct financing and sales-type leases:                                           Gross lease contracts receivable, net of nonrecourse debt service            $       145,738               $       145,842              Estimated residual value of leased assets                247,512                   247,512              Unearned income                (131,385       )               (139,020       )                                                           261,865                   254,334              Equipment under operating leases                9,860                   10,944                                                           $       271,725               $       265,278                                                       Deferred tax liabilities related to leveraged and direct     financing leases were $54,707,000 and $110,079,000 at     December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.         The investment in leases of equipment at December 31, 2009     and 2008 relates to the following types of equipment:                                        In Thousands        2009           2008                    Telecommunications            $       172,011               $       168,252              Air traffic control                62,856                   58,997              Aircraft                36,520                   37,603              Manufacturing                338                   426                                                           $       271,725               $       265,278                                                       In 2003, the Company entered into a leveraged lease transaction     related to air traffic control equipment in Australia with a     cash investment of $48,763,000. In 2002, the Company entered     into leveraged leasing transactions related to mobile     telecommunications equipment with two major European     telecommunications companies with a cash investment of     $144,676,000. Under the terms of the telecommunications and air     traffic control lease transactions, the lessees have made     upfront payments to third-party financial institutions that are     acting as payment undertakers. These payment undertakers are     obligated to make the required scheduled payments directly to     the nonrecourse debt holders and to the lessors, including the     Company. In the event of default by the lessees, the Company has     the right to recover its net investment from the          52    Table of Contents      Notes to     Financial Statements  (Continued)          payment undertakers. In addition, the lessees are required to     purchase residual value insurance from a creditworthy third     party at a date near the end of the lease term.         Income from leveraged, direct financing and sales-type leases     was $7,636,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009.     Expense from leveraged, direct financing and sales-type leases     was $10,158,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008.     Income from leveraged, direct financing and sales-type leases     was $8,280,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007.     Unearned income related to leveraged leases is recognized as     lease income over the life of the lease based on the effective     yield of the lease. The Company adjusts recognition of lease     income on its leveraged leases when there is a change in the     assumptions affecting total income or the timing of cash flows     associated with the lease. The residual values of leased assets     are estimated at the inception of the lease based on market     appraisals and reviewed for impairment at least annually.         On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted new accounting     guidance that addresses how a change or projected change in the     timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a     leveraged lease transaction affects the accounting by a lessor     for that lease. Upon adoption of this guidance, the Company     recorded an after-tax charge to equity of $22,559,000, resulting     from a change in the timing of expected cash flows related to     income tax benefits of the Companys leveraged lease     transactions.     Other     Investments         The Company has entered into several affordable housing limited     partnerships primarily to receive tax benefits in the form of     tax credits and tax deductions from operating losses. These     affordable housing investments are accounted for using the     effective yield method, in which the investment is amortized to     income tax expense as the tax benefits are received. The tax     credits are credited to income tax expense as they are allocated     to the Company.         The Company entered into a venture capital limited partnership     in 2001 that invests primarily in late-stage venture capital     opportunities. The Company has a 25% limited partnership     interest and accounts for this investment using the equity     method, whereby the Company recognizes its proportionate share     of the partnerships income or loss. The partnerships     financial statements are prepared on a     mark-to-market     basis.         The Company has invested in property developments with a     residential construction developer through partnerships in which     the Company has a 50% interest. These partnership investments     are accounted for using the equity method, whereby the Company     recognizes its proportionate share of the partnerships     income or loss.     The Company neither bears the majority of the risk of loss     nor enjoys the majority of any residual returns relative to the     property development investments and affordable housing     investments, therefore it does not consolidate those entities.     The Companys maximum exposure to loss related to the     property development investments and affordable housing     investments is $32,253,000 and $59,986,000, respectively, as of     December 31, 2009.         53    Table of Contents      Notes to     Financial Statements  (Continued)      Cash     Flows         Cash flows related to investments during 2009, 2008 and 2007     were as follows:                                                    In Thousands        2009           2008           2007                    Cash used to purchase investments:                                                           Affordable housing limited partnerships            $       (15,679       )           $       (16,078       )           $       (16,789       )          Property developments                (1,166       )               (1,739       )               (3,414       )          Venture capital limited partnership                (741       )               (1,566       )               (8,252       )          Other                                   (200       )               (279       )                                                                       $       (17,586       )           $       (19,583       )           $       (28,734       )                                                                Cash proceeds from investments:                                                           Affordable housing limited partnerships            $       8,025               $       2,552               $                     Properties held for sale                5,207                   4,933                   5,149              Leases of equipment                3,985                   5,746                   7,085              Venture capital limited partnership                2,407                   12,723                   44,792              Property developments                575                   972                   2,506              Prepaid forward contract                                                      31,629              Other                16                   6                   23                                                                           $       20,215               $       26,932               $       91,184                                                                   Goodwill and Intangible Assets       Goodwill and Intangible Assets  Goodwill     represents the excess cost over fair value of the net assets of     purchased businesses. The Company does not amortize goodwill     and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. The Company     performs an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and     intangible assets with indefinite lives based on the estimated     fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset.         On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted new accounting     guidance on fair value measurements for all nonfinancial assets     and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at     fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The new accounting guidance     defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell     an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly     transaction between market participants and provides guidance     for measuring fair value and the necessary disclosures.         When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company     compares the estimated fair value of each of its 60 reporting     units to its carrying value. Fair values are determined     primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows based     either on current operating cash flows or on a detailed cash     flow forecast prepared by the relevant reporting unit. The     Company also considers additional valuation techniques, such as     market multiples from similar transactions and quoted market     prices of relevant public companies. If the fair value of a     reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment     loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied     fair value and the carrying value of the reporting units     goodwill.         The Companys indefinite-lived intangibles consist of     trademarks and brands. The estimated fair values of these     intangibles are determined based on a     relief-of-royalty     income approach derived from internally forecasted revenues of     the related products. If the fair value of the trademark or     brand is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is     recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and     carrying value of the intangible asset.         54    Table of Contents      Notes to     Financial Statements  (Continued)          Amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible     assets for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007     were as follows:                                                    In Thousands        2009           2008           2007                    Goodwill:                                                           Impairment            $       90,000               $       137               $       988              Intangible Assets:                                                           Amortization                203,230                   184,410                   145,702              Impairment                15,568                   1,438                   1,166                                                                           $       308,798               $       185,985               $       147,856                                                                       Income (loss) from discontinued operations included goodwill     impairment charges of $132,563,000 in 2008 and amortization of     $5,744,000 in 2008 and $13,187,000 in 2007.         In the first quarter of 2009, the Company performed its annual     goodwill impairment assessment which resulted in impairment     charges of $60,000,000 related to the pressure sensitive     adhesives reporting unit in the Polymers & Fluids     segment and $18,000,000 related to the PC board fabrication     reporting unit in the Power Systems & Electronics     segment.         In the third quarter of 2009, the Company changed the date of     its annual goodwill impairment assessment from the first quarter     to the third quarter. This constitutes a change in the method of     applying an accounting principle that the Company believes is     preferable, as it better aligns the timing of the Companys     goodwill impairment assessment with the Companys annual     business planning and forecasting process. In the third quarter     of 2009, the Company performed its goodwill impairment     assessment which resulted in a charge of $12,000,000 related to     the truck remanufacturing and related parts and service     reporting unit in the Transportation segment.         Also in 2009, intangible asset impairments of $15,568,000 were     recorded to reduce to the estimated fair value the carrying     value of certain trademarks, brands and patents. Approximately     $5,800,000 of this total charge related to the PC board     fabrication reporting unit and the remainder to various     trademarks, brands and patents of other reporting units. The     annual impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets     during 2008 and 2007 resulted in immaterial impairment charges     for continuing operations.         The impairments during 2009 were primarily related to new     reporting units which were acquired over the last few years     before the recent economic downturn. These charges were driven     primarily by lower current forecasts compared to the expected     forecasts at the time the reporting units were acquired.         A summary of goodwill and intangible assets that were adjusted     to fair value and the related impairment charges included in     earnings for 2009 is as follows:

The U.S. primary pension plan provides benefits based on     years of service and final average salary. In addition to     pension benefits, the Company sponsors defined contribution     retirement plans covering the majority of its     U.S. employees. The Company has various defined benefit     pension plans in certain foreign countries, mainly the United     Kingdom, Germany, Canada and Australia. The U.S. primary     postretirement health care plan is contributory with the     participants contributions adjusted annually. The     U.S. primary postretirement life insurance plan is     noncontributory.         Beginning January 1, 2007, the U.S. primary pension     and other postretirement benefit plans were closed to new     participants. Newly hired employees and employees from acquired     businesses that are not participating in these plans are     eligible for additional Company contributions under the existing     U.S. primary defined contribution retirement plans.         On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted new accounting     guidance which required the Company to change the measurement     date of its defined benefit plans to correspond with the     Companys fiscal year end. The Company previously used a     September 30 measurement date. As allowed under the provisions     of this new guidance, the Company elected to remeasure its plan     assets and benefit obligation as of the beginning of the fiscal     year. Upon adoption, the Company recorded an after-tax charge of     $12,788,000 to beginning retained earnings and an after-tax gain     to accumulated other comprehensive income of $3,573,000 related     to the three months ended December 31, 2007.         The Companys expense related to defined contribution plans     was $66,000,000 in 2009, $66,700,000 in 2008 and $60,100,000 in     2007.

inflation, interest rates and equity performance.         Assumed health care cost trend rates have an effect on the     amounts reported for the postretirement health care benefit     plans. The assumed health care cost trend rates used to     determine the postretirement benefit obligation at     December 31, 2009, 2008 and September 30, 2007 were as     follows:                                                           2009       2008       2007                Health care cost trend rate assumed for the next year                8.21       %               8.71       %               10.40       %          Ultimate trend rate                5.00       %               5.00       %               5.00       %          Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate                2020                   2016                   2014                 A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend     rates would have the following effects:                                               1-Percentage-        1-Percentage-       In Thousands        Point Increase       Point Decrease                Effect on total of service and interest cost components for 2009            $       1,029               $       (1,333       )          Effect on postretirement benefit obligation at December 31,     2009            $       14,870               $       (16,619       )         Plan     Assets         The Companys overall investment strategy for the assets in     the pension funds is to achieve a balance between the goals of     growing plan assets and keeping risk at a reasonable level over     a long-term investment horizon. In order to reduce unnecessary     risk, the pension funds are diversified across several asset     classes, securities and investment managers with a focus on     total return. The target allocations for plan assets are     55-70%     equity securities,     30-45% debt     securities, 0-1% real estate and 0-10% in other types of     investments. The Company does not use derivatives for the     purpose of speculation, leverage, circumventing investment     guidelines or taking risks that are inconsistent with specified     guidelines.         The assets in the Companys postretirement health care plan     are primarily invested in life insurance policies. The     Companys overall investment strategy for the assets in the     postretirement health care fund is to invest in assets that     provide a reasonable tax exempt rate of return while preserving     capital.         59    Table of Contents      Notes to     Financial Statements  (Continued)          The following table presents the fair value of the     Companys pension and other postretirement benefit plan     assets at December 31, 2009 by asset category and valuation     methodology. Level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted     quoted prices for identical assets in active markets.     Level 2 assets are valued using quoted prices or other     observable inputs for similar assets. Level 3 assets are     valued using unobservable inputs, but reflect the assumptions     market participants would use in pricing the assets. Each     financial instruments categorization is based on the     lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value     measurement.

Equity securities primarily include     common and preferred equity securities covering a wide range of     industries and geographies which are traded in active markets     and are valued based on quoted prices. Fixed income securities     primarily consist of U.S. and foreign government bills,     notes and bonds, corporate debt securities, asset-backed     securities, and investment contracts. The majority of the assets     in this category are valued using a bid evaluation process with     bid data provided by independent pricing sources.

Mutual funds are     traded in active markets and are valued based on quoted prices.     The underlying investments include small-cap equity,     international equity and long- and short-term fixed income     instruments. Collective trust funds are private funds that are     valued at the net asset value which is determined based on the     fair value of the underlying investments. The underlying     investments include both passive and actively managed     U.S. and foreign large- and mid-cap equity funds and     short-term investment funds. Partnerships/private equity     interests are investments in partnerships where the benefit plan     is a limited partner. The investments are valued by the     investment managers on a periodic basis using pricing models     that use market, income and cost valuation methods.

The Company accrues for such     liabilities when it is probable that future costs will be     incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Such     accruals are based on developments to date, the Companys     estimates of the outcomes of these matters and its experience in     contesting, litigating and settling other similar matters.

Among the toxic tort cases in which the Company is a defendant,     the Company as well as its subsidiaries Hobart Brothers Company     and Miller Electric Mfg. Co., have been named, along with     numerous other defendants, in lawsuits alleging injury from     exposure to welding consumables.

Stock-Based Compensation       Stock-Based Compensation  Stock options and     restricted stock units have been issued to officers and other     management employees under ITWs 2006 Stock Incentive Plan     (the Plan). The stock options generally vest over a     four-year period and have a maturity of ten years from the     issuance date. The fair value of restricted stock units is     determined by reducing the closing market price on the date of     grant by the present value of projected dividends over the     vesting period. Restricted stock units generally vest after a     three-year period. To cover the exercise of vested options and     non-restricted common stock awards, the Company generally issues     new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool. At     December 31, 2009, 59,671,644 shares of ITW common     stock were reserved for issuance under this Plan.

The form     of RSU provides for full cliff vesting three years     from the date of grant. The form of PRSU provides for full     cliff vesting after three years if the Compensation     Committee certifies that the performance goals set with respect     to the PRSU are met. Upon vesting, the holder will receive one     share of common stock of the Company for each vested RSU or     PRSU. Stock options were granted on 2,287,974 shares at an     exercise price of $43.64 per share. Additionally, 711,813 RSUs     and PRSUs were issued at the grant date share price of $43.64.     The Company uses a binomial option pricing model to estimate the     fair value of the stock options granted. The following     summarizes the assumptions used in the models:                                                           2010           2009           2008                    Risk-free interest rate                0.4-3.9       %               0.6-3.3       %               1.9-3.9       %          Weighted-average volatility                25.0       %               33.0       %               27.0       %          Dividend yield                2.78       %               2.34       %               1.96       %          Expected years until exercise                7.5-7.8                   7.3-7.7                   7.3-7.9                 67    Table of Contents      Notes to     Financial Statements  (Continued)          Lattice-based option valuation models, such as the binomial     option pricing model, incorporate ranges of assumptions for     inputs. The risk-free rate of interest for periods within the     contractual life of the option is based on a zero-coupon     U.S. government instrument over the contractual term of the     equity instrument. Expected volatility is based on implied     volatility from traded options on the Companys stock and     historical volatility of the Companys stock. The Company     uses historical data to estimate option exercise timing and     employee termination rates within the valuation model. Separate     groups of employees that have similar historical exercise     behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The     expected term of options granted is derived from the output of     the option valuation model and represents the period of time     that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The ranges     presented result from separate groups of employees assumed to     exhibit different behavior.         The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted     during 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $9.59, $10.24, $13.32 and     $14.37 per share, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of     options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2009,     2008 and 2007, was $38,609,000, $23,502,000, and $86,253,000,     respectively. Exercise of options during the years ended     December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, resulted in cash receipts     of $101,613,000, $54,989,000 and $116,665,000, respectively.         As of December 31, 2009 there was $72,575,000 of total     unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested equity     awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a     weighted-average period of 2.2 years. The total fair value     of vested equity awards during the years ended December 31,     2009, 2008 and 2007 was $39,467,000, $30,185,000 and     $20,841,000, respectively.
