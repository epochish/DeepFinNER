Business  General       Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the Company or ITW) was founded in 1912 and incorporated in 1915. The Company is a worldwide manufacturer of highly engineered products and specialty systems.        The Company has approximately 600 operations in 44 countries which are aggregated and organized for internal reporting purposes into the following five segments:        Engineered Products  North America: Businesses in this segment are located in North America and manufacture a variety of short lead-time plastic and metal components and fasteners, as well as specialty products for a diverse customer base. These commercially oriented, value-added products become part of the customers products and typically are manufactured and delivered in a period of time of less than 30 days. In the plastic and metal components and fasteners category, product examples include cordless nailing systems for new housing and renovation projects, plastic interior door handles for automobiles and light trucks, and plastic shelving supports for household appliances. In the specialty products category, product examples include reclosable packaging for consumer food applications, specialty swabs and wipes for clean room usage, and specialty adhesives for household purposes.        Engineered Products  International: Businesses in this segment are located outside North America and manufacture a variety of short lead-time plastic and metal components and fasteners, as well as specialty products for a diverse customer base. These commercially oriented, value-added products become part of the customers products and typically are manufactured and delivered in a period of time of less than 30 days. In the plastic and metal components and fastener category, products are similar to those made in North America and serve the construction, automotive and general industrial sectors. In the specialty products category, a product example includes electronic component packaging trays used for the storage, shipment and manufacturing insertion of electronic components and microchips.        Specialty Systems  North America: Businesses in this segment are located in North America and design and manufacture longer lead-time machinery and related consumables, as well as specialty equipment for a diverse customer base. These commercially oriented value-added products become part of the customers production process and typically are manufactured and delivered in a period of time of more than 30 days. In the machinery and related consumables category, examples of products include industrial packaging equipment and plastic and steel strap for the bundling and shipment of a variety products for customers in numerous end markets, welding equipment and consumables for a variety of end market users, and equipment and consumables that multi-pack cans and bottles for the food and beverage industry. In the specialty equipment category, product examples include commercial food equipment such as dishwashers, refrigerators and specialty scales for use by restaurants and supermarkets, and paint spray equipment for a variety of general industrial applications.        Specialty Systems  International: Businesses in this segment are located outside North America and design and manufacture longer lead-time machinery and related consumables, as well as specialty equipment for a diverse customer base. These commercially oriented, value-added products become part of the customers production process and typically are manufactured and delivered in a period of time of more than 30 days. In the machinery and related consumables category, products are similar to those made in North America and include numerous equipment and consumables for use by the customers serving the general industrial and food and beverage sectors. In the specialty equipment category, products are used by food equipment and paint spray equipment customers.        Leasing & Investments: Businesses in this segment make opportunistic investments in mortgage-related assets, leveraged and direct financing leases of telecommunications, aircraft and other equipment, properties and property developments, affordable housing and a venture capital fund. As a result of the Companys strong     Table of Contents  cash flow, the Company has historically had excess funds to make opportunistic investments that meet the Companys desired financial returns. The Companys significant investments are described below:             1)   Mortgage     investments  In 1995, 1996     and 1997, the Company invested a total of $300 million in     three separate mortgage investments. Although it acquired     commercial mortgage loans and real estate and issued nonrecourse     notes payable in these transactions, the Company also entered     into swap and related agreements with the seller of the assets     to mitigate its real estate and credit risks relative to the     mortgage loans and real estate and eliminate its interest rate     risk relative to the nonrecourse notes payable. As a result of     these transactions, the Company will receive cash of     approximately $26 million per year and a portion of the     disposition proceeds in the tenth year of each transaction, by     which time all of the assets are expected to be sold. In     addition, the swap counterparty will repay the principal and     interest on the Companys nonrecourse notes payable. See     the Leasing & Investments section of the Managements     Discussion & Analysis on pages 22 through 25 of the     Companys 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders for further     discussion of these mortgage investments.              2)   Leases of     equipment  The Company has     entered into numerous leases of equipment used in the     telecommunications and transportation industries. These leases     are accounted for as leveraged or direct financing leases. See     the Investments note on pages 42 through 44 of the     Companys Annual Report to Stockholders for further     discussion of these leases.              3)   Affordable housing limited     partnerships  The Company     has entered into several affordable housing limited partnerships     primarily to receive tax benefits in the form of tax credits and     tax deductions from operating losses. See the Investments note     on pages 42 through 44 of the Companys Annual Report to     Stockholders for further discussion of these investments.              A key element of the Companys business strategy is its continuous 80/20 simplification process. The basic concept of this 80/20 process is to focus on whats most important (the 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value) and spend less time and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value). The Companys operations use this 80/20 process to simply and focus on the keys parts of their business, and reduce complexity that may disguise what is truly important. Each of the Companys 600 operations utilize the 80/20 process in all aspects of their business. Common applications of the 80/20 process include:               Simplifying manufactured product lines by     reducing the number of products offered by combining the     features of similar products, outsourcing products or     eliminating products.                 Simplifying the customer base by focusing on the     80/20 customers and finding different ways to serve the 20/80     customers.                 Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with     key 80/20 suppliers and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.                 Designing business processes and systems around     the key 80/20 activities.              The result of the application of this 80/20 simplification process is that the Companys operating and financial performance is improved. These 80/20 efforts often result in restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins.        In November 1999, a wholly owned subsidiary of ITW merged with Premark International, Inc. (Premark), a commercial manufacturer of food equipment and laminate products. Shareholders of Premark received .8081 shares of ITW common stock in exchange for each share of Premark common stock outstanding. A total of 49,781,665 of ITW common stock shares were issued to the former Premark shareholders in connection with the merger. The merger was accounted for under the pooling-of-interests accounting method. Accordingly, ITWs historical financial statements for periods prior to the merger have been restated to include the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Premark as though the companies had been combined during such periods.  2    Table of Contents       In December 2001, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the divestiture of the Consumer Products segment. These businesses were acquired by ITW in 1999 as part of the Premark merger. Subsequent to the Premark merger, the Company determined that the consumer characteristics of the businesses in the Consumer Products segment were not a good long-term fit with the Companys other industrial-focused businesses. Businesses in this segment are located primarily in North America and manufacture household products that are used by consumers, including Precor specialty exercise equipment, West Bend small appliances and premium cookware, and Florida Tile ceramic tile. On October 31, 2002 the sales of Precor and West Bend were completed, resulting in net cash proceeds of $207.9 million. The Company is actively marketing and intends to dispose of Florida Tile through a sale transaction in 2003. The Companys estimated net gain on disposal of the segment is as follows:                                       After-   In thousands  Pretax  Tax  Tax              Realized gains on 2002 sales of Precor and West     Bend         $ 146,240     $ 51,604     $ 94,636       Estimated loss on 2003 sale of Florida Tile     recorded in 2002           (123,874 )     (31,636 )     (92,238 )                              Estimated net gain on disposal of the segment         $ 22,366     $ 19,968     $ 2,398                                     The estimated after tax net gain of $2.4 million on the segment has been deferred at December 31, 2002 pending the completion of the sale of Florida Tile in 2003.        During the five-year period ending December 31, 2002, the Company acquired and disposed of numerous other operations which did not materially impact consolidated results.   Current Year Developments       Refer to pages 20 through 31, Managements Discussion and Analysis, in the Companys 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders.   Financial Information about Segments and Markets       Segment and geographic data are included on pages 20 through 28 and 52 through 54 of the Companys 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders.        The principal markets served by the Companys four continuing manufacturing segments are as follows:                                                % of 2002 Operating Revenues by     Manufacturing Segment          Engineered  Engineered  Specialty  Specialty     Products-  Products-  Systems-  Systems-     North  Inter-  North  Inter-   End Markets Served  America  national  America  national                Construction           45 %     37 %     10 %     5 %     Automotive           32       31       5       3       General Industrial           9       12       22       26       Food Retail and Service                         29       21       Consumer Durables           4       7       3       2       Electronics           3       7       1       2       Food and Beverage           2              9       15       Industrial Capital Goods           2       1       5       5       Paper Products                         3       4       Other           3       5       13       17                                           100 %     100 %     100 %     100 %                                          Operating results of the segments are described on pages 20 through 28 and 52 through 54 of the Companys 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders.  3    Table of Contents       The Companys manufacturing businesses primarily distribute their products directly to industrial manufacturers and through independent distributors.   Backlog       Backlog generally is not considered a significant factor in the Companys businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of its products. Backlog by continuing manufacturing segment as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 is summarized as follows:           Backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond calendar year 2003 were not material in any manufacturing segment as of December 31, 2002.        The information set forth below is applicable to all industry segments of the Company unless otherwise noted:   Competition       The Companys global competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of products the Company manufactures and the many markets it serves. Depending on the product or market, the Company may compete with a few other companies or with many others.        The Company is a leading producer of plastic and metal components and fasteners; laminate products; polymers and fluid products; welding products; packaging machinery and related consumables; food service equipment; and industrial finishing equipment.   Raw Materials       The Company uses raw materials of various types, primarily metals, plastics and paper that are available from numerous commercial sources. The availability of materials and energy has not resulted in any significant business interruptions or other major problems, nor are any such problems anticipated.   Research and Development       The Companys growth has resulted from developing new and improved products, broadening the application of established products, continuing efforts to improve and develop new methods, processes and equipment, and from acquisitions. Many new products are designed to reduce customers costs by eliminating steps in their manufacturing processes, reducing the number of parts in an assembly, or by improving the quality of customers assembled products. Typically, the development of such products is accomplished by working closely with customers on specific applications. Identifiable research and development costs are set forth on page 38 of the Companys 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders.        The Company owns approximately 2,400 unexpired United States patents covering articles, methods and machines. Many counterparts of these patents have also been obtained in various foreign countries. In addition, the Company has approximately 900 applications for patents pending in the United States Patent Office, but there is no assurance that any patent will be issued. The Company maintains an active patent department for the administration of patents and processing of patent applications.        The Company believes that many of its patents are valuable and important. Nevertheless, the Company credits its leadership in the markets it serves to engineering capability; manufacturing techniques, skills and efficiency; marketing and sales promotion; and service and delivery of quality products to its customers. The  4    Table of Contents  expiration of any one of the Companys patents would not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations or financial position.    Trademarks       Many of the Companys products are sold under various owned or licensed trademarks, which are important to the Company. Among the most significant are: ITW, Apex, Bernard, Buildex, Chemtronics, Corex, Deltar, Devcon, DeVilbiss, Dymon, Dynatec, Fastex, Foster, Hi-Cone, Hobart, Keps, LPS, Magna, Magnaflux, Miller, Mima, Minigrip, Paktron, Paslode, Ramset, Ransburg, Red Head, Rocol, Shakeproof, Signode, Stero, Teks, Tempil, Tenax, Texwipe, Traulsen, Tri-Mark, Vulcan, Wilsonart and Zip-Pak.   Environmental       The Company believes that its plants and equipment are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental regulations. Additional measures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect the Companys capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations.        Various legislative and administrative regulations concerning environmental issues have become effective or are under consideration in many parts of the world relating to manufacturing processes, and the sale or use of certain products. To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse impact on the Companys sales or earnings. The Company has made considerable efforts to develop and sell environmentally compatible products resulting in new and expanding marketing opportunities.   Employees       The Company employed approximately 48,700 persons as of December 31, 2002 and considers its employee relations to be excellent.   International       The Companys international operations include subsidiaries, joint ventures and licensees in 43 countries on six continents. These operations serve such markets as construction, automotive, food retail and service, general industrial, and others on a worldwide basis. The Companys international operations contributed approximately 37% of operating revenues in 2002 and in 2001.        Refer to pages 20 through 31 and 52 through 54 in the Companys 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders for additional information on international activities. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business in foreign countries, including price controls, exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, nationalization, expropriation and other governmental action, and changes in currency exchange rates.
