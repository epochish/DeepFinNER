Business  General       Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the Company or ITW) was founded in 1912 and incorporated in 1915. The Company is a worldwide manufacturer of highly engineered products and specialty systems.        The Company has approximately 600 operations in 43 countries which are aggregated and organized for internal reporting purposes into the following five continuing segments:        Engineered Products  North America: Businesses that are located in North America and the manufacture short lead-time plastic and metal components and fasteners, and specialty products such as polymers, fluid products and resealable packaging.        Engineered Products  International: Businesses that are located outside North America and that manufacture short lead-time plastic and metal components and fasteners, and specialty products such as polymers, fluid products and electronic component packaging.        Specialty Systems  North America: Businesses that are located in North America and that produce longer lead-time machinery and related consumables, and specialty equipment for applications such as food service and industrial finishing.        Specialty Systems  International: Businesses that are located outside North America and that manufacture longer lead-time machinery and related consumables, and specialty equipment for applications such as food service and industrial finishing.        Leasing & Investments: Businesses that make opportunistic investments in mortgage-related assets, leveraged and direct financing leases of aircraft and other equipment, properties and property developments, affordable housing and a venture capital fund.        In November 1999, a wholly owned subsidiary of ITW merged with Premark International, Inc. (Premark), a commercial manufacturer of food equipment and laminate products. Shareholders of Premark received .8081 shares of ITW common stock in exchange for each share of Premark common stock outstanding. A total of 49,781,665 of ITW common shares were issued to the former Premark shareholders in connection with the merger.        The merger was accounted for under the pooling-of-interests accounting method. Accordingly, ITWs historical financial statements for periods prior to the merger have been restated to include the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Premark as though the companies had been combined during such periods.        In December 2001, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the divestiture of the Consumer Products segment. These businesses became part of ITW in 1999 with the Premark merger. The segment is comprised of the following businesses: Precor specialty exercise equipment, West Bend appliances and premium cookware, and Florida Tile ceramic tile. The Companys consolidated financial statements have been restated for all periods to present these businesses as discontinued operations in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30. The Company intends to divest these businesses through sale transactions in 2002 and does not expect to incur a loss on their disposal.        During the five-year period ending December 31, 2001, the Company acquired and disposed of numerous other operations which did not materially impact consolidated results.   Current Year Developments       Refer to pages 25 through 33, Managements Discussion and Analysis, in the Companys 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders.     Table of Contents  Financial Information about Segments and Markets       Segment and geographic data are included on pages 25 through 29 and 51 through 52 of the Companys 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders.        The principal markets served by the Companys four continuing manufacturing segments are as follows:                                                % of 2001 Operating Revenues by Manufacturing Segment          Engineered  Engineered  Specialty  Specialty     Products-  Products-  Systems-  Systems-     North  Inter-  North  Inter-   End Markets Served  America  national  America  national                Construction        47 %     36 %     10 %     4 %     Automotive        29       32       5       3       General Industrial        8       16       22       27       Food Retail and Service                      31       22       Consumer Durables        5       6       3       2       Electronics        4       5       1       1       Food and Beverage        2       1       8       13       Industrial Capital Goods        2       1       6       6       Paper Products                      4       4       Other        3       3       10       18                                   100 %     100 %     100 %     100 %                                  Operating results of the segments are described on pages 25 through 29 and 51 through 52 of the Companys 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders.        The Companys manufacturing businesses distribute their products directly to industrial manufacturers and through independent distributors.   Backlog       Backlog generally is not considered a significant factor in the Companys businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of its products. Backlog by continuing manufacturing segment as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 is summarized as follows:           Backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond calendar year 2002 were not material in any manufacturing segment as of December 31, 2001.        The information set forth below is applicable to all industry segments of the Company unless otherwise noted:   Competition       The Companys global competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of products the Company manufactures and the many markets it serves. Depending on the product or market, the Company may compete with a few other companies or with many others.  2    Table of Contents       The Company is a leading producer of plastic, metal and laminate components and fasteners; polymers and fluid products; tooling for specialty applications; welding products; packaging machinery and related consumables; food service equipment; and industrial finishing equipment.   Raw Materials       The Company uses raw materials of various types, primarily metals, plastics and paper that are available from numerous commercial sources. The availability of materials and energy has not resulted in any significant business interruptions or other major problems, nor are any such problems anticipated.   Research and Development       The Companys growth has resulted from developing new and improved products, broadening the application of established products, continuing efforts to improve and develop new methods, processes and equipment, and from acquisitions. Many new products are designed to reduce customers costs by eliminating steps in their manufacturing processes, reducing the number of parts in an assembly, or by improving the quality of customers assembled products. Typically, the development of such products is accomplished by working closely with customers on specific applications. Identifiable research and development costs are set forth on page 39 of the Companys 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders.        The Company owns approximately 3,000 unexpired United States patents covering articles, methods and machines. Many counterparts of these patents have also been obtained in various foreign countries. In addition, the Company has approximately 1,200 applications for patents pending in the United States Patent Office, but there is no assurance that any patent will be issued. The Company maintains an active patent department for the administration of patents and processing of patent applications.        The Company believes that many of its patents are valuable and important. Nevertheless, the Company credits its leadership in the markets it serves to engineering capability; manufacturing techniques, skills and efficiency; marketing and sales promotion; and service and delivery of quality products to its customers.   Trademarks       Many of the Companys products are sold under various trademarks owned or licensed by the Company. Among the most significant are: ITW, Apex, Bernard, Buildex, Chemtronics, Corex, Deltar, Devcon, DeVilbiss, Dymon, Dynatec, Fastex, Foster, Hi-Cone, Hobart, Keps, LPS, Magna, Magnaflux, Miller, Mima, Minigrip, Paktron, Paslode, Precor, Ramset, Ransburg, Red Head, Rocol, Shakeproof, Signode, Stero, Teks, Tempil, Tenax, Texwipe, Traulsen, Tri-Mark, Vulcan, West Bend, Wilsonart, and Zip-Pak.   Environmental       The Company believes that its plants and equipment are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental regulations. Additional measures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect the Companys capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations.        Various legislative and administrative regulations concerning environmental issues have become effective or are under consideration in many parts of the world relating to manufacturing processes, and the sale or use of certain products. To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse impact on the Companys sales or earnings. The Company has made considerable efforts to develop and sell environmentally compatible products resulting in new and expanding marketing opportunities.   Employees       The Company employed approximately 52,000 persons as of December 31, 2001 and considers its employee relations to be excellent.  3    Table of Contents  International       The Companys international operations include subsidiaries, joint ventures and licensees in 42 countries on six continents. These operations serve such markets as construction, automotive, food retail and service, general industrial, and others on a worldwide basis. The Companys international operations contributed approximately 37% of operating revenues in 2001 and 36% in 2000.        Refer to pages 25 through 33 and 51 through 52 in the Companys 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders for additional information on international activities. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business in foreign countries, including price controls, exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, nationalization, expropriation and other governmental action, and changes in currency exchange rates.

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings       The United States Environmental Protection Agency has issued a proposed fine of $1,259,000 against one of the Companys businesses for alleged violation of hazardous waste regulations issued under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976.

The Company never operated at the Kansas City facility. The former owners of the business have indemnified ITW with respect to the matter, insofar as it relates to pre-acquisition activities. ITW and the former owners are in current negotiations with The United States Environmental Protection Agency regarding the amount of the fine.  5    Table of Contents    ITEM 4.
