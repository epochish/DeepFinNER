Segment     Reporting Change         In prior periods, the Companys operations were aggregated     and organized into the following four segments: Engineered     Products  North America; Engineered     Products  International; Specialty     Systems  North America; and Specialty     Systems  International. The segment information in     prior years has been restated to conform to the new segment     presentation.     80/20     Business Process         A key element of the Companys business strategy is its     continuous 80/20 business process for both existing businesses     and new acquisitions. The basic concept of this 80/20 business     process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the     items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time     and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which     account for 20% of the value). The Companys operations use     this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key     parts of their business, and as a result, reduce complexity that     often disguises what is truly important. The Companys 825     operations utilize the 80/20 process in various aspects of their     business. Common applications of the 80/20 business process     include:                         Simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products     offered by combining the features of similar products,     outsourcing products or, as a last resort, eliminating low-value     products.                    Segmenting the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers     separately and finding alternative ways to serve the 20/80     customers.                    Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers     and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.                    Designing business processes, systems and measurements around     the 80/20 activities.           The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is     that the Company has consistently improved its operating and     financial performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in     restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins.     Corporate management works closely with those business units     that have operating results below expectations to help those     units better apply this 80/20 business process and improve their     results.     Discontinued     Operations         In 2007 and 2006, the Company completed the divestitures of     certain construction, consumer packaging and automotive     machinery businesses and recognized after-tax gains on disposal     of $40.2 million in 2007, including a tax benefit of     $7.0 million, and $14.3 million in 2006, net of tax     expense of $4.8 million. In addition, a consumer packaging     and an automotive components business have been classified as     held for sale as of December 31, 2007.         In 2004 and 2003, the Company sold the former Consumer Products     segment, which was comprised of the following businesses: Precor     specialty exercise equipment, West Bend small appliances and     premium cookware, and Florida Tile ceramic tile. The     Companys net loss on disposal of the segment was     $0.9 million in 2004 and $16.5 million in 2003.

Backlog         Backlog generally is not considered a significant factor in the     Companys businesses as relatively short delivery periods     and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of its     products. Backlog by segment as of December 31, 2007 and     2006 is summarized as follows:                                       In Thousands        2007           2006                   Industrial Packaging            $       150,000               $       122,000              Power Systems & Electronics                153,000                   147,000              Transportation                118,000                   131,000              Construction Products                26,000                   35,000              Food Equipment                227,000                   145,000              Decorative Surfaces                39,000                   22,000              Polymers & Fluids                61,000                   35,000              All Other                384,000                   414,000                                                    Total            $       1,158,000               $       1,051,000                                                       Backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond calendar year 2008     were not material as of December 31, 2007.         The information set forth below is applicable to all industry     segments of the Company unless otherwise noted:     Competition         The Companys global competitive environment is complex     because of the wide diversity of products the Company     manufactures and the many markets it serves. Depending on the     product or market, the Company may compete with a limited number     of companies or with many others. The Company is a leading     producer of plastic        5            and metal components and fasteners; industrial packaging     machinery and related consumables; welding products and related     consumables; automotive aftermarket maintenance and appearance     products; food service equipment; laminate products; polymers     and fluid products; consumer packaging; materials testing     equipment; and industrial finishing equipment.     Raw     Materials         The Company uses raw materials of various types, primarily     metals, plastics, paper and chemicals, that are available from     numerous commercial sources. The availability of materials and     energy has not resulted in any significant business     interruptions or other major problems, and no such problems are     anticipated.     Research     and Development         The Companys growth has resulted from developing new and     improved products, broadening the application of established     products, continuing efforts to improve and develop new methods,     processes and equipment, and from acquisitions. Many new     products are designed to reduce customers costs by     eliminating steps in their manufacturing processes, reducing the     number of parts in an assembly, or by improving the quality of     customers assembled products. Typically, the development     of such products is accomplished by working closely with     customers on specific applications. Identifiable research and     development costs are set forth on page 54 of the     Companys 2007 Annual Report to Stockholders.         The Company owns approximately 3,800 unexpired United States     patents covering articles, methods and machines. Many     counterparts of these patents have also been obtained in various     foreign countries. In addition, the Company has approximately     1,700 applications for patents pending in the United States     Patent Office, but there is no assurance that any patent will be     issued. The Company maintains an active patent department for     the administration of patents and processing of patent     applications.         The Company believes that many of its patents are valuable and     important. Nevertheless, the Company credits its leadership in     the markets it serves to engineering capability; manufacturing     techniques; skills and efficiency; marketing and sales     promotion; and service and delivery of quality products to its     customers. The expiration of any one of the Companys     patents would not have a material effect on the Companys     results of operations or financial position.     Trademarks         Many of the Companys products are sold under various owned     or licensed trademarks, which are important to the Company.     Among the most significant are: ITW, Acme, Alpine, Angleboard,     Apex, Ark-Les, Bernard, Betaprint, Binks, Buehler, Buildex,     Chemtronics, Click Commerce, Covid, Deltar, Densit, Devcon,     DeVilbiss, Dymon, Dynatec, Electrocal, Evercoat,     E-Z Anchor,     Fastex, Filtertek, Foilmark, Forte, Foster, Franklynn, Futura     Coatings, Gema, Hi-Cone, Hobart, Instron, Intellibuild, Keps,     Kester, Krafft, Lachenmeier, Lebo, LPS, Magna, Magnaflux,     Meyercord, Miller, Mima, Minigrip, Nexus, NorDen, Orbitalum,     Orgapack, Paktron, Paslode, Permatex, Plexus, Polymark,     Pro/Mark, Pryda, QMI, Racor, Ramset, Ransburg, Red Head,     Resopal, Reyflex, Rippey, Rockwell, Rocol, Shakeproof, Shore,     Signode, Simco, Space Bag, Spectrum, Speedline, Spiroid, SPIT,     Stero, Strapex, Tapcon, Teks, Tempil, Tenax, Texwipe, Traulsen,     Tregaskiss, Truswal Systems, Valeron, Versachem, Vulcan, WERCS,     Wilsonart, Wynns and Zip-Pak.     Environmental         The Company believes that its plants and equipment are in     substantial compliance with all applicable environmental     regulations. Additional measures to maintain compliance are not     expected to materially affect the Companys capital     expenditures, competitive position, financial position or     results of operations.         Various legislative and administrative regulations concerning     environmental issues have become effective or are under     consideration in many parts of the world relating to     manufacturing processes and the sale or use of certain products.     To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse     impact on the Companys        6            revenues or earnings. The Company has made considerable efforts     to develop and sell environmentally compatible products.     Employees         The Company employed approximately 60,000 persons as of     December 31, 2007 and considers its employee relations to     be excellent.     International         The Companys international operations include subsidiaries     and joint ventures in 51 foreign countries on six continents.     These operations serve such end markets as construction, general     industrial, automotive, food institutional/restaurant and     service, food and beverage, consumer durables, electronics,     primary metals and others on a worldwide basis. The     Companys international operations contributed     approximately 49% of revenues in 2007, 43% of revenues in 2006     and 42% of revenues in 2005.         Refer to pages 30 through 47 and page 72 in the     Companys 2007 Annual Report to Stockholders for additional     information on international activities. International     operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting     business in foreign countries, including price controls,     exchange controls, limitations on participation in local     enterprises, nationalization, expropriation and other     governmental action, and changes in currency exchange rates.

These statements are subject to certain risks,     uncertainties, and other factors, which could cause actual     results to differ materially from those anticipated. Important     risks that may influence future results include (1) a     downturn or further downturn in the construction, general     industrial, automotive or food institutional/restaurant and     service markets, (2) deterioration in international and     domestic business and economic conditions, particularly in North     America, Europe, Asia or Australia, (3) the unfavorable     impact of foreign currency fluctuations and costs of raw     materials, (4) an interruption in, or reduction in,     introducing new products into the Companys product lines,     (5) an unfavorable environment for making acquisitions,     domestic and international, including adverse accounting or     regulatory requirements and market values of candidates, and     (6) unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings.     The risks covered here are not all inclusive and given these and     other possible risks and uncertainties, investors should not     place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a     prediction of actual results.         ITW practices fair disclosure for all interested parties.     Investors should be aware that while ITW regularly communicates     with securities analysts and other investment professionals, it     is against ITWs policy to disclose to them any material     non-public information or other confidential commercial     information.

Copies of the        8            following information are also available free of charge through     the Companys website (www.itw.com) and are     available in print to any shareholder who requests it:                         The Companys Annual Report on     Form 10-K,     Quarterly Reports on     Form 10-Q     and Current Reports on     Form 8-K;                    Statement of Principles of Conduct;                    Code of Ethics for CEO and key financial and accounting     personnel;                    Charters of the Audit, Corporate Governance and Nominating and     Compensation Committees of the Board of Directors;                    Corporate Governance Guidelines; and                    Amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to     Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of     1934.             ITEM 1A.    Risk     Factors           The Companys business, financial condition, results of     operations and cash flows are subject to various risks,     including, but not limited to those set forth below, which could     cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or     from anticipated future results. These risk factors should be     considered together with information included elsewhere in this     Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     In addition, the Company is subject to substantially the same     risk factors as other     U.S.-based     global industrial manufacturers, although the Company believes     that its decentralized structure and the broad array of end     markets that its businesses serve mitigates the possibility that     any single risk factor will materially adversely effect the     Companys consolidated financial position.     A     downturn or further downturn in the major markets served by the     Company may adversely affect results.         While the Companys businesses serve a broad array of end     markets, a sustained downturn or further downturn in the     construction, general industrial, automotive or food     institutional/restaurant and service markets could have a     material adverse effect on the Companys business, results     of operation or financial condition.     Deterioration     in international and domestic business and economic conditions     may have a material adverse affect on the Companys results     of operations.         The Company currently has approximately 825 business units in 52     countries. In 2007, approximately 49% of the Companys     revenues were generated outside of the United States. As the     Company continues to expand its global footprint these sales may     represent an ever increasing portion of the Companys     revenues. Deterioration in either international or domestic     business and economic conditions could occur as a result of a     number of factors including:                         fluctuation in currency exchange rates;                    limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings;                    transportation delays and interruptions;                    political, social and economic instability and disruptions;                    government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions;                    the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;                    import and export controls;                    labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;                    the potential for nationalization of enterprises;          9                              difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;                    limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and     remedies; and                    potentially adverse tax consequences.           If the Company is unable to manage successfully the risks     associated with expanding its international business or     adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally, the     risks could have a material adverse effect on the Companys     business, results of operations or financial condition.     Unfavorable     impact on raw materials which could adversely affect     results.         The Companys supply of raw materials for its businesses     could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including     availability and pricing. Prices for raw materials necessary for     production have fluctuated significantly in the past and     significant increases could adversely affect the Companys     results of operations and profit margins. While the Company     generally attempts to pass along increased raw material prices     to its customers in the form of price increases, there may be a     time delay between the increased raw material prices and the     Companys ability to increase the prices of its products,     or it may be unable to increase the prices of its products due     to pricing pressure or other factors.         The Companys suppliers of component parts may     significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to     increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture     their component parts. In those circumstances, the Company may     not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its     increased costs. Consequently, its results of operations and     financial condition may be materially adversely affected.     The     Companys future growth is, in part, dependent upon     introducing new products and preserving its intellectual     property.         The Companys ability to develop new products based on     innovation can affect its competitive position and often     requires the investment of significant resources. Difficulties     or delays in research, development or production of new products     and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new     products and technologies may significantly reduce future     revenues and materially adversely affect the Companys     competitive position.         Protecting the Companys intellectual property is critical     to its innovation efforts. The Company owns a number of patents,     trademarks and licenses related to its products and has     exclusive and non-exclusive rights under patents owned by     others. The Companys intellectual property may be     challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the Company may     be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license     agreements with third party owners of intellectual property on     reasonable terms. Unauthorized use of the Companys     intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing     intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact     the Companys competitive position and results of     operations.     An     unfavorable environment for making acquisitions may adversely     affect the Companys future growth.         The Company completed 52 acquisitions in 2007 resulting in     approximately $995 million of acquired annualized revenue.     The Company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and     acquiring businesses with complementary products and services as     well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new     platforms. However, there can be no assurance that the Company     will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase     or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable     terms. If the Company is unsuccessful in its efforts, its     ability to continue to grow could be adversely affected.     Unfavorable     tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect     results.         The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and     in various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax     liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among     various tax jurisdictions. The Companys effective tax rate     could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings     in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the     valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws. The     amount of income taxes and other taxes paid are subject to     ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax     authorities and        10            by     non-U.S. authorities.     If these audits result in assessments different from amounts     recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax     adjustments.     Potential     adverse outcome in legal proceedings may adversely affect     results.         The Companys businesses expose it to potential toxic tort     and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in     the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the     products of third-party vendors that it uses or resells. The     Company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and     adequate insurance programs consisting of self-insurance up to a     certain limit and excess insurance coverage for claims over the     established limit. There can be no assurance, however, that the     Company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or     that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection     against potential liabilities. Even if it maintains adequate     insurance programs, successful claims could have a material     adverse effect on the Companys financial condition,     liquidity and results of operations and on the ability to obtain     suitable or adequate insurance in the future.

The Companys properties are primarily of steel, brick or     concrete construction and are maintained in good operating     condition. Productive capacity, in general, currently exceeds     operating levels. Capacity levels are somewhat flexible based on     the number of shifts operated and on the number of overtime     hours worked. The Company adds productive capacity from time to     time as required by increased demand. Additions to capacity can     be made within a reasonable period of time due to the nature of     the businesses.           ITEM 3.    Legal     Proceedings           Not applicable.

On August 4, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors     authorized a stock repurchase program, which provides for the     buyback of up to 35,000,000 shares of common stock. This     stock repurchase program was completed in November 2007.         On August 20, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors     authorized a new stock repurchase program, which provides for     the buyback of up to $3.0 billion of the Companys     common stock over an open-ended period of time.         Share repurchase activity under these programs for the fourth     quarter was as follows:                                                                                                          Total Number of Shares            Maximum Number            Maximum Value that                              Average            Purchased as part of            that may yet be            may yet be                  Total Number of            Price Paid            Publicly Announced            Purchased Under            Purchased Under           Period        Shares Purchased           Per Share           Program           2006 Program           2007 Program                   October 2007                3,635,524               $       56.60                   3,635,524                   3,658,098                                 November 2007                3,658,098                   55.96                   3,658,098                                                    November 2007                2,344,583                   55.96                   2,344,583                                  $       2,868,800,000              December 2007                4,761,445                   54.00                   4,761,445                                      2,611,700,000                                                                                                    Total                14,399,650                   55.48                   14,399,650                                                                                                                                         ITEM 6.

On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial     Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position     No. FAS 13-2,     Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of     Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged     Lease Transaction     (FSP 13-2). FSP 13-2     addresses how a change or projected change in the timing of cash     flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease     transaction affects the accounting by a lessor for that lease.     Refer to page 59 of the Companys 2007 Annual Report     to Stockholders for discussion of the change in accounting     principle.         In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial     Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting     for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement     Plans  an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,     88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS 158). On     December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the recognition and     disclosure provisions of SFAS 158. This statement requires     employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of     defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an asset or     liability        12            in its statement of financial position and previously     unrecognized changes in that funded status through accumulated     other comprehensive income. Refer to pages 62     through 65 of the Companys 2007 Annual Report to     Stockholders for discussion of the effect of the change in     accounting principle.         Effective January 1, 2005, the Company adopted Statement of     Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),     Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which requires     the Company to measure the cost of employee services received in     exchange for equity awards based on the grant date fair value.     Upon adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company records     compensation expense for the fair value of stock awards over the     remaining service periods of those awards.
