Leasing and Investments: Businesses in this segment make investments in mortgage entities, leases of telecommunications, aircraft, air traffic control and other equipment, properties and property developments, affordable housing and a venture capital fund. As a result of the Companys strong cash flow, the Company has historically had excess funds to make opportunistic investments that meet the Companys desired returns. In connection with some of these investment transactions, the Company may be contractually required to make future cash payments related to affordable housing capital contributions, venture fund capital contributions or the redemption of preferred stock of subsidiaries. See the Companys 2003 Annual Report to Stockholders for further information regarding these cash contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003. The Companys significant investments are described below:            1)    Mortgage     investments  In 1995, 1996     and 1997, the Company invested a total of $300 million in     three separate mortgage entities. In these essentially similar     transactions, the mortgage entities entered into various     agreements with a AAA-rated third party related to commercial     mortgage loans and real estate whereby the Company paid cash of     $240 million ($80 million for each transaction),     issued preferred stock of subsidiaries of $60 million     ($20 million for each transaction) and the mortgage     entities issued nonrecourse notes payable of $740 million.     These agreements, each covering a ten-year period, are     summarized as follows:                     The third party transferred to the mortgage     entities legal title in pools of sub-performing commercial     mortgage loans and real estate (collectively, the mortgage     assets). To balance the economics of the transactions, a     Treasury security was added to the pool of assets in the second     transaction and an annuity contract was added to the pool of     mortgage assets in the third transaction.                 The mortgage entities entered into swap     agreements with the third party whereby:                     The third party (the swap counter     party) makes the contractual principal and interest     payments on the mortgage entities nonrecourse notes     payable.                 The swap counter party receives all of the annual     operating cash flows from the pools of mortgage assets except     for $26 million per year ($9 million for the first two     transactions and $8 million for the third transaction),     which is paid to the Company.                 By the tenth year of each transaction, the swap     counter party (who is also the asset servicer) is required to     sell all of the mortgage assets. The Company receives the first     $127.2 million of the disposition proceeds, which is equal     to the redemption value (liquidation value plus accrued     dividends) of the $60 million preferred stock of     subsidiaries. The swap counter party receives the next     $317.6 million of the disposition proceeds, which will be     used to pay the principal and interest on the nonrecourse notes     payable due in year 10.                 The mortgage entities entered into Servicing,     Administration and Management agreements (the servicing     agreements) with the swap counter party whereby the swap     counter party will perform all aspects of the servicing,     management and marketing of the pools of mortgage assets.        3    Table of Contents            In addition, under the terms of the servicing     agreements, the swap counter party will collect all cash flows     from the assets and make the required swap payments to the     mortgage entities, the Company and the holder of the nonrecourse     notes payable. In exchange for these services, the swap counter     party is paid an annual servicing fee equal to a percentage of     the mortgage assets managed and a disposition fee equal to a     portion of the disposition proceeds from the sale of the     mortgage assets at the end of ten years.                 To significantly reduce the risk that the Company     will not receive its annual cash flow of $26 million per     year, the swap counter party transferred to the Company legal     title to membership interests in three limited liability     corporations, which own separate pools of performing mortgage     loans and real estate. In the event that the mortgage     entities pools of mortgage assets do not generate cash     flows of at least $26 million per year, the mortgage     entities have a right to receive the shortfall from the cash     flow generated by the pools of assets owned by the limited     liability corporations. This collateral right is the     Companys only interest in the limited liability     corporations.                 In 2000, the servicing agreements were amended     such that the disposition proceeds from the sales of the     original mortgage assets were allowed to be reinvested in     replacement mortgage assets. As part of the amendment, the swap     counter party guaranteed that the disposition proceeds of the     replacement mortgage assets would be no less than the     disposition proceeds from the sales of the original mortgage     assets.                  See the Leasing and Investments section of the     Managements Discussion and Analysis in the Companys     2003 Annual Report to Stockholders for further discussion of the     estimated future cash flows and risks related to these mortgage     investments.               On July 1, 2003, the Company adopted FASB     Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest     Entities (FIN 46) relative to its investments     in the mortgage entities. FIN 46 requires consolidation of     variable interest entities in which a company has a controlling     financial interest, even if it does not have a majority voting     interest. A company is deemed to have a controlling financial     interest in a variable interest entity if it has either the     majority of the risk of loss or the majority of the residual     returns. Upon its adoption of FIN 46 for the mortgage     investments as of July 1, 2003, the Company deconsolidated     its investments in the mortgage entities as the Company neither     bears the majority of the risk of loss nor enjoys the majority     of any residual returns.               Starting in the third quarter of 2003 and for     subsequent periods, the Company accounts for its net investments     in the mortgage entities using the equity method of accounting     as provided in Statement of Position 78-9, Accounting for     Investments in Real Estate Ventures. Under this method, the net     mortgage investments are adjusted through income for changes in     the Companys share of the net assets of the mortgage     entities. The excess of the liquidation value of the investments     in the mortgage entities over their net book value as of     July 1, 2003 of $178.3 million is being recognized as     income over the remaining term of each of the investments.               Prior to the adoption of FIN 46 for the     mortgage investments as of July 1, 2003, each asset and     liability of the mortgage entities was recorded based on the     appropriate accounting method for each component. See the     Investments note in the Companys 2003 Annual Report to     Stockholders for a detailed explanation of the accounting     methods used for the various assets in these transactions.                  2)   Leases of     equipment  The Company has     entered into numerous leases of equipment used in the     telecommunications and transportation industries. These leases     are accounted for as leveraged, operating or sales-type leases.     See the Investments note in the Companys 2003 Annual     Report to Stockholders for further discussion of these leases.        4    Table of Contents           3)   Affordable housing limited     partnerships  The Company     has entered into several affordable housing limited partnerships     primarily to receive tax benefits in the form of tax credits and     tax deductions from operating losses. See the Investments note     in the Companys 2003 Annual Report to Stockholders for     further discussion of these investments.         80/20 Simplification Process       A key element of the Companys business strategy is its continuous 80/20 simplification process. The basic concept of this 80/20 process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value). The Companys operations use this 80/20 process to simplify and focus on the keys parts of their business, and reduce complexity that often disguises what is truly important. Each of the Companys 625 operations utilizes the 80/20 process in all aspects of its business. Common applications of the 80/20 process include:               Simplifying manufactured product lines by     reducing the number of products offered by combining the     features of similar products, outsourcing products or     eliminating products.                 Simplifying the customer base by focusing on the     80/20 customers and finding different ways to serve the 20/80     customers.                 Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with     key 80/20 suppliers and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.                 Designing business processes and systems around     the key 80/20 activities.              The result of the application of this 80/20 simplification process is that the Company improves its operating and financial performance. These 80/20 efforts often result in restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins. Corporate management works more closely with those business units that have operating results below expectations to help the unit apply this 80/20 simplification process and improve their results.   Discontinued Operations       In November 1999, a wholly owned subsidiary of ITW merged with Premark International, Inc. (Premark), a manufacturer of commercial food equipment and laminate products. Shareholders of Premark received .8081 shares of ITW common stock in exchange for each share of Premark common stock outstanding. A total of 49,781,665 of ITW common stock shares were issued to the former Premark shareholders in connection with the merger. The merger was accounted for under the pooling-of-interests accounting method. Accordingly, ITWs historical financial statements for periods prior to the merger have been restated to include the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Premark as though the companies had been combined during such periods.        In December 2001, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the divestiture of the Consumer Products segment. These businesses were acquired by ITW in 1999 as part of the Companys merger with Premark. Subsequent to the Premark merger, the Company determined that the consumer characteristics of the businesses in the Consumer Products segment were not a good long-term fit with the Companys other industrially focused businesses. Businesses in this segment were located primarily in North America and manufactured household products that are used by consumers, including Precor specialty exercise equipment, West Bend small appliances and premium cookware and Florida Tile ceramic tile. On October 31, 2002, the sales of Precor and West Bend were completed, resulting in cash proceeds of $211.2 million. On November 7,  5    Table of Contents  2003, the sale of Florida Tile was completed, resulting in cash proceeds of $11.5 million. The Companys net loss on disposal of the segment was as follows:                                    Pretax Gain  Tax Provision  After-Tax Gain   In thousands  (Loss)  (Benefit)  (Loss)              Realized gains on 2002 sales of Precor and West     Bend         $ 146,240     $ 51,604     $ 94,636       Estimated loss on 2003 sale of Florida Tile     recorded in 2002           (123,874 )     (31,636 )     (92,238 )                              Estimated net gain on disposal of the segment     deferred at December 31, 2002           22,366       19,968       2,398                                Gain adjustments related to 2002 sales of Precor     and West Bend recorded in 2003           (752 )     (256 )     (496 )     Additional loss on sale of Florida Tile recorded     in 2003           (28,784 )     (10,348 )     (18,436 )                              Net loss on disposal of segment as of     December 31, 2003         $ (7,170 )   $ 9,364     $ (16,534 )                                   During the five-year period ending December 31, 2003, the Company acquired and disposed of numerous other operations which did not materially impact consolidated results.

The Companys manufacturing businesses primarily distribute their products directly to industrial manufacturers and through independent distributors.  6    Table of Contents  Backlog       Backlog generally is not considered a significant factor in the Companys businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of its products. Backlog by continuing manufacturing segment as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 is summarized as follows:           Backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond calendar year 2004 were not material in any manufacturing segment as of December 31, 2003.        The information set forth below is applicable to all industry segments of the Company unless otherwise noted:   Competition       The Companys global competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of products the Company manufactures and the many markets it serves. Depending on the product or market, the Company may compete with a few other companies or with many others.        The Company is a leading producer of plastic and metal components and fasteners; laminate products; polymers and fluid products; welding products; packaging machinery and related consumables; food service equipment; and industrial finishing equipment.   Raw Materials       The Company uses raw materials of various types, primarily metals, plastics and paper that are available from numerous commercial sources. The availability of materials and energy has not resulted in any significant business interruptions or other major problems, nor are any such problems anticipated.   Research and Development       The Companys growth has resulted from developing new and improved products, broadening the application of established products, continuing efforts to improve and develop new methods, processes and equipment, and from acquisitions. Many new products are designed to reduce customers costs by eliminating steps in their manufacturing processes, reducing the number of parts in an assembly, or by improving the quality of customers assembled products. Typically, the development of such products is accomplished by working closely with customers on specific applications. Identifiable research and development costs are set forth on page 49 of the Companys 2003 Annual Report to Stockholders.        The Company owns approximately 2,700 unexpired United States patents covering articles, methods and machines. Many counterparts of these patents have also been obtained in various foreign countries. In addition, the Company has approximately 950 applications for patents pending in the United States Patent Office, but there is no assurance that any patent will be issued. The Company maintains an active patent department for the administration of patents and processing of patent applications.        The Company believes that many of its patents are valuable and important. Nevertheless, the Company credits its leadership in the markets it serves to engineering capability; manufacturing techniques, skills and efficiency; marketing and sales promotion; and service and delivery of quality products to its customers. The expiration of any one of the Companys patents would not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations or financial position.  7    Table of Contents  Trademarks       Many of the Companys products are sold under various owned or licensed trademarks, which are important to the Company. Among the most significant are: ITW, Acme, Angleboard, Apex, Bernard, Binks, Buildex, Chemtronics, Corex, Deltar, Devcon, DeVilbiss, Dymon, Dynatec, Elga, Evercoat, Fastex, Foster, Gema, Hi-Cone, Hobart, Keps, LPS, Magna, Magnaflux, Miller, Mima, Minigrip, Nexus, Orgapack, Paktron, Paslode, Ramset, Ransburg, Red Head, Resopal, Rocol, Shakeproof, Signode, Simco, Spit, Stero, Strapex, Teks, Tempil, Tenax, Texwipe, Traulsen, Tri-Mark, Unipac, Valeron, Vulcan, Wilsonart and Zip-Pak.   Environmental       The Company believes that its plants and equipment are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental regulations. Additional measures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect the Companys capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations.        Various legislative and administrative regulations concerning environmental issues have become effective or are under consideration in many parts of the world relating to manufacturing processes and the sale or use of certain products. To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse impact on the Companys sales or earnings. The Company has made considerable efforts to develop and sell environmentally compatible products resulting in new and expanding marketing opportunities.   Employees       The Company employed approximately 47,500 persons as of December 31, 2003 and considers its employee relations to be excellent.   International       The Companys international operations include subsidiaries, joint ventures and licensees in 43 countries on six continents. These operations serve such markets as construction, automotive, food retail and service, general industrial, food and beverage, and others on a worldwide basis. The Companys international operations contributed approximately 41% of operating revenues in 2003 and 37% in 2002.        Refer to pages 25 through 42 and 68 through 70 in the Companys 2003 Annual Report to Stockholders for additional information on international activities. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business in foreign countries, including price controls, exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, nationalization, expropriation and other governmental action, and changes in currency exchange rates.   Forward-looking Statements       This annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including, without limitation, statements regarding availability of raw materials and energy, the cost of compliance with environmental regulations, the adequacy of internally generated funds, the recoverability of the Companys investment in mortgage entities, equipment leases, the meeting of dividend payout objectives, the impact of the adoption of FIN 46 on investments in real estate development joint ventures, Premarks target operating margins, payments under guarantees, the availability of additional financing, the Companys portion of future benefit payments related to pension and other postretirement benefits and the Companys 2004 forecasts. These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, including, without limitation, the risks described herein. Important factors that may influence future results include (1) a downturn in the construction, automotive, general industrial, food retail and service, or real estate markets, (2) deterioration in global and domestic business and economic conditions, particularly in North America, the European Community and Australia, (3) the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations and prices of raw materials, (4) an interruption in, or reduction in, introducing new products into the Companys product lines, (5) an unfavorable environment for making acquisitions, domestic and  8    Table of Contents  international, including adverse accounting or regulatory requirements and market values of candidates, and (6) unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings.         The risks covered here are not all inclusive. ITW operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment and therefore, new risk factors emerge from time to time. It is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on ITWs business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.        ITW practices fair disclosure for all interested parties. Investors should be aware that while ITW regularly communicates with securities analysts and other investment professionals, it is against ITWs policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Shareholders should not assume that ITW agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report.

Additions to capacity can be made within a reasonable period of time due to the nature of the businesses.            ITEM 3.
