Business General       Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the Company or ITW) was founded in 1912 and incorporated in 1915. The Company manufactures and markets a variety of products and systems that provide specific, problem-solving solutions for a diverse customer base worldwide. The Company has approximately 600 operations in 43 countries.        The Companys business units are divided into six segments: Engineered Products-North America, Engineered Products-International, Specialty Systems-North America, Specialty Systems-International, Consumer Products, and Leasing and Investments. Businesses in the Engineered Products-North America segment are located in North America and manufacture short lead-time plastic and metal components and fasteners, and specialty products such as polymers, fluid products, and resealable packaging. Businesses in the Engineered Products-International segment are located outside North America and manufacture short lead-time plastic and metal components and fasteners, and specialty products such as polymers, fluid products and electronic component packaging. Businesses in the Specialty Systems-North America segment are located in North America and produce longer lead-time machinery and related consumables, and specialty equipment for applications such as food service and industrial finishing. Businesses in the Specialty Systems-International segment are located outside North America and manufacture longer lead-time machinery and related consumables, and specialty equipment for food service and industrial finishing. Businesses in the Consumer Products segment are located primarily in North America and manufacture specialty exercise equipment, small electric appliances, cookware and ceramic tile. The Leasing and Investment segment makes opportunistic investments in mortgage-related assets, leveraged and direct financing leases of equipment, properties and property developments, and affordable housing.        On November 23, 1999, a wholly owned subsidiary of ITW merged with Premark International, Inc. (Premark), a commercial manufacturer of food equipment and laminate products. Shareholders of Premark received .8081 shares of ITW common stock in exchange for each share of Premark common stock outstanding. A total of 49,781,665 of ITW common shares were issued to the former Premark shareholders in connection with the merger. The merger was accounted for under the pooling-of-interests accounting method and accordingly, ITWs historical financial statements for periods prior to the merger have been restated to include the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Premark, as though the companies had been combined during such periods.        During the five-year period ending December 31, 2000, the Company acquired and disposed of numerous other operations which did not materially impact consolidated results.  Current Year Developments       Refer to pages 21 through 26, Managements Discussion and Analysis, in the Companys 2000 Annual Report to Stockholders.  Financial Information about Segments and Markets       Segment and geographic data are included on pages 21 through 23 and 42 through 44 of the Companys 2000 Annual Report to Stockholders.     Table of Contents       The principal markets served by the Companys five manufacturing segments are as follows:                                                        % of 2000 Operating Revenues by Manufacturing Segment          Engineered  Engineered  Specialty  Specialty       Products-  Products-  Systems-  Systems-       North  Inter-  North  Inter-  Consumer   End Markets Served  America  national  America  national  Products                   Construction      47 %     31 %     9 %     7 %     31 %       Automotive      26       32       6       3                General Industrial      12       15       20       25                Food Retail and Service                    33       26                Consumer Durables      6       9       2       3       68         Electronics      3       8       2       2                Food and Beverage      2       1       8       9                Industrial Capital Goods      1       1       5       6                Paper Products                    4       5                Other      3       3       11       14       1                                                  100 %     100 %     100 %     100 %     100 %                                                 Operating results of the segments are described on pages 21 through 23 and 42 through 44 of the Companys 2000 Annual Report to Stockholders.        Most of the Companys businesses distribute their products directly to industrial manufacturers and through independent distributors.  Backlog       Backlog generally is not considered a significant factor in the Companys businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of its products.        Backlog by manufacturing segment as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 is summarized as follows:                                                                  Backlog in Thousands of Dollars              Engineered    Specialty         Products-  Engineered  Systems-  Specialty         North  Products-  North  Systems-  Consumer       America  International  America  International  Products  Total                     2000    $ 315,000     $ 145,000     $ 252,000     $ 139,000     $ 16,000     $ 867,000         1999    $ 257,000     $ 125,000     $ 196,000     $ 136,000            $ 714,000            Backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond calendar year 2001 were not material in any manufacturing segment as of December 31, 2000.        The information set forth below is applicable to all industry segments of the Company unless otherwise noted:  Competition       The Companys global competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of products the Company manufactures and the markets it serves. Depending on the product or market, the Company may compete with a few other companies or with many others, some of which may be the Companys own licensees.        The Company is a leading producer of plastic, metal and laminate components and fasteners; polymers and fluid products; tooling for specialty applications; welding products; packaging machinery and related consumables; food service equipment; and industrial finishing equipment.  2    Table of Contents Raw Materials       The Company uses raw materials of various types, primarily metals and plastics that are available from numerous commercial sources. The availability of materials and energy has not resulted in any significant business interruptions or other major problems, nor are any such problems anticipated.  Research and Development       The Companys growth has resulted from developing new and improved products, broadening the application of established products, continuing efforts to improve and develop new methods, processes and equipment, and from acquisitions. Many new products are designed to reduce customers costs by eliminating steps in their manufacturing processes, reducing the number of parts in an assembly, or by improving the quality of customers assembled products. Typically, the development of such products is accomplished by working closely with customers on specific applications. Identifiable research and development costs are set forth on page 31 of the Companys 2000 Annual Report to Stockholders.        The Company owns approximately 2,805 unexpired United States patents covering articles, methods and machines. Many counterparts of these patents have also been obtained in various foreign countries. In addition, the Company has approximately 975 applications for patents pending in the United States Patent Office, but there is no assurance that any patent will be issued. The Company maintains an active patent department for the administration of patents and processing of patent applications.        The Company believes that many of its patents are valuable and important. Nevertheless, the Company credits its leadership in the markets it serves to engineering capability; manufacturing techniques, skills and efficiency; marketing and sales promotion; and service and delivery of quality products to its customers.  Trademarks       Many of the Companys products are sold under various trademarks owned or licensed by the Company. Among the most significant are: ITW, Apex, Buildex, Corex, Deltar, Devcon, DeVilbiss, Fastex, Hi-Cone, Hobart, Keps, Magnaflux, Miller, Minigrip, Paktron, Paslode, Precor, Ramset, Ransburg, Red Head, Shakeproof, Signode, Stero, Teks, Tempil, Tenax, Tri-Mark, Vulcan, West Bend, Wilsonart, and Zip-Pak.  Environmental       The Company believes that its plants and equipment are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental regulations. Additional measures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect the Companys capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations.        Various legislative and administrative regulations concerning environmental issues have become effective or are under consideration in many parts of the world relating to manufacturing processes, and the sale or use of certain products. To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse impact on the Companys sales or earnings. The Company has made considerable efforts to develop and sell environmentally compatible products resulting in new and expanding marketing opportunities.  Employees       The Company employed approximately 55,300 persons as of December 31, 2000 and considers its employee relations to be excellent.  International       The Companys international operations include subsidiaries, joint ventures and licensees in 42 countries on six continents. These operations serve such markets as construction, automotive, food retail and service, general industrial, and others on a worldwide basis. The Companys international operations contributed approximately 35% of operating revenues in 2000 and 34% in 1999.  3    Table of Contents       Refer to pages 21 through 26 and 42 through 44 in the Companys 2000 Annual Report to Stockholders for additional information on international activities. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business in foreign countries, including price controls, exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, nationalization, expropriation and other governmental action, and changes in currency exchange rates.
