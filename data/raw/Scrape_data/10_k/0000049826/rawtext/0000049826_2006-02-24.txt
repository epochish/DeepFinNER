Leasing and Investments: Businesses in this segment make investments in mortgage entities; leases of telecommunications, aircraft, air traffic control and other equipment; properties; affordable housing and a venture capital fund.        The Companys significant investments are described below:            1)   Mortgage investments  In 1995, 1996 and 1997,     the Company invested a total of $300.0 million in three     separate mortgage entities. In these essentially similar     transactions, the mortgage entities entered into various     agreements with a AAA-rated third party related to commercial     mortgage loans and real estate whereby the Company paid cash of     $240.0 million ($80.0 million for each transaction),     issued preferred stock of subsidiaries of $60.0 million     ($20.0 million for each transaction) and the mortgage     entities issued nonrecourse notes payable of     $739.7 million. These agreements, each covering a ten-year     period, are summarized as follows:                    The third party transferred to the mortgage entities legal title     in pools of sub-performing commercial mortgage loans and real     estate (collectively, the mortgage-related assets).     To balance the economics of the transactions, a Treasury     security was added to the pool of mortgage-related assets in the     second transaction and an annuity contract was added to the pool     of mortgage-related assets in the third transaction.   4                       The mortgage entities entered into swap agreements with the     third party whereby:                    The third party (the swap counter party) makes the     contractual principal and interest payments on the mortgage     entities nonrecourse notes payable.                The swap counter party receives all of the annual operating cash     flows from the pools of mortgage-related assets, except for     specified amounts which are paid to the Company.                By the tenth year of each transaction, the swap counter party     (who is also the asset servicer) is required to sell all of the     mortgage-related assets. The Company receives the first     $127.2 million of the disposition proceeds, which is equal     to the redemption value (liquidation value plus accrued     dividends) of the $60.0 million preferred stock of     subsidiaries. The swap counter party receives the next     $317.6 million of the disposition proceeds, which will be     used to pay the principal and interest on the nonrecourse notes     payable due in year 10.                The mortgage entities entered into Servicing, Administration and     Management agreements (the servicing agreements)     with the swap counter party whereby the swap counter party will     perform all aspects of the servicing, management and marketing     of the pools of mortgage-related assets. In addition, under the     terms of the servicing agreements, the swap counter party will     collect all cash flows from the assets and make the required     swap payments to the mortgage entities, the Company and the     holder of the nonrecourse notes payable. In exchange for these     services, the swap counter party is paid an annual servicing fee     equal to a percentage of the mortgage-related assets managed and     a disposition fee equal to a portion of the disposition proceeds     from the sale of the mortgage-related assets at the end of ten     years.                To significantly reduce the risk that the Company will not     receive its specified annual cash flow per year, the swap     counter party transferred to the Company legal title to certain     membership interests in three limited liability corporations,     which own separate pools of performing mortgage loans and real     estate. In the event that the pools of mortgage-related assets     do not generate interest and net operating cash flow greater     than the specified amounts, the Company has the right to receive     the shortfall from the cash flow generated by separate pools of     mortgage-related assets (owned by third parties in which the     Company has minimal interest).                In 2000, the servicing agreements were amended such that the     disposition proceeds from the sales of the original     mortgage-related assets were allowed to be reinvested in     replacement mortgage-related assets. As part of the amendment,     the swap counter party guaranteed that the disposition proceeds     of the replacement mortgage-related assets would be no less than     the disposition proceeds from the sales of the original     mortgage-related assets.                 In December 2005, in accordance with the     10-year term of the     transaction, all remaining mortgage-related assets related to     the 1995 mortgage investment transaction (the First     Mortgage Transaction) were sold. The Company received     $150.8 million for its share of the disposition proceeds     and paid $32.0 million for the redemption of preferred     stock of a subsidiary and related accrued dividends. As of     December 31, 2005, there are no remaining assets or     liabilities related to the First Mortgage Transaction.              See the Leasing and Investments section of the Managements     Discussion and Analysis in the Companys 2005 Annual Report     to Stockholders for further discussion of the estimated future     cash flows and risks related to these mortgage investments.              On July 1, 2003, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation     No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities     (FIN 46) relative to its investments in the     mortgage entities. FIN 46 requires consolidation of     variable interest entities in which a company has a controlling     financial interest, even if it does not have a majority voting     interest. A company is deemed to have a controlling financial     interest in a variable interest entity if it has either the     majority of the risk of loss or the majority of the residual     returns. Upon its adoption of FIN 46 for the mortgage     investments as of July 1, 2003, the   5                   Company deconsolidated its investments in the mortgage entities     as the Company neither bears the majority of the risk of loss     nor enjoys the majority of any residual returns. No gain or loss     was recognized in connection with this change in accounting.              Starting in the third quarter of 2003 and for subsequent     periods, the Company accounts for its net investments in the     mortgage entities using the equity method of accounting as     provided in Statement of Position     78-9, Accounting for     Investments in Real Estate Ventures. Under this method, the net     mortgage investments are adjusted through income for changes in     the Companys share of the net assets of the mortgage     entities. The excess of the liquidation value of the investments     in the mortgage entities over their net book value as of     July 1, 2003 of $178.3 million is being recognized as     income over the remaining term of each of the investments.              Prior to the adoption of FIN 46 for the mortgage     investments as of July 1, 2003, each asset and liability of     the mortgage entities was recorded based on the appropriate     accounting method for each component. See the Investments note     in the Companys 2005 Annual Report to Stockholders for a     detailed explanation of the accounting methods used prior to the     adoption of FIN 46 for the various assets in these     transactions.             2)   Leases of equipment  The Company has entered     into numerous leases of telecommunications, aircraft, air     traffic control and other equipment. These leases are accounted     for as leveraged, operating or sales-type leases. See the     Investments note in the Companys 2005 Annual Report to     Stockholders for further discussion of these leases.         3)   Affordable housing limited partnerships  The     Company has entered into several affordable housing limited     partnerships primarily to receive tax benefits in the form of     tax credits and tax deductions from operating losses. See the     Investments note in the Companys 2005 Annual Report to     Stockholders for further discussion of these investments.         4)   Venture capital limited partnership  The     Company entered into a venture capital limited partnership in     2001 that invests in late-stage venture capital opportunities.     The Company has committed to total capital contributions to this     partnership of $100.0 million over a five-year period. See     the Investments note in the Companys 2005 Annual Report to     Stockholders for further discussion of these investments.         5)   Prepaid forward contract  The Companys     investment in the prepaid forward contract was initially     recorded at cost. See the Investments note in the Companys     2005 Annual Report to Stockholders for further discussion of     these investments.         6)   Properties held for sale  Properties held for     sale are former manufacturing or office facilities located     primarily in the United States that are no longer used by the     Companys operations and are currently held for sale. See     the Investments note in the Companys 2005 Annual Report to     Stockholders further discussion of these investments.         7)   Property developments  The Company has     invested in property developments with a residential     construction developer through partnerships in which the Company     has a 50% interest. See the Investments note in the     Companys 2005 Annual Report to Stockholders for further     discussion of these investments.    In January 2006, the Company announced that given the planned run-off of assets in the Leasing and Investments portfolio and its desire to utilize free cash flow for core manufacturing investments and acquisitions, rather than to make additional financial investments, management has decided to no longer report this activity as a segment on a prospective basis. In 2006, income from these activities will be reported as non-operating investment income.   80/20 Business Process        A key element of the Companys business strategy is its continuous 80/20 business process for both existing businesses and new acquisitions. The basic concept of this 80/20 business process is to focus on what  6       is most important (the 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value). The Companys operations use this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key parts of their business, and as a result, reduce complexity that often disguises what is truly important. The Companys 700 operations utilize the 80/20 process in various aspects of its business. Common applications of the 80/20 business process include:                   Simplifying manufactured product lines by reducing the number of     products offered by combining the features of similar products,     outsourcing products or, as a last resort, eliminating products.                Simplifying the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers     and finding different ways to serve the 20/80 customers.                Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with key 80/20     suppliers and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.                Designing business processes and systems around the key 80/20     activities.         The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is that the Company improves its operating and financial performance. These 80/20 efforts often result in restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins. Corporate management works closely with those business units that have operating results below expectations to help the unit apply this 80/20 business process and improve their results.   Discontinued Operations        Discontinued Operations represents the Companys former Consumer Products segment which was comprised of the following businesses: Precor specialty exercise equipment, West Bend small appliances and premium cookware, and Florida Tile ceramic tile. The Companys net loss on disposal of the segment was $0.9 million in 2004 and $16.5 million in 2003. In 2002, the Company recorded an estimated after-tax net gain on disposal of the segment of $2.4 million, which was deferred pending the completion of the sale of Florida Tile in 2003.

Backlog        Backlog generally is not considered a significant factor in the Companys businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of its products. Backlog by manufacturing segment as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 is summarized as follows:                                                     Backlog in Thousands of Dollars               Engineered       Specialty           Products-   Engineered   Systems-   Specialty           North   Products-   North   Systems-           America   International   America   International   Total                                 2005    $ 292,000     $ 274,000     $ 273,000     $ 268,000     $ 1,107,000           2004    $ 287,000     $ 268,000     $ 231,000     $ 171,000     $ 957,000            Backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond calendar year 2006 were not material in any manufacturing segment as of December 31, 2005.        The information set forth below is applicable to all industry segments of the Company unless otherwise noted:   Competition        The Companys global competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of products the Company manufactures and the many markets it serves. Depending on the product or market, the Company may compete with a few other companies or with many others. The Company is a leading producer of plastic and metal components and fasteners; laminate products; polymers and fluid products; automotive aftermarket maintenance and appearance products; welding products; packaging machinery and related consumables; equipment for materials testing; food service equipment; and industrial finishing equipment.  8       Raw Materials        The Company uses raw materials of various types, primarily metals, plastics and paper, that are available from numerous commercial sources. The availability of materials and energy has not resulted in any significant business interruptions or other major problems, nor are any such problems anticipated.   Research and Development        The Companys growth has resulted from developing new and improved products, broadening the application of established products, continuing efforts to improve and develop new methods, processes and equipment, and from acquisitions. Many new products are designed to reduce customers costs by eliminating steps in their manufacturing processes, reducing the number of parts in an assembly, or by improving the quality of customers assembled products. Typically, the development of such products is accomplished by working closely with customers on specific applications. Identifiable research and development costs are set forth on page 54 of the Companys 2005 Annual Report to Stockholders.        The Company owns approximately 3,300 unexpired United States patents covering articles, methods and machines. Many counterparts of these patents have also been obtained in various foreign countries. In addition, the Company has approximately 1,200 applications for patents pending in the United States Patent Office, but there is no assurance that any patent will be issued. The Company maintains an active patent department for the administration of patents and processing of patent applications.        The Company believes that many of its patents are valuable and important. Nevertheless, the Company credits its leadership in the markets it serves to engineering capability; manufacturing techniques, skills and efficiency; marketing and sales promotion; and service and delivery of quality products to its customers. The expiration of any one of the Companys patents would not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations or financial position.   Trademarks        Many of the Companys products are sold under various owned or licensed trademarks, which are important to the Company. Among the most significant are: ITW, Acme, Angleboard, Apex, Bernard, Binks, Buildex, Chemtronics, Corex, Deltar, Devcon, DeVilbiss, Dymon, Dynatec, Elga, Evercoat, Fastex, Forkardt, Foster, Gema, Hi-Cone, Hobart, Instron, Intellibuild, Keps, Krafft, LPS, Magna, Magnaflux, Miller, Mima, Minigrip, Nexus, Orgapack, Paktron, Paslode, Permatex, Pryda, Ramset, Ransburg, Red Head, Resopal, Rippey, Rockwell, Rocol, Shakeproof, Shore, Signode, Simco, Spiroid, Spit, Stero, Strapex, Teks, Tempil, Tenax, Texwipe, Traulsen, Truswal Systems, Tri-Mark, Unipac, Valeron, Vulcan, Wilsonart, Wynns and Zip-Pak.   Environmental        The Company believes that its plants and equipment are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental regulations. Additional measures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect the Companys capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations.        Various legislative and administrative regulations concerning environmental issues have become effective or are under consideration in many parts of the world relating to manufacturing processes and the sale or use of certain products. To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse impact on the Companys sales or earnings. The Company has made considerable efforts to develop and sell environmentally compatible products resulting in new and expanding marketing opportunities.   Employees        The Company employed approximately 50,000 persons as of December 31, 2005 and considers its employee relations to be excellent.  9       International        The Companys international operations include subsidiaries, joint ventures and licensees in 47 countries on six continents. These operations serve such end markets as construction, automotive, food institutional and retail, general industrial, food and beverage, and others on a worldwide basis. The Companys international operations contributed approximately 44% of operating revenues in 2005 and 2004.        Refer to pages 30 through 48 and 74 through 76 in the Companys 2005 Annual Report to Stockholders for additional information on international activities. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business in foreign countries, including price controls, exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, nationalization, expropriation and other governmental action, and changes in currency exchange rates.

The Companys properties are primarily of steel, brick or concrete construction and are maintained in good operating condition. Productive capacity, in general, currently exceeds operating levels. Capacity levels are somewhat flexible based on the number of shifts operated and on the number of overtime hours worked. The Company adds productive capacity from time to time as required by increased demand. Additions to capacity can be made within a reasonable period of time due to the nature of the businesses.         ITEM 3.   Legal Proceedings         Wilsonart International, Inc. (Wilsonart), a wholly owned subsidiary of ITW, is a defendant in a consolidated class action lawsuit filed in June 2000 in U.S. federal district court in White Plains, New York on behalf of purchasers of high-pressure laminate. The complaint alleges that Wilsonart participated in a conspiracy with competitors to fix, raise, maintain or stabilize prices for high-pressure laminate between 1994 and 2000 and seeks injunctive relief and treble damages. Indirect purchasers of high-pressure laminate filed similar purported class action cases under various state antitrust and consumer protection statutes in 13 states and the District of Columbia, all of which cases have been stayed pending the outcome of the consolidated class action. These lawsuits were brought following the commencement of a federal grand jury investigation into price-fixing in the high-pressure laminate industry, which investigation was subsequently closed by the Department of Justice with no further proceedings and with all documents being returned to the parties. Plaintiffs are seeking damages of $470,000,000 before trebling. Without admitting liability, Wilsonarts co-defendants, International Paper Company and Panolam International, Inc., have settled the federal consoli-  12       dated class action case for $31,000,000 and $9,500,000, respectively. The plaintiffs claims against Formica Corporation, the remaining co-defendant in the case, were dismissed with prejudice on September 27, 2004 as a result of its bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, Wilsonart is the sole remaining defendant in the consolidated class action lawsuit. While no assurances can be given regarding the ultimate outcome or the timing of the resolution of these claims, the Company believes that the plaintiffs claims are without merit and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in this action and all related actions that are now pending or that may be brought in the future.
