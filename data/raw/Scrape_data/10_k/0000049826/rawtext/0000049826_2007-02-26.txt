Segment     Reporting Change         In 2006, the Company announced that given the run-off of assets     in the Leasing and Investments portfolio and the general     intention to utilize free cash flow for core manufacturing     investments and acquisitions rather than to make additional     financial investments, the internal reporting has been revised     to eliminate the reporting of Leasing and Investments as an     operating segment. Leasing and Investments results have been     reclassified to nonoperating investment income in the prior     years income statement to conform to the current year     presentation.     80/20     Business Process         A key element of the Companys business strategy is its     continuous 80/20 business process for both existing businesses     and new acquisitions. The basic concept of this 80/20 business     process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the     items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time     and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which     account for 20% of the value). The Companys operations use     this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key     parts of their business, and as a result, reduce complexity that     often disguises what is truly important. The Companys 750     operations utilize the 80/20 process in various aspects of their     business. Common applications of the 80/20 business process     include:                         Simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products     offered by combining the features of similar products,     outsourcing products or, as a last resort, eliminating low-value     products.          4                              Segmenting the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers     separately and finding alternative ways to serve the 20/80     customers.                    Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers     and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.                    Designing business processes, systems and measurements around     the 80/20 activities.           The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is     that the Company has consistently improved its operating and     financial performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in     restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins.     Corporate management works closely with those business units     that have operating results below expectations to help those     units apply this 80/20 business process and improve their     results.     Discontinued     Operations         Discontinued Operations represents the Companys former     Consumer Products segment which was comprised of the following     businesses: Precor specialty exercise equipment, West Bend small     appliances and premium cookware, and Florida Tile ceramic tile.     The Companys net loss on disposal of the segment was     $0.9 million in 2004 and $16.5 million in 2003. In     2002, the Company recorded an estimated after-tax gain on     disposal of the segment of $2.4 million, which was deferred     pending the completion of the sale of Florida Tile in 2003.

Backlog by segment as of December 31, 2006 and     2005 is summarized as follows:                                                                                 Backlog in Thousands of Dollars                 Engineered                        Specialty                                          Products-            Engineered            Systems-            Specialty                              North            Products-            North            Systems-                              America           International           America           International           Total               2006                 $       321,000               $       315,000               $       315,000               $       352,000               $       1,303,000          2005                 $       294,000               $       282,000               $       275,000               $       269,000               $       1,120,000                 Backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond calendar year 2007     were not material as of December 31, 2006.         The information set forth below is applicable to all industry     segments of the Company unless otherwise noted:     Competition         The Companys global competitive environment is complex     because of the wide diversity of products the Company     manufactures and the many markets it serves. Depending on the     product or market, the Company may compete with a limited number     of companies or with many others. The Company is a leading     producer of plastic and metal components and fasteners; laminate     products; polymers and fluid products; automotive aftermarket     maintenance and appearance products; welding products; packaging     machinery and related consumables; food service equipment;     materials testing equipment; consumer packaging and industrial     finishing equipment.     Raw     Materials         The Company uses raw materials of various types, primarily     metals, plastics, paper and chemicals, that are available from     numerous commercial sources. The availability of materials and     energy has not resulted in any significant business     interruptions or other major problems, nor are any such problems     anticipated.     Research     and Development         The Companys growth has resulted from developing new and     improved products, broadening the application of established     products, continuing efforts to improve and develop new methods,     processes and equipment, and from acquisitions. Many new     products are designed to reduce customers costs by     eliminating steps in their manufacturing processes, reducing the     number of parts in an assembly, or by improving the quality of     customers assembled products. Typically, the development     of such products is accomplished by working closely with     customers on specific applications. Identifiable research and     development costs are set forth on page 54 of the     Companys 2006 Annual Report to Stockholders.         The Company owns approximately 3,400 unexpired United States     patents covering articles, methods and machines. Many     counterparts of these patents have also been obtained in various     foreign countries. In addition, the Company has approximately     1,500 applications for patents pending in the United States     Patent Office, but there is no assurance that any patent will be     issued. The Company maintains an active patent department for     the administration of patents and processing of patent     applications.         The Company believes that many of its patents are valuable and     important. Nevertheless, the Company credits its leadership in     the markets it serves to engineering capability; manufacturing     techniques; skills and efficiency; marketing and sales     promotion; and service and delivery of quality products to its     customers. The expiration of any one of the Companys     patents would not have a material effect on the Companys     results of operations or financial position.        6          Trademarks         Many of the Companys products are sold under various owned     or licensed trademarks, which are important to the Company.     Among the most significant are: ITW, Acme, Alpine, Angleboard,     Apex, Ark-Les, Bernard, Betaprint, Binks, Buehler, Buildex,     Chemtronics, Click Commerce, Covid, Deltar, Devcon, DeVilbiss,     Dymon, Dynatec, Electrocal, Evercoat,     E-Z Ancor,     Fastex, Foilmark, Foster, Franklynn, Futura Coatings, Gema,     Hi-Cone, Hobart, Instron, Intellibuild, Keps, Kester, Krafft,     LPS, Magna, Magnaflux, Meyercord, Miller, Mima, Minigrip, Nexus,     Orbitalum, Orgapack, Paktron, Paslode, Permatex, Plexus,     Polymark, Pro/Mark, Pryda, QMI, Ramset, Ransburg, Red Head,     Resopal, Rippey, Rockwell, Rocol, Shakeproof, Shore, Signode,     Simco, Space Bag, Spiroid, Spit, Stero, Strapex, Tapcon, Teks,     Tempil, Tenax, Texwipe, Traulsen, Truswal Systems, Unipac,     Valeron, Versachem, Vulcan, WERCS, Wilsonart, Wynns and     Zip-Pak.     Environmental         The Company believes that its plants and equipment are in     substantial compliance with all applicable environmental     regulations. Additional measures to maintain compliance are not     expected to materially affect the Companys capital     expenditures, competitive position, financial position or     results of operations.         Various legislative and administrative regulations concerning     environmental issues have become effective or are under     consideration in many parts of the world relating to     manufacturing processes and the sale or use of certain products.     To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse     impact on the Companys revenues or earnings. The Company     has made considerable efforts to develop and sell     environmentally compatible products.     Employees         The Company employed approximately 55,000 persons as of     December 31, 2006 and considers its employee relations to     be excellent.     International         The Companys international operations include     subsidiaries, joint ventures and licensees in 48 foreign     countries on six continents. These operations serve such end     markets as construction, general industrial, automotive, food     institutional and service, food and beverage, consumer durables     and others on a worldwide basis. The Companys     international operations contributed approximately 45% of     revenues in 2006 and 44% of revenues in 2005.

International     operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting     business in foreign countries, including price controls,     exchange controls, limitations on participation in local     enterprises, nationalization, expropriation and other     governmental action, and changes in currency exchange rates.

Copies of the following information are also     available free of charge through the Companys website     (www.itw.com) and are available in print to any shareholder who     requests it:                         The Companys Annual Report on     Form 10-K,     Quarterly Reports on     Form 10-Q     and Current Reports on     Form 8-K;                    Statement of Principles of Conduct;                    Code of Ethics for CEO and key financial and accounting     personnel;                    Charters of the Audit, Corporate Governance and Nominating and     Compensation Committees of the Board of Directors;                    Corporate Governance Guidelines; and                    Board amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to     Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of     1934.              ITEM 1A.    Risk     Factors           The Companys business, financial condition, results of     operations and cash flows are subject to various risks,     including, but not limited to those set forth below, which could     cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or     from anticipated future results. These risk factors should be     considered together with information included elsewhere in this     Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     In addition, the Company is subject to substantially the same     risk factors as other     U.S.-based     global industrial manufacturers, although the Company believes     that its decentralized structure and the broad array of end     markets that its businesses serve mitigates the possibility that     any single risk factor will materially adversely effect the     Companys consolidated financial position.     A     downturn in the major markets served by the Company may     adversely affect results.         While the Companys businesses serve a broad array of end     markets, a sustained downturn in the construction, general     industrial, automotive or food institutional and service markets     could have a material adverse effect on the Companys     business, results of operation or financial condition.     Deterioration     in international and domestic business and economic conditions     may have a material adverse affect on the Companys result     of operations.         The Company currently has approximately 750 business units in 49     countries. In 2006, approximately 45% of the Companys     revenues were generated outside of the United States. As the     Company continues to expand its global footprint these sales     will represent an ever increasing portion of the Companys     revenues. Deterioration in either international or domestic     business and economic conditions could occur as a result of a     number of factors including:                         fluctuation in currency exchange rates;                    limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings;                    transportation delays and interruptions;                    political, social and economic instability and disruptions;                    government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions;                    the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;                    import and export controls;          9                              labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;                    the potential for nationalization of enterprises;                    difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;                    limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and     remedies; and                    potentially adverse tax consequences.           If the Company is unable to manage successfully the risks     associated with expanding its international business or     adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally, the     risks could have a material adverse effect on the Companys     business, results of operations or financial condition.     Unfavorable     impact of increases in raw materials which could adversely     affect results.         The Companys supply of raw materials for its businesses     could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including     availability and pricing. Prices for raw materials necessary for     production have fluctuated significantly in the past and     significant increases could adversely affect the Companys     results of operations and profit margins. While the Company     generally attempts to pass along increased raw material prices     to its customers in the form of price increases, there may be a     time delay between the increased raw material prices and the     Companys ability to increase the prices of its products,     or it may be unable to increase the prices of its products due     to pricing pressure or other factors.         The Companys suppliers of component parts may     significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to     increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture     their component parts. In those circumstances, the Company may     not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its     increased costs. Consequently, its results of operations and     financial condition may be materially adversely affected.     The     Companys future growth is in part, dependent upon     introducing new products and preserving its intellectual     property.         The Companys ability to develop new products based on     innovation can affect its competitive position and often     requires the investment of significant resources. Difficulties     or delays in research, development or production of new products     and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new     products and technologies may significantly reduce future     revenues and materially adversely affect the Companys     competitive position.         Protecting the Companys intellectual property is critical     to its innovation efforts. The Company owns a number of patents,     trademarks and licenses related to its products and has     exclusive and non-exclusive rights under patents owned by     others. The Companys intellectual property may be     challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the Company may     be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license     agreements with third party owners of intellectual property on     reasonable terms. Unauthorized use of the Companys     intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing     intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact     the Companys competitive position and results of     operations.     An     unfavorable environment for making acquisitions may adversely     affect the Companys future growth.         The Company completed 53 acquisitions in 2006 resulting in     approximately $1.7 billion of acquired annualized revenue.     The Company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and     acquiring businesses with complementary products and services as     well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new     platforms. However, there can be no assurance that the Company     will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase     or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable     terms. If the Company is unsuccessful in its efforts, its     ability to continue to grow the Company could be adversely     affected.     Unfavorable     tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect     results.         The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and     in various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax     liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among     various tax jurisdictions. The        10            Companys effective tax rate could be adversely affected by     changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing     statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of     deferred tax assets or tax laws. The amount of income taxes paid     is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and     local tax authorities and by     non-U.S. authorities.     If these audits result in assessments different from amounts     reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable     adjustments to the Companys tax liabilities.     Potential     adverse outcome in legal proceedings may adversely affect     results.         The Companys businesses expose it to potential toxic tort     and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in     the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the     products of third-party vendors that it uses or resells. The     Company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and     adequate insurance program consisting of a self-insured     retention and excess insurance above that layer. There can be no     assurance, however, that the Company will be able to obtain     insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance program will     provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. Even     if it maintains an adequate insurance program, successful claims     could have a material adverse effect on the Companys     financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on     the ability to obtain suitable or adequate insurance in the     future.

The Companys properties are primarily of steel, brick or     concrete construction and are maintained in good operating     condition. Productive capacity, in general, currently exceeds     operating levels. Capacity levels are somewhat flexible based on     the number of shifts operated and on the number of overtime     hours worked. The Company adds productive capacity from time to     time as required by increased demand. Additions to capacity can     be made within a reasonable period of time due to the nature of     the businesses.            ITEM 3.    Legal     Proceedings           Wilsonart International, Inc. (Wilsonart), a     wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was a defendant in a     consolidated class action lawsuit filed in 2000 in federal     district court in White Plains, New York on behalf of direct     purchasers of high-pressure laminate. The complaint alleged that     Wilsonart participated in a conspiracy with competitors to fix,     raise, maintain or stabilize prices for high pressure laminate     between 1994 and 2000 and sought injunctive relief and treble     damages. On May 24, 2006, after a two month trial, a     federal jury unanimously rendered a verdict in favor of     Wilsonart. Judgment was entered on the verdict, and that     judgment is now final. Indirect purchasers of high-pressure     laminate had filed similar purported class action cases under     various state        11            antitrust and consumer protection laws in 13 states and the     District of Columbia, all of which cases have been voluntarily     dismissed by the plaintiffs.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board     (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting     Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined     Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans  an     amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R),     (SFAS 158). On December 31, 2006, the     Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of     SFAS 158. This statement requires employers to recognize     the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension     and postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its     statement of financial position and previously unrecognized     changes in that funded status through accumulated other     comprehensive income. Refer to pages 62 through 66 of     the Companys 2006 Annual Report to Stockholders for     discussion of the effect of the change in accounting principle.        12              Effective January 1, 2005, the Company adopted Statement of     Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),     Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which requires     the Company to measure the cost of employee services received in     exchange for equity awards based on the grant date fair value.     Refer to pages 70 through 72 of the Companys     2006 Annual Report to Stockholders for discussion of the effect     of the change in accounting principle.         In 2003, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46,     (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest     Entities (FIN 46R) relative to its investments     in the mortgage entities. FIN 46R requires consolidation of     variable interest entities in which a company has a controlling     financial interest, even if it does not have a majority voting     interest. A company is deemed to have a controlling financial     interest in a variable interest entity if it has either the     majority of the risk of loss or the majority of the residual     returns. Upon its adoption of FIN 46R for the mortgage     investments as of July 1, 2003, the Company deconsolidated     its investments in the mortgage entities as the Company neither     bears the majority of the risk of loss nor enjoys the majority     of any residual returns. No gain or loss was recognized in     connection with this change in accounting.         Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of     Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other     Intangible Assets, (SFAS 142). Under     SFAS 142, the Company does not amortize goodwill and     intangible assets that have indefinite lives. SFAS 142 also     requires that the Company assess goodwill and intangible assets     with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually, based on     the fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset.

Based on such evaluation, the     Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Senior     Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that,     as of December 31, 2006, the Companys disclosure     controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting the     Companys management to all information required to be     included in this     Form 10-K     and other Exchange Act filings.        13          Managements     Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting         The Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial     Reporting, as found on page 48 of the Companys 2006     Annual Report to Stockholders, is incorporated by reference.
