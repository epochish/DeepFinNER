The basic concept of this 80/20 business     process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the     items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time     and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which     account for 20% of the value). The Companys operations use     this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key     parts of their business, and as a result, reduce complexity that     often disguises what is truly important. The Companys     operations utilize the 80/20 process in various aspects of their     business. Common applications of the 80/20 business process     include:                         Simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products     offered by combining the features of similar products,     outsourcing products or, as a last resort, eliminating low-value     products.                    Segmenting the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers     separately and finding alternative ways to serve the 20/80     customers.           3    Table of Contents                          Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers     and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.                  Designing business processes, systems and measurements around     the 80/20 activities.           The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is     that the Company has over time improved its long-term operating     and financial performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in     restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins.     Corporate management works closely with those businesses that     have operating results below expectations to help those     businesses better apply this 80/20 business process and improve     their results.     Discontinued     Operations         In August 2008, the Companys Board of Directors authorized     the divestiture of the Click Commerce industrial software     business, which was previously reported in the All Other     segment. In the second quarter of 2009, the Company completed     the sale of the Click Commerce business. Additionally, the     Company completed the divestiture of an automotive components     business in 2009, a consumer packaging business in 2008, an     automotive machinery business and a consumer packaging business     in 2007, and a construction business in 2006.

Backlog by segment as of December 31, 2010 and     2009 is summarized as follows:                                       In Thousands       2010           2009                    Transportation            $       276,000               $       225,000              Industrial Packaging                121,000                   113,000              Power Systems & Electronics                138,000                   125,000              Food Equipment                204,000                   179,000              Construction Products                33,000                   24,000              Polymers & Fluids                83,000                   73,000              Decorative Surfaces                29,000                   19,000              All Other                462,000                   340,000                                                    Total            $       1,346,000               $       1,098,000                                                       Backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond calendar year 2011     were not material as of December 31, 2010.         The information set forth below is applicable to all industry     segments of the Company unless otherwise noted:     Competition         With operations in 57 countries, the Company has a wide     diversity of products in a myriad of markets, many of which are     fragmented, and we encounter a wide variety of competitors that     vary by product line, end market and geographic area. Our     competitors include many regional or specialized companies, as     well as large U.S. and     non-U.S. companies     or divisions of large companies. Each of our segments generally     has several main competitors and numerous smaller ones in most     of their end markets and geographic areas. In addition, our     Decorative Surfaces and Power Systems & Electronics     segments each has one global competitor and numerous smaller     regional competitors.         In virtually all segments, we compete on the basis of product     innovation, product quality, brand preference, service delivery     and price. Technical capability is also a competitive factor in     most of our segments. We believe that for each of our segments,     our primary competitive advantages derive from our decentralized     operating structure, which creates a strong focus on end markets     and customers at the local level, enabling our businesses to     respond rapidly to market dynamics. This structure enables our     business units to drive operational excellence utilizing our     80/20 business process and leverages our product innovation     capabilities. We also believe that our global footprint is a     competitive advantage in many of our markets, especially in our     Transportation and Decorative Surfaces segments.     Raw     Materials         The Company uses raw materials of various types, primarily     steel, resins, chemicals and paper, that are available from     numerous commercial sources. The availability of materials and     energy has not resulted in any significant business     interruptions or other major problems, and no such problems are     currently anticipated.     Research     and Development         The Companys growth has resulted from developing new and     improved products, broadening the application of established     products, continuing efforts to improve and develop new methods,     processes and equipment, and from acquisitions. Many new     products are designed to reduce customers costs by     eliminating steps in their manufacturing processes, reducing the     number of parts in an assembly, or by          5    Table of Contents        improving the quality of customers assembled products.     Typically, the development of such products is accomplished by     working closely with customers on specific applications.     Research and development expenses were $220,462,000 in 2010,     $198,536,000 in 2009 and $212,658,000 in 2008.     Intellectual     Property         The Company owns approximately 3,800 unexpired United States     patents and 8,800 foreign patents covering articles, methods and     machines. In addition, the Company has approximately 1,800     applications for patents pending in the United States Patent     Office and 5,100 pending foreign patent offices, but there is no     assurance that any of these patents will be issued. The Company     maintains an active patent department for the administration of     patents and processing of patent applications.         The Company believes that many of its patents are valuable and     important; however, the expiration of any one of the     Companys patents would not have a material effect on the     Companys results of operations or financial position. The     Company also credits its leadership in the markets it serves to     engineering capability; manufacturing techniques; skills and     efficiency; marketing and sales promotion; and service and     delivery of quality products to its customers.         In addition to patents, many of the Companys products and     services are sold under various owned or licensed trademarks,     which are important to the Company in the aggregate. Some of the     Companys more significant trademarks include ITW, which is     also used in conjunction with many of its businesses; Deltar and     Shakeproof in the Transportation segment; Signode in the     Industrial Packaging segment; Miller in the Power     Systems & Electronics segment; Hobart in the Food     Equipment segment; Paslode in the Construction Products segment;     and Wilsonart in the Decorative Surfaces segment.     Environmental         The Company believes that its manufacturing plants and equipment     are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental     regulations. Additional measures to maintain compliance are not     expected to materially affect the Companys capital     expenditures, competitive position, financial position or     results of operations.         Various legislative and administrative regulations concerning     environmental issues have become effective or are under     consideration in many parts of the world relating to     manufacturing processes and the sale or use of certain products.     To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse     impact on the Companys revenues or earnings. The Company     has made considerable efforts to develop and sell     environmentally compatible products.     Employees         The Company employed approximately 61,000 persons as of     December 31, 2010 and considers its employee relations to     be excellent.     International         The Companys international operations include subsidiaries     and joint ventures in 56 foreign countries on six continents.     These operations serve such end markets as construction, general     industrial, automotive, food institutional/restaurant and     service, food and beverage, electronics, consumer durables,     primary metals, and others on a worldwide basis. The     Companys revenues from sales to customers outside the     United States were approximately 58% of revenues in 2010, 57% of     revenues in 2009 and 58% of revenues in 2008.

Financial Statements and     Supplementary Data for additional information on international     activities. International operations are subject to certain     risks inherent in conducting business in foreign countries,     including price controls, exchange controls, limitations on     participation in local enterprises, nationalization,     expropriation and other governmental action, and changes in          6    Table of Contents        currency exchange rates.

ITEM 1A.    Risk     Factors           The Companys business, financial condition, results of     operations and cash flows are subject to various risks,     including, but not limited to those set forth below, which could     cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or     from anticipated future results. These risk factors should be     considered together with information included elsewhere in this     Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     An     interruption or slowdown of economic recovery in the markets     served by the Company could adversely affect our business     operating results or financial condition.         Although recently most of our end markets have shown significant     recovery from the global recession, we cannot be certain that     the recovery will continue globally as anticipated. An     interruption or slowdown of the economic recovery in one or more     of our significant markets could have an adverse effect on the     Companys business, results of operations or financial     condition.     The     global nature of our operations subjects the Company to     political and economic risks that could adversely affect our     business, results of operations or financial     condition.         The Company currently operates in 57 countries. In 2010,     approximately 58% of the Companys revenues were generated     from sales to customers outside of the United States. As the     Company continues to expand its global footprint, these sales     may represent an increasing portion of the Companys     revenues. The risks inherent in our global operations include:                         fluctuation in currency exchange rates;                  limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings;                  transportation delays and interruptions;                  political, social and economic instability and disruptions;                  government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions;                  the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;           8    Table of Contents                        import and export controls;                  labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;                  the potential for nationalization of enterprises;                  difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;                  limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and     remedies; and                  potentially adverse tax consequences.           If the Company is unable to successfully manage these and other     risks associated with managing and expanding its international     businesses, the risks could have a material adverse effect on     the Companys business, results of operations or financial     condition.     Our     acquisition of businesses could negatively impact our     profitability and return on invested capital.         As part of our business strategy, we acquire businesses in the     ordinary course. Our acquisitions involve a number of risks and     financial, accounting, managerial and operational challenges,     including the following, any of which could adversely affect our     growth and profitability:                         Any acquired business, technology, service or product could     under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we     paid for it, or not perform in accordance with our anticipated     timetable.                  Acquisitions could cause our financial results to differ from     our expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long     term.                  Acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact     operating results.                  Acquisitions could place unanticipated demands on our     management, operational resources and financial and internal     control systems.                  We may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities     that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater     than anticipated. The realization of any of these liabilities     may increase our expenses or adversely affect our financial     position.                  As a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded significant     goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on our balance     sheet. If we are not able to realize the value of these assets,     we may incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets.       We may     incur fines or penalties, damage to our reputation or other     adverse consequences if our employees, agents or business     partners violate anti-bribery or other laws.         We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will     always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by     our employees, agents or business partners that would violate     U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws,     including anti-bribery laws, competition, and export and import     compliance. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil     or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other     jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal     monetary and non-monetary penalties against us or our     subsidiaries, and could damage our reputation.     A     significant fluctuation between the U.S. dollar and other     currencies could adversely impact our operating     income.         Although the Companys financial results are reported in     U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our sales and     operating costs are realized in other currencies, with the     largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in Europe. The     Companys profitability is affected by movements of the     U.S. dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies     in which we generate revenues and incur expenses. Significant     long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in     particular an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar     against foreign currencies, could have an adverse effect on our     profitability and financial condition.     Diminished     credit availability could adversely impact our ability to     readily obtain financing or to obtain cost-effective     financing.         A deterioration in world financial markets and decreases in     credit availability could make it more difficult for us to     obtain financing when desired or cause the cost of financing to     increase.         9    Table of Contents    Raw     material price increases and supply shortages could adversely     affect results.         The supply of raw materials to the Company and to its component     parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons,     including availability and pricing. Prices for raw materials     necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the     past and significant increases could adversely affect the     Companys results of operations and profit margins. Due to     pricing pressure or other factors, the Company may not be able     to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices     to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability     to do so could be delayed. Consequently, its results of     operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.     If the     Company is unable to successfully introduce new products or     adequately protect its intellectual property, its future growth     may be adversely affected.         The Companys ability to develop new products based on     innovation can affect its competitive position and often     requires the investment of significant resources. Difficulties     or delays in research, development or production of new products     and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new     products and technologies may reduce future revenues and     adversely affect the Companys competitive position.         Protecting the Companys intellectual property is critical     to its innovation efforts. The Company owns a number of patents,     trademarks and licenses related to its products and has     exclusive and non-exclusive rights under patents owned by     others. The Companys intellectual property may be     challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in     countries where property rights are not highly developed or     protected, or the Company may be unable to maintain, renew or     enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of     intellectual property on reasonable terms. Unauthorized use of     the Companys intellectual property rights or inability to     preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely     impact the Companys competitive position and results of     operations.     An     unfavorable environment for making acquisitions may adversely     affect the Companys growth rate.         The Company has historically followed a strategy of identifying     and acquiring businesses with complementary products and     services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential     new platforms. There can be no assurance that the Company will     be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or     that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable     terms. If the Company is unsuccessful in its efforts, its growth     rate could be adversely affected.     Unfavorable     tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect     results.         The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and     in various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax     liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax     jurisdictions. The Companys effective tax rate could be     adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among     countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the     valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws. The     amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing     audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and     by     non-U.S. authorities.     If these audits result in assessments different from amounts     recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax     adjustments.     Our     defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market     risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and     cash flows.         The performance of the financial markets and interest rates     impact our funding obligations under our defined benefit pension     plans. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases     in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan     assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact     our results of operations and cash flows.         10    Table of Contents    Potential     adverse outcome in legal proceedings may adversely affect     results.         The Companys businesses expose it to potential toxic tort     and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in     the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the     products of third-party vendors. The Company currently maintains     insurance programs consisting of self insurance up to certain     limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established     limits. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able     to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance     programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses.     In addition, the Company is subject to the risk that one or more     of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay     claims that may be made in the future. Even if it maintains     adequate insurance programs, successful claims could have a     material adverse effect on the Companys financial     condition, liquidity and results of operations and on its     ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance     in the future.

Capacity levels are somewhat flexible based on     the number of shifts operated and on the number of overtime     hours worked. The Company adds productive capacity from time to     time as required by increased demand. Additions to capacity can     be made within a reasonable period of time due to the nature of     the businesses.             ITEM 3.

On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted new accounting     guidance related to business combinations. The new accounting     guidance requires an entity to recognize assets acquired,     liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent     consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date. This     new guidance also requires prospectively that     (1) acquisition-related costs be expensed as incurred;     (2) restructuring costs generally be recognized as     post-acquisition expenses; and (3) changes in deferred tax     asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after     the measurement period impact income tax expense. Refer to the     Acquisitions note in Item 8. Financial Statements and     Supplementary Data for discussion of the change in accounting     principle.         On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted new accounting     guidance on fair value measurements for all nonfinancial assets     and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at     fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The new accounting guidance     defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell     an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly     transaction between market participants and provides guidance     for measuring fair values and the necessary disclosures. Refer     to the Goodwill and Intangible Assets note in Item 8.     Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of     the change in accounting principle.         On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted new accounting     guidance related to defined benefit plans which required the     Company to change its measurement date to correspond with the     Companys fiscal year-end. The Company previously used a     September 30 measurement date. Refer to the Pension and Other     Postretirement Benefits note in Item 8. Financial     Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the effect     of the change in accounting principle.         On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted new accounting     guidance that addresses how a change or projected change in the     timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a     leveraged lease transaction affects the accounting by a lessor     for that lease.         Information on the comparability of results is included in     Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of     Financial Condition and Results of Operations.             ITEM 7.    Managements     Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of     Operations       INTRODUCTION         Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the Company or     ITW) is a multinational manufacturer of a     diversified range of industrial products and equipment with     operations in 57 countries. These businesses are internally     reported as 60 operating segments to senior management. The     Companys 60 operating segments have been aggregated into     the following eight external reportable segments:     Transportation; Industrial Packaging; Power Systems &     Electronics; Food Equipment; Construction Products;     Polymers & Fluids; Decorative Surfaces; and All Other.         14    Table of Contents        Due to the large number of diverse businesses and the     Companys highly decentralized operating style, the Company     does not require its businesses to provide detailed information     on operating results. Instead, the Companys corporate     management collects data on several key measurements: operating     revenues, operating income, operating margins, overhead costs,     number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in     accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested     capital. These key measures are monitored by management and     significant changes in operating results versus current trends     in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with     operating unit management.         The results of each segment are analyzed by identifying the     effects of changes in the results of the base businesses, newly     acquired companies, restructuring costs, goodwill and intangible     asset impairment charges, and currency translation on the     operating revenues and operating income of each segment. Base     businesses are those businesses that have been included in the     Companys results of operations for more than     12 months. The changes to base business operating income     include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and     changes in variable margins and overhead costs. Operating     leverage is the estimated effect of the base business revenue     changes on operating income, assuming variable margins remain     the same as the prior period. As manufacturing and     administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly     change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing, the     percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage     is usually more than the percentage change in the base business     revenues.         A key element of the Companys business strategy is its     continuous 80/20 business process for both existing businesses     and new acquisitions. The basic concept of this 80/20 business     process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the     items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time     and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which     account for 20% of the value). The Companys operations use     this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key     parts of their business, and as a result, reduce complexity that     often disguises what is truly important. The Companys     operations utilize the 80/20 process in various aspects of their     businesses. Common applications of the 80/20 business process     include:                         Simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products     offered by combining the features of similar products,     outsourcing products or, as a last resort, eliminating low-value     products.                  Segmenting the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers     separately and finding alternative ways to serve the 20/80     customers.                  Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers     and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.                  Designing business processes, systems and measurements around     the 80/20 activities.           The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is     that the Company has over time improved its long-term operating     and financial performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in     restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins.     Corporate management works closely with those businesses that     have operating results below expectations to help those     businesses better apply this 80/20 business process and improve     their results.     CONSOLIDATED     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS         The Companys consolidated results of operations for 2010,     2009 and 2008 are summarized as follows:                                                   Dollars in Thousands       2010       2009       2008                Operating revenues            $       15,870,376               $       13,877,068               $       17,100,341              Operating income                2,356,678                   1,385,979                   2,501,286              Margin %                14.8       %               10.0       %               14.6       %             15    Table of Contents        In 2010 and 2009, the changes in revenues, operating income and     operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the     following factors:                                                                                               2010 Compared to 2009           2009 Compared to 2008                             % Point Increase                        % Point Increase                  % Increase (Decrease)           (Decrease)           % Increase (Decrease)           (Decrease)                 Operating            Operating            Operating            Operating            Operating            Operating                  Revenues           Income           Margins           Revenues           Income           Margins                    Base business:                                                                                                           Revenue change/Operating leverage                10.8       %               44.2       %               3.0       %               (18.4       )%               (51.8       )%               (6.0       )%          Changes in variable margins and overhead costs                                   6.0                   0.6                                      21.2                   3.8                                                                                                                               10.8                   50.2                   3.6                   (18.4       )               (30.6       )               (2.2       )                                                                                                                Acquisitions and divestitures                3.0                   1.9                   (0.2       )               4.2                                      (0.6       )          Restructuring costs                                   8.9                   0.8                                      (4.1       )               (0.7       )          Impairment of goodwill and intangibles                                   7.5                   0.7                                      (4.1       )               (0.7       )          Translation                0.8                   1.5                                      (4.8       )               (5.8       )               (0.4       )          Other                (0.2       )                                  (0.1       )               0.2                                                                                                                                                                     14.4       %               70.0       %               4.8       %               (18.8       )%               (44.6       )%               (4.6       )%                                                                                                               Operating Revenues         Revenues increased 14.4% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to     higher base revenues and revenues from acquisitions. Base     revenues increased 10.8% in 2010 versus 2009 as the Company saw     improvement in macroeconomic indices across many geographies as     worldwide end markets began to recover from the global     recession. North American and international base revenues     increased 10.9% and 10.4%, respectively, in 2010 versus 2009.     End markets associated with transportation, welding, industrial     packaging and PC board/electronics showed improvement in 2010.     The company anticipates continued macroeconomic improvement in     2011.         Revenues decreased 18.8% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to     lower base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency     translation, mainly due to the strengthening of the dollar,     partially offset by revenues from acquisitions. Total base     revenues declined 18.4% in 2009 versus 2008. Base revenues     declined 21.6% and 14.9% for North American and international     businesses, respectively, as both were adversely affected by the     global recession and weak industrial production in related end     markets throughout 2009.     Operating Income         Operating income increased 70.0% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily     due to the increase in base revenues, lower restructuring     expenses, and 2009 goodwill and intangible asset impairment     charges. Base margins increased 360 basis points primarily     due to positive leverage from the increase in base revenues.     Additionally, benefits from restructuring projects were     partially offset by unfavorable selling price versus material     cost comparisons. Lower restructuring expenses in 2010 versus     2009 reflect the Companys 2009 efforts to reduce costs in     response to weak economic conditions. In 2009, the Company     recorded impairment charges of $90.0 million and     $15.6 million against goodwill and intangibles,     respectively, compared to $1.0 million in intangible asset     impairment charges in 2010.         Operating income declined 44.6% in 2009 versus 2008 due to the     decline in base revenues, the negative effect of currency     translation, increased restructuring expenses and increased     goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. In 2009, the     Company recorded impairment charges of $90.0 million and     $15.6 million against goodwill and intangibles,     respectively. The goodwill and intangible asset impairments were     primarily related to new reporting units which were acquired     over the last few years before the recent economic downturn.     These charges were driven primarily by lower current forecasts     compared to the expected          16    Table of Contents        forecasts at the time the reporting units were acquired. The     higher restructuring expenses reflected the Companys     efforts to reduce costs in response to weak economic conditions.     Improvements in base variable margins and lower overhead costs     increased base margins 380 basis points in 2009, as the     cumulative benefits of restructuring projects began to be     realized and selling price versus material cost comparisons were     favorable. Total margins declined by 460 basis points in     2009 primarily due to the declines in base revenues,     restructuring expenses and the goodwill and intangible asset     impairment charges.     TRANSPORTATION         Businesses in this segment produce components, fasteners, fluids     and polymers, as well as truck remanufacturing and related parts     and service.         In the Transportation segment, products and services include:                         metal and plastic components, fasteners and assemblies for     automobiles and light trucks;                  fluids and polymers for auto aftermarket maintenance and     appearance;                  fillers and putties for auto body repair;                  polyester coatings and patch and repair products for the marine     industry; and                  truck remanufacturing and related parts and service.

The increase in     acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a North     American          17    Table of Contents        automotive aftermarket business in the second quarter of 2010.     Worldwide automotive base revenues increased 30.6%. North     American automotive base revenues increased 37.8% in 2010 versus     2009 primarily due to an increase in auto builds of     approximately 39%. International automotive base revenues     increased 25.1% primarily due to an increase in European auto     builds of approximately 16% and increased product penetration.     The automotive aftermarket businesses, which were less impacted     in 2009 by the economic downturn, were virtually flat over the     prior year. Base revenues for the truck remanufacturing and     related parts and service business declined 5.4% over the prior     year.         Revenues declined 12.2% in 2009 versus 2008 due to declines in     base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency     translation. Acquisition revenues partially mitigated the base     revenue decrease and were primarily related to the purchase of a     North American truck remanufacturing and related parts and     service business in the third quarter of 2008. Worldwide     automotive base revenues declined 19.0% for the full year.     North American automotive base revenues declined 23.3% in     2009 due to a decline in auto builds of 32%. International     automotive base revenues declined 15.4% in 2009 due to a 24%     decline in European auto builds. The automotive aftermarket     businesses, which were less impacted by the economic downturn,     declined 9.5%.     Operating     Income         Operating income increased 160.4% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily     due to the increase in base revenues, lower restructuring     expenses, 2009 goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges,     and income from acquisitions. Base margins increased     620 basis points primarily due to the positive leverage     effect of the increase in base revenues described above,     benefits from restructuring projects and favorable inventory     obsolescence expense comparisons. During the third quarter of     2009, a $12.0 million goodwill impairment charge was     recorded in the truck remanufacturing and related parts and     service business.         Operating income decreased 47.4% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily     due to the decline in base revenues described above, the     unfavorable effect of currency translation and higher     restructuring expenses. In addition, a $12.0 million     goodwill impairment charge was recorded in the third quarter of     2009 related to the North American truck remanufacturing and     related parts and service business. The increase in     restructuring expenses was primarily due to efforts to reduce     costs in response to the decline in worldwide automotive     production. Total operating margins declined by 470 basis     points primarily due to the decline in base revenues described     above, partially offset by reductions in overhead expenses,     favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons and     benefits of restructuring projects.

Base revenues increased 23.2%     for the North American strapping businesses in 2010 largely     due to an increase in steel and plastic strap volume driven by     improved industrial production demand in key industries     including primary metals and general industrial. The     international strapping businesses increased 10.5% while     worldwide protective packaging increased 16.4% over the prior     period. Acquisition revenue increased primarily due to the     purchase of a North American protective packaging business in     the fourth quarter of 2009.         Revenues decreased 26.4% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to     lower base revenues and the unfavorable impact of currency     translation. Base revenues declined 35.3% for the North American     strapping businesses largely due to declines in consumable and     equipment volume in key end markets such as primary metals,     construction and general industrial. The international strapping     businesses declined 25.6% due to the global decrease in     industrial production activity. Worldwide stretch and protective     packaging declined 13.8% and 1.3%, respectively.     Operating     Income         Operating income increased 165.5% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily     due to the increase in base revenues and lower restructuring     expenses. Base operating margins increased 450 basis points     primarily driven by leverage from the increase in base revenues     and restructuring benefits, partially offset by unfavorable     selling price versus material cost comparisons. Lower     restructuring expenses compared to 2009 increased total     operating margins by 130 basis points.         Operating income decreased 68.4% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily     due to the negative leverage effect of the decline in base     revenues described above, the negative effect of currency     translation and higher restructuring expenses. Base margins     declined 460 basis points primarily due to the decline in     base revenues discussed above, partially offset by favorable     selling price versus material cost comparisons and reduced     overhead costs as the benefits of restructuring projects began     to be realized.         19    Table of Contents    POWER     SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS         Businesses in this segment produce equipment and consumables     associated with specialty power conversion, metallurgy and     electronics.

Worldwide welding base revenues     increased 11.0%. North American welding base business revenues     increased 15.9% as end markets began to experience recovery,     particularly for heavy equipment OEMs and general     manufacturers. Base business revenues for the international     welding businesses increased 1.0% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily     due to increased oil and gas end market activity, partially     offset by declines in Asian shipyard activity. Base          20    Table of Contents        revenues for the PC board fabrication businesses increased 71.6%     as demand for consumer electronics and capital equipment     increased significantly.         Revenues declined 31.4% in 2009 versus 2008 mainly due to     declines in base revenues and the negative effect of currency     translation. Revenues fell as end market demand declined across     the broad spectrum of industries that this segment serves,     including key end markets such as commercial construction and     general industrial. The revenue decrease was partially offset by     2008 acquisitions, including a welding equipment business and a     PC board fabrication business. Worldwide base welding revenues     declined 32.6% in 2009. North American welding base businesses     declined 36.3% while international welding base businesses     declined 23.5%. Base revenues for the electronics businesses     fell 29.4% while base revenues in the PC board fabrication     businesses fell 44.9%, both largely due to the decline in     consumer demand for electronics during 2009.     Operating     Income         Operating income increased 89.2% in 2010 versus 2009 mainly due     to the favorable leverage effect of the growth in base revenues,     2009 impairment charges and lower restructuring expenses. Base     margins increased 530 basis points primarily due to the     favorable leverage effect of the growth in base revenues, the     cumulative benefits of restructuring projects and favorable     product mix, partially offset by unfavorable selling price     versus material cost comparisons. During the first quarter of     2009, $24.7 million of goodwill and intangible asset     impairment charges were recorded in the PC Board fabrication and     welding accessories businesses.         Operating income decreased 53.0% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily     due to the declines in base revenues described above, 2009     impairment charges, higher restructuring expenses and the     negative effect of currency translation. Goodwill and intangible     asset impairment charges of $18.0 million and     $6.7 million, respectively, were incurred in the PC board     fabrication and welding accessories businesses in the first     quarter of 2009. Base margins decreased 260 basis points     primarily due to the decline in base revenues, partially offset     by favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons,     benefits of restructuring projects and lower overhead costs.

North     American base revenues declined 1.4% in 2010 versus 2009     primarily due to declines in equipment sales for end markets     including the lodging and casino markets. Base revenues in the     service portion of the business increased 1.5% as customers     continued to maintain existing equipment. International base     revenues increased 2.4% for the period largely due to increased     Asian and Latin American revenue offset by lower European     equipment sales in 2010 versus 2009. The acquired revenues were     attributable to the acquisition of a European food equipment     business in the third quarter of 2010.         Revenues decreased 12.8% in 2009 versus 2008 due to the decline     in base business and the unfavorable effect of currency     translation, partially offset by revenues from acquisitions. The     acquired revenues were attributable to the acquisition of a     European food equipment business. North American food equipment     base revenues declined 11.2% while international food equipment     base revenues declined 7.9% in 2009 as a result of weak demand     across all worldwide markets. Base revenues for the North     American institutional/restaurant businesses declined 14.7% as     customers delayed equipment purchases. Base service revenues     declined a moderate 1.2% as customers continued to maintain     existing equipment.     Operating     Income         Operating income increased 1.8% in 2010 versus 2009. Base     business margins decreased 40 basis points primarily due to     higher overhead expenses and adjustments related to a European     business, partially offset by favorable selling price versus     material cost comparisons and benefits from restructuring. Lower     restructuring expenses in 2010 versus 2009 increased total     operating margins by 60 basis points.         Operating income declined 20.5% in 2009 versus 2008 due to the     decrease in base revenues described above and the unfavorable     effect of currency translation and restructuring expenses. Base     margins decreased 40 basis points primarily due to the     decline in base revenues, partially offset by margin gains from     favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons,     benefits from restructuring projects and favorable product mix.         22    Table of Contents    CONSTRUCTION     PRODUCTS         Businesses in this segment produce tools, fasteners and other     products for construction applications.

European base revenues     increased 8.4% in 2010 primarily due to improved market     conditions. Base revenues for the Asia-Pacific region increased     3.7% as market conditions in the Australian residential     construction market improved. North American base revenues     increased 1.8% primarily due to modest inventory restocking and     a one-time licensing agreement settlement in the second quarter     of 2010 in the commercial construction business. The North     American base business was negatively impacted by an 8% decline     in U.S. housing starts on an annualized basis and an 18%     decline in commercial construction square footage activity.     Acquisition revenue was primarily the result of the purchase of     a European business in the second quarter of 2010.         Revenues declined 23.2% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily as a     result of the decline in base revenues and the unfavorable     effect of currency translation. Base revenues for the North     American, European and Asia-Pacific regions decreased 26.7%,     22.9% and 1.1%, respectively, primarily due to weakness in the     residential and commercial construction markets in North America     and Europe. U.S. housing starts declined 14% on          23    Table of Contents        an annualized basis in 2009 versus 2008. In addition,     U.S. commercial construction square footage activity fell     46% for the year versus 2008. The Asia-Pacific region     outperformed other regions largely due to better customer     activity in Australia and New Zealand.     Operating Income         Operating income increased 105.3% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily     due to positive leverage from the increase in base revenues     described above, lower operating expenses and the favorable     effect of currency translation, partially offset by higher     restructuring expenses. Base margins increased 540 basis     points versus the prior year primarily due to the favorable     leverage effect of the increase in base revenues, favorable     selling price versus material cost comparisons, favorable     inventory obsolescence expense comparisons, benefits from     restructuring projects and a favorable one-time licensing     agreement settlement in the second quarter of 2010 in the     commercial construction business.         Operating income decreased 60.0% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily     due to the base revenue decline described above. In addition,     the unfavorable effect of currency translation and higher     restructuring expenses contributed to the lower income and     margins. Base margins declined 430 basis points as reduced     operating expenses, including favorable selling price versus     material cost comparisons and benefits from restructuring     projects, were more than offset by the effect of lower base     revenues.

The results of operations for the Polymers & Fluids     segment for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:                                                   Dollars in Thousands       2010       2009       2008                Operating revenues            $       1,359,542               $       1,195,750               $       1,295,972              Operating income                200,295                   80,231                   190,805              Margin %                14.7       %               6.7       %               14.7       %             24    Table of Contents        In 2010 and 2009, the changes in revenues, operating income and     operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the     following factors:                                                                                               2010 Compared to 2009           2009 Compared to 2008                             % Point Increase                        % Point Increase                  % Increase (Decrease)           (Decrease)           % Increase (Decrease)           (Decrease)                 Operating            Operating            Operating            Operating            Operating            Operating                  Revenues           Income           Margins           Revenues           Income           Margins                    Base business:                                                                                                           Revenue change/Operating leverage                8.0       %               49.9       %               2.6       %               (12.5       )%               (34.7       )%               (3.7       )%          Changes in variable margins and overhead costs                                   4.9                   0.3                                      21.1                   3.5                                                                                                                               8.0                   54.8                   2.9                   (12.5       )               (13.6       )               (0.2       )                                                                                                                Acquisitions                4.8                   5.7                   (0.3       )               10.6                   (1.8       )               (1.2       )          Restructuring costs                                   11.7                   0.7                                      (4.1       )               (0.7       )          Impairment of goodwill and intangibles                                   75.3                   4.7                                      (31.6       )               (5.3       )          Translation                0.9                   2.1                                      (5.9       )               (6.9       )               (0.6       )          Other                                                                         0.1                                                                                                                                                                     13.7       %               149.6       %               8.0       %               (7.7       )%               (58.0       )%               (8.0       )%                                                                                                               Operating     Revenues         Revenues increased 13.7% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to an     increase in base revenues and revenues from acquisitions.     Acquisition revenue was primarily the result of the purchase of     four Latin American adhesive businesses in 2009 and a Latin     American polymers business in the third quarter of 2010. Total     base revenues for both the polymers and fluids businesses     increased 8.0% due to recovery in most of the industrial based     end markets served by the worldwide polymers and fluids     businesses. Growth in the emerging markets of Brazil and China     was particularly strong during the year.         Revenues decreased 7.7% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to     lower base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency     translation, partially offset by revenues from acquisitions.     Acquisition revenue was primarily the result of the purchase of     a pressure sensitive adhesives business and two construction     adhesives businesses in 2008. Total base revenues declined 12.5%     primarily due to weakness in worldwide industrial production and     construction end markets. Worldwide base revenues for the fluids     businesses declined 10.5% while base revenues for the polymers     businesses declined 13.8% in 2009.     Operating     Income         Operating income increased 149.6% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily     due to the increase in base revenues described above, lower     restructuring expenses and a 2009 goodwill impairment charge.     During the first quarter of 2009, a $60.0 million goodwill     impairment charge was recorded against the pressure sensitive     adhesives business. Base margins increased 290 basis points     versus last year primarily due to the positive leverage effect     of the increase in base revenues and benefits of restructuring     projects.         Operating income decreased 58.0% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily     due to the decline in base revenues and the $60.0 million     goodwill impairment charge against the pressure sensitive     adhesives business in the first quarter of 2009. Base margins     decreased 20 basis points as favorable selling price versus     material cost comparisons and the benefits of restructuring     projects were more than offset by the effect of lower base     revenues. The first quarter 2009 goodwill impairment charge     reduced total operating margins by 530 basis points.     Additionally, acquisitions diluted margins 120 basis points     for the year.         25    Table of Contents    DECORATIVE     SURFACES         Businesses in this segment produce decorative surfacing     materials for furniture, office and retail space, countertops     and other applications.

Base revenues increased 3.2% for the     North American laminate business primarily due to improvement in     the commercial construction sector including office equipment.     International base revenues increased 1.2% primarily due to     improvements in Asian end markets, partially offset by modest     declines in European end markets. Base revenues for the flooring     business declined 37.1% as the Company is in the process of     closing its flooring business.         Revenues decreased 18.9% in 2009 versus 2008 due to lower base     revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation.     North American laminate base revenues declined 18.9% as a result     of the downturn in North American commercial and residential     construction. These declines were partially offset by product     penetration in the premium high-definition laminate product     market. International base revenues declined 9.7% due to     European volume declines.         26    Table of Contents    Operating     Income         Operating income decreased 8.0% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily     due to higher operating costs. Base margins decreased     110 basis points versus the prior year primarily due to     costs related to the closing of the flooring business and     unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons,     partially offset by the benefits of restructuring projects and     the positive leverage of the increase in base revenues.         Operating income decreased 20.2% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily     due to the decline in base revenues, increased restructuring     expenses and the unfavorable effect of currency translation.     Base margins increased 40 basis points primarily due to     favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons,     benefits from restructuring projects and higher margins on the     high-definition laminate product, partially offset by the effect     of lower base revenues.

The acquisition revenue was primarily due to the     purchase of a consumer packaging business in the fourth quarter     of 2009. Base business revenues increased 7.8% for the test and     measurement businesses due to increased demand for capital     equipment, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Base     revenues increased 6.7% in 2010 versus 2009 for the consumer     packaging business due to improvement in decorating end markets.     Base revenues for the industrial plastics and metals businesses     improved 15.1% due to increased demand for domestic appliances.     Base revenues increased 16.3% for the finishing businesses due     to improved North American and international industrial end     market demand.         Revenues decreased 13.6% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to     the decline in base business revenues and the unfavorable effect     of currency translation, partially offset by an increase in     revenues from acquired companies. The acquisition revenue was     primarily related to the purchase of two test and measurement     businesses in 2008. Base revenues declined 15.6%, 12.2%, 21.5%     and 32.5%, for the test and measurement, consumer packaging,     industrial plastics and metals and finishing businesses,     respectively, due to negative industrial production trends and     the related impact of weak end market and capital equipment     demand across the broad spectrum of industries this segment     serves.     Operating     Income         Operating income increased 46.5% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily     due to the growth in base revenues and lower restructuring     expenses. Base margins increased 320 basis points primarily     due to the positive leverage effect from the increase in base     revenues and benefits from past restructuring projects,     partially offset by unfavorable selling price versus material     cost comparisons. In addition, lower restructuring costs     increased total operating margins by 110 basis points.     Acquisitions and divestitures diluted total operating margins by     70 basis points in 2010.         Operating income declined 33.5% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily     due to the decline in base revenues described above, higher     restructuring expenses and the unfavorable effect of currency     translation, partially offset by increased income from     acquisitions. Base margins decreased 180 basis points as     favorable selling          28    Table of Contents        price versus material cost comparisons and benefits from     restructuring projects were more than offset by the effect of     lower base revenues. Additionally, acquisitions diluted total     margins by 90 basis points.     AMORTIZATION     OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS         Amortization expense increased to $212.9 million in 2010     and $203.2 million in 2009, versus $184.4 million in     2008, due to intangible asset amortization related to newly     acquired businesses.     IMPAIRMENT     OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS         Total goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges by     segment for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and     2008 were as follows:                                                   In Thousands       2010           2009           2008                    Transportation            $                      $       14,414               $       13              Industrial Packaging                                   386                                 Power Systems & Electronics                                   28,337                   824              Food Equipment                                   46                                 Polymers & Fluids                                   60,416                   251              All Other                1,006                   1,969                   487                                                                           $       1,006               $       105,568               $       1,575                                                                       The Company recorded $1.0 million of intangible asset     impairment charges in 2010 versus $105.6 million of     goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges in 2009.     The 2009 charges were primarily due to goodwill impairment     charges related to the pressure sensitive adhesives reporting     unit of $60.0 million, the PC board fabrication reporting     unit of $18.0 million and the truck remanufacturing and     related parts and service reporting unit of $12.0 million.     Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets was     $105.6 million in 2009 versus $1.6 million in 2008.     See the Goodwill and Intangible Assets note in Item 8.     Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details     of the impairment charges.     INTEREST     EXPENSE         Interest expense increased to $175.5 million in 2010 versus     $164.8 million in 2009 primarily due to interest on the     6.25% and 5.15% notes which were issued in March 2009,     partially offset by lower interest related to the     5.75% notes repaid at maturity in March 2009, and lower     commercial paper borrowings. Interest expense increased to     $164.8 million in 2009 versus $154.5 million in 2008     primarily due to interest on the 6.25% and 5.15% notes,     partially offset by lower interest related to the     5.75% notes, lower interest related to the     6.875% notes repaid at maturity in November 2008, and lower     commercial paper rates and borrowings. The weighted-average     interest rate on commercial paper was 0.2% in 2010, 0.3% in 2009     and 2.4% in 2008.     OTHER     INCOME (EXPENSE)         Other income (expense) was income of $30.8 million in 2010     versus expense of $7.4 million in 2009. The increase was     primarily due to gains on disposal of operating affiliates of     $12.8 million (versus a loss of $6.7 million in 2009),     and higher income from investments of $20.8 million (versus     $4.9 million in 2009).         Other income (expense) was expense of $7.4 million in 2009     versus income of $4.7 million in 2008. The decrease was     primarily due to 2009 losses on foreign currency transactions of     $24.9 million, lower income from investments of     $4.9 million (versus $17.0 million in 2008) and     lower interest income of $17.6 million (versus     $29.4 million in 2008), partially offset by the impact of     the German transfer tax charge of $44.0 million in 2008.         29    Table of Contents    INCOME     TAXES         The effective tax rate was 31.0% in 2010, 20.1% in 2009 and     28.1% in 2008. The effective tax rate for 2010 was unfavorably     impacted by the discrete tax charge of $21.9 million in the     first quarter of 2010 related to the Patient Protection and     Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education     Reconciliation Act, signed into law in March 2010. The effective     tax rate for 2009 was favorably impacted by discrete tax     adjustments in the fourth quarter of $85.5 million related     to a global legal structure reorganization and     $77.5 million related to a favorable settlement reached     with the German tax authorities. In the above mentioned     reorganization, the Company reorganized its ownership structure     in certain U.S. and foreign subsidiaries in the fourth     quarter of 2009 and made an election regarding the U.S. tax     treatment of a foreign subsidiary. The Company recorded a     reduction in tax expense primarily for the effect of the     resulting foreign tax credits. Also during the fourth quarter of     2009, the Company finalized a settlement with the German tax     authorities primarily regarding the treatment of an intercompany     financing transaction which resulted in the reversal of     previously established tax reserves as a reduction of tax     expense.         The Company has been litigating its dispute with the Australian     Tax Office over the tax treatment of an intercompany financing     transaction between the U.S. and Australia. The case was     heard before the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria, in     September 2010. The proceedings result from the Companys     appeal of a decision by the Australian Tax Commissioner to     disallow income tax deductions for income tax years 2002 through     2005 and the assessment of withholding taxes for income tax year     2003. The Company also contested the Commissioners similar     determination for income tax years 2006 and 2007; however, the     parties agreed to defer the appeal of that determination until a     decision was made on the earlier years. On February 4,     2011, the Federal Court of Australia decided in the     Companys favor with respect to a significant portion of     the income tax deductions. The Court issued the final orders on     February 18, 2011. Based on this decision, the Company     expects in 2011 to decrease its unrecognized tax benefits     related to this matter by approximately $186 million and     decrease tax expense by approximately $166 million. The     Australian Tax Office has 21 days from the date the Court     issued its final orders to appeal the decision.         See the Income Taxes note in Item 8. Financial Statements     and Supplementary Data for a reconciliation of the     U.S. Federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate.     INCOME     FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS         Income from continuing operations in 2010 of $1.5 billion     ($3.03 per diluted share) was 57.5% higher than 2009 income of     $969.5 million ($1.93 per diluted share). Income from     continuing operations in 2009 was 42.7% lower than 2008 income     of $1.7 billion ($3.24 per diluted share).     FOREIGN     CURRENCY         The weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies     increased operating revenues by approximately $153 million     in 2010 and increased income from continuing operations by     approximately 6 cents per diluted share. The strengthening of     the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies decreased     operating revenues by approximately $653 million in 2009     and decreased income from continuing operations by approximately     10 cents per diluted share.     DISCONTINUED     OPERATIONS         Loss from discontinued operations was $22.5 million in 2009     versus $172.1 million in 2008, primarily due to 2008     impairment on goodwill of $132.6 million, and a loss     reserve on assets held for sale of $64.0 million partially     offset by gains on sales of discontinued operations in 2008     versus losses in 2009. See the Discontinued Operations note in     Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for     further information.         30    Table of Contents    NEW     ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS         In October 2009, new accounting guidance was issued on     multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. The new accounting     guidance amends the accounting for multiple-deliverable     arrangements to enable the vendor to account for products or     services separately rather than as a combined unit. The guidance     establishes a hierarchy for determining the selling price of a     deliverable, which is based on: (1) vendor-specific     objective evidence, (2) third-party evidence or     (3) estimates. The Company will adopt the new accounting     guidance on January 1, 2011 and does not expect the new     guidance to materially affect the Companys financial     position or results of operations.     2011     INTERNATIONAL REPORTING CHANGE         Effective January 1, 2011, the Company will be eliminating     the one month lag for the reporting of its international     operations outside of North America. As a result, the Company     will report both North American and international results on a     calendar year basis. Prior to this, the international fiscal     reporting period began in December and ended in November.     LIQUIDITY     AND CAPITAL RESOURCES         The Companys primary sources of liquidity are free     operating cash flows and short-term credit facilities.     Management continues to believe that internally generated cash     flows will be adequate to service debt, continue to pay     dividends, to finance internal growth and to fund small to     medium-sized acquisitions.         The primary uses of liquidity are:                         dividend payments  the Companys dividend payout     guidelines are 30% to 45% of the last two years average     free operating cash flow;                  acquisitions; and                  any excess liquidity may be used for share repurchases.       Cash     Flow         The Company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow     generated by operations that is available for dividends,     acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. The Company     believes this measure is useful to investors in evaluating our     financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash     internally to fund Company initiatives. Free operating cash     flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from     operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not     be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other     companies.         Summarized cash flow information for the three years ended     December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was as follows:                                                   In Thousands       2010           2009           2008                    Net cash provided by operating activities            $       1,560,790               $       2,146,589               $       2,222,224              Additions to plant and equipment                (286,172       )               (247,102       )               (362,312       )                                                                Free operating cash flow            $       1,274,618               $       1,899,487               $       1,859,912                                                                    Cash dividends paid            $       (636,200       )           $       (619,681       )           $       (598,690       )          Acquisitions                (433,403       )               (281,674       )               (1,546,982       )          Repurchases of common stock                (350,000       )                                  (1,390,594       )          Net proceeds (repayments) of debt                (185,364       )               (736,470       )               1,467,613              Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and equivalents                (34,747       )               183,722                   (82,002       )          Other                236,362                   130,438                   206,169                                                                    Net increase (decrease) in cash and equivalents            $       (128,734       )           $       575,822               $       (84,574       )                                                                   31    Table of Contents        On August 20, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors     authorized a stock repurchase program, which provides for the     buyback of up to $3.0 billion of the Companys common     stock over an open-ended period of time. Through     December 31, 2010, the Company repurchased     47.9 million shares of its common stock under this program     at an average price of $44.48 per share. There are approximately     $871 million of authorized repurchases remaining under this     program.     Return     on Average Invested Capital         The Company uses return on average invested capital     (ROIC) to measure the effectiveness of its     operations use of invested capital to generate profits.     The Company believes that ROIC is a meaningful metric to     investors in evaluating the Companys financial performance     and may be different than the method used by other companies to     calculate ROIC. Invested capital represents the net assets of     the Company, excluding cash and cash equivalents and outstanding     debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital     investment in the Companys operations. Average invested     capital is calculated using balances at the start of the year     and at the end of each quarter. ROIC for the three years ended     December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 was as follows:                                                   Dollars in Thousands       2010           2009           2008                    Operating income            $       2,356,678               $       1,385,979               $       2,501,286              Taxes (31.0%, 20.1% and 28.1%, respectively)                (729,628       )               (278,998       )               (702,611       )                                                                Operating income after taxes            $       1,627,050               $       1,106,981               $       1,798,675                                                                    Invested Capital:                                                           Trade receivables            $       2,678,084               $       2,491,492               $       2,571,987              Inventories                1,547,447                   1,356,233                   1,774,697              Net plant and equipment                2,023,045                   2,136,527                   2,109,432              Investments                441,606                   451,293                   465,894              Goodwill and intangible assets                6,573,943                   6,584,149                   6,297,219              Accounts payable and accrued expenses                (2,147,516       )               (2,048,966       )               (1,999,097       )          Net assets held for sale                                                      61,525              Other, net                (95,655       )               (343,069       )               (667,660       )                                                                Total invested capital            $       11,020,954               $       10,627,659               $       10,613,997                                                                    Average invested capital            $       10,645,278               $       10,390,424               $       11,235,625                                                                    Return on average invested capital                15.3       %               10.7       %               16.0       %                                                                   The 460 basis point increase in ROIC in 2010 versus 2009     was the result of after-tax operating income increasing 47.0%,     primarily due to an increase in base business, while average     invested capital increased slightly.         The 530 basis point decrease in ROIC in 2009 versus 2008     was the result of after-tax operating income decreasing 38.5%,     resulting from the economic downturn, while average invested     capital decreased 7.5%.         32    Table of Contents    Working     Capital         Net working capital at December 31, 2010 and 2009 is     summarized as follows:                                                                                   Increase          Dollars in Thousands       2010           2009           (Decrease)                    Current Assets:                                                           Cash and equivalents            $       1,190,038               $       1,318,772               $       (128,734       )          Trade receivables                2,678,084                   2,491,492                   186,592              Inventories                1,547,447                   1,356,233                   191,214              Other                552,832                   508,098                   44,734                                                                               5,968,401                   5,674,595                   293,806                                                                    Current Liabilities:                                                           Short-term debt                317,787                   213,681                   104,106              Accounts payable and accrued expenses                2,147,516                   2,048,966                   98,550              Other                628,289                   572,991                   55,298                                                                               3,093,592                   2,835,638                   257,954                                                                    Net Working Capital            $       2,874,809               $       2,838,957               $       35,852                                                                    Current Ratio                1.93                   2.00                                                                                   Debt         Total debt at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was as follows:                                                                                   Increase          Dollars in Thousands       2010           2009           (Decrease)                    Short-term debt            $       317,787               $       213,681               $       104,106              Long-term debt                2,511,959                   2,914,874                   (402,915       )                                                                Total debt            $       2,829,746               $       3,128,555               $       (298,809       )                                                                Total debt to total capitalization                23.2       %               26.2       %                                                                                   The Company issues commercial paper to fund general corporate     needs and to fund small and medium-sized acquisitions. As of     December 31, 2010, the Company had no amounts outstanding     under its commercial paper program. The Company has committed     lines of credit of $2.5 billion in the U.S. to support     the potential issuances of commercial paper. Of this amount,     $1.0 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement     with a termination date of June 10, 2011 and     $1.0 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement     with a termination date of June 11, 2013. The remaining     $500 million is provided under a revolving credit facility     that terminates on June 15, 2012. No amounts are     outstanding under these three facilities. The Companys     foreign operations also have unused capacity on uncommitted     facilities of approximately $318 million.         The Company believes that based on its current free operating     cash flow,     debt-to-capitalization     ratios and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional     financing if necessary. The Companys targeted     debt-to-capital     ratio is 20% to 30%, excluding the impact of any larger     acquisitions.         33    Table of Contents    Stockholders     Equity         The changes to stockholders equity during 2010 and 2009     were as follows:                                       In Thousands       2010           2009                    Beginning balance            $       8,817,876               $       7,675,091              Net income                1,527,193                   947,009              Cash dividends declared                (649,709       )               (620,679       )          Repurchases of common stock                (350,000       )                             Stock option and restricted stock activity                186,818                   165,007              Currency translation adjustments                (180,149       )               716,208              Other                29,217                   (64,760       )                                                Ending balance            $       9,381,246               $       8,817,876                                                   CONTRACTUAL     OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS         The Companys significant contractual obligations as of     December 31, 2010 were as follows:                                                                                                                                                           2016 and          In Thousands       2011           2012           2013           2014           2015           Future Years                    Total long-term debt            $       252,236               $       16,572               $       6,132               $       1,776,592               $       2,688               $       709,975              Interest payments on notes and preferred debt securities                153,509                   136,873                   136,635                   107,305                   43,982                   154,006              Minimum lease payments                150,509                   109,472                   83,673                   58,649                   43,952                   73,956                                                                                                                           $       556,254               $       262,917               $       226,440               $       1,942,546               $       90,622               $       937,937                                                                                                                       As of December 31, 2010, the Company has recorded income     taxes payable, including liabilities for unrecognized tax     benefits, of $459.1 million. The Company is not able to     reasonably estimate the timing of payments related to the     liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits.         At December 31, 2010, the Company had open stand-by letters     of credit of approximately $181 million, substantially all     of which expire in 2011. The Company had no other significant     off-balance sheet commitments at December 31, 2010.     CRITICAL     ACCOUNTING POLICIES         The Company has six accounting policies which it believes are     most important to the Companys financial condition and     results of operations, and which require the Company to make     estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.     Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on     various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the     circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making     judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities     that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results     may differ from these estimates.         These critical accounting policies are as follows:     Realizability of Inventories       Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.     Generally, the Companys businesses perform an analysis of     the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on     hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to     market value based on the following usage criteria:                                 Usage Classification       Criteria       Reserve %                Active            Quantity on hand is less than prior 6 months usage               0       %          Slow-moving            Some usage in last 12 months, but quantity on hand exceeds     prior 6 months usage               50       %          Obsolete            No usage in the last 12 months               90       %             34    Table of Contents        In addition, for approximately half of the     U.S. inventories, the Company has elected to use the     last-in,     first-out (LIFO) method of inventory costing.     Generally, this method results in a lower inventory value than     the     first-in,     first-out (FIFO) method due to the effects of     inflation.     Collectibility of Accounts Receivable      The Company estimates the allowance     for uncollectible accounts based on the greater of a specific     reserve or a reserve calculated based on the historical     write-off percentage over the last two years. In addition, the     allowance for uncollectible accounts includes reserves for     customer credits and cash discounts, which are also estimated     based on past experience.     Depreciation of Plant and Equipment      The Companys     U.S. businesses compute depreciation on an accelerated     basis, as follows:                           Buildings and improvements            150% declining balance          Machinery and equipment            200% declining balance             The majority of the international businesses compute     depreciation on a straight-line basis to conform to their local     statutory accounting and tax regulations.     Income Taxes  The Company     provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the     estimated future tax effects of differences between the     financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on     currently enacted tax laws. The Companys deferred and     other tax balances are based on managements interpretation     of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing     jurisdictions. Income tax expense and liabilities recognized by     the Company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions     regarding, among other things, the level of future taxable     income and effect of the Companys various tax planning     strategies. Future tax authority rulings and changes in tax     laws, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future     tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax     rate and tax balances recorded by the Company.     Goodwill and Intangible Assets  The     Companys business acquisitions typically result in     recording goodwill and intangible assets, which are a     significant portion of the Companys total assets and     affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges     that the Company could incur in future periods. The Company     follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to     test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. On an annual     basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the     Company compares the estimated fair value of its 60 reporting     units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine     if a goodwill impairment exists. If the fair value of a     reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment     loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied     fair value and the carrying value of the reporting units     goodwill. In calculating the fair value of the reporting units,     management relies on a number of factors, including operating     results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated     future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market     data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors     and managements judgment in applying them in the     impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets.         In the third quarter of 2009, the Company changed the date of     its annual goodwill impairment assessment from the first quarter     to the third quarter. This constituted a change in method of     applying an accounting principle that the Company believes is     preferable. The change was made to better align the timing of     the Companys goodwill impairment assessment with the     Companys annual business planning and forecasting process.         Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges related     to continuing operations were $1.0 million in 2010,     $105.6 million in 2009 and $1.6 million in 2008. The     impairments during 2009 were primarily related to new reporting     units which were acquired over the last few years before the     recent economic downturn. These charges were driven primarily by     lower current forecasts compared to the expected forecasts at     the time the reporting units were acquired. See the Goodwill and     Intangible Assets note in Item 8. Financial Statements and     Supplementary Data for further discussion of the relative     carrying values and fair values of the reporting units related     to these impairment charges.         35    Table of Contents        As of December 31, 2010, the Company had goodwill and     intangible assets of $6.6 billion allocated to its 60     reporting units. Although there can be no assurance that the     Company will not incur additional impairment charges related to     its goodwill and intangible assets, the Company generally     believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened     by the number of diversified businesses and end markets     represented by its 60 reporting units that have goodwill and     intangible assets. In addition, the individual businesses in     many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long     period of time, and therefore have been able to improve their     performance, primarily as a result of the application of the     Companys 80/20 business simplification process. The amount     of goodwill and intangible assets allocated to individual     reporting units range from approximately $3 million to     $740 million, with the average amount equal to     $110 million.         Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are     sensitive to changes in the factors described above. Due to the     inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and     economic conditions in the Companys global end markets,     impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could     occur in future periods.     Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits      The Company has various company-sponsored     defined benefit retirement plans covering a substantial portion     of U.S. employees and many employees outside the United     States. Pension and other postretirement expense and obligations     are determined based on actuarial valuations. Pension benefit     obligations are generally based on each participants years     of service, future compensation, and age at retirement or     termination. Important assumptions in determining pension and     postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate,     the expected long-term return on plan assets and healthcare cost     trend rates. See the Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits     note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data     for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in     determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities     and expenses.         The Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan     liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the     U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans. The discount     rate reflects the current rate at which the associated     liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the     end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company looks at     rates of return on high-quality fixed income investments, with     similar duration to the liabilities in the plan. A 25 basis     point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present     value of the U.S. primary pension plan obligation by     approximately $32 million.         The expected long-term return on plan assets is based on     historical and expected long-term returns for similar investment     allocations among asset classes. For the U.S. primary     pension plan, the Companys assumption for the expected     return on plan assets was 8.0% for 2010 and will be 8.0% for     2011. A 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on     plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by     approximately $3 million. See the Pension and Other     Postretirement Benefits note in Item 8. Financial     Statements and Supplementary Data for information on how this     rate is determined.         36    Table of Contents              ITEM 7A.

In general, the Companys products are primarily     manufactured and sold within the same country. The initial     funding for the foreign manufacturing operations was provided     primarily through the permanent investment of equity capital     from the U.S. parent company. Therefore, the Company and     its subsidiaries do not have significant assets or liabilities     denominated in currencies other than their functional     currencies. As such, the Company does not have any significant     derivatives or other financial instruments that are subject to     foreign currency risk at December 31, 2010 or 2009.         In October 2007, the Company issued 750.0 million of     5.25% Euro notes due October 1, 2014. The Company has     significant operations with the Euro as their functional     currency. The Company believes that the Euro cash flows from     these businesses will be adequate to fund the debt obligations     under these notes.         37    Table of Contents              ITEM 8.    Financial     Statements and Supplementary Data        MANAGEMENT     REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING          The management of Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the     Company or ITW) is responsible for     establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over     financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act     Rule 13a-15(f).     ITWs internal control system was designed to provide     reasonable assurance to the Companys management and Board     of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of     published financial statements.         All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have     inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined     to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with     respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.         ITW management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys     internal control over financial reporting as of     December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, it used the     criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations     of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal     Control  Integrated Framework. Based on our     assessment we believe that, as of December 31, 2010, the     Companys internal control over financial reporting is     effective based on those criteria.         The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over     financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been     audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent     registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report     herein.                       /s/  David     B. Speer        /s/  Ronald     D. Kropp      David B. Speer        Ronald D. Kropp     Chairman & Chief Executive Officer     February 25, 2011       Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer     February 25, 2011             38    Table of Contents       REPORT OF     INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM          To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Illinois Tool     Works Inc.:         We have audited the accompanying statement of financial position     of Illinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries (the     Company) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and     the related statements of income, income reinvested in the     business, comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the     three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. We also     have audited the Companys internal control over financial     reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria     established in Internal Control  Integrated     Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring     Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys     management is responsible for these financial statements, for     maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,     and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control     over financial reporting, included in the accompanying     management report on internal control over financial reporting.     Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial     statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control     over financial reporting based on our audits.         We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the     Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those     standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain     reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are     free of material misstatement and whether effective internal     control over financial reporting was maintained in all material     respects. Our audits of the financial statements included     examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and     disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the     accounting principles used and significant estimates made by     management, and evaluating the overall financial statement     presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial     reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal     control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a     material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design     and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the     assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other     procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We     believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our     opinions.         A companys internal control over financial reporting is a     process designed by, or under the supervision of, the     companys principal executive and principal financial     officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected     by the companys board of directors, management, and other     personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the     reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of     financial statements for external purposes in accordance with     generally accepted accounting principles. A companys     internal control over financial reporting includes those     policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance     of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly     reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the     company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions     are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial     statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting     principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company     are being made only in accordance with authorizations of     management and directors of the company; and (3) provide     reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of     unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the     companys assets that could have a material effect on the     financial statements.         Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over     financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or     improper management override of controls, material misstatements     due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a     timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the     effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting     to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may     become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the     degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may     deteriorate.         In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above     present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position     of Illinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries as of     December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their     operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in     the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with     accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of     America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all     material respects, effective internal control over financial     reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria     established in Internal Control  Integrated     Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring     Organizations of the Treadway Commission.         /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP       Deloitte & Touche LLP

(the Company or     ITW) is a multinational manufacturer of a     diversified range of industrial products and equipment with     operations in 57 countries.

Significant Accounting Principles And Policies           Significant accounting principles and policies of the Company     are in italics. Certain reclassifications of prior years     data have been made to conform to current year reporting.         The preparation of the Companys financial statements in     conformity with generally accepted accounting principles     requires management to make estimates and assumptions that     affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the     notes to financial statements. Actual results could differ from     those estimates. The significant estimates included in the     preparation of the financial statements are related to     inventories, trade receivables, plant and equipment, income     taxes, goodwill and intangible assets, product liability     matters, litigation, product warranties, pensions, other     postretirement benefits, environmental matters and stock options.     Consolidation and Translation        Consolidation and Translation  The     financial statements include the Company and substantially all     of its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany     transactions are eliminated from the financial statements.     Substantially all of the Companys foreign subsidiaries     outside North America have November 30 fiscal year-ends to     facilitate inclusion of their financial statements in the     December 31 consolidated financial statements.     Foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities are     translated to U.S. dollars at     end-of-period     exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at average     rates for the period. Translation adjustments are reported as a     component of accumulated other comprehensive income in     stockholders equity.      Disposal Groups Including Discontinued Operations Disclosure       Discontinued Operations  The Company     periodically reviews its operations for businesses which may no     longer be aligned with its long-term objectives.

On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted new accounting     guidance related to business combinations. The new accounting     guidance requires an entity to recognize assets acquired,     liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent     consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date. The     new guidance also requires prospectively that     (1) acquisition-related costs be expensed as incurred;     (2) restructuring costs generally be recognized as a     post-acquisition expense; and (3) changes in deferred tax     asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after     the measurement period impact income tax expense. Upon adoption     of the new guidance, the Company recorded an after-tax charge to     equity of $1,055,000 in 2009.     Operating Revenues        Operating Revenues are recognized when persuasive     evidence of an arrangement exists, product has shipped and the     risks and rewards of ownership have transferred or services have     been rendered, the price to the customer is fixed or     determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured,     which is generally at the time of product     shipment. Typical sales arrangements are for     standard products and provide for transfer of ownership and risk     of loss at the time of shipment.     In limited     circumstances where significant obligations to the customer are     unfulfilled at the time of shipment, typically involving     installation and customer acceptance, revenue recognition is     deferred until such obligations have been completed. Customer     allowances and rebates, consisting primarily of volume discounts     and other short-term incentive programs, are estimated at the     time of sale based on historical experience and known trends and     are recorded as a reduction in reported     revenues. No single customer accounted     for more than 5% of consolidated revenues in 2010, 2009 or 2008.         In October 2009, new accounting guidance was issued on     multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. The new accounting     guidance amends the accounting for multiple-deliverable     arrangements to enable the vendor          45    Table of Contents    Notes to     Financial Statements  (Continued)          to account for product or services separately rather than as a     combined unit. The guidance establishes a hierarchy for     determining the selling price of a deliverable, which is based     on: (1) vendor-specific objective evidence,     (2) third-party evidence or (3) estimates. The Company     will adopt the new accounting guidance on January 1, 2011     and does not expect the new guidance to materially affect the     Companys financial position or results of operations.

The changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits during     2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:                                                   In Thousands       2010           2009           2008                    Beginning balance            $       725,000               $       800,000               $       773,000              Additions based on tax positions related to the current year                57,000                   123,000                   67,000              Additions for tax positions of prior years                55,000                   122,000                   107,000              Reductions for tax positions of prior years                (92,000       )               (18,000       )               (66,000       )          Settlements                                   (383,000       )                             Foreign currency translation                (41,000       )               81,000                   (81,000       )                                                                Ending balance            $       704,000               $       725,000               $       800,000                                                                        Included in the balance at December 31, 2010, are     approximately $525,000,000 of tax positions that, if recognized,     would impact the Companys effective tax rate.         The Company settled several items during 2009 related to its     German and U.S. tax audits. The most significant issues     related to a financing transaction, leveraged leases and     mortgage-backed securities.         In the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service has completed its     audit for the years     2006-2007     and has proposed several adjustments which the Company is     protesting. The Company has recorded its best estimate of its     exposure for this audit; however, it is reasonably possible that     the Company will resolve an issue related to a          49    Table of Contents    Notes to     Financial Statements  (Continued)          deduction for foreign exchange losses on an intercompany loan     within the next 12 months and that the amount of the     Companys unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by     approximately $179,000,000.         The Company has been litigating its dispute with the Australian     Tax Office over the tax treatment of an intercompany financing     transaction between the U.S. and Australia. The case was     heard before the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria, in     September 2010. The proceedings result from the Companys     appeal of a decision by the Australian Tax Commissioner to     disallow income tax deductions for income tax years 2002 through     2005 and the assessment of withholding taxes for income tax year     2003. The Company also contested the Commissioners similar     determination for income tax years 2006 and 2007; however, the     parties agreed to defer the appeal of that determination until a     decision was made on the earlier years. The Company has recorded     its best estimate of the exposure for this audit.         On February 4, 2011, the Federal Court of Australia decided     in the Companys favor with respect to a significant     portion of the income tax deductions. The Court issued the final     orders on February 18, 2011. Based on this decision, the     Company expects in 2011 to decrease its unrecognized tax     benefits related to this matter by approximately $186,000,000     and decrease tax expense by approximately $166,000,000. The     Australian Tax Office has 21 days from the date the Court     issues its final orders to appeal the decision.         The Company files numerous consolidated and separate tax returns     in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction and in many state and     foreign jurisdictions.     The     following table summarizes the open tax years for the     Companys major jurisdictions:                                   Open          Jurisdiction       Tax Years                    United States  Federal                2001-2010              United Kingdom                2000-2010              Germany                2006-2010              France                2002-2010              Australia                2002-2010               The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to     income tax matters in income tax     expense.  The accrual for     interest and penalties, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009     was $39,000,000 and $45,000,000, respectively.     Earnings Per Share        Income from Continuing Operations Per Share is     computed by dividing income from continuing operations by the     weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period.     Income from continuing operations per diluted share is computed     by dividing income from continuing operations by the     weighted-average number of shares assuming dilution for stock     options and restricted stock. Dilutive     shares reflect the potential additional shares that would be     outstanding if the dilutive stock options outstanding were     exercise          50    Table of Contents    Notes to     Financial Statements  (Continued)          and the unvested restricted stock vested during the period.

The antidilutive     options outstanding as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008     were 10,434,146, 14,581,559 and 11,729,898, respectively.

The     last-in,     first-out (LIFO) method is used to determine the     cost of the inventories of approximately half of the     U.S. inventories. Inventories priced     at LIFO were approximately 22% of total inventories as of     December 31, 2010 and 2009.     The     first-in,     first-out (FIFO) method, which approximates current     cost, is used for all other inventories.     If the FIFO method was used for all     inventories, total inventories would have been approximately     $122,888,000 and $115,090,000 higher than reported at     December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.         51    Table of Contents    Notes to     Financial Statements  (Continued)        Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets      Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets as of     December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:                                       In Thousands       2010           2009                    Value-added-tax receivables            $       54,649               $       47,568              Vendor advances                32,886                   30,712              Insurance                27,166                   31,052              Other                136,540                   166,908                                                           $       251,241               $       276,240                                                    Property Plant And Equipment Disclosure        Plant and Equipment are stated at cost less     accumulated depreciation. Renewals and improvements that     increase the useful life of plant and equipment are capitalized.     Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.          Depreciation was $334,388,000 in 2010, $365,372,000 in 2009 and     $366,711,000 in 2008, and was reflected primarily in cost of     revenues. Discontinued operations depreciation was $755,000 in     2009 and $904,000 in 2008 and was reflected in loss from     discontinued operations.     Depreciation     of plant and equipment for financial reporting purposes is     computed on an accelerated basis for U.S. businesses and on     a straight-line basis for a majority of the international     businesses.           The range of useful lives used to depreciate plant and equipment     is as follows:                           Buildings and improvements            10  50 years          Machinery and equipment            3  20 years          Equipment leased to others            Term of lease          Investments        Investments as of December 31, 2010 and 2009     consisted of the following:                                       In Thousands       2010           2009                    Leases of equipment            $       281,067               $       271,725              Venture capital limited partnership                50,112                   59,046              Properties held for sale                45,971                   35,908              Affordable housing limited partnerships                39,002                   59,986              Property developments                25,454                   24,628                                                           $       441,606               $       451,293                                                     Leases     of Equipment           The components of the investment in leases of equipment at     December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as shown below:                                       In Thousands       2010           2009                    Leveraged and direct financing leases:                                           Gross lease contracts receivable, net of nonrecourse debt service            $       145,687               $       145,738              Estimated residual value of leased assets                247,512                   247,512              Unearned income                (120,863       )               (131,385       )                                                           272,336                   261,865              Equipment under operating leases                8,731                   9,860                                                           $       281,067               $       271,725                                                        Deferred tax liabilities related to leases of equipment were     $56,170,000 and $54,707,000 at December 31, 2010 and 2009,     respectively.         52    Table of Contents    Notes to     Financial Statements  (Continued)           The investment in leases of equipment at December 31, 2010     and 2009 relates to the following types of equipment:                                       In Thousands       2010           2009                    Telecommunications            $       178,946               $       172,011              Air traffic control                66,433                   62,856              Aircraft                35,391                   36,520              Manufacturing                297                   338                                                           $       281,067               $       271,725                                                        In 2003, the Company entered into a leveraged lease transaction     related to air traffic control equipment in Australia with a     cash investment of $48,763,000. In 2002, the Company entered     into leveraged leasing transactions related to mobile     telecommunications equipment with two major European     telecommunications companies with a cash investment of     $144,676,000. Under the terms of the telecommunications and air     traffic control lease transactions, the lessees have made     upfront payments to third-party financial institutions that are     acting as payment undertakers. These payment undertakers are     obligated to make the required scheduled payments directly to     the nonrecourse debt holders and to the lessors, including the     Company. In the event of default by the lessees, the Company has     the right to recover its net investment from the payment     undertakers. In addition, the lessees are required to purchase     residual value insurance from a creditworthy third party at a     date near the end of the lease term.         Income from leveraged leases was $10,513,000 and $7,618,000 for     the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.     Expense from leveraged leases was $10,191,000 for the year ended     December 31, 2008.     Unearned income related     to leveraged leases is recognized as lease income over the life     of the lease based on the effective yield of the lease. The     Company adjusts recognition of lease income on its leveraged     leases when there is a change in the assumptions affecting total     income or the timing of cash flows associated with the lease.     The residual values of leased assets are estimated at the     inception of the lease based on market appraisals and reviewed     for impairment at least annually.       Other     Investments          The Company entered into a venture capital limited partnership     in 2001 that invests primarily in late-stage venture capital     opportunities. The     Company has a 25% limited partnership interest and accounts     for this investment using the equity method, whereby the Company     recognizes its proportionate share of the partnerships     income or loss. The partnerships financial statements are     prepared on a     mark-to-market     basis.         The Company has entered into several affordable housing limited     partnerships primarily to receive tax benefits in the form of     tax credits and tax deductions from operating losses.     These affordable     housing investments are accounted for using the effective yield     method, in which the investment is amortized to income tax     expense as the tax benefits are received. The tax credits are     credited to income tax expense as they are allocated to the     Company.          The Company has invested in property developments with a     residential construction developer through partnerships in which     the Company has a 50% interest.     These partnership     investments are accounted for using the equity method, whereby     the Company recognizes its proportionate share of the     partnerships income or loss.      Goodwill And Intangible Assets Disclosure        Goodwill and Intangible     Assets  Goodwill represents     the excess cost over fair value of the net assets of purchased     businesses.     The     Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that     have indefinite lives. The Company performs an annual impairment     assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite     lives based on the estimated fair value of the related reporting     unit or intangible asset.         53    Table of Contents    Notes to     Financial Statements  (Continued)             On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted new accounting     guidance on fair value measurements for all nonfinancial assets     and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at     fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The new accounting guidance     defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell     an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly     transaction between market participants and provides guidance     for measuring fair value and the necessary disclosures.         When performing its annual goodwill impairment assessment, the     Company compares the estimated fair value of each of its 60     reporting units to its carrying value. Fair values are     determined primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows     based either on current operating cash flows or on a detailed     cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant reporting unit. The     Company also considers additional valuation techniques, such as     market multiples from similar transactions and quoted market     prices of relevant public companies. If the fair value of a     reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment     loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied     fair value and the carrying value of the reporting units     goodwill.         The Companys indefinite-lived intangibles consist of     trademarks and brands. The estimated fair values of these     intangibles are determined based on a     relief-of-royalty     income approach derived from internally forecasted revenues of     the related products. If the fair value of the trademark or     brand is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is     recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and     carrying value of the intangible asset.          Amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible     assets for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008     were as follows:                                                   In Thousands       2010           2009           2008                    Goodwill:                                                           Impairment            $                      $       90,000               $       137              Intangible Assets:                                                           Amortization                212,884                   203,230                   184,410              Impairment                1,006                   15,568                   1,438                                                                           $       213,890               $       308,798               $       185,985                                                                        Loss from discontinued operations included goodwill impairment     charges of $132,563,000 and amortization of $5,744,000 in 2008.         In 2010, the Company performed its annual goodwill and     indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment which     resulted in immaterial intangible asset impairment charges.         In the third quarter of 2009, the Company changed the date of     its annual goodwill impairment assessment from the first quarter     to the third quarter. This constituted a change in the method of     applying an accounting principle that the Company believes is     preferable, as it better aligns the timing of the Companys     goodwill impairment assessment with the Companys annual     business planning and forecasting process. In the third quarter     of 2009, the Company performed its goodwill impairment     assessment which resulted in a charge of $12,000,000 related to     the truck remanufacturing and related parts and service     reporting unit in the Transportation segment.         In the first quarter of 2009, the Company performed its annual     goodwill impairment assessment which resulted in impairment     charges of $60,000,000 related to the pressure sensitive     adhesives reporting unit in the Polymers & Fluids     segment and $18,000,000 related to the PC board fabrication     reporting unit in the Power Systems & Electronics     segment.         Also in 2009, intangible asset impairments of $15,568,000 were     recorded to reduce to the estimated fair value the carrying     value of certain trademarks, brands and patents. Approximately     $5,800,000 of this total charge related to the PC board     fabrication reporting unit and the remainder to various     trademarks, brands          54    Table of Contents    Notes to     Financial Statements  (Continued)          and patents of other reporting units. The annual impairment     testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets     during 2008 resulted in immaterial impairment charges for     continuing operations.         The impairments during 2009 were primarily related to new     reporting units which were acquired over the last few years     before the recent economic downturn. These charges were driven     primarily by lower current forecasts compared to the expected     forecasts at the time the reporting units were acquired.          A summary of goodwill and intangible assets that were adjusted     to fair value and the related impairment charges included in     earnings for 2009 is as follows:

The U.S. primary pension plan provides benefits based on     years of service and final average salary. The U.S. primary     postretirement healthcare plan is contributory with the     participants contributions adjusted annually. The     U.S. primary postretirement life insurance plan is     noncontributory.         Beginning January 1, 2007, the U.S. primary pension     and other postretirement benefit plans were closed to new     participants. Newly hired employees and employees from acquired     businesses that are not participating in these plans are     eligible for additional Company contributions under the existing     U.S. primary defined contribution retirement plans. The     Companys expense related to defined contribution plans was     $69,300,000 in 2010, $66,000,000 in 2009 and $66,700,000 in 2008.         In addition to the U.S. plans, the Company also has defined     benefit pension plans in certain other countries, mainly the     United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany and Canada.         On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted new accounting     guidance which required the Company to change the measurement     date of its defined benefit plans to correspond with the     Companys fiscal year end. The Company previously used a     September 30 measurement date. As allowed under the provisions     of this new guidance, the Company elected to remeasure its plan     assets and benefit obligation as of the beginning of the fiscal     year. Upon adoption, the Company recorded an after-tax charge of     $12,788,000 to beginning retained earnings and an after-tax gain     to accumulated other comprehensive income of $3,573,000 related     to the three months ended December 31, 2007.         56    Table of Contents    Notes to     Financial Statements  (Continued)           Summarized information regarding the Companys significant

long-term rates of return for pension and other     postretirement benefit plans were developed using historical     asset class returns while factoring in current market conditions     such as inflation, interest rates and asset class performance.         Assumed health care cost trend rates have an effect on the     amounts reported for the postretirement health care benefit     plans.     The     assumed health care cost trend rates used to determine the     postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2010,     2009 and 2008 were as follows:                                                           2010       2009       2008                Health care cost trend rate assumed for the next year                8.71       %               8.21       %               8.71       %          Ultimate trend rate                5.00       %               5.00       %               5.00       %          Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate                2020                   2020                   2016                   A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend     rates would have the following effects:                                               1-Percentage-        1-Percentage-      In Thousands       Point Increase       Point Decrease                Effect on total of service and interest cost components for 2010            $       923               $       (1,254       )          Effect on postretirement benefit obligation at December 31,     2010            $       14,089               $       (16,501       )           Plan     Assets         The Companys overall investment strategy for the assets in     the pension funds is to achieve a balance between the goals of     growing plan assets and keeping risk at a reasonable level over     a long-term investment horizon. In order to reduce unnecessary     risk, the pension funds are diversified across several asset     classes, securities and investment managers. The target     allocations for plan assets are     55-70%     equity securities,     30-45% debt     securities, 0-1% real estate and 0-10% in other types of     investments. The Company does not use derivatives for the     purpose of speculation, leverage, circumventing investment     guidelines or taking risks that are inconsistent with specified     guidelines.         The assets in the Companys postretirement health care plan     are primarily invested in life insurance policies. The     Companys overall investment strategy for the assets in the     postretirement health care fund is to invest in assets that     provide a reasonable tax exempt rate of return while preserving     capital.         The following tables present the fair value of the     Companys pension and other postretirement benefit plan     assets at December 31, 2010 and 2009, by asset category and     valuation methodology. Level 1 assets are valued using     unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets.     Level 2 assets are valued using quoted          59    Table of Contents    Notes to     Financial Statements  (Continued)          prices or other observable inputs for similar assets.     Level 3 assets are valued using unobservable inputs, but     reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing     the assets. Each financial instruments categorization is     based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the     fair value measurement.

less and are valued at cost which     approximates fair value. Equity securities primarily include     common and preferred equity securities covering a wide range of     industries and geographies which are traded in active markets     and are valued based on quoted prices. Fixed income securities     primarily consist of U.S. and foreign government bills,     notes and bonds, corporate debt securities, asset-backed     securities, and investment contracts. The majority of the assets     in this category are valued using a bid evaluation process with     bid data provided by independent pricing sources. For securities     where market data is not readily available, unobservable market     data is used to value the security. Commingled funds include     investments in public and private pooled funds. Mutual funds are     traded in active markets and are valued based on quoted prices.     The underlying investments include small-cap equity,     international equity and long- and short-term fixed income     instruments. Collective trust funds are private funds that are     valued at the net asset value which is determined based on the     fair value of the underlying investments. The underlying     investments include both passively and actively managed     U.S. and foreign large- and mid-cap equity funds and     short-term investment funds. Partnerships/private equity     interests are investments in partnerships where the benefit plan     is a limited partner. The investments are valued by the     investment managers on a periodic basis using pricing models     that use market, income and cost valuation methods. Life     insurance policies are used to fund other postretirement     benefits in order to obtain favorable tax treatment.

The Company     believes resolution of these matters, individually and in the     aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the     Companys financial position, liquidity or future     operations.         Among the toxic tort cases in which the Company is a defendant,     the Company as well as its subsidiaries Hobart Brothers Company     and Miller Electric Mfg. Co., have been named, along with     numerous other defendants, in lawsuits alleging injury from     exposure to welding consumables. The plaintiffs in these suits     claim unspecified damages for injuries resulting from the     plaintiffs alleged exposure to asbestos, manganese     and/or toxic     fumes in connection with the welding process. Based upon the     Companys experience in defending these claims, the Company     believes that the resolution of these proceedings will not have     a material adverse effect on the Companys financial     position, liquidity or future operations. The Company has not     recorded any significant reserves related to these cases.

The significant     terms of options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and     performance restricted stock units (PRSUs) granted     under the amended and restated plan were not changed. As of     February 11, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board     of Directors approved an annual equity award consisting of stock     options, RSUs and PRSUs. The form of RSU provides for full     cliff vesting three years from the date of grant.     The form of PRSU provides for full cliff vesting     after three years if the Compensation Committee certifies that     the performance goals set with respect to the PRSU have been     met. Upon vesting, the holder will receive one share of common     stock of the Company for each vested RSU or PRSU. Option     exercise prices are equal to the common stock fair market value     on the date of grant. Stock options were granted on     1,873,409 shares at an exercise price of $55.81 per share.     Additionally, 591,101 RSUs and PRSUs were issued at the grant     date share price of $55.81. The fair value of RSUs and PRSUs is     determined by reducing the closing market price on the date of     the grant by the present value of projected dividends over the     vesting period.     The     Company uses a binomial option pricing model to estimate the     fair value of the stock options granted. The following     summarizes the assumptions used in the models:                                                           2011       2010       2009                Risk-free interest rate                0.3-3.8       %               0.4-3.9       %               0.6-3.3       %          Weighted-average volatility                25.0       %               25.0       %               33.0       %          Dividend yield                2.80       %               2.78       %               2.34       %          Expected years until exercise                7.6-7.9                   7.5-7.8                   7.3-7.7                  Lattice-based option valuation models, such as the binomial     option pricing model, incorporate ranges of assumptions for     inputs. The risk-free rate of interest for periods within the     contractual life of the option is based on a zero-coupon     U.S. government instrument over the contractual term of the     equity instrument. Expected volatility is based on implied     volatility from traded options on the Companys stock and     historical          68    Table of Contents    Notes to     Financial Statements  (Continued)          volatility of the Companys stock. The Company uses     historical data to estimate option exercise timing and employee     termination rates within the valuation model. Separate groups of     employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are     considered separately for valuation purposes. The     weighted-average dividend yield is based on historical     information. The expected term of options granted is derived     from the output of the option valuation model and represents the     period of time that options granted are expected to be     outstanding. The ranges presented result from separate groups of     employees assumed to exhibit different behavior.         The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted     during 2011, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $12.34, $9.59, $10.24 and     $13.32 per share, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of     options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2010,     2009, and 2008 was $56,191,000, $38,609,000 and $23,502,000,     respectively. As of December 31, 2010 there was $34,078,000     of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested     stock options. That cost is expected to be recognized over a     weighted-average period of 2.1 years. Exercise of options     during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008     resulted in cash receipts of $113,627,000, $101,613,000 and     $54,989,000, respectively. The total fair value of vested stock     option awards during the years ended December 31, 2010,     2009 and 2008 was $29,545,000, $38,999,000 and $30,185,000,     respectively.         As of December 31, 2010 there was $27,723,000 of total     unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted     stock units. That cost is expected to be recognized over a     weighted-average remaining contractual life of 1.7 years.     The total fair value of vested restricted stock unit awards     during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was     $632,000 and $468,000, respectively.
