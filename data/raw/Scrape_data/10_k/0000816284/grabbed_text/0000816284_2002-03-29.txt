ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW WE WERE ORGANIZED IN 1980 AS A UNIT OF CELANESE CORPORATION, A CHEMICAL COMPANY. OUR INITIAL MANDATE WAS TO APPLY BIOTECHNOLOGY TO THE PRODUCTION OF FINE AND SPECIALTY CHEMICALS. FOLLOWING THE 1986 MERGER OF CELANESE CORPORATION WITH AMERICAN HOECHST CORPORATION, WE WERE SPUN OFF AS AN INDEPENDENT BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY. IN JULY 1987, WE COMPLETED AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND COMMENCED THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF CHEMICAL AND BIOTREATMENT PROCESSES FOR THE CHEMICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES. WE DISCONTINUED THE BIOTREATMENT OPERATIONS IN 1994 TO FOCUS ON OUR TARGETED SMALL MOLECULE CANCER AND IMMUNOLOGY COMPOUND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND OUR BIOCATALYTIC CHIRAL CHEMISTRY PROGRAM. BETWEEN 1990 AND 1998, OUR REVENUE WAS GENERATED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY OF CHIRALLY PURE INTERMEDIATES TO PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES FOR USE IN NEW DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND, TO A LESSER DEGREE, FROM AGROCHEMICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS. HOWEVER, AS REVENUE FROM THALOMID(REG. TM) SALES, LICENSE AGREEMENTS AND MILESTONE PAYMENTS RELATED TO OUR CANCER AND IMMUNOLOGY PROGRAMS INCREASED, SALES OF CHIRALLY PURE INTERMEDIATES BECAME A LESS INTEGRAL PART OF OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS. ACCORDINGLY, ON JANUARY 9, 1998, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF OUR CHIRAL INTERMEDIATES BUSINESS TO CAMBREX CORPORATION FOR $15.0 MILLION. TERMS OF THE SALE PROVIDED FOR A PAYMENT TO CELGENE OF $7.5 MILLION AT CLOSING AND FUTURE ROYALTIES ON PRODUCT SALES NOT TO EXCEED THE NET PRESENT VALUE ON THE INITIAL DATE OF THE SALE OF $7.5 MILLION, WITH A GUARANTEE OF CERTAIN MINIMUM PAYMENTS TO CELGENE BEGINNING IN THE THIRD YEAR FOLLOWING THE CLOSE OF THE AGREEMENT. IN JULY 1998, WE RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE FDA TO MARKET THALOMID(REG. TM) (THALIDOMIDE) FOR USE IN ENL, A SIDE EFFECT OF LEPROSY, AND, IN LATE SEPTEMBER 1998, WE COMMENCED SALES OF THALOMID(REG. TM) IN THE UNITED STATES. SALES HAVE GROWN RAPIDLY EACH YEAR SINCE THE LAUNCH AND, IN 2001, WE RECORDED NET SALES OF THALOMID(REG. TM) OF $82.0 MILLION. ON FEBRUARY 16, 2000, WE COMPLETED A FOLLOW-ON PUBLIC OFFERING TO SELL 10,350,000 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE OF $33.67 PER SHARE, AS ADJUSTED FOR A THREE-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT EFFECTIVE APRIL 2000. 8,802,000 SHARES WERE FOR OUR ACCOUNT AND 1,548,000 WERE FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A SELLING SHAREHOLDER PURSUANT TO THE CONVERSION OF $9,288,000 OF THE 9%, JANUARY 1999 CONVERTIBLE NOTES HELD BY THAT SHAREHOLDER. OUR PROCEEDS, NET OF OFFERING EXPENSES, WERE APPROXIMATELY $278.0 MILLION. ON APRIL 19, 2000, WE SIGNED A LICENSE AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT WITH NOVARTIS PHARMA AG IN WHICH WE GRANTED TO NOVARTIS A WORLDWIDE LICENSE FOR D-MPH, OUR CHIRALLY PURE VERSION OF RITALIN(REG. TM). THE AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR SIGNIFICANT UPFRONT AND MILESTONE PAYMENTS BASED ON ACHIEVING VARIOUS REGULATORY APPROVALS AND ROYALTIES ON THE ENTIRE FAMILY OF RITALIN(REG. TM) PRODUCTS UPON APPROVAL OF D-MPH BY THE FDA. WE HAVE RETAINED THE RIGHTS FOR THE USE OF D-MPH IN ONCOLOGY INDICATIONS. WE RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE FDA TO MARKET D-MPH, OR FOCALIN(TM), ON NOVEMBER 14, 2001. ON AUGUST 31, 2000, WE COMPLETED A MERGER, ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING-OF-INTERESTS, WITH SIGNAL PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., A PRIVATELY HELD BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY FOCUSED ON THE DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF DRUGS THAT REGULATE GENES ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE. WE HAVE SUSTAINED LOSSES IN EACH YEAR SINCE OUR INCEPTION AS AN INDEPENDENT BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY IN 1986. IN 2001, WE HAD A NET LOSS OF $1.9 MILLION AND, AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, WE HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $222.4 MILLION. WE EXPECT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE THALOMID(REG. TM), DEVELOP OUR OTHER ONCOLOGY AND IMMUNOLOGICAL DISEASE PROGRAMS, AND ADVANCE OUR GENE REGULATION AND TARGET DISCOVERY PROGRAM. THESE EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE MORE THAN OFFSET BY INCREASING SALES OF THALOMID(REG. TM), SALES OF FOCALIN(TM) TO NOVARTIS AND ROYALTIES FROM NOVARTIS ON THEIR SALES OF RITALIN(REG. TM), REVENUES FROM VARIOUS RESEARCH COLLABORATIONS AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, AND INVESTMENT INCOME. SUBJECT TO THE RISKS DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES UNDER DEVELOPMENT BY US. TO ADDRESS THESE AND POTENTIAL FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES IN A TIMELY AND COMPETITIVE MANNER, WE INTEND TO 32 SEEK OUT DRUG DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATIONS AND LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS COVERING THE MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION FOR US OF CERTAIN COMPOUNDS, SUCH AS THALOMID(REG. TM) AND FOCALIN(TM), AND THE DEVELOPMENT BY US OF PROCESSES FOR PRODUCING CHIRALLY PURE CROP PROTECTION AGENTS FOR LICENSE TO AGROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS. THE LATTER DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE PERFORMED THROUGH CELGRO CORPORATION, OUR WHOLLY OWNED AGROCHEMICAL SUBSIDIARY. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A COMMERCIAL SALES, MARKETING AND CUSTOMER SERVICE ORGANIZATION TO SELL AND SUPPORT THALOMID(REG. TM) AND AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2002, WE EMPLOY 128 PERSONS IN THIS CAPACITY. WE INTEND TO DEVELOP AND MARKET OUR OWN PHARMACEUTICALS FOR INDICATIONS WITH ECONOMICALLY ACCESSIBLE PATIENT POPULATIONS IN OUR DISEASE FRANCHISES. FOR DRUGS WITH INDICATIONS OUTSIDE THE ONCOLOGY AND IMMUNOLOGICAL DISEASE FIELDS AND FOR LARGER PATIENT POPULATIONS, WE MAY PARTNER WITH OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. WE CURRENTLY PARTNER WITH COMPANIES SUCH AS NOVARTIS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR CHIRALLY PURE PHARMACEUTICAL AND AGROCHEMICAL PRODUCTS. WE EXPECT THESE ARRANGEMENTS TYPICALLY WILL INCLUDE SOME COMBINATION OF LICENSE FEES, MILESTONE PAYMENTS, REIMBURSEMENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND ROYALTY ARRANGEMENTS. WE ALSO MAY ACQUIRE PRODUCTS OR COMPANIES TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO AND TO AUGMENT OUR DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION RESOURCES. FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, REGULATORY APPROVALS OF OUR PRODUCTS, THE TIMING OF THE INTRODUCTION AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS BY US OR COMPETING COMPANIES, THE TIMING OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL COSTS. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, 2000 AND 1999 TOTAL REVENUE. OUR TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 INCREASED 35% TO $114.2 MILLION COMPARED WITH $84.9 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2000. TOTAL REVENUE IN 2001 CONSISTED OF PRODUCT SALES OF $84.2 MILLION, OF WHICH $82.0 MILLION WERE THALOMID(REG. TM) SALES AND $2.2 MILLION WERE SALES OF FOCALIN(TM), WHICH RECEIVED FDA APPROVAL IN NOVEMBER 2001, RESEARCH CONTRACT REVENUE OF $28.1 MILLION AND RELATED PARTY REVENUE OF $1.9 MILLION COMPARED WITH PRODUCT SALES OF $62.7 MILLION, ALL OF WHICH WERE THALOMID(REG. TM) SALES, RESEARCH CONTRACT REVENUE OF $15.9 MILLION AND RELATED PARTY REVENUE OF $6.3 MILLION IN 2000. THALOMID(REG. TM) SALES CONTINUE TO GROW IN ONCOLOGY AS MORE CLINICAL DATA IS PRESENTED EITHER IN PUBLICATIONS OR AT ONCOLOGY MEETINGS. RESEARCH CONTRACT REVENUE INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $10.4 MILLION OF AMORTIZATION OF UPFRONT PAYMENTS RELATED TO TWO SEPARATE AGREEMENTS WITH NOVARTIS PHARMA AG AND A MILESTONE PAYMENT OF $12.5 MILLION FROM NOVARTIS FOR RECEIVING FDA APPROVAL TO MARKET FOCALIN(TM). RELATED PARTY REVENUE DECREASED IN 2001 AS THE INITIAL TERMS OF BOTH RELATED PARTY AGREEMENTS EXPIRED AND SUCH ENTITIES ARE NO LONGER CONSIDERED RELATED PARTIES. ONE OF THOSE AGREEMENTS HAS BEEN EXTENDED AND APPROXIMATELY $2.8 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS RESEARCH CONTRACT REVENUE IN 2001. OUR TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 INCREASED 122% TO $84.9 MILLION COMPARED WITH $38.2 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 1999. REVENUE IN 2000 CONSISTED OF THALOMID(REG. TM) SALES OF $62.7 MILLION, RESEARCH CONTRACT REVENUE OF $15.9 MILLION AND RELATED PARTY COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENT REVENUE OF $6.3 MILLION COMPARED WITH THALOMID(REG. TM) SALES OF $24.3 MILLION, RESEARCH CONTRACT REVENUE OF $9.4 MILLION AND REVENUE FROM RELATED PARTY COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS OF $4.5 MILLION IN 1999. THE GROWTH IN THALOMID(REG. TM) SALES PRIMARILY IS RELATED TO INCREASED USE FOR ONCOLOGY INDICATIONS. RESEARCH CONTRACT REVENUE FOR 2000 INCLUDED THE RECOGNITION OF $4.6 MILLION OF THE $10.0 MILLION NONREFUNDABLE UPFRONT LICENSE FEE PAYMENT RECEIVED IN CONNECTION WITH A COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO WITH NOVARTIS PHARMA AG IN APRIL 2000, AND A $5.0 MILLION MILESTONE PAYMENT RELATED TO THE SAME AGREEMENT WITH NOVARTIS. COST OF GOODS SOLD. COST OF GOODS SOLD IN 2001 INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 36% TO $13.6 MILLION FROM APPROXIMATELY $10.0 MILLION IN 2000, IN LINE WITH THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT SALES AND THEREFORE PRIMARILY VOLUME RELATED. COST OF GOODS SOLD FOR 2001 RELATING TO FOCALIN(TM) SALES WAS FAVORABLY IMPACTED AS MANUFACTURING COSTS INCURRED PRIOR TO FOCALIN'S(TM) APPROVAL IN NOVEMBER 2001 WERE EXPENSED AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. THIS FAVORABILITY WILL CONTINUE UNTIL THE QUANTITY PREVIOUSLY EXPENSED IS COMPLETELY SOLD. COST OF GOODS SOLD IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 WAS APPROXIMATELY $10.0 MILLION COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY $3.2 MILLION IN 1999. THE INCREASE IN COST OF GOODS SOLD REFLECTS THE HIGHER 33 VOLUME OF THALOMID(REG. TM) SALES IN 2000. IN ADDITION, THE COST OF GOODS SOLD DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2000 AND THE FULL YEAR OF 1999 WAS LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED AS RAW MATERIAL, FORMULATION AND ENCAPSULATION COSTS OF THALOMID(REG. TM) WERE CHARGED AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES PRIOR TO RECEIVING FDA MARKETING APPROVAL. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SALARIES AND BENEFITS, CONTRACTOR FEES, PRINCIPALLY WITH CONTRACT RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS TO ASSIST IN OUR CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, CLINICAL DRUG SUPPLIES FOR OUR CLINICAL AND PRECLINICAL PROGRAMS AS WELL AS OTHER CONSUMABLE RESEARCH SUPPLIES, AND ALLOCATED FACILITIES CHARGES SUCH AS BUILDING RENT AND UTILITIES. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES IN 2001 INCREASED 20% TO $67.7 MILLION FROM $56.2 MILLION IN 2000. APPROXIMATELY $33 MILLION WAS SPENT ON THALOMID(REG. TM) AND ITS FOLLOW-ON COMPOUNDS, THE IMIDS(REG. TM) AND SELCIDS(TM), PRIMARILY FOR PRECLINICAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHASE I/II CLINICAL TRIALS, REGULATORY EXPENSES FOR PREPARATION OF AN SNDA FOR THALOMID(REG. TM) IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND LEGAL EXPENSES RELATED TO PATENT FILINGS. APPROXIMATELY $2.8 MILLION WAS SPENT FOR FOCALIN(TM) (D-MPH) PRIMARILY FOR DRUG SUPPLY WHICH WAS EXPENSED PRIOR TO FDA APPROVAL. WE SPENT APPROXIMATELY $31.8 MILLION IN OUR GENE REGULATION, TARGET DISCOVERY AND AGRO-CHEMICAL PROGRAMS, PRIMARILY FOR INTERNAL HEADCOUNT RELATED EXPENSES, LABORATORY SUPPLIES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED BY 45% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 TO APPROXIMATELY $56.2 MILLION COMPARED TO $38.8 MILLION IN 1999. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SPENDING FOR PRECLINICAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY STUDIES AND PHASE I AND PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS FOR OUR SELCIDS(TM) AND IMIDS(REG. TM), COMPLETION OF THE PIVOTAL CLINICAL TRIALS AND PREPARATION FOR FILING THE NDA FOR D-MPH, OUR CHIRALLY PURE VERSION OF RITALIN(REG. TM), AND PRECLINICAL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT FOR OUR SERM CANCER PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY, THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN THE RECOGNITION OF DEFERRED COMPENSATION RECORDED FOR STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED BY SIGNAL DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2000. AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE APPROXIMATELY 59%, 66% AND 101% IN 2001, 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY. AS A RESULT OF INCREASING REVENUE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUE ALTHOUGH THE ACTUAL DOLLAR AMOUNT WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE AS WE MOVE OUR EARLIER STAGE COMPOUNDS THROUGH PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL PROGRAMS. REFERENCE THE TABLE ON PAGE 4 OF PART I -- BUSINESS SECTION FOR THE STATUS OF SPECIFIC COMPOUNDS. IN GENERAL, ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETION WITHIN THE VARIOUS STAGES OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS: ESTIMATED COMPLETION CLINICAL PHASE PERIOD -------------- -------------------- PHASE I 1-2 YEARS PHASE II 1-2 YEARS PHASE III 2-3 YEARS DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN PRECLINICAL TESTS AND CLINICAL TRIALS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, THE COST TO COMPLETE SUCH PROJECTS IS NOT REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. THE DATA OBTAINED FROM THESE TESTS AND TRIALS MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING INTERPRETATION THAT COULD DELAY, LIMIT OR PREVENT A PROJECT'S ADVANCEMENT THROUGH THE VARIOUS STAGES OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE COSTS INCURRED TO BRING A PROJECT TO COMPLETION. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. SELLING EXPENSE CONSIST OF SALARIES AND BENEFITS FOR SALES AND MARKETING AND CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSONNEL, WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS, AND OTHER COMMERCIAL EXPENSES TO SUPPORT THE SALES FORCE AND THE EDUCATION AND REGISTRATION EFFORTS UNDERLYING THE S.T.E.P.S.(REG. TM) PROGRAM. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SALARIES AND BENEFITS, OUTSIDE SERVICES FOR LEGAL, AUDIT, TAX AND INVESTOR ACTIVITIES AND ALLOCATIONS OF FACILITIES COSTS, PRINCIPALLY FOR RENT, UTILITIES AND PROPERTY TAXES. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED 25% IN 2001 TO $58.0 MILLION FROM $46.4 MILLION IN 2000. THE INCREASED SPENDING WAS PRIMARILY COMMERCIAL EXPENSES TO SUPPORT THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF THALOMID(REG. TM), WITH APPROXIMATELY A $2.7 MILLION INCREASE IN SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE SALES FORCE EXPANSION AND AN INCREASE OF $2.5 MILLION IN CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO BRINGING THE PREVIOUSLY OUT-SOURCED CUSTOMER SERVICE FUNCTION IN HOUSE AND A ROLL OUT OF AN ENHANCED S.T.E.P.S.(REG. TM) PROGRAM. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR 2000 INCREASED 73% TO $46.4 MILLION FROM $26.9 MILLION IN 1999. THE INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE EXPANSION OF OUR SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATION AND RELATED EXPENSES, AND 34 SPENDING FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION, ALL TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH IN THALOMID(REG. TM) SALES. AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUE, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE APPROXIMATELY 51%, 55% AND 70% IN 2001, 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY. WHILE IN ACTUAL DOLLAR TERMS THESE EXPENSES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE, THE PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUE IS EXPECTED TO DECLINE AS TOTAL REVENUE INCREASES. MERGER-RELATED COSTS. WE INCURRED ONE-TIME COSTS OF $6.7 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE MERGER WITH SIGNAL PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. IN 2000. THESE COSTS WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO FEES FOR FINANCIAL ADVISORS, ACCOUNTANTS, LAWYERS AND FINANCIAL PRINTERS. INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE. INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 19% IN 2001, TO $20.9 MILLION FROM $17.6 MILLION IN 2000. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO HIGHER AVERAGE CASH BALANCES AND THE RECOGNITION OF A GAIN ON THE SALE OF CERTAIN MARKETABLE SECURITIES DURING 2001. INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME IN 2000 INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY TO $17.6 MILLION FROM $1.3 MILLION IN 1999. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO THE INVESTMENT OF THE NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $278.0 MILLION FROM THE FOLLOW-ON PUBLIC OFFERING IN FEBRUARY OF 2000, AND $10.0 MILLION RECEIVED FROM NOVARTIS PHARMA AG IN JULY 2000 RELATED TO THE LICENSE AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2000. INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED TO APPROXIMATELY $83,000 IN 2001 COMPARED WITH $2.1 MILLION IN 2000. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE-HOLDERS TO ELIMINATE THE INTEREST REQUIREMENTS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE RIGHT TO HEDGE THE SHARES UNDERLYING THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES. INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2000 TO $2.1 MILLION FROM $3.3 MILLION IN 1999. THE DECREASE WAS THE RESULT OF THE CONVERSION TO EQUITY OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM CONVERTIBLE NOTES THROUGHOUT 2000. LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. THE LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2001, TO $2.9 MILLION FROM $17.0 MILLION IN 2000. THE DECREASED LOSS RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN TOTAL REVENUE OF $29.3 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN NET INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE OF $5.3 MILLION AND AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $1.2 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF A PORTION OF OUR NEW JERSEY STATE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN COSTS AND EXPENSES OF $20.0 MILLION THE LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS DECREASED 43% TO $17.0 MILLION IN 2000 FROM $29.6 MILLION IN 1999. THE DECREASED LOSS WAS THE RESULT OF HIGHER THALOMID(REG. TM) SALES, INCREASED REVENUES FROM RESEARCH CONTRACTS AND COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $1.8 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF A PORTION OF OUR NEW JERSEY STATE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER COST OF GOODS SOLD, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND ONE-TIME MERGER-RELATED COSTS. GAIN ON SALE OF CHIRAL ASSETS. WE RECEIVED ROYALTY PAYMENTS FROM CAMBREX CORPORATION OF APPROXIMATELY $1.0 MILLION IN 2001 AND $719,000 IN 2000, WHICH REPRESENT ADDITIONAL PORTIONS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID BY CAMBREX FOR OUR CHIRAL ASSETS. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES SINCE INCEPTION, WE HAVE FINANCED OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS PRIMARILY THROUGH PRODUCT SALES, PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SALES OF OUR DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES, INCOME EARNED ON THE INVESTMENT OF PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SUCH SECURITIES AND REVENUE FROM RESEARCH CONTRACTS AND LICENSE AND MILESTONE PAYMENTS. SINCE OUR INITIAL PRODUCT LAUNCH IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 1998, WE HAVE RECORDED NET PRODUCT SALES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $174.0 MILLION THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2001. WE ALSO RECEIVED $37.5 MILLION FROM TWO SEPARATE RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS DURING 2000 AND 2001. OUR WORKING CAPITAL AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 3% TO $306.5 MILLION FROM $298.2 MILLION IN 2000. THE INCREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER COMBINATION OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND LOWER CURRENT LIABLILITIES. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DECREASED TO $47.1 MILLION IN 2001 FROM $161.4 MILLION IN 2000 WHILE INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES INCREASED TO $262.9 MILLION IN 2001 FROM $144.8 MILLION IN 2000. TOTAL CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $3.9 MILLION REFLECTING THE RECEIPT OF FUNDS FROM REVENUE RECEIVED FROM RESEARCH CONTRACTS AND COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES FROM SALES OF THALOMID(REG. TM). 35 WE EXPECT THAT OUR RATE OF SPENDING WILL INCREASE AS THE RESULT OF RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SPENDING, INCREASED CLINICAL TRIAL COSTS, INCREASED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF PRODUCTS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT, INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF THALOMID(REG. TM) AND INCREASED CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. ON FEBRUARY 16, 2000, WE COMPLETED A PUBLIC OFFERING OF 10,350,000 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AS ADJUSTED FOR A THREE-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT EFFECTIVE APRIL 2000. PROCEEDS FROM THE TRANSACTION NET OF EXPENSES, WERE APPROXIMATELY $278.0 MILLION. THESE FUNDS, COMBINED WITH THE INCREASING REVENUE FROM PRODUCT SALES AND VARIOUS RESEARCH AGREEMENTS AND COLLABORATIONS, ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL FOR OUR OPERATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OUR MAJOR OUTSTANDING CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATE TO OUR OPERATING (FACILITIES) LEASES. OUR FACILITIES LEASE EXPENSE IN FUTURE YEARS WILL INCREASE OVER PREVIOUS YEARS AS A RESULT OF A NEW LEASE ARRANGEMENT ENTERED INTO IN 2001. WE LEASE A 44,500-SQUARE FOOT LABORATORY AND OFFICE FACILITY IN WARREN, NEW JERSEY, UNDER A LEASE WITH AN UNAFFILIATED PARTY, WHICH HAS A TERM ENDING IN MAY 2002 WITH THREE FIVE-YEAR RENEWAL OPTIONS, AND A 29,000-SQUARE FOOT FACILITY WHICH HAS A TERM ENDING IN JULY 2010 WITH TWO FIVE-YEAR RENEWAL OPTIONS. MONTHLY RENTAL EXPENSES FOR THIS FACILITY ARE APPROXIMATELY $64,000. WE ALSO LEASE AN 18,000-SQUARE FOOT LABORATORY AND OFFICE FACILITY IN NORTH BRUNSWICK, NEW JERSEY, UNDER A LEASE WITH AN UNAFFILIATED PARTY WHICH HAS A TERM ENDING IN DECEMBER 2009 WITH TWO FIVE-YEAR RENEWAL OPTIONS. MONTHLY RENTAL EXPENSES FOR THIS FACILITY ARE APPROXIMATELY $46,000. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR LABORATORY FACILITIES ARE ADEQUATE FOR OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE ALSO LEASE OFFICES AND RESEARCH FACILITIES IN SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA UNDER THREE OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS FOR OUR SIGNAL RESEARCH OPERATIONS. THE MINIMUM ANNUAL RENTS ARE SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED ANNUAL RENTAL INCREASES. SIGNAL ALSO REIMBURSES THE LESSOR FOR TAXES, INSURANCE AND OPERATING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEASES. MONTHLY RENTAL EXPENSE FOR THESE FACILITIES IS APPROXIMATELY $81,000. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LEASE, WE HAVE AN OUTSTANDING LETTER OF CREDIT FOR $150,000 IN FAVOR OF THE LESSOR, WHICH IS FULLY COLLATERALIZED BY CASH. IN DECEMBER 2001, WE ENTERED INTO A NEW TEN-YEAR LEASE FOR A 78,200 SQUARE FOOT FACILITY TO CONSOLIDATE THE SIGNAL RESEARCH DIVISION INTO ONE BUILDING. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT WE WILL OCCUPY THAT FACILITY DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002. MONTHLY RENTAL EXPENSE WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $172,000. RENTAL EXPENSE WILL BE INCURRED WHEN WE OCCUPY THE BUILDING. WE INTEND TO SUBLEASE THE CURRENT FACILITIES UNTIL THE LEASE EXPIRES IN 2003. FOR A SCHEDULE OF PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE OPERATING LEASES, REFER TO THE TABLE INCLUDED IN FOOTNOTE 17(A) TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN DECEMBER 2001, THE SEC REQUESTED THAT ALL REGISTRANTS DISCUSS THEIR MOST "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES" IN MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE SEC INDICATED THAT A "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY" IS ONE WHICH IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENT'S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 2 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICY TO BE CRITICAL: REVENUE RECOGNITION. WE HAVE FORMED COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS AND ALLIANCES WITH SEVERAL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE IN THE FORM OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS. THE AGREEMENTS ARE FOR BOTH EARLY AND LATE STAGE COMPOUNDS AND ARE FOCUSED ON SPECIFIC DISEASE AREAS. FOR THE EARLY STAGE COMPOUNDS, THE AGREEMENTS ARE RELATIVELY SHORT-TERM AGREEMENTS THAT ARE RENEWABLE DEPENDING ON THE SUCCESS OF THE COMPOUNDS AS THEY MOVE 36 THROUGH PRECLINICAL DEVELOPMENT. THE AGREEMENTS CALL FOR NONREFUNDABLE UPFRONT PAYMENTS, MILESTONE PAYMENTS ON ACHIEVING SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE EVENTS, AND IN SOME CASES ONGOING RESEARCH FUNDING. THE AGREEMENTS ALSO CONTEMPLATE ROYALTY PAYMENTS ON SALES IF AND WHEN THE COMPOUND RECEIVES FDA MARKETING APPROVAL. IN ACCORDANCE WITH STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 101 ("SAB 101") REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, UPFRONT PAYMENTS ARE RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE ESTIMATED SERVICE PERIOD. IF THE ESTIMATED SERVICE PERIOD IS SUBSEQUENTLY MODIFIED, THE PERIOD OVER WHICH THE UPFRONT FEE IS RECOGNIZED IS MODIFIED ACCORDINGLY ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS. REVENUE FROM THE ACHIEVEMENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES, WHICH REPRESENT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A SIGNIFICANT STEP IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN AND IF THE SPECIFIC MILESTONES ARE ACHIEVED. CONTINUATION OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ACHIEVING SPECIFIC CONTRACTUAL MILESTONES; HOWEVER, NONE OF THE PAYMENTS RECEIVED TO DATE ARE REFUNDABLE REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF THE PROJECT. RESEARCH FUNDING IS RECORDED IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE EXPENSES COVERED BY THE FUNDING OCCURRED. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IN JULY 2001, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 141, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, AND SFAS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. SFAS NO. 141 REQUIRES THAT ALL BUSINESS COMBINATIONS BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER A SINGLE METHOD--THE PURCHASE METHOD. USE OF THE POOLING-OF-INTERESTS METHOD NO LONGER IS PERMITTED. SFAS NO. 141 REQUIRES THAT THE PURCHASE METHOD BE USED FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INITIATED AFTER JUNE 30, 2001. SFAS NO. 142 REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL NO LONGER BE AMORTIZED TO EARNINGS, BUT INSTEAD BE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT. THE AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL CEASES UPON ADOPTION OF THE STATEMENT, WHICH FOR CALENDAR YEAR-END COMPANIES, WILL BE JANUARY 1, 2002. SFAS NO. 142 HAS NO FINANCIAL IMPACT ON US AS WE DO NOT HAVE ANY GOODWILL OR INTANGIBLE ASSETS WHICH RESULTED FROM BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK MARKET RISK OUR HOLDINGS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE COMPRISED OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, U.S. GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE SECURITIES. THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE OR HELD TO MATURITY AND CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST DEPENDING UPON OUR INTENT. SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE HELD FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED TO BE USED TO MEET OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES (WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY) ON AVAILABLE FOR SALE SECURITIES, IF ANY, ARE REPORTED IN A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY. THE COST OF ALL DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME. WE DO NOT USE FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES FOR INVESTMENT OR TRADING PURPOSES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000, ALL SECURITIES HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH OUR INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. OUR INVESTMENTS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND WILL DECREASE IN VALUE IF MARKET INTEREST RATES INCREASE. DUE TO THE LIMITED NUMBER OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS, OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE CURRENCY RISK IS MINIMAL. 37 THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS AND RELATED WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES BY YEAR OF MATURITY FOR OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001: 2002 2003 2004 2005 ---- ---- ---- ---- (IN THOUSANDS $) FIXED RATE .................... $ 5,250 $ 36,800 $ 5,000 $ 28,510 AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ......... 6.66% 6.63% 6.75% 7.70% VARIABLE RATE ................. -- -- -- -- AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ......... -- -- -- -- ------- -------- ------- -------- TOTAL ....................... $ 5,250 $ 36,800 $ 5,000 $ 28,510 2007 AND 2006 BEYOND TOTAL FAIR VALUE ---- -------- ----- ---------- FIXED RATE .................... $ 64,307 $ 113,000 $ 252,867 $260,900 AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ......... 6.80% 6.90% 6.92% -- VARIABLE RATE ................. -- $ 2,000 $ 2,000 $ 2,000 AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ......... -- 8.00% 8.00% -- -------- --------- --------- -------- TOTAL ....................... $ 64,307 $ 115,000 $ 254,867 $262,900 AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, OUR 9% JANUARY 1999 AND JULY 1999 CONVERTIBLE NOTES WITH OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS OF $1,713,600 AND $10,000,000, RESPECTIVELY, NO LONGER ACCRUE INTEREST. THESE CONVERTIBLE NOTES ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO OUR COMMON STOCK AT A CONVERSION PRICE OF $6.00 AND $6.33 PER SHARE, RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR VALUE OF FIXED INTEREST RATE INSTRUMENTS ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND IN THE CASE OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES BY CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. AN INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK RESULTS IN AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES. WE DO NOT USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW WE WERE ORGANIZED IN 1980 AS A UNIT OF CELANESE CORPORATION, A CHEMICAL COMPANY. OUR INITIAL MANDATE WAS TO APPLY BIOTECHNOLOGY TO THE PRODUCTION OF FINE AND SPECIALTY CHEMICALS. FOLLOWING THE 1986 MERGER OF CELANESE CORPORATION WITH AMERICAN HOECHST CORPORATION, WE WERE SPUN OFF AS AN INDEPENDENT BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY. IN JULY 1987, WE COMPLETED AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND COMMENCED THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF CHEMICAL AND BIOTREATMENT PROCESSES FOR THE CHEMICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES. WE DISCONTINUED THE BIOTREATMENT OPERATIONS IN 1994 TO FOCUS ON OUR TARGETED SMALL MOLECULE CANCER AND IMMUNOLOGY COMPOUND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND OUR BIOCATALYTIC CHIRAL CHEMISTRY PROGRAM. BETWEEN 1990 AND 1998, OUR REVENUE WAS GENERATED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY OF CHIRALLY PURE INTERMEDIATES TO PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES FOR USE IN NEW DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND, TO A LESSER DEGREE, FROM AGROCHEMICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS. HOWEVER, AS REVENUE FROM THALOMID(REG. TM) SALES, LICENSE AGREEMENTS AND MILESTONE PAYMENTS RELATED TO OUR CANCER AND IMMUNOLOGY PROGRAMS INCREASED, SALES OF CHIRALLY PURE INTERMEDIATES BECAME A LESS INTEGRAL PART OF OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS. ACCORDINGLY, ON JANUARY 9, 1998, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF OUR CHIRAL INTERMEDIATES BUSINESS TO CAMBREX CORPORATION FOR $15.0 MILLION. TERMS OF THE SALE PROVIDED FOR A PAYMENT TO CELGENE OF $7.5 MILLION AT CLOSING AND FUTURE ROYALTIES ON PRODUCT SALES NOT TO EXCEED THE NET PRESENT VALUE ON THE INITIAL DATE OF THE SALE OF $7.5 MILLION, WITH A GUARANTEE OF CERTAIN MINIMUM PAYMENTS TO CELGENE BEGINNING IN THE THIRD YEAR FOLLOWING THE CLOSE OF THE AGREEMENT. IN JULY 1998, WE RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE FDA TO MARKET THALOMID(REG. TM) (THALIDOMIDE) FOR USE IN ENL, A SIDE EFFECT OF LEPROSY, AND, IN LATE SEPTEMBER 1998, WE COMMENCED SALES OF THALOMID(REG. TM) IN THE UNITED STATES. SALES HAVE GROWN RAPIDLY EACH YEAR SINCE THE LAUNCH AND, IN 2001, WE RECORDED NET SALES OF THALOMID(REG. TM) OF $82.0 MILLION. ON FEBRUARY 16, 2000, WE COMPLETED A FOLLOW-ON PUBLIC OFFERING TO SELL 10,350,000 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE OF $33.67 PER SHARE, AS ADJUSTED FOR A THREE-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT EFFECTIVE APRIL 2000. 8,802,000 SHARES WERE FOR OUR ACCOUNT AND 1,548,000 WERE FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A SELLING SHAREHOLDER PURSUANT TO THE CONVERSION OF $9,288,000 OF THE 9%, JANUARY 1999 CONVERTIBLE NOTES HELD BY THAT SHAREHOLDER. OUR PROCEEDS, NET OF OFFERING EXPENSES, WERE APPROXIMATELY $278.0 MILLION. ON APRIL 19, 2000, WE SIGNED A LICENSE AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT WITH NOVARTIS PHARMA AG IN WHICH WE GRANTED TO NOVARTIS A WORLDWIDE LICENSE FOR D-MPH, OUR CHIRALLY PURE VERSION OF RITALIN(REG. TM). THE AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR SIGNIFICANT UPFRONT AND MILESTONE PAYMENTS BASED ON ACHIEVING VARIOUS REGULATORY APPROVALS AND ROYALTIES ON THE ENTIRE FAMILY OF RITALIN(REG. TM) PRODUCTS UPON APPROVAL OF D-MPH BY THE FDA. WE HAVE RETAINED THE RIGHTS FOR THE USE OF D-MPH IN ONCOLOGY INDICATIONS. WE RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE FDA TO MARKET D-MPH, OR FOCALIN(TM), ON NOVEMBER 14, 2001. ON AUGUST 31, 2000, WE COMPLETED A MERGER, ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING-OF-INTERESTS, WITH SIGNAL PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., A PRIVATELY HELD BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY FOCUSED ON THE DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF DRUGS THAT REGULATE GENES ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE. WE HAVE SUSTAINED LOSSES IN EACH YEAR SINCE OUR INCEPTION AS AN INDEPENDENT BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY IN 1986. IN 2001, WE HAD A NET LOSS OF $1.9 MILLION AND, AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, WE HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $222.4 MILLION. WE EXPECT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE THALOMID(REG. TM), DEVELOP OUR OTHER ONCOLOGY AND IMMUNOLOGICAL DISEASE PROGRAMS, AND ADVANCE OUR GENE REGULATION AND TARGET DISCOVERY PROGRAM. THESE EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE MORE THAN OFFSET BY INCREASING SALES OF THALOMID(REG. TM), SALES OF FOCALIN(TM) TO NOVARTIS AND ROYALTIES FROM NOVARTIS ON THEIR SALES OF RITALIN(REG. TM), REVENUES FROM VARIOUS RESEARCH COLLABORATIONS AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, AND INVESTMENT INCOME. SUBJECT TO THE RISKS DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES UNDER DEVELOPMENT BY US. TO ADDRESS THESE AND POTENTIAL FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES IN A TIMELY AND COMPETITIVE MANNER, WE INTEND TO 32 SEEK OUT DRUG DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATIONS AND LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS COVERING THE MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION FOR US OF CERTAIN COMPOUNDS, SUCH AS THALOMID(REG. TM) AND FOCALIN(TM), AND THE DEVELOPMENT BY US OF PROCESSES FOR PRODUCING CHIRALLY PURE CROP PROTECTION AGENTS FOR LICENSE TO AGROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS. THE LATTER DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE PERFORMED THROUGH CELGRO CORPORATION, OUR WHOLLY OWNED AGROCHEMICAL SUBSIDIARY. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A COMMERCIAL SALES, MARKETING AND CUSTOMER SERVICE ORGANIZATION TO SELL AND SUPPORT THALOMID(REG. TM) AND AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2002, WE EMPLOY 128 PERSONS IN THIS CAPACITY. WE INTEND TO DEVELOP AND MARKET OUR OWN PHARMACEUTICALS FOR INDICATIONS WITH ECONOMICALLY ACCESSIBLE PATIENT POPULATIONS IN OUR DISEASE FRANCHISES. FOR DRUGS WITH INDICATIONS OUTSIDE THE ONCOLOGY AND IMMUNOLOGICAL DISEASE FIELDS AND FOR LARGER PATIENT POPULATIONS, WE MAY PARTNER WITH OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. WE CURRENTLY PARTNER WITH COMPANIES SUCH AS NOVARTIS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR CHIRALLY PURE PHARMACEUTICAL AND AGROCHEMICAL PRODUCTS. WE EXPECT THESE ARRANGEMENTS TYPICALLY WILL INCLUDE SOME COMBINATION OF LICENSE FEES, MILESTONE PAYMENTS, REIMBURSEMENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND ROYALTY ARRANGEMENTS. WE ALSO MAY ACQUIRE PRODUCTS OR COMPANIES TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO AND TO AUGMENT OUR DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION RESOURCES. FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, REGULATORY APPROVALS OF OUR PRODUCTS, THE TIMING OF THE INTRODUCTION AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS BY US OR COMPETING COMPANIES, THE TIMING OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL COSTS. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, 2000 AND 1999 TOTAL REVENUE. OUR TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 INCREASED 35% TO $114.2 MILLION COMPARED WITH $84.9 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2000. TOTAL REVENUE IN 2001 CONSISTED OF PRODUCT SALES OF $84.2 MILLION, OF WHICH $82.0 MILLION WERE THALOMID(REG. TM) SALES AND $2.2 MILLION WERE SALES OF FOCALIN(TM), WHICH RECEIVED FDA APPROVAL IN NOVEMBER 2001, RESEARCH CONTRACT REVENUE OF $28.1 MILLION AND RELATED PARTY REVENUE OF $1.9 MILLION COMPARED WITH PRODUCT SALES OF $62.7 MILLION, ALL OF WHICH WERE THALOMID(REG. TM) SALES, RESEARCH CONTRACT REVENUE OF $15.9 MILLION AND RELATED PARTY REVENUE OF $6.3 MILLION IN 2000. THALOMID(REG. TM) SALES CONTINUE TO GROW IN ONCOLOGY AS MORE CLINICAL DATA IS PRESENTED EITHER IN PUBLICATIONS OR AT ONCOLOGY MEETINGS. RESEARCH CONTRACT REVENUE INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $10.4 MILLION OF AMORTIZATION OF UPFRONT PAYMENTS RELATED TO TWO SEPARATE AGREEMENTS WITH NOVARTIS PHARMA AG AND A MILESTONE PAYMENT OF $12.5 MILLION FROM NOVARTIS FOR RECEIVING FDA APPROVAL TO MARKET FOCALIN(TM). RELATED PARTY REVENUE DECREASED IN 2001 AS THE INITIAL TERMS OF BOTH RELATED PARTY AGREEMENTS EXPIRED AND SUCH ENTITIES ARE NO LONGER CONSIDERED RELATED PARTIES. ONE OF THOSE AGREEMENTS HAS BEEN EXTENDED AND APPROXIMATELY $2.8 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS RESEARCH CONTRACT REVENUE IN 2001. OUR TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 INCREASED 122% TO $84.9 MILLION COMPARED WITH $38.2 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 1999. REVENUE IN 2000 CONSISTED OF THALOMID(REG. TM) SALES OF $62.7 MILLION, RESEARCH CONTRACT REVENUE OF $15.9 MILLION AND RELATED PARTY COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENT REVENUE OF $6.3 MILLION COMPARED WITH THALOMID(REG. TM) SALES OF $24.3 MILLION, RESEARCH CONTRACT REVENUE OF $9.4 MILLION AND REVENUE FROM RELATED PARTY COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS OF $4.5 MILLION IN 1999. THE GROWTH IN THALOMID(REG. TM) SALES PRIMARILY IS RELATED TO INCREASED USE FOR ONCOLOGY INDICATIONS. RESEARCH CONTRACT REVENUE FOR 2000 INCLUDED THE RECOGNITION OF $4.6 MILLION OF THE $10.0 MILLION NONREFUNDABLE UPFRONT LICENSE FEE PAYMENT RECEIVED IN CONNECTION WITH A COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO WITH NOVARTIS PHARMA AG IN APRIL 2000, AND A $5.0 MILLION MILESTONE PAYMENT RELATED TO THE SAME AGREEMENT WITH NOVARTIS. COST OF GOODS SOLD. COST OF GOODS SOLD IN 2001 INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 36% TO $13.6 MILLION FROM APPROXIMATELY $10.0 MILLION IN 2000, IN LINE WITH THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT SALES AND THEREFORE PRIMARILY VOLUME RELATED. COST OF GOODS SOLD FOR 2001 RELATING TO FOCALIN(TM) SALES WAS FAVORABLY IMPACTED AS MANUFACTURING COSTS INCURRED PRIOR TO FOCALIN'S(TM) APPROVAL IN NOVEMBER 2001 WERE EXPENSED AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. THIS FAVORABILITY WILL CONTINUE UNTIL THE QUANTITY PREVIOUSLY EXPENSED IS COMPLETELY SOLD. COST OF GOODS SOLD IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 WAS APPROXIMATELY $10.0 MILLION COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY $3.2 MILLION IN 1999. THE INCREASE IN COST OF GOODS SOLD REFLECTS THE HIGHER 33 VOLUME OF THALOMID(REG. TM) SALES IN 2000. IN ADDITION, THE COST OF GOODS SOLD DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2000 AND THE FULL YEAR OF 1999 WAS LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED AS RAW MATERIAL, FORMULATION AND ENCAPSULATION COSTS OF THALOMID(REG. TM) WERE CHARGED AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES PRIOR TO RECEIVING FDA MARKETING APPROVAL. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SALARIES AND BENEFITS, CONTRACTOR FEES, PRINCIPALLY WITH CONTRACT RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS TO ASSIST IN OUR CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, CLINICAL DRUG SUPPLIES FOR OUR CLINICAL AND PRECLINICAL PROGRAMS AS WELL AS OTHER CONSUMABLE RESEARCH SUPPLIES, AND ALLOCATED FACILITIES CHARGES SUCH AS BUILDING RENT AND UTILITIES. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES IN 2001 INCREASED 20% TO $67.7 MILLION FROM $56.2 MILLION IN 2000. APPROXIMATELY $33 MILLION WAS SPENT ON THALOMID(REG. TM) AND ITS FOLLOW-ON COMPOUNDS, THE IMIDS(REG. TM) AND SELCIDS(TM), PRIMARILY FOR PRECLINICAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHASE I/II CLINICAL TRIALS, REGULATORY EXPENSES FOR PREPARATION OF AN SNDA FOR THALOMID(REG. TM) IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND LEGAL EXPENSES RELATED TO PATENT FILINGS. APPROXIMATELY $2.8 MILLION WAS SPENT FOR FOCALIN(TM) (D-MPH) PRIMARILY FOR DRUG SUPPLY WHICH WAS EXPENSED PRIOR TO FDA APPROVAL. WE SPENT APPROXIMATELY $31.8 MILLION IN OUR GENE REGULATION, TARGET DISCOVERY AND AGRO-CHEMICAL PROGRAMS, PRIMARILY FOR INTERNAL HEADCOUNT RELATED EXPENSES, LABORATORY SUPPLIES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED BY 45% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 TO APPROXIMATELY $56.2 MILLION COMPARED TO $38.8 MILLION IN 1999. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SPENDING FOR PRECLINICAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY STUDIES AND PHASE I AND PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS FOR OUR SELCIDS(TM) AND IMIDS(REG. TM), COMPLETION OF THE PIVOTAL CLINICAL TRIALS AND PREPARATION FOR FILING THE NDA FOR D-MPH, OUR CHIRALLY PURE VERSION OF RITALIN(REG. TM), AND PRECLINICAL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT FOR OUR SERM CANCER PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY, THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN THE RECOGNITION OF DEFERRED COMPENSATION RECORDED FOR STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED BY SIGNAL DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2000. AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE APPROXIMATELY 59%, 66% AND 101% IN 2001, 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY. AS A RESULT OF INCREASING REVENUE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUE ALTHOUGH THE ACTUAL DOLLAR AMOUNT WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE AS WE MOVE OUR EARLIER STAGE COMPOUNDS THROUGH PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL PROGRAMS. REFERENCE THE TABLE ON PAGE 4 OF PART I -- BUSINESS SECTION FOR THE STATUS OF SPECIFIC COMPOUNDS. IN GENERAL, ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETION WITHIN THE VARIOUS STAGES OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS: ESTIMATED COMPLETION CLINICAL PHASE PERIOD -------------- -------------------- PHASE I 1-2 YEARS PHASE II 1-2 YEARS PHASE III 2-3 YEARS DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN PRECLINICAL TESTS AND CLINICAL TRIALS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, THE COST TO COMPLETE SUCH PROJECTS IS NOT REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. THE DATA OBTAINED FROM THESE TESTS AND TRIALS MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING INTERPRETATION THAT COULD DELAY, LIMIT OR PREVENT A PROJECT'S ADVANCEMENT THROUGH THE VARIOUS STAGES OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE COSTS INCURRED TO BRING A PROJECT TO COMPLETION. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. SELLING EXPENSE CONSIST OF SALARIES AND BENEFITS FOR SALES AND MARKETING AND CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSONNEL, WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS, AND OTHER COMMERCIAL EXPENSES TO SUPPORT THE SALES FORCE AND THE EDUCATION AND REGISTRATION EFFORTS UNDERLYING THE S.T.E.P.S.(REG. TM) PROGRAM. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SALARIES AND BENEFITS, OUTSIDE SERVICES FOR LEGAL, AUDIT, TAX AND INVESTOR ACTIVITIES AND ALLOCATIONS OF FACILITIES COSTS, PRINCIPALLY FOR RENT, UTILITIES AND PROPERTY TAXES. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED 25% IN 2001 TO $58.0 MILLION FROM $46.4 MILLION IN 2000. THE INCREASED SPENDING WAS PRIMARILY COMMERCIAL EXPENSES TO SUPPORT THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF THALOMID(REG. TM), WITH APPROXIMATELY A $2.7 MILLION INCREASE IN SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE SALES FORCE EXPANSION AND AN INCREASE OF $2.5 MILLION IN CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO BRINGING THE PREVIOUSLY OUT-SOURCED CUSTOMER SERVICE FUNCTION IN HOUSE AND A ROLL OUT OF AN ENHANCED S.T.E.P.S.(REG. TM) PROGRAM. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR 2000 INCREASED 73% TO $46.4 MILLION FROM $26.9 MILLION IN 1999. THE INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE EXPANSION OF OUR SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATION AND RELATED EXPENSES, AND 34 SPENDING FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION, ALL TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH IN THALOMID(REG. TM) SALES. AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUE, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE APPROXIMATELY 51%, 55% AND 70% IN 2001, 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY. WHILE IN ACTUAL DOLLAR TERMS THESE EXPENSES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE, THE PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUE IS EXPECTED TO DECLINE AS TOTAL REVENUE INCREASES. MERGER-RELATED COSTS. WE INCURRED ONE-TIME COSTS OF $6.7 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE MERGER WITH SIGNAL PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. IN 2000. THESE COSTS WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO FEES FOR FINANCIAL ADVISORS, ACCOUNTANTS, LAWYERS AND FINANCIAL PRINTERS. INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE. INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 19% IN 2001, TO $20.9 MILLION FROM $17.6 MILLION IN 2000. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO HIGHER AVERAGE CASH BALANCES AND THE RECOGNITION OF A GAIN ON THE SALE OF CERTAIN MARKETABLE SECURITIES DURING 2001. INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME IN 2000 INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY TO $17.6 MILLION FROM $1.3 MILLION IN 1999. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO THE INVESTMENT OF THE NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $278.0 MILLION FROM THE FOLLOW-ON PUBLIC OFFERING IN FEBRUARY OF 2000, AND $10.0 MILLION RECEIVED FROM NOVARTIS PHARMA AG IN JULY 2000 RELATED TO THE LICENSE AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2000. INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED TO APPROXIMATELY $83,000 IN 2001 COMPARED WITH $2.1 MILLION IN 2000. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE-HOLDERS TO ELIMINATE THE INTEREST REQUIREMENTS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE RIGHT TO HEDGE THE SHARES UNDERLYING THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES. INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2000 TO $2.1 MILLION FROM $3.3 MILLION IN 1999. THE DECREASE WAS THE RESULT OF THE CONVERSION TO EQUITY OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM CONVERTIBLE NOTES THROUGHOUT 2000. LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. THE LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2001, TO $2.9 MILLION FROM $17.0 MILLION IN 2000. THE DECREASED LOSS RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN TOTAL REVENUE OF $29.3 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN NET INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE OF $5.3 MILLION AND AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $1.2 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF A PORTION OF OUR NEW JERSEY STATE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN COSTS AND EXPENSES OF $20.0 MILLION THE LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS DECREASED 43% TO $17.0 MILLION IN 2000 FROM $29.6 MILLION IN 1999. THE DECREASED LOSS WAS THE RESULT OF HIGHER THALOMID(REG. TM) SALES, INCREASED REVENUES FROM RESEARCH CONTRACTS AND COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $1.8 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF A PORTION OF OUR NEW JERSEY STATE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER COST OF GOODS SOLD, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND ONE-TIME MERGER-RELATED COSTS. GAIN ON SALE OF CHIRAL ASSETS. WE RECEIVED ROYALTY PAYMENTS FROM CAMBREX CORPORATION OF APPROXIMATELY $1.0 MILLION IN 2001 AND $719,000 IN 2000, WHICH REPRESENT ADDITIONAL PORTIONS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID BY CAMBREX FOR OUR CHIRAL ASSETS. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES SINCE INCEPTION, WE HAVE FINANCED OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS PRIMARILY THROUGH PRODUCT SALES, PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SALES OF OUR DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES, INCOME EARNED ON THE INVESTMENT OF PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SUCH SECURITIES AND REVENUE FROM RESEARCH CONTRACTS AND LICENSE AND MILESTONE PAYMENTS. SINCE OUR INITIAL PRODUCT LAUNCH IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 1998, WE HAVE RECORDED NET PRODUCT SALES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $174.0 MILLION THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2001. WE ALSO RECEIVED $37.5 MILLION FROM TWO SEPARATE RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS DURING 2000 AND 2001. OUR WORKING CAPITAL AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 3% TO $306.5 MILLION FROM $298.2 MILLION IN 2000. THE INCREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER COMBINATION OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND LOWER CURRENT LIABLILITIES. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DECREASED TO $47.1 MILLION IN 2001 FROM $161.4 MILLION IN 2000 WHILE INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES INCREASED TO $262.9 MILLION IN 2001 FROM $144.8 MILLION IN 2000. TOTAL CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $3.9 MILLION REFLECTING THE RECEIPT OF FUNDS FROM REVENUE RECEIVED FROM RESEARCH CONTRACTS AND COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES FROM SALES OF THALOMID(REG. TM). 35 WE EXPECT THAT OUR RATE OF SPENDING WILL INCREASE AS THE RESULT OF RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SPENDING, INCREASED CLINICAL TRIAL COSTS, INCREASED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF PRODUCTS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT, INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF THALOMID(REG. TM) AND INCREASED CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. ON FEBRUARY 16, 2000, WE COMPLETED A PUBLIC OFFERING OF 10,350,000 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AS ADJUSTED FOR A THREE-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT EFFECTIVE APRIL 2000. PROCEEDS FROM THE TRANSACTION NET OF EXPENSES, WERE APPROXIMATELY $278.0 MILLION. THESE FUNDS, COMBINED WITH THE INCREASING REVENUE FROM PRODUCT SALES AND VARIOUS RESEARCH AGREEMENTS AND COLLABORATIONS, ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL FOR OUR OPERATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OUR MAJOR OUTSTANDING CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATE TO OUR OPERATING (FACILITIES) LEASES. OUR FACILITIES LEASE EXPENSE IN FUTURE YEARS WILL INCREASE OVER PREVIOUS YEARS AS A RESULT OF A NEW LEASE ARRANGEMENT ENTERED INTO IN 2001. WE LEASE A 44,500-SQUARE FOOT LABORATORY AND OFFICE FACILITY IN WARREN, NEW JERSEY, UNDER A LEASE WITH AN UNAFFILIATED PARTY, WHICH HAS A TERM ENDING IN MAY 2002 WITH THREE FIVE-YEAR RENEWAL OPTIONS, AND A 29,000-SQUARE FOOT FACILITY WHICH HAS A TERM ENDING IN JULY 2010 WITH TWO FIVE-YEAR RENEWAL OPTIONS. MONTHLY RENTAL EXPENSES FOR THIS FACILITY ARE APPROXIMATELY $64,000. WE ALSO LEASE AN 18,000-SQUARE FOOT LABORATORY AND OFFICE FACILITY IN NORTH BRUNSWICK, NEW JERSEY, UNDER A LEASE WITH AN UNAFFILIATED PARTY WHICH HAS A TERM ENDING IN DECEMBER 2009 WITH TWO FIVE-YEAR RENEWAL OPTIONS. MONTHLY RENTAL EXPENSES FOR THIS FACILITY ARE APPROXIMATELY $46,000. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR LABORATORY FACILITIES ARE ADEQUATE FOR OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE ALSO LEASE OFFICES AND RESEARCH FACILITIES IN SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA UNDER THREE OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS FOR OUR SIGNAL RESEARCH OPERATIONS. THE MINIMUM ANNUAL RENTS ARE SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED ANNUAL RENTAL INCREASES. SIGNAL ALSO REIMBURSES THE LESSOR FOR TAXES, INSURANCE AND OPERATING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEASES. MONTHLY RENTAL EXPENSE FOR THESE FACILITIES IS APPROXIMATELY $81,000. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LEASE, WE HAVE AN OUTSTANDING LETTER OF CREDIT FOR $150,000 IN FAVOR OF THE LESSOR, WHICH IS FULLY COLLATERALIZED BY CASH. IN DECEMBER 2001, WE ENTERED INTO A NEW TEN-YEAR LEASE FOR A 78,200 SQUARE FOOT FACILITY TO CONSOLIDATE THE SIGNAL RESEARCH DIVISION INTO ONE BUILDING. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT WE WILL OCCUPY THAT FACILITY DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002. MONTHLY RENTAL EXPENSE WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $172,000. RENTAL EXPENSE WILL BE INCURRED WHEN WE OCCUPY THE BUILDING. WE INTEND TO SUBLEASE THE CURRENT FACILITIES UNTIL THE LEASE EXPIRES IN 2003. FOR A SCHEDULE OF PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE OPERATING LEASES, REFER TO THE TABLE INCLUDED IN FOOTNOTE 17(A) TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN DECEMBER 2001, THE SEC REQUESTED THAT ALL REGISTRANTS DISCUSS THEIR MOST "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES" IN MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE SEC INDICATED THAT A "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY" IS ONE WHICH IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENT'S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 2 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICY TO BE CRITICAL: REVENUE RECOGNITION. WE HAVE FORMED COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS AND ALLIANCES WITH SEVERAL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE IN THE FORM OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS. THE AGREEMENTS ARE FOR BOTH EARLY AND LATE STAGE COMPOUNDS AND ARE FOCUSED ON SPECIFIC DISEASE AREAS. FOR THE EARLY STAGE COMPOUNDS, THE AGREEMENTS ARE RELATIVELY SHORT-TERM AGREEMENTS THAT ARE RENEWABLE DEPENDING ON THE SUCCESS OF THE COMPOUNDS AS THEY MOVE 36 THROUGH PRECLINICAL DEVELOPMENT. THE AGREEMENTS CALL FOR NONREFUNDABLE UPFRONT PAYMENTS, MILESTONE PAYMENTS ON ACHIEVING SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE EVENTS, AND IN SOME CASES ONGOING RESEARCH FUNDING. THE AGREEMENTS ALSO CONTEMPLATE ROYALTY PAYMENTS ON SALES IF AND WHEN THE COMPOUND RECEIVES FDA MARKETING APPROVAL. IN ACCORDANCE WITH STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 101 ("SAB 101") REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, UPFRONT PAYMENTS ARE RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE ESTIMATED SERVICE PERIOD. IF THE ESTIMATED SERVICE PERIOD IS SUBSEQUENTLY MODIFIED, THE PERIOD OVER WHICH THE UPFRONT FEE IS RECOGNIZED IS MODIFIED ACCORDINGLY ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS. REVENUE FROM THE ACHIEVEMENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES, WHICH REPRESENT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A SIGNIFICANT STEP IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN AND IF THE SPECIFIC MILESTONES ARE ACHIEVED. CONTINUATION OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ACHIEVING SPECIFIC CONTRACTUAL MILESTONES; HOWEVER, NONE OF THE PAYMENTS RECEIVED TO DATE ARE REFUNDABLE REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF THE PROJECT. RESEARCH FUNDING IS RECORDED IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE EXPENSES COVERED BY THE FUNDING OCCURRED. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IN JULY 2001, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 141, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, AND SFAS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. SFAS NO. 141 REQUIRES THAT ALL BUSINESS COMBINATIONS BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER A SINGLE METHOD--THE PURCHASE METHOD. USE OF THE POOLING-OF-INTERESTS METHOD NO LONGER IS PERMITTED. SFAS NO. 141 REQUIRES THAT THE PURCHASE METHOD BE USED FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INITIATED AFTER JUNE 30, 2001. SFAS NO. 142 REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL NO LONGER BE AMORTIZED TO EARNINGS, BUT INSTEAD BE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT. THE AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL CEASES UPON ADOPTION OF THE STATEMENT, WHICH FOR CALENDAR YEAR-END COMPANIES, WILL BE JANUARY 1, 2002. SFAS NO. 142 HAS NO FINANCIAL IMPACT ON US AS WE DO NOT HAVE ANY GOODWILL OR INTANGIBLE ASSETS WHICH RESULTED FROM BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK MARKET RISK OUR HOLDINGS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE COMPRISED OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, U.S. GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE SECURITIES. THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE OR HELD TO MATURITY AND CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST DEPENDING UPON OUR INTENT. SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE HELD FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED TO BE USED TO MEET OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES (WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY) ON AVAILABLE FOR SALE SECURITIES, IF ANY, ARE REPORTED IN A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY. THE COST OF ALL DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME. WE DO NOT USE FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES FOR INVESTMENT OR TRADING PURPOSES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000, ALL SECURITIES HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH OUR INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. OUR INVESTMENTS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND WILL DECREASE IN VALUE IF MARKET INTEREST RATES INCREASE. DUE TO THE LIMITED NUMBER OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS, OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE CURRENCY RISK IS MINIMAL. 37 THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS AND RELATED WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES BY YEAR OF MATURITY FOR OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001: 2002 2003 2004 2005 ---- ---- ---- ---- (IN THOUSANDS $) FIXED RATE .................... $ 5,250 $ 36,800 $ 5,000 $ 28,510 AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ......... 6.66% 6.63% 6.75% 7.70% VARIABLE RATE ................. -- -- -- -- AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ......... -- -- -- -- ------- -------- ------- -------- TOTAL ....................... $ 5,250 $ 36,800 $ 5,000 $ 28,510 2007 AND 2006 BEYOND TOTAL FAIR VALUE ---- -------- ----- ---------- FIXED RATE .................... $ 64,307 $ 113,000 $ 252,867 $260,900 AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ......... 6.80% 6.90% 6.92% -- VARIABLE RATE ................. -- $ 2,000 $ 2,000 $ 2,000 AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ......... -- 8.00% 8.00% -- -------- --------- --------- -------- TOTAL ....................... $ 64,307 $ 115,000 $ 254,867 $262,900 AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, OUR 9% JANUARY 1999 AND JULY 1999 CONVERTIBLE NOTES WITH OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS OF $1,713,600 AND $10,000,000, RESPECTIVELY, NO LONGER ACCRUE INTEREST. THESE CONVERTIBLE NOTES ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO OUR COMMON STOCK AT A CONVERSION PRICE OF $6.00 AND $6.33 PER SHARE, RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR VALUE OF FIXED INTEREST RATE INSTRUMENTS ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND IN THE CASE OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES BY CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. AN INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK RESULTS IN AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES. WE DO NOT USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.
