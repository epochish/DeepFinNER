ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION WE ARE AN INTEGRATED GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN THE DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF NOVEL THERAPIES FOR THE TREATMENT OF CANCER AND IMMUNOLOGICAL DISEASES. WE CURRENTLY MARKET THALOMID, OUR LEAD PRODUCT, FOR THE TREATMENT OF ERYTHEMA NODOSUM LEPROSUM ("ENL"), WHICH IS MORE WIDELY USED OFF-LABEL FOR TREATMENT IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND OTHER CANCERS. DESPITE DOSAGE DECREASES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, THALOMID SALES HAVE GROWN RAPIDLY AS THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS USING THALOMID HAS INCREASED STEADILY. THE SUCCESS OF THALOMID HAS ENABLED US TO INVEST HEAVILY IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING, WHICH HAS RESULTED IN A BROAD PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS IN THE OUR DISCOVERY PIPELINE. MOREOVER, USING YEARS OF CLINICAL DATA GENERATED THROUGH THE STUDY OF THALIDOMIDE, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A PROMISING PIPELINE OF THALOMID ANALOGS (E.G., IMIDS(TM)). THESE COMPOUNDS HAVE BEEN OPTIMIZED TO HAVE THE BENEFICIAL ATTRIBUTES OF THALIDOMIDE WHILE HAVING MINIMIZED ITS NEGATIVE ATTRIBUTES AND SIDE EFFECTS. REVLIMID(TM), ONE OF OUR CLINICAL STAGE IMIDS, IS NOW BEING TESTED IN ONGOING PIVOTAL PHASE III SPECIAL PROTOCOL ASSESSMENT TRIALS AND PHASE II TRIALS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO RESULT IN FDA APPROVAL IN 2005. GIVEN REVLIMID'S POTENTIALLY SUPERIOR SAFETY AND EFFICACY PROFILE, ITS HIGHER PROFITABILITY PROJECTIONS AND THE LEVERAGE WE CAN ACHIEVE FROM OUR ESTABLISHED ONCOLOGY SALESFORCE, WE EXPECT THE LAUNCH OF REVLIMID TO RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH TO OUR BOTTOM-LINE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE SUCCESS OF THALOMID, THE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES OF REVLIMID AND A BROAD PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS COUPLED WITH OUR SOLID CASH POSITION, PLACES US IN A GOOD POSITION WITHIN THE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY. INDUSTRY-WIDE FACTORS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, REGULATORY APPROVALS OF OUR PRODUCTS, THE TIMING OF THE INTRODUCTION AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS BY US OR COMPETING COMPANIES, THE TIMING OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL COSTS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT RISKS, REFER TO "RISK FACTORS" CONTAINED IN PART I, ITEM I OF THIS DOCUMENT. INDUSTRY-WIDE FACTORS THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, NEAR-TERM COMPETITION FOR THALOMID, DELAYS IN THE INTRODUCTION OF REVLIMID AND, IN THE LONGER-TERM, FAILURE TO COMMERCIALIZE OUR EARLY STAGE DRUG CANDIDATES. NEAR TERM COMPETITION FOR THALOMID: IN JUNE 2003, THE FDA APPROVED MILLENIUM PHARMACEUTICALS, INC'S. VELCADE(R) FOR USE IN REFRACTORY MULTIPLE MYELOMA PATIENTS. WHILE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT VELCADE COULD REDUCE THALOMID SALES IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA, WE BELIEVE THAT THALOMID WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED AS A FIRST LINE TREATMENT AND THAT VELCADE WILL LIKELY BE USED IN PATIENTS THAT HAVE NOT HAD SUCCESS WITH THALOMID. ALSO, GENERIC COMPETITION COULD REDUCE THALOMID SALES. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THIS IS UNLIKELY, AT LEAST IN THE NEAR TERM, GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE FOUR PATENTS THAT EXPIRE BETWEEN THE YEARS 2018 AND 2020 COVERING THE "SYSTEM FOR THALIDOMIDE EDUCATION AND PRESCRIBING SAFETY," OR S.T.E.P.S., DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, WHICH ALL PATIENTS RECEIVING THALIDOMIDE MUST FOLLOW AND SEVERAL ISSUED PATENTS COVERING THALOMID USE IN ONCOLOGY. EVEN IF GENERIC COMPETITION COULD MANAGE TO ENTER THE MARKET, IT IS UNLIKELY THEY COULD DO SO BEFORE 2006 GIVEN THE TIME NEEDED TO COMMERCIALIZE A PRODUCT, AND BY THAT TIME, WE EXPECT TO HAVE AT LEAST PARTIALLY REPLACED THALOMID WITH REVLIMID. DELAY IN THE INTRODUCTION OF REVLIMID: WHILE WE HAVE MADE EXCELLENT PROGRESS IN OUR EFFORTS TO ACCELERATE THE PATH TO REGULATORY APPROVAL OF REVLIMID NOW BEING TESTED IN ONGOING PIVOTAL PHASE III SPECIAL PROTOCOL ASSESSMENT TRIALS AND PHASE II TRIALS, ALL OF WHICH REMAIN ON OR AHEAD OF THEIR PLANNED PATIENT ACCRUAL TIMELINES FOR POTENTIAL APPROVALS IN 2005, A DELAY IN THE INTRODUCTION OF REVLIMID OR ITS 30 FAILURE TO DEMONSTRATE EFFICACY OR AN ACCEPTABLE SAFETY PROFILE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FAILURE TO COMMERCIALIZE EARLY STAGE DRUG CANDIDATES: OUR LONG-TERM SUCCESS AND SUSTAINABILITY IS DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO MOVE OUR EARLIER STAGE DRUG CANDIDATES THROUGH DEVELOPMENT AND TO REALIZE THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF OUR BROAD PIPELINE. COMPANY BACKGROUND CELGENE WAS ORGANIZED IN 1980 AS A UNIT OF CELANESE CORPORATION, A CHEMICAL COMPANY. IN 1986, WE WERE SPUN-OFF AS AN INDEPENDENT CHEMICAL BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY AND IN JULY 1987, WE COMPLETED AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF OUR COMMON STOCK. AT FIRST, OUR OPERATIONS INVOLVED THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF CHEMICAL AND BIOTREATMENT PROCESSES FOR THE CHEMICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES. IN 1994, WE DISCONTINUED THE BIOTREATMENT OPERATIONS TO FOCUS ON OUR TARGETED SMALL MOLECULE CANCER AND IMMUNOLOGY COMPOUND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND OUR BIOCATALYTIC CHIRAL CHEMISTRY PROGRAM. BETWEEN 1990 AND 1998, OUR REVENUES WERE GENERATED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY OF CHIRALLY PURE INTERMEDIATES TO PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES FOR USE IN NEW DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND, TO A LESSER DEGREE, FROM AGROCHEMICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS. SALES OF CHIRALLY PURE INTERMEDIATES BECAME A LESS INTEGRAL PART OF OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS AND, IN JANUARY 1998, WE SOLD CHIRAL INTERMEDIATES BUSINESS TO CAMBREX CORPORATION. REVENUE FROM THALOMID SALES, LICENSE AGREEMENTS AND MILESTONE PAYMENTS RELATED TO OUR CANCER AND IMMUNOLOGY PROGRAMS BEGAN TO INCREASE AT THIS TIME. IN JULY 1998, WE RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE FDA TO MARKET THALOMID (THALIDOMIDE) FOR USE IN ENL, A SIDE EFFECT OF LEPROSY, AND, IN SEPTEMBER 1998, WE COMMENCED SALES OF THALOMID IN THE UNITED STATES. SALES OF THALOMID, OUR LEAD PRODUCT, HAVE GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY EACH YEAR SINCE THE LAUNCH AND, IN 2001, 2002 AND 2003 WE RECORDED NET THALOMID SALES OF $82.0 MILLION, $119.1 MILLION AND $223.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. IN FEBRUARY 2000, WE COMPLETED A FOLLOW-ON PUBLIC OFFERING IN WHICH WE RAISED PROCEEDS, NET OF OFFERING EXPENSES, OF APPROXIMATELY $278.0 MILLION. IN APRIL 2000, WE SIGNED A LICENSE AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT WITH NOVARTIS PHARMA AG IN WHICH WE GRANTED TO NOVARTIS A LICENSE FOR D-MPH, OUR CHIRALLY PURE VERSION OF RITALIN. THE AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR SIGNIFICANT UPFRONT AND MILESTONE PAYMENTS BASED ON ACHIEVING VARIOUS REGULATORY APPROVALS AND ROYALTIES ON THE ENTIRE FAMILY OF RITALIN PRODUCTS UPON APPROVAL OF D-MPH BY THE FDA. WE HAVE RETAINED THE RIGHTS FOR THE USE OF D-MPH IN ONCOLOGY INDICATIONS. WE RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE FDA TO MARKET D-MPH, OR FOCALIN(TM), ON NOVEMBER 14, 2001. IN AUGUST 2000, WE ACQUIRED SIGNAL PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., A PRIVATELY HELD BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY FOCUSED ON THE DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF DRUGS THAT REGULATE GENES ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE AND, IN DECEMBER 2002, WE ACQUIRED ANTHROGENESIS CORP., A PRIVATELY HELD BIOTHERAPEUTICS COMPANY PIONEERING THE RECOVERY OF STEM CELLS FROM HUMAN PLACENTAL TISSUE FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF A FULL-TERM, SUCCESSFUL PREGNANCY. IN MARCH 2003, WE ENTERED INTO A THREE-YEAR SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT WITH GLAXOSMITHKLINE ("GSK") TO DISTRIBUTE, PROMOTE AND SELL ALKERAN (MELPHALAN), A THERAPY APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR THE PALLIATIVE TREATMENT OF MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND FOR PALLIATION OF CARCINOMA OF THE OVARY. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, WE PURCHASE ALKERAN TABLETS AND ALKERAN FOR INJECTION FROM GLAXOSMITHKLINE AND DISTRIBUTES THE PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER THE CELGENE LABEL. THE AGREEMENT, WHICH PROVIDES US WITH AN APPROVED ONCOLOGY PRODUCT, REQUIRES THAT WE PURCHASE CERTAIN MINIMUM QUANTITIES EACH YEAR FOR AN INITIAL THREE-YEAR TERM UNDER A TAKE-OR-PAY ARRANGEMENT AGGREGATING $56.6 MILLION OVER SUCH PERIOD. AT 31 DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE REMAINING MINIMUM PURCHASE REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE AGREEMENT WERE $43.5 MILLION. IN JUNE 2003, WE RAISED AN ADDITIONAL $387.8, NET OF EXPENSES, THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF UNSECURED CONVERTIBLE NOTES TO QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYERS. THE NOTES HAVE A FACE VALUE OF $400.0 MILLION, A TERM OF FIVE-YEARS, A COUPON RATE OF 1.75% PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY AND ARE CONVERTIBLE AT ANY TIME INTO 8,255,920 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A CONVERSION PRICE OF $48.45 PER SHARE, WHICH REPRESENTS A 50% PREMIUM TO OUR CLOSING STOCK PRICE ON MAY 28, 2003. UNTIL 2003, WE HAD SUSTAINED LOSSES IN EACH YEAR SINCE OUR INCORPORATION IN 1986. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, WE POSTED NET INCOME OF $13.5 MILLION. WE HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $308.9 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND HAVE SINCE OUR INCEPTION FINANCED OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS PRIMARILY THROUGH PRODUCT SALES, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SALES OF OUR EQUITY SECURITIES AND DEBT, INCOME EARNED ON THE INVESTMENT OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SUCH SECURITIES AND REVENUES FROM RESEARCH CONTRACTS AND LICENSE PAYMENTS. WE EXPECT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE OUR PRODUCTS. WE EXPECT THAT OUR RATE OF SPENDING WILL ACCELERATE AS A RESULT OF INCREASED CLINICAL TRIAL COSTS AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATORY APPROVAL AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF PRODUCTS NOW IN DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, THESE EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE MORE THAN OFFSET BY INCREASING PRODUCT SALES, ROYALTIES, REVENUES FROM VARIOUS RESEARCH COLLABORATIONS AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, AND INVESTMENT INCOME. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 TOTAL REVENUE: TOTAL REVENUE AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 WERE AS FOLLOWS: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- % CHANGE ------------------- 2002 2001 TO TO (IN THOUSANDS) 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NET PRODUCT SALES: THALOMID $223,686 $119,060 $ 82,003 87.9% 45.2% FOCALIN 2,383 3,861 2,192 (38.3%) 76.1% ALKERAN 17,827 -- -- N/A N/A STEM CELL THERAPIES 557 -- -- N/A N/A ------------------------------------ TOTAL NET PRODUCT SALES $244,453 $122,921 $ 84,195 98.9% 46.0% COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER REVENUE 15,174 8,115 28,149 87.0% (71.2%) ROYALTY REVENUE 11,848 4,710 -- 151.5% N/A RELATED-PARTY COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENT REVENUE -- -- 1,899 N/A N/A ------------------------------------ TOTAL REVENUE $271,475 $135,746 $114,243 100.0% 18.8% ======================================================================================================== THALOMID NET SALES INCREASES IN 2003 AND 2002 WERE DUE TO THE COMBINATION OF PRICE INCREASES AND INCREASING USE BY ONCOLOGISTS IN THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS TYPES OF CANCERS, ESPECIALLY FIRST LINE USE IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA. THALOMID NET SALES IN 2003 ALSO BENEFITED FROM THE MARKET INTRODUCTION OF TWO NEW HIGHER STRENGTH FORMULATIONS DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2003, WHICH HAD HIGHER PER UNIT SALES PRICES. NET SALES OF FOCALIN, WHICH RECEIVED FDA APPROVAL IN NOVEMBER 2001, WERE LOWER IN 2003 DUE TO THE TIMING OF SHIPMENTS TO NOVARTIS FOR THEIR 32 COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION. THE ALKERAN SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT WITH GLAXOSMITHKLINE WAS EXECUTED IN MARCH 2003 AND SALES OF ALKERAN BEGAN DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003. CONSEQUENTLY, SALES FOR THIS PRODUCT ARE REFLECTED ONLY IN THE 2003 PERIOD. COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 INCLUDED PRIMARILY $6.0 MILLION RELATED TO THE AGREEMENT TO TERMINATE THE GELCLAIR CO-PROMOTION AGREEMENT BETWEEN OSI PHARMACEUTICALS INC. AND CELGENE, $4.3 MILLION OF RESEARCH AND LICENSE FUNDING RECEIVED IN CONNECTION WITH THE PHARMION COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS, $1.3 MILLION OF REIMBURSEMENTS FROM NOVARTIS FOR SHIPMENTS OF BULK RAW MATERIAL USED IN THE FORMULATION OF FOCALIN LA AND UTILIZED IN CLINICAL STUDIES CONDUCTED BY NOVARTIS AND $2.9 MILLION OF REVENUE FROM THE STEM CELL THERAPIES SEGMENT, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE WITH THE ACQUISITION OF ANTHROGENESIS ON DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE 2002 PERIOD INCLUDED PRIMARILY $4.9 MILLION OF AMORTIZATION OF AN UP-FRONT PAYMENT AND A $1.0 MILLION MILESTONE PAYMENT RECEIVED FROM NOVARTIS PHARMA AG IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERM LICENSE AGREEMENT, $1.2 MILLION OF LICENSE REVENUE FROM PHARMION AND $0.5 MILLION OF CERTAIN OTHER MILESTONE PAYMENTS. THE 2001 PERIOD INCLUDED PRIMARILY $10.4 MILLION OF AMORTIZATION OF UPFRONT PAYMENTS RELATED TO TWO SEPARATE AGREEMENTS WITH NOVARTIS AND A MILESTONE PAYMENT OF $12.5 MILLION FROM NOVARTIS FOR RECEIVING FDA APPROVAL TO MARKET FOCALIN. ROYALTY REVENUE REFLECTS ROYALTIES RECEIVED FROM NOVARTIS ON SALES OF THEIR ENTIRE FAMILY OF RITALIN DRUGS. THERE WAS NO RELATED PARTY REVENUE IN 2003 AND 2002 AS THE AGREEMENT WITH AXYS PHARMACEUTICALS, WHICH WE TREATED AS A RELATED PARTY IN 2001 AND UNDER WHICH WE RECORDED REVENUE OF $1.9 MILLION IN 2001 EXPIRED IN OCTOBER 2001. COST OF GOODS SOLD: COST OF GOODS SOLD AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 WERE AS FOLLOWS: --------------------------------------------------------------------- (IN THOUSANDS $) 2003 2002 2001 --------------------------------------------------------------------- COST OF GOODS SOLD $ 49,085 $ 17,322 $ 13,571 INCREASE FROM PRIOR YEAR $ 31,763 $ 3,751 N/A PERCENTAGE INCREASE FROM PRIOR YEAR 183.4% 27.6% N/A PERCENTAGE OF NET PRODUCT SALES 20.1% 14.1% 16.1% ===================================================================== COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED IN 2003 COMPARED TO 2002, PRIMARILY DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THALOMID SALES VOLUMES, HIGHER ROYALTIES ON THALOMID PRODUCT SALES AND THE INTRODUCTION OF ALKERAN. THE INCREASE IN COST OF GOODS SOLD AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET PRODUCT SALES IN 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF ALKERAN, WHICH HAS A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COST STRUCTURE THAN THALOMID, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER GROSS PROFITS ON THALOMID DUE TO PRICE INCREASES INITIATED DURING THE YEAR AND BY HIGHER 2002 SALES OF FOCALIN, WHICH ALSO HAS A HIGHER COST STRUCTURE THAN THALOMID. SIMILAR TO 2003, COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED IN 2002 COMPARED TO 2001, DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THALOMID SALES VOLUMES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE 2002 INCREASE WERE HIGHER SALES OF FOCALIN, WHICH AS INDICATED ABOVE, HAS A HIGHER COST STRUCTURE THAN THALOMID AND HIGHER THALOMID PRODUCT ROYALTIES RESULTING FROM HIGHER SALES AND THEREBY TRIGGERING HIGHER ROYALTY PERCENTAGES. FOCALIN PRODUCT COSTS INCURRED PRIOR TO ITS APPROVAL IN NOVEMBER 2001 WERE EXPENSED AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. FOCALIN ACTUAL COSTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE LOWER THAN ITS STANDARD COSTS UNTIL THE PRODUCT ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY EXPENSED COSTS ARE COMPLETELY SOLD. 33 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SALARIES AND BENEFITS, CONTRACTOR FEES, PRINCIPALLY WITH CONTRACT RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS TO ASSIST IN OUR CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, CLINICAL DRUG SUPPLIES FOR OUR CLINICAL AND PRECLINICAL PROGRAMS AS WELL AS OTHER CONSUMABLE RESEARCH SUPPLIES, AND ALLOCATED FACILITIES CHARGES SUCH AS BUILDING RENT AND UTILITIES. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 WERE AS FOLLOWS: ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (IN THOUSANDS $) 2003 2002 2001 ----------------------------------------------------------------------- RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES $ 122,700 $ 84,924 $ 67,653 INCREASE FROM PRIOR YEAR $ 37,776 $ 17,271 N/A PERCENTAGE INCREASE FROM PRIOR YEAR 44.5% 25.5% N/A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE 45.2% 62.6% 59.2% ======================================================================= RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED IN 2003 COMPARED TO 2002, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INITIATION OF SEVERAL LARGE STUDIES RELATED TO OUR THALOMID AND REVLIMID CLINICAL PROGRAMS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2002. IN 2003, APPROXIMATELY $82.0 MILLION WAS SPENT ON THALOMID AND ITS FOLLOW ON COMPOUNDS (I.E., THE IMIDS AND SELCIDS) AND FOCALIN, PRIMARILY FOR PRECLINICAL TOXICOLOGY, PHASE I/II AND PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS AND REGULATORY EXPENSES, APPROXIMATELY $37.1 MILLION WAS SPENT IN GENE REGULATION, TARGET AND DRUG DISCOVERY AND AGRO-CHEMICAL PROGRAMS, AND APPROXIMATELY $3.7 MILLION WAS SPENT ON STEM CELL THERAPY PROGRAMS, PRIMARILY FOR INTERNAL HEADCOUNT RELATED EXPENSES, LABORATORY SUPPLIES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS. IN 2002, APPROXIMATELY $49.1 MILLION WAS SPENT ON THALOMID AND THE IMIDS AND SELCIDS COMPOUNDS, PRIMARILY FOR PRECLINICAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHASE I/II CLINICAL TRIALS, THE INITIATION OF OUR PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND METASTATIC MELANOMA AND LEGAL EXPENSES RELATED TO PATENT FILINGS AND APPROXIMATELY $35.8 MILLION WAS SPENT IN GENE REGULATION, TARGET DISCOVERY AND AGRO-CHEMICAL PROGRAMS, PRIMARILY FOR INTERNAL HEADCOUNT RELATED EXPENSES, LABORATORY SUPPLIES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS. IN 2001, APPROXIMATELY $33.1 MILLION WAS SPENT ON THALOMID AND THE IMIDS AND SELCIDS COMPOUNDS, PRIMARILY FOR PRECLINICAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHASE I/II CLINICAL TRIALS, REGULATORY EXPENSES FOR PREPARATION OF A SUPPLEMENTARY NEW DRUG APPLICATION ("SNDA") FOR THALOMID IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND LEGAL EXPENSES RELATED TO PATENT FILINGS, APPROXIMATELY $2.8 MILLION WAS SPENT FOR FOCALIN, PRIMARILY FOR DRUG SUPPLY THAT WAS EXPENSED PRIOR TO FDA APPROVAL AND APPROXIMATELY $31.8 MILLION WAS SPENT IN GENE REGULATION, TARGET DISCOVERY AND AGRO-CHEMICAL PROGRAMS, PRIMARILY FOR INTERNAL HEADCOUNT RELATED EXPENSES, LABORATORY SUPPLIES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS. AS TOTAL REVENUE INCREASES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE MAY CONTINUE TO DECREASE AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUE, HOWEVER THE ACTUAL DOLLAR AMOUNT WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE AS EARLIER STAGE COMPOUNDS ARE MOVED THROUGH THE PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL STAGES. 34 FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMMERCIAL STATUS, TARGET DISEASES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR DRUG COMPOUNDS, REFER TO THE PRODUCT OVERVIEW TABLE CONTAINED IN PART I, ITEM I OF THIS DOCUMENT. IN GENERAL, THE ESTIMATED TIMES TO COMPLETION WITHIN THE VARIOUS STAGES OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS: ------------------------------------------------------------ CLINICAL PHASE ESTIMATED COMPLETION TIME ------------------------------------------------------------ PHASE I 1-2 YEARS PHASE II 2-3 YEARS PHASE III 2-3 YEARS ------------------------------------------------------------ DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN PRECLINICAL TESTS AND CLINICAL TRIALS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, THE COST TO COMPLETE SUCH PROJECTS IS NOT REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. THE DATA OBTAINED FROM THESE TESTS AND TRIALS MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING INTERPRETATION THAT COULD DELAY, LIMIT OR PREVENT A PROJECT'S ADVANCEMENT THROUGH THE VARIOUS STAGES OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE COSTS INCURRED IN BRINGING A PROJECT TO COMPLETION. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE: SELLING EXPENSES CONSIST OF SALARIES AND BENEFITS FOR SALES AND MARKETING AND CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSONNEL, WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS, AND OTHER COMMERCIAL EXPENSES TO SUPPORT THE SALES FORCE AND THE EDUCATION AND REGISTRATION EFFORTS UNDERLYING THE S.T.E.P.S. PROGRAM. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SALARIES AND BENEFITS, OUTSIDE SERVICES FOR LEGAL, AUDIT, TAX AND INVESTOR ACTIVITIES AND ALLOCATIONS OF FACILITIES COSTS, PRINCIPALLY FOR RENT, UTILITIES AND PROPERTY TAXES. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 WERE AS FOLLOWS: ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (IN THOUSANDS $) 2003 2002 2001 ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES $ 102,339 $ 69,717 $ 57,962 INCREASE FROM PRIOR YEAR $ 32,622 $ 11,755 N/A PERCENTAGE INCREASE FROM PRIOR YEAR 46.8% 20.3% N/A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE 37.7% 51.4% 50.7% ======================================================================= SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED IN 2003 COMPARED TO 2002, PRIMARILY DUE TO $10.1 MILLION OF EXPENSES INCURRED WITHIN THE STEM CELL THERAPIES SEGMENT, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE WITH THE ACQUISITION OF ANTHROGENESIS IN DECEMBER 2002, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $12.0 MILLION IN COMMERCIAL EXPENSES RELATED TO THE EXPANSION OF THE SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATION AND AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER SERVICE STAFF AND AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $10.0 MILLION IN GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE AND MEDICAL AFFAIRS EXPENSES. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED IN 2002 COMPARED TO 2001, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN COMMERCIAL EXPENSES TO SUPPORT THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF THALOMID, WITH AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $4.9 MILLION IN SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR SALES FORCE EXPANSION. AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUE, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED TO APPROXIMATELY 38% IN 2003 FROM APPROXIMATELY 51% IN BOTH THE 2002 AND 2001 PERIODS. 35 LITIGATION SETTLEMENT AND RELATED AGREEMENTS: IN DECEMBER 2002, WE ENTERED INTO A SERIES OF AGREEMENTS WITH ENTREMED, INC. AND CHILDREN'S MEDICAL CENTER CORPORATION ("CMCC") TO EFFECTIVELY TERMINATE ONGOING LITIGATION RELATING TO PATENTS FOR THALIDOMIDE ANALOGS AND TO GRANT AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO CELGENE FOR THE RIGHTS TO THOSE PATENTS. UNDER THE TERMS OF AN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH ENTREMED, WE PAID TO ENTREMED $10.0 MILLION FOR ALL THALIDOMIDE ANALOG PATENTS AND ASSOCIATED CLINICAL DATA AND RECORDS, AND THE TERMINATION OF ANY LITIGATION SURROUNDING THOSE PATENTS. UNDER THE TERMS OF A SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH ENTREMED, WE ACQUIRED FROM ENTREMED 3,350,000 SHARES OF SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, AND WARRANTS FOR AN ADDITIONAL 7,000,000 COMMON SHARES FOR APPROXIMATELY $16.8 MILLION. WE COMPLETED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE ESTIMATED REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. CONSIDERING THE LEVEL OF THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN ENTREMED, ITS HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES AND THE FACT THAT ENTREMED IS A CLINICAL-STAGE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY ENGAGED PRIMARILY IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES WITH PROPOSED PRODUCTS AND RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN THE EARLY STAGE OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, AND BASED ON SUCH ASSESSMENT, THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF SUCH PREFERRED STOCK WAS WRITTEN DOWN. WE ALSO SIGNED AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH CMCC THAT TERMINATED ANY EXISTING THALIDOMIDE ANALOG AGREEMENTS BETWEEN CMCC AND ENTREMED AND DIRECTLY GRANTED US AN EXCLUSIVE WORLDWIDE LICENSE FOR THE ANALOG PATENTS. WE PAID TO CMCC $2.5 MILLION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANOTHER $2.5 MILLION PAYABLE BETWEEN 2004 AND 2006, THE PRESENT VALUE OF WHICH TOTALED $2.2 MILLION AND WAS EXPENSED IN 2002. ADDITIONALLY, WE ENTERED INTO A FIVE YEAR SPONSORED RESEARCH AGREEMENT WITH CMCC WHEREBY WE HAVE COMMITTED $0.3 MILLION PER YEAR IN FUNDING. ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS ARE POSSIBLE UNDER THE AGREEMENT DEPENDING ON THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF THALIDOMIDE ANALOGS. WE RECORDED A CHARGE TO EARNINGS FOR THE COST OF THESE AGREEMENTS AND RELATED EXPENSES OF $32.2 MILLION IN 2002 INCLUDING THE WRITE DOWN OF THE ENTREMED SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK AND CERTAIN LEGAL EXPENSES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SETTLEMENT. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE LITIGATION SETTLEMENT AND RELATED AGREEMENTS, REFER TO NOTE 4 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: ON DECEMBER 31, 2002, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF ANTHROGENESIS CORP., WHICH NOW OPERATES AS CELGENE CELLULAR THERAPEUTICS, FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $60.0 MILLION. THE ACQUISITION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, UNDER WHICH APPROXIMATELY $55.7 MILLION WAS ALLOCATED TO IPR&D AND CHARGED TO EXPENSE AT THE ACQUISITION DATE. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE ANTHROGENESIS ACQUISITION, REFER TO NOTES 2 AND 18 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME: INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME DECREASED APPROXIMATELY 5.5% TO $21.8 MILLION IN 2003, FROM $23.1 IN 2002. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INTEREST INCOME AS A RESULT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES IN 2003, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $1.4 MILLION IN REALIZED GAINS ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES. INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 10.4% TO $23.1 MILLION IN 2002, FROM $20.9 MILLION IN 2001. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO HIGHER REALIZED GAINS OF APPROXIMATELY $5.0 MILLION ON SALES OF CERTAIN MARKETABLE SECURITIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST INCOME ON LOWER AVERAGE CASH BALANCES AND LOWER YIELDS ON OUR SECURITIES DURING 2002. INTEREST EXPENSE: INTEREST EXPENSE WAS APPROXIMATELY $5.7 MILLION IN 2003 AND REFLECTS INTEREST ON THE $400 MILLION UNSECURED CONVERTIBLE NOTES ISSUED ON JUNE 3, 2003. INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE 2002 AND 2001 PERIODS WAS IMMATERIAL. INCOME TAX BENEFIT (PROVISION): IN 2003 WE RECOGNIZED TAX EXPENSE OF $1.1 MILLION FOR FEDERAL AND STATE PURPOSES AND IN 2002, WE RECOGNIZED $0.4 MILLION FOR STATE TAX PURPOSES. DURING 2003, 2002 AND 2001, WE ALSO RECOGNIZED A TAX BENEFIT OF $0.4 MILLION, $0.7 MILLION AND $1.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FROM THE SALE OF CERTAIN STATE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS. 36 INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS: INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND PER COMMON SHARE AMOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 WERE AS FOLLOWS: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) 2003 2002 2001 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS $ 12,761 $ (101,000) $ (2,904) PER COMMON SHARE AMOUNTS: BASIC $ 0.16 $ (1.31) $ (0.04) DILUTED $ 0.15 $ (1.31) $ (0.04) WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UTILIZED TO CALCULATE PER COMMON SHARE AMOUNTS BASIC 80,887,000 77,337,000 75,108,000 DILUTED 85,398,000 77,337,000 75,108,000 =========================================================================================== IN 2003, WE RECORDED INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE OUR INCEPTION IN 1986. INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCREASED IN 2003 DUE TO AN INCREASE IN TOTAL REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $135.8 MILLION, LEAD BY AN INCREASE IN THALOMID NET SALES OF $104.6 MILLION AND FIRST-TIME ALKERAN SALES OF $17.8 MILLION AND ONE-TIME COSTS INCURRED IN 2002 OF $55.7 MILLION FROM THE WRITE-OFF OF ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO THE ANTHROGENESIS ACQUISITION AND $32.2 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION SETTLEMENT AND RELATED AGREEMENTS WITH ENTREMED, INC. AND CMCC. OFFSETTING THESE INCREASES WERE HIGHER OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $102.2 MILLION, A DECREASE IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $6.9 MILLION AND, FROM A PER SHARE PERSPECTIVE, THE HIGHER NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UTILIZED TO CALCULATE THE PER COMMON SHARE AMOUNTS IN 2003. THE LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2002 COMPARED TO 2001 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE AGGREGATE ONE-TIME COSTS OF $87.9 MILLION DESCRIBED ABOVE, AN INCREASE OF $32.8 MILLION IN OTHER OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES AND A DECREASE OF $1.1 MILLION IN THE INCOME TAX BENEFIT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN TOTAL REVENUE OF $21.5 MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN NET INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE OF $2.2 MILLION. GAIN ON SALE OF CHIRAL ASSETS: IN JANUARY 1998, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF OUR CHIRAL INTERMEDIATE BUSINESS TO CAMBREX CORPORATION. PURSUANT TO THE MINIMUM ROYALTY PROVISIONS OF THE AGREEMENT, WE RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY $0.8 MILLION, $1.0 MILLION AND $1.0 MILLION IN 2003, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE DISPOSITION OF THE CHIRAL INTERMEDIATES BUSINESS, REFER TO NOTES 2 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES SINCE OUR INCEPTION, WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN FINANCED PRIMARILY THROUGH PRODUCT SALES, PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SALES OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES, INCOME EARNED ON THE INVESTMENT OF SUCH SECURITIES AND REVENUE FROM RESEARCH CONTRACTS AND LICENSE AND MILESTONE PAYMENTS. SINCE OUR INITIAL PRODUCT LAUNCH IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 1998, WE HAVE RECORDED NET PRODUCT SALES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $541.2 MILLION THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2003. ON JUNE 3, 2003, WE ISSUED CONVERTIBLE NOTES TO INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS IN THE AMOUNT OF $400.0 MILLION. PROCEEDS FROM THE TRANSACTION, NET OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS, WERE APPROXIMATELY $387.8 MILLION. NET WORKING CAPITAL, (I.E., CURRENT ASSETS MINUS CURRENT LIABILITIES) AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 161% TO $658.3 MILLION FROM $251.8 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER TOTAL CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES, AS WELL AS 37 INCREASES IN BOTH INVENTORY, WITH THE ADDITION OF ALKERAN, AND TRADE RECEIVABLES, DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THALOMID SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ACCRUED EXPENSES. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS INCREASED TO $267.5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 FROM $85.5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE INCREASED TO $399.5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, FROM $175.7 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE INCREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NET PROCEEDS OF $387.8 MILLION RECEIVED IN CONNECTION WITH THE $400 MILLION CONVERTIBLE NOTE OFFERING ON JUNE 3, 2003. WE EXPECT THE RATE OF SPENDING TO INCREASE AS A RESULT OF RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SPENDING, INCREASED CLINICAL TRIAL COSTS, INCREASED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF PRODUCTS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT, INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF THALOMID AND INCREASED CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, COMBINED WITH INCREASING THALOMID PRODUCT SALES, THE INTRODUCTION OF ALKERAN AND VARIOUS RESEARCH AGREEMENTS AND COLLABORATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL FOR OUR OPERATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

ALKERAN PURCHASE COMMITMENTS: ON MARCH 31, 2003, WE ENTERED INTO A SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT WITH GSK TO DISTRIBUTE, PROMOTE, SELL AND DISTRIBUTE ALKERAN (MELPHALAN), A THERAPY APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR THE PALLIATIVE TREATMENT OF MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND FOR PALLIATION OF CARCINOMA OF THE OVARY. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, WE PURCHASE ALKERAN TABLETS AND ALKERAN FOR INJECTION FROM GLAXOSMITHKLINE AND DISTRIBUTES THE PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER THE CELGENE LABEL THE AGREEMENT, WHICH PROVIDES US WITH AN APPROVED ONCOLOGY PRODUCT, REQUIRES THAT WE PURCHASE CERTAIN MINIMUM QUANTITIES EACH YEAR FOR AN INITIAL THREE-YEAR TERM UNDER A TAKE-OR-PAY ARRANGEMENT AGGREGATING $56.6 MILLION OVER SUCH PERIOD. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE REMAINING MINIMUM PURCHASE REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE AGREEMENT WERE $43.5 MILLION. EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS: WE HAVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES. EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR BASE COMPENSATION AND AN ANNUAL TARGET BONUS BASED UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF COMPANY PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND ANNUAL INCREASES IN BASE COMPENSATION REFLECTING ANNUAL REVIEWS AND RELATED SALARY ADJUSTMENT. THE OUTSTANDING COMMITMENT FOR BASE COMPENSATION RELATED TO EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003 IS APPROXIMATELY $2.6 MILLION PER YEAR IN EACH OF THE NEXT THREE CONSECUTIVE YEARS (EXCLUDING ANY CHANGE IN CONTROL PROVISIONS). OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS: WE SIGNED AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH CMCC, WHICH TERMINATED ANY EXISTING THALIDOMIDE ANALOG AGREEMENTS BETWEEN CMCC AND ENTREMED AND DIRECTLY GRANTED TO CELGENE AN EXCLUSIVE WORLDWIDE LICENSE FOR THE ANALOG PATENTS. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY CMCC $2.5 MILLION BETWEEN 2004 AND 2006, THE PRESENT VALUE OF WHICH TOTALED $2.2 MILLION AND WAS 39 EXPENSED IN 2002. ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS ARE POSSIBLE UNDER THE AGREEMENT DEPENDING ON THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF THALIDOMIDE ANALOGS. WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH PENN PHARMACEUTICAL, LTD. OF GREAT BRITAIN FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THALOMID. PENN MANUFACTURES THALOMID AND SELLS IT EXCLUSIVELY TO US. THE AGREEMENT HAS BEEN EXTENDED THROUGH 2004 FOR DEDICATED CONTAINMENT FACILITIES ("DCF") PAYMENTS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $0.7 MILLION. IN NOVEMBER 2001, CONCURRENT WITH THE PHARMION LICENSE AGREEMENT (SEE NOTE 15 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS), WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH PENN PHARMACEUTICALS, LTD. AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS IN WHICH PENN GRANTED US AN OPTION TO PURCHASE THEIR THALIDOMIDE DCF AND RELATED THALIDOMIDE ASSETS. WE HAVE THREE YEARS IN WHICH TO EXERCISE THE OPTION. THE PURCHASE PRICE WILL BE DETERMINED IN THE FUTURE BASED ON A FORMULA DEFINED IN THE AGREEMENT. IN OCTOBER 2003, WE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT WITH INSTITUTE OF DRUG TECHNOLOGY AUSTRALIA LIMITED ("IDT") FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF FINISHED DOSAGE FORM OF THALOMID CAPSULES. THE AGREEMENT REQUIRES MINIMUM PAYMENTS FOR THALOMID CAPSULES OF $4.7 MILLION FOR THE THREE-YEAR TERM COMMENCING WITH THE FDA'S APPROVAL OF IDT AS AN ALTERNATE SUPPLIER. THIS AGREEMENT PROVIDES US WITH ADDITIONAL CAPACITY AND REDUCES OUR DEPENDENCY ON ONE MANUFACTURER FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THALOMID. 2004 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK IN ITS JANUARY 29, 2004 EARNINGS RELEASE, WE SET FORTH MANAGEMENT'S EARNINGS ESTIMATE FOR FULL YEAR 2004. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE JANUARY 29, 2004 EARNINGS PROJECTION CONTINUES TO REFLECT THE CURRENT THINKING OF MANAGEMENT, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SALES OR EARNINGS WILL DEVELOP IN THE MANNER PROJECTED OR IF THE ANALYSIS, ON WHICH THE EARNINGS PROJECTION WERE BASED, WERE TO BE REDONE ON THE DATE HEREOF THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE GUIDANCE. REVENUES: WE ANTICIPATE REVENUES FOR 2004 TO BE IN THE RANGE OF $360 TO $380 MILLION, A PROJECTED INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 33% TO 40% OVER TOTAL 2003 REVENUES OF $271.5 MILLION. THALOMID NET SALES ARE TARGETED TO BE IN THE RANGE OF $280 TO $290 MILLION, REPRESENTING A PROJECTED INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 25% TO 30% OVER THALOMID NET SALES OF $223.5 MILLION IN 2003. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE MAINTAINING OUR TARGET REVENUES FOR THE RITALIN FAMILY OF DRUGS OF APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION IN 2004, WHICH INCLUDES A MILESTONE PAYMENT FOR FILING AN NDA FOR FOCALIN LA. R&D SPENDING: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES IN 2004 ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN THE RANGE OF $160 TO $170 MILLION, A PROJECTED INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 34% COMPARED TO 2003, AS WE CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE SPENDING TO SUPPORT MULTIPLE PIVOTAL PHASE III AND OTHER ACCELERATED REGULATORY PROGRAMS. IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF OUR 2004 R&D SPENDING INCLUDE (1) EXPANDED INVESTMENT IN OUR HEMATOLOGICAL AND MALIGNANT BLOOD DISORDER DISEASE PROGRAMS, (2) INVESTMENT IN THE INVESTIGATION OF OUR AGENTS IN COMBINATION USE IN SOLID TUMOR CLINICAL TRIALS, AND (3) ADVANCEMENT OF MULTIPLE HIGH POTENTIAL PRE-CLINICAL 40 AND CLINICAL COMPOUNDS, INCLUDING; SELCIDS(TM), KINASE INHIBITORS, LIGASE INHIBITORS, TUBULIN INHIBITORS AND BENZOPYRANS. SG&A EXPENSES: SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2004 ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN THE RANGE OF $115 TO $125 MILLION, A PROJECTED INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 17% COMPARED TO 2003. EARNINGS PER SHARE: DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN THE RANGE OF $0.40 TO $0.50 PER SHARE IN 2004, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 180 % OVER OUR 2003 RESULTS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IS ONE WHICH IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENT'S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL: REVENUE RECOGNITION ON COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS: WE HAVE FORMED COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS AND ALLIANCES WITH SEVERAL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE IN THE FORM OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS. THE AGREEMENTS ARE FOR BOTH EARLY AND LATE STAGE COMPOUNDS AND ARE FOCUSED ON SPECIFIC DISEASE AREAS. FOR THE EARLY STAGE COMPOUNDS, THE AGREEMENTS ARE RELATIVELY SHORT-TERM AGREEMENTS THAT ARE RENEWABLE DEPENDING ON THE SUCCESS OF THE COMPOUNDS AS THEY MOVE THROUGH PRECLINICAL DEVELOPMENT. THE AGREEMENTS CALL FOR NONREFUNDABLE UPFRONT PAYMENTS, MILESTONE PAYMENTS ON ACHIEVING SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE EVENTS, AND IN SOME CASES ONGOING RESEARCH FUNDING. THE AGREEMENTS ALSO CONTEMPLATE ROYALTY PAYMENTS ON SALES IF AND WHEN THE COMPOUND RECEIVES FDA MARKETING APPROVAL. IN ACCORDANCE WITH STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 104 ("SAB 104") "REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS," UPFRONT PAYMENTS ARE RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE ESTIMATED SERVICE PERIOD. IF THE ESTIMATED SERVICE PERIOD IS SUBSEQUENTLY MODIFIED, THE PERIOD OVER WHICH THE UPFRONT FEE IS RECOGNIZED IS MODIFIED ACCORDINGLY ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS. CONTINUATION OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ACHIEVING SPECIFIC CONTRACTUAL MILESTONES; HOWEVER, NONE OF THE PAYMENTS RECEIVED TO DATE ARE REFUNDABLE REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF THE PROJECT. RESEARCH FUNDING IS RECORDED IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE EXPENSES COVERED BY THE FUNDING OCCURRED. SAB NO. 104 UPDATES THE GUIDANCE IN SAB NO. 101 AND REQUIRES COMPANIES TO IDENTIFY SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING BASED ON THE CONSENSUS REACHED ON EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ("EITF") ISSUE NO. 00-21, "REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES" ("EITF 00-21"). EITF 00-21 PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON HOW TO DETERMINE WHEN AN ARRANGEMENT THAT INVOLVES MULTIPLE REVENUE-GENERATING ACTIVITIES OR DELIVERABLES SHOULD BE DIVIDED INTO SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION PURPOSES, AND IF THIS DIVISION IS REQUIRED, HOW THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE ALLOCATED AMONG THE SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING. EITF 00-21 IS EFFECTIVE FOR REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO IN QUARTERS BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 15, 2003. IF THE DELIVERABLES IN A REVENUE ARRANGEMENT CONSTITUTE SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING ACCORDING TO THE EITF'S SEPARATION CRITERIA, THE REVENUE-RECOGNITION POLICY MUST BE DETERMINED FOR EACH IDENTIFIED UNIT. IF THE ARRANGEMENT IS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING UNDER THE SEPARATION CRITERIA, THE REVENUE-RECOGNITION POLICY MUST BE DETERMINED FOR THE ENTIRE ARRANGEMENT. THE ADOPTION OF EITF 00-21 DID NOT IMPACT THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, BUT COULD AFFECT THE TIMING OR PATTERN OF REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR FUTURE COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AND/OR LICENSE AGREEMENTS. PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF EITF 00-21, REVENUES FROM THE ACHIEVEMENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES, WHICH 41 REPRESENT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A SIGNIFICANT STEP IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, WERE RECOGNIZED WHEN AND IF THE MILESTONES WERE ACHIEVED. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS, MEDICAID REBATES AND CHARGEBACKS: WE RECORD AN ALLOWANCE FOR SALES RETURNS BASED ON THE ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY FOR CONSUMED LOTS AND THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED. WE RECORD MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION. WE RECORD CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS BASED ON ACTUAL SALES TO CUSTOMERS WHO ARE COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DEFERRED TAX ASSET VALUATION ALLOWANCE: WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. WE RECOGNIZED A 100% VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BASED ON A CUMULATIVE THREE-YEAR HISTORY OF LOSSES (INCLUDING OPERATING LOSSES IN EACH OF THE LAST THREE YEARS). ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: WE RECORDED A LIABILITY FOR THE 2003 - 2005 PLAN BASED ON ACHIEVING AN ESTIMATED AWARD OF 75% OF THE TARGET. THE PLAN PROVIDES PAYOUT IN THE RANGE OF 0% TO 200%. ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ("IPR&D"): THE VALUE ASSIGNED TO ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS DETERMINED BY IDENTIFYING THOSE ACQUIRED SPECIFIC IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE CONTINUED AND FOR WHICH (A) TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AT THE ACQUISITION DATE, (B) THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE, AND (C) THE FAIR VALUE IS ESTIMABLE WITH REASONABLE RELIABILITY. AMOUNTS ASSIGNED TO IPR&D ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AT THE ACQUISITION DATE. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THESE PROJECTS IS DETERMINED BY EMPLOYMENT OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL. THE DISCOUNT RATES USED TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE STAGE OF COMPLETION AND THE RISKS SURROUNDING THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF EACH OF THE PURCHASED IN-PROCESS TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS THAT ARE VALUED. THE ANALYSIS INCLUDES FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE PROGRESS MADE ON THE IN-PROCESS PROJECT PRIOR TO THE PURCHASE DATES. APPROPRIATE OPERATING EXPENSES ARE DEDUCTED FROM THE TOTAL FORECASTED NET REVENUES TO ESTABLISH A FORECAST OF NET RETURNS ON THE COMPLETED PORTION OF THE IN-PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. FINALLY, THESE NET RETURNS ARE DISCOUNTED TO A PRESENT VALUE USING DISCOUNT RATES THAT INCORPORATE THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL RELATIVE TO THE BIOTECH INDUSTRY AND THE COMPANY AS WELL AS PRODUCT SPECIFIC RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PRODUCTS. THE PRODUCT SPECIFIC RISK FACTORS INCLUDE THE PRODUCT'S PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT, LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS, MANUFACTURING PROCESS CAPABILITY, SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE, PRECLINICAL SAFETY AND EFFICACY DATA, TARGET PRODUCT PROFILE, AND DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION AN OVERALL DISCOUNT RATE, WHICH REPRESENTS A RISK PREMIUM TO THE COMPANY'S WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL FOR PURCHASE VALUATION PURPOSES. THE FORECAST DATA IN THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON INTERNAL PRODUCT LEVEL FORECAST INFORMATION MAINTAINED BY MANAGEMENT IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF MANAGING THE BUSINESS. THE INPUTS USED BY MANAGEMENT IN ANALYZING IPR&D IS BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS, WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES TO BE REASONABLE BUT WHICH ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND UNPREDICTABLE. THESE ASSUMPTIONS MAY BE INCOMPLETE OR INACCURATE, AND NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT UNANTICIPATED EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES WILL NOT OCCUR. THE VALUATIONS USED TO ESTIMATE IPR&D REQUIRE US TO USE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, THAT IF CHANGED, MAY RESULT IN A DIFFERENT VALUATION FOR IPR&D. VALUATIONS FOR THE ANTHROGENESIS ACQUISITION WERE COMPLETED BY AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY CONSULTING FIRM IN ACCORDANCE WITH SEC GUIDELINES. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES FORWARD-LOOKING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM 42 ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RISK OF LOSS IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES, CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE EARNINGS. THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR ITS INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND WILL DECREASE IN VALUE IF MARKET INTEREST RATES INCREASE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR INVESTMENT OR TRADING PURPOSES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY'S MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS CONSISTED OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, A SENIOR CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTE DUE FROM PHARMION CORPORATION AND UNSECURED CONVERTIBLE NOTES ISSUED BY THE COMPANY. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 THE COMPANY'S MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE CONSISTED OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS, U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY BONDS AND CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, WHICH HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE. SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE HELD FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED TO BE USED TO MEET THE ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF THE COMPANY. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES (WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY) ON AVAILABLE FOR SALE SECURITIES, IF ANY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY. THE COST OF ALL DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME. THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS AND RELATED WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES BY MATURITIES FOR THE MARKETABLE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2003: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FIXED RATE SECURITIES -------------------------------------- 0 TO 1 1 TO 3 3 TO 5 5 TO 7 VARIABLE TOTAL YEAR YEAR YEAR YEAR RATE -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (IN THOUSANDS $) PRINCIPAL AMOUNT $77,662 $176,765 $14,422 $73,275 $37,150 $379,274 FAIR VALUE $65,831 $207,496 $15,064 $74,884 $36,239 $399,514 AVERAGE INTEREST RATE 3.49% 5.62% 3.32% 5.10% 6.71% 5.10% PHARMION NOTE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY HELD A $12.0 MILLION, FIVE YEAR, 6% PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUAL SENIOR CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTE DUE FROM PHARMION CORPORATION. THE NOTE HAS A CONVERSION PRICE OF $11.00 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK ADJUSTED FOR PHARMION'S FOUR-FOR-ONE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT (FOR MORE INFORMATION SEE NOTE 15 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). THE PHARMION NOTE IS CLASSIFIED UNDER "OTHER ASSETS" ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND MEASURED AT COST. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE PHARMION NOTE EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE BY APPROXIMATELY $5.2 MILLION, WHICH REFLECTS THE INCREASE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF PHARMION CORPORATION'S COMMON STOCK PRICE TO $15.25 PER SHARE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003 (EFFECTIVE MARCH 1, 2004, THE NOTE WAS CONVERTED INTO 1,150,511 SHARES OF PHARMION COMMON STOCK). 43 CONVERTIBLE DEBT: AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY HAD $400.0 MILLION OF UNSECURED CONVERTIBLE NOTES OUTSTANDING. THE NOTES HAVE A FIVE-YEAR TERM AND A COUPON RATE OF 1.75% PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY. THE NOTES CAN BE CONVERTED AT ANY TIME INTO 8,255,920 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A CONVERSION PRICE OF $48.45 PER SHARE (FOR MORE INFORMATION SEE NOTE 9 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S CONVERTIBLE NOTES EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE OF $400.0 MILLION BY APPROXIMATELY $78.1 MILLION, WHICH THE COMPANY BELIEVES REFLECTS THE INCREASE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK TO $44.88 PER SHARE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003. ASSUMING OTHER FACTORS ARE HELD CONSTANT, AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES GENERALLY RESULTS IN A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF FIXED-RATE CONVERTIBLE DEBT, BUT DOES NOT IMPACT THE CARRYING VALUE, AND AN INCREASE IN THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE GENERALLY RESULTS IN AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT, BUT DOES NOT IMPACT THE CARRYING VALUE. 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION WE ARE AN INTEGRATED GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN THE DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF NOVEL THERAPIES FOR THE TREATMENT OF CANCER AND IMMUNOLOGICAL DISEASES. WE CURRENTLY MARKET THALOMID, OUR LEAD PRODUCT, FOR THE TREATMENT OF ERYTHEMA NODOSUM LEPROSUM ("ENL"), WHICH IS MORE WIDELY USED OFF-LABEL FOR TREATMENT IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND OTHER CANCERS. DESPITE DOSAGE DECREASES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, THALOMID SALES HAVE GROWN RAPIDLY AS THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS USING THALOMID HAS INCREASED STEADILY. THE SUCCESS OF THALOMID HAS ENABLED US TO INVEST HEAVILY IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING, WHICH HAS RESULTED IN A BROAD PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS IN THE OUR DISCOVERY PIPELINE. MOREOVER, USING YEARS OF CLINICAL DATA GENERATED THROUGH THE STUDY OF THALIDOMIDE, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A PROMISING PIPELINE OF THALOMID ANALOGS (E.G., IMIDS(TM)). THESE COMPOUNDS HAVE BEEN OPTIMIZED TO HAVE THE BENEFICIAL ATTRIBUTES OF THALIDOMIDE WHILE HAVING MINIMIZED ITS NEGATIVE ATTRIBUTES AND SIDE EFFECTS. REVLIMID(TM), ONE OF OUR CLINICAL STAGE IMIDS, IS NOW BEING TESTED IN ONGOING PIVOTAL PHASE III SPECIAL PROTOCOL ASSESSMENT TRIALS AND PHASE II TRIALS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO RESULT IN FDA APPROVAL IN 2005. GIVEN REVLIMID'S POTENTIALLY SUPERIOR SAFETY AND EFFICACY PROFILE, ITS HIGHER PROFITABILITY PROJECTIONS AND THE LEVERAGE WE CAN ACHIEVE FROM OUR ESTABLISHED ONCOLOGY SALESFORCE, WE EXPECT THE LAUNCH OF REVLIMID TO RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH TO OUR BOTTOM-LINE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE SUCCESS OF THALOMID, THE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES OF REVLIMID AND A BROAD PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS COUPLED WITH OUR SOLID CASH POSITION, PLACES US IN A GOOD POSITION WITHIN THE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY. INDUSTRY-WIDE FACTORS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, REGULATORY APPROVALS OF OUR PRODUCTS, THE TIMING OF THE INTRODUCTION AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS BY US OR COMPETING COMPANIES, THE TIMING OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL COSTS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT RISKS, REFER TO "RISK FACTORS" CONTAINED IN PART I, ITEM I OF THIS DOCUMENT. INDUSTRY-WIDE FACTORS THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, NEAR-TERM COMPETITION FOR THALOMID, DELAYS IN THE INTRODUCTION OF REVLIMID AND, IN THE LONGER-TERM, FAILURE TO COMMERCIALIZE OUR EARLY STAGE DRUG CANDIDATES. NEAR TERM COMPETITION FOR THALOMID: IN JUNE 2003, THE FDA APPROVED MILLENIUM PHARMACEUTICALS, INC'S. VELCADE(R) FOR USE IN REFRACTORY MULTIPLE MYELOMA PATIENTS. WHILE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT VELCADE COULD REDUCE THALOMID SALES IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA, WE BELIEVE THAT THALOMID WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED AS A FIRST LINE TREATMENT AND THAT VELCADE WILL LIKELY BE USED IN PATIENTS THAT HAVE NOT HAD SUCCESS WITH THALOMID. ALSO, GENERIC COMPETITION COULD REDUCE THALOMID SALES. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THIS IS UNLIKELY, AT LEAST IN THE NEAR TERM, GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE FOUR PATENTS THAT EXPIRE BETWEEN THE YEARS 2018 AND 2020 COVERING THE "SYSTEM FOR THALIDOMIDE EDUCATION AND PRESCRIBING SAFETY," OR S.T.E.P.S., DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, WHICH ALL PATIENTS RECEIVING THALIDOMIDE MUST FOLLOW AND SEVERAL ISSUED PATENTS COVERING THALOMID USE IN ONCOLOGY. EVEN IF GENERIC COMPETITION COULD MANAGE TO ENTER THE MARKET, IT IS UNLIKELY THEY COULD DO SO BEFORE 2006 GIVEN THE TIME NEEDED TO COMMERCIALIZE A PRODUCT, AND BY THAT TIME, WE EXPECT TO HAVE AT LEAST PARTIALLY REPLACED THALOMID WITH REVLIMID. DELAY IN THE INTRODUCTION OF REVLIMID: WHILE WE HAVE MADE EXCELLENT PROGRESS IN OUR EFFORTS TO ACCELERATE THE PATH TO REGULATORY APPROVAL OF REVLIMID NOW BEING TESTED IN ONGOING PIVOTAL PHASE III SPECIAL PROTOCOL ASSESSMENT TRIALS AND PHASE II TRIALS, ALL OF WHICH REMAIN ON OR AHEAD OF THEIR PLANNED PATIENT ACCRUAL TIMELINES FOR POTENTIAL APPROVALS IN 2005, A DELAY IN THE INTRODUCTION OF REVLIMID OR ITS 30 FAILURE TO DEMONSTRATE EFFICACY OR AN ACCEPTABLE SAFETY PROFILE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FAILURE TO COMMERCIALIZE EARLY STAGE DRUG CANDIDATES: OUR LONG-TERM SUCCESS AND SUSTAINABILITY IS DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO MOVE OUR EARLIER STAGE DRUG CANDIDATES THROUGH DEVELOPMENT AND TO REALIZE THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF OUR BROAD PIPELINE. COMPANY BACKGROUND CELGENE WAS ORGANIZED IN 1980 AS A UNIT OF CELANESE CORPORATION, A CHEMICAL COMPANY. IN 1986, WE WERE SPUN-OFF AS AN INDEPENDENT CHEMICAL BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY AND IN JULY 1987, WE COMPLETED AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF OUR COMMON STOCK. AT FIRST, OUR OPERATIONS INVOLVED THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF CHEMICAL AND BIOTREATMENT PROCESSES FOR THE CHEMICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES. IN 1994, WE DISCONTINUED THE BIOTREATMENT OPERATIONS TO FOCUS ON OUR TARGETED SMALL MOLECULE CANCER AND IMMUNOLOGY COMPOUND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND OUR BIOCATALYTIC CHIRAL CHEMISTRY PROGRAM. BETWEEN 1990 AND 1998, OUR REVENUES WERE GENERATED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY OF CHIRALLY PURE INTERMEDIATES TO PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES FOR USE IN NEW DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND, TO A LESSER DEGREE, FROM AGROCHEMICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS. SALES OF CHIRALLY PURE INTERMEDIATES BECAME A LESS INTEGRAL PART OF OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS AND, IN JANUARY 1998, WE SOLD CHIRAL INTERMEDIATES BUSINESS TO CAMBREX CORPORATION. REVENUE FROM THALOMID SALES, LICENSE AGREEMENTS AND MILESTONE PAYMENTS RELATED TO OUR CANCER AND IMMUNOLOGY PROGRAMS BEGAN TO INCREASE AT THIS TIME. IN JULY 1998, WE RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE FDA TO MARKET THALOMID (THALIDOMIDE) FOR USE IN ENL, A SIDE EFFECT OF LEPROSY, AND, IN SEPTEMBER 1998, WE COMMENCED SALES OF THALOMID IN THE UNITED STATES. SALES OF THALOMID, OUR LEAD PRODUCT, HAVE GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY EACH YEAR SINCE THE LAUNCH AND, IN 2001, 2002 AND 2003 WE RECORDED NET THALOMID SALES OF $82.0 MILLION, $119.1 MILLION AND $223.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. IN FEBRUARY 2000, WE COMPLETED A FOLLOW-ON PUBLIC OFFERING IN WHICH WE RAISED PROCEEDS, NET OF OFFERING EXPENSES, OF APPROXIMATELY $278.0 MILLION. IN APRIL 2000, WE SIGNED A LICENSE AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT WITH NOVARTIS PHARMA AG IN WHICH WE GRANTED TO NOVARTIS A LICENSE FOR D-MPH, OUR CHIRALLY PURE VERSION OF RITALIN. THE AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR SIGNIFICANT UPFRONT AND MILESTONE PAYMENTS BASED ON ACHIEVING VARIOUS REGULATORY APPROVALS AND ROYALTIES ON THE ENTIRE FAMILY OF RITALIN PRODUCTS UPON APPROVAL OF D-MPH BY THE FDA. WE HAVE RETAINED THE RIGHTS FOR THE USE OF D-MPH IN ONCOLOGY INDICATIONS. WE RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE FDA TO MARKET D-MPH, OR FOCALIN(TM), ON NOVEMBER 14, 2001. IN AUGUST 2000, WE ACQUIRED SIGNAL PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., A PRIVATELY HELD BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY FOCUSED ON THE DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF DRUGS THAT REGULATE GENES ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE AND, IN DECEMBER 2002, WE ACQUIRED ANTHROGENESIS CORP., A PRIVATELY HELD BIOTHERAPEUTICS COMPANY PIONEERING THE RECOVERY OF STEM CELLS FROM HUMAN PLACENTAL TISSUE FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF A FULL-TERM, SUCCESSFUL PREGNANCY. IN MARCH 2003, WE ENTERED INTO A THREE-YEAR SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT WITH GLAXOSMITHKLINE ("GSK") TO DISTRIBUTE, PROMOTE AND SELL ALKERAN (MELPHALAN), A THERAPY APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR THE PALLIATIVE TREATMENT OF MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND FOR PALLIATION OF CARCINOMA OF THE OVARY. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, WE PURCHASE ALKERAN TABLETS AND ALKERAN FOR INJECTION FROM GLAXOSMITHKLINE AND DISTRIBUTES THE PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER THE CELGENE LABEL. THE AGREEMENT, WHICH PROVIDES US WITH AN APPROVED ONCOLOGY PRODUCT, REQUIRES THAT WE PURCHASE CERTAIN MINIMUM QUANTITIES EACH YEAR FOR AN INITIAL THREE-YEAR TERM UNDER A TAKE-OR-PAY ARRANGEMENT AGGREGATING $56.6 MILLION OVER SUCH PERIOD. AT 31 DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE REMAINING MINIMUM PURCHASE REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE AGREEMENT WERE $43.5 MILLION. IN JUNE 2003, WE RAISED AN ADDITIONAL $387.8, NET OF EXPENSES, THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF UNSECURED CONVERTIBLE NOTES TO QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYERS. THE NOTES HAVE A FACE VALUE OF $400.0 MILLION, A TERM OF FIVE-YEARS, A COUPON RATE OF 1.75% PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY AND ARE CONVERTIBLE AT ANY TIME INTO 8,255,920 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A CONVERSION PRICE OF $48.45 PER SHARE, WHICH REPRESENTS A 50% PREMIUM TO OUR CLOSING STOCK PRICE ON MAY 28, 2003. UNTIL 2003, WE HAD SUSTAINED LOSSES IN EACH YEAR SINCE OUR INCORPORATION IN 1986. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, WE POSTED NET INCOME OF $13.5 MILLION. WE HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $308.9 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND HAVE SINCE OUR INCEPTION FINANCED OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS PRIMARILY THROUGH PRODUCT SALES, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SALES OF OUR EQUITY SECURITIES AND DEBT, INCOME EARNED ON THE INVESTMENT OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SUCH SECURITIES AND REVENUES FROM RESEARCH CONTRACTS AND LICENSE PAYMENTS. WE EXPECT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE OUR PRODUCTS. WE EXPECT THAT OUR RATE OF SPENDING WILL ACCELERATE AS A RESULT OF INCREASED CLINICAL TRIAL COSTS AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATORY APPROVAL AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF PRODUCTS NOW IN DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, THESE EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE MORE THAN OFFSET BY INCREASING PRODUCT SALES, ROYALTIES, REVENUES FROM VARIOUS RESEARCH COLLABORATIONS AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, AND INVESTMENT INCOME. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 TOTAL REVENUE: TOTAL REVENUE AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 WERE AS FOLLOWS: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- % CHANGE ------------------- 2002 2001 TO TO (IN THOUSANDS) 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NET PRODUCT SALES: THALOMID $223,686 $119,060 $ 82,003 87.9% 45.2% FOCALIN 2,383 3,861 2,192 (38.3%) 76.1% ALKERAN 17,827 -- -- N/A N/A STEM CELL THERAPIES 557 -- -- N/A N/A ------------------------------------ TOTAL NET PRODUCT SALES $244,453 $122,921 $ 84,195 98.9% 46.0% COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER REVENUE 15,174 8,115 28,149 87.0% (71.2%) ROYALTY REVENUE 11,848 4,710 -- 151.5% N/A RELATED-PARTY COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENT REVENUE -- -- 1,899 N/A N/A ------------------------------------ TOTAL REVENUE $271,475 $135,746 $114,243 100.0% 18.8% ======================================================================================================== THALOMID NET SALES INCREASES IN 2003 AND 2002 WERE DUE TO THE COMBINATION OF PRICE INCREASES AND INCREASING USE BY ONCOLOGISTS IN THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS TYPES OF CANCERS, ESPECIALLY FIRST LINE USE IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA. THALOMID NET SALES IN 2003 ALSO BENEFITED FROM THE MARKET INTRODUCTION OF TWO NEW HIGHER STRENGTH FORMULATIONS DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2003, WHICH HAD HIGHER PER UNIT SALES PRICES. NET SALES OF FOCALIN, WHICH RECEIVED FDA APPROVAL IN NOVEMBER 2001, WERE LOWER IN 2003 DUE TO THE TIMING OF SHIPMENTS TO NOVARTIS FOR THEIR 32 COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION. THE ALKERAN SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT WITH GLAXOSMITHKLINE WAS EXECUTED IN MARCH 2003 AND SALES OF ALKERAN BEGAN DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003. CONSEQUENTLY, SALES FOR THIS PRODUCT ARE REFLECTED ONLY IN THE 2003 PERIOD. COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 INCLUDED PRIMARILY $6.0 MILLION RELATED TO THE AGREEMENT TO TERMINATE THE GELCLAIR CO-PROMOTION AGREEMENT BETWEEN OSI PHARMACEUTICALS INC. AND CELGENE, $4.3 MILLION OF RESEARCH AND LICENSE FUNDING RECEIVED IN CONNECTION WITH THE PHARMION COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS, $1.3 MILLION OF REIMBURSEMENTS FROM NOVARTIS FOR SHIPMENTS OF BULK RAW MATERIAL USED IN THE FORMULATION OF FOCALIN LA AND UTILIZED IN CLINICAL STUDIES CONDUCTED BY NOVARTIS AND $2.9 MILLION OF REVENUE FROM THE STEM CELL THERAPIES SEGMENT, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE WITH THE ACQUISITION OF ANTHROGENESIS ON DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE 2002 PERIOD INCLUDED PRIMARILY $4.9 MILLION OF AMORTIZATION OF AN UP-FRONT PAYMENT AND A $1.0 MILLION MILESTONE PAYMENT RECEIVED FROM NOVARTIS PHARMA AG IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERM LICENSE AGREEMENT, $1.2 MILLION OF LICENSE REVENUE FROM PHARMION AND $0.5 MILLION OF CERTAIN OTHER MILESTONE PAYMENTS. THE 2001 PERIOD INCLUDED PRIMARILY $10.4 MILLION OF AMORTIZATION OF UPFRONT PAYMENTS RELATED TO TWO SEPARATE AGREEMENTS WITH NOVARTIS AND A MILESTONE PAYMENT OF $12.5 MILLION FROM NOVARTIS FOR RECEIVING FDA APPROVAL TO MARKET FOCALIN. ROYALTY REVENUE REFLECTS ROYALTIES RECEIVED FROM NOVARTIS ON SALES OF THEIR ENTIRE FAMILY OF RITALIN DRUGS. THERE WAS NO RELATED PARTY REVENUE IN 2003 AND 2002 AS THE AGREEMENT WITH AXYS PHARMACEUTICALS, WHICH WE TREATED AS A RELATED PARTY IN 2001 AND UNDER WHICH WE RECORDED REVENUE OF $1.9 MILLION IN 2001 EXPIRED IN OCTOBER 2001. COST OF GOODS SOLD: COST OF GOODS SOLD AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 WERE AS FOLLOWS: --------------------------------------------------------------------- (IN THOUSANDS $) 2003 2002 2001 --------------------------------------------------------------------- COST OF GOODS SOLD $ 49,085 $ 17,322 $ 13,571 INCREASE FROM PRIOR YEAR $ 31,763 $ 3,751 N/A PERCENTAGE INCREASE FROM PRIOR YEAR 183.4% 27.6% N/A PERCENTAGE OF NET PRODUCT SALES 20.1% 14.1% 16.1% ===================================================================== COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED IN 2003 COMPARED TO 2002, PRIMARILY DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THALOMID SALES VOLUMES, HIGHER ROYALTIES ON THALOMID PRODUCT SALES AND THE INTRODUCTION OF ALKERAN. THE INCREASE IN COST OF GOODS SOLD AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET PRODUCT SALES IN 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF ALKERAN, WHICH HAS A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COST STRUCTURE THAN THALOMID, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER GROSS PROFITS ON THALOMID DUE TO PRICE INCREASES INITIATED DURING THE YEAR AND BY HIGHER 2002 SALES OF FOCALIN, WHICH ALSO HAS A HIGHER COST STRUCTURE THAN THALOMID. SIMILAR TO 2003, COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED IN 2002 COMPARED TO 2001, DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THALOMID SALES VOLUMES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE 2002 INCREASE WERE HIGHER SALES OF FOCALIN, WHICH AS INDICATED ABOVE, HAS A HIGHER COST STRUCTURE THAN THALOMID AND HIGHER THALOMID PRODUCT ROYALTIES RESULTING FROM HIGHER SALES AND THEREBY TRIGGERING HIGHER ROYALTY PERCENTAGES. FOCALIN PRODUCT COSTS INCURRED PRIOR TO ITS APPROVAL IN NOVEMBER 2001 WERE EXPENSED AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. FOCALIN ACTUAL COSTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE LOWER THAN ITS STANDARD COSTS UNTIL THE PRODUCT ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY EXPENSED COSTS ARE COMPLETELY SOLD. 33 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SALARIES AND BENEFITS, CONTRACTOR FEES, PRINCIPALLY WITH CONTRACT RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS TO ASSIST IN OUR CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, CLINICAL DRUG SUPPLIES FOR OUR CLINICAL AND PRECLINICAL PROGRAMS AS WELL AS OTHER CONSUMABLE RESEARCH SUPPLIES, AND ALLOCATED FACILITIES CHARGES SUCH AS BUILDING RENT AND UTILITIES.

AS TOTAL REVENUE INCREASES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE MAY CONTINUE TO DECREASE AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUE, HOWEVER THE ACTUAL DOLLAR AMOUNT WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE AS EARLIER STAGE COMPOUNDS ARE MOVED THROUGH THE PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL STAGES. 34 FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMMERCIAL STATUS, TARGET DISEASES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR DRUG COMPOUNDS, REFER TO THE PRODUCT OVERVIEW TABLE CONTAINED IN PART I, ITEM I OF THIS DOCUMENT. IN GENERAL, THE ESTIMATED TIMES TO COMPLETION WITHIN THE VARIOUS STAGES OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS: ------------------------------------------------------------ CLINICAL PHASE ESTIMATED COMPLETION TIME ------------------------------------------------------------ PHASE I 1-2 YEARS PHASE II 2-3 YEARS PHASE III 2-3 YEARS ------------------------------------------------------------ DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN PRECLINICAL TESTS AND CLINICAL TRIALS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, THE COST TO COMPLETE SUCH PROJECTS IS NOT REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. THE DATA OBTAINED FROM THESE TESTS AND TRIALS MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING INTERPRETATION THAT COULD DELAY, LIMIT OR PREVENT A PROJECT'S ADVANCEMENT THROUGH THE VARIOUS STAGES OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE COSTS INCURRED IN BRINGING A PROJECT TO COMPLETION. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE: SELLING EXPENSES CONSIST OF SALARIES AND BENEFITS FOR SALES AND MARKETING AND CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSONNEL, WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS, AND OTHER COMMERCIAL EXPENSES TO SUPPORT THE SALES FORCE AND THE EDUCATION AND REGISTRATION EFFORTS UNDERLYING THE S.T.E.P.S.

AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUE, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED TO APPROXIMATELY 38% IN 2003 FROM APPROXIMATELY 51% IN BOTH THE 2002 AND 2001 PERIODS. 35 LITIGATION SETTLEMENT AND RELATED AGREEMENTS: IN DECEMBER 2002, WE ENTERED INTO A SERIES OF AGREEMENTS WITH ENTREMED, INC. AND CHILDREN'S MEDICAL CENTER CORPORATION ("CMCC") TO EFFECTIVELY TERMINATE ONGOING LITIGATION RELATING TO PATENTS FOR THALIDOMIDE ANALOGS AND TO GRANT AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO CELGENE FOR THE RIGHTS TO THOSE PATENTS. UNDER THE TERMS OF AN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH ENTREMED, WE PAID TO ENTREMED $10.0 MILLION FOR ALL THALIDOMIDE ANALOG PATENTS AND ASSOCIATED CLINICAL DATA AND RECORDS, AND THE TERMINATION OF ANY LITIGATION SURROUNDING THOSE PATENTS. UNDER THE TERMS OF A SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH ENTREMED, WE ACQUIRED FROM ENTREMED 3,350,000 SHARES OF SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, AND WARRANTS FOR AN ADDITIONAL 7,000,000 COMMON SHARES FOR APPROXIMATELY $16.8 MILLION. WE COMPLETED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE ESTIMATED REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. CONSIDERING THE LEVEL OF THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN ENTREMED, ITS HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES AND THE FACT THAT ENTREMED IS A CLINICAL-STAGE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY ENGAGED PRIMARILY IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES WITH PROPOSED PRODUCTS AND RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN THE EARLY STAGE OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, AND BASED ON SUCH ASSESSMENT, THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF SUCH PREFERRED STOCK WAS WRITTEN DOWN. WE ALSO SIGNED AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH CMCC THAT TERMINATED ANY EXISTING THALIDOMIDE ANALOG AGREEMENTS BETWEEN CMCC AND ENTREMED AND DIRECTLY GRANTED US AN EXCLUSIVE WORLDWIDE LICENSE FOR THE ANALOG PATENTS. WE PAID TO CMCC $2.5 MILLION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANOTHER $2.5 MILLION PAYABLE BETWEEN 2004 AND 2006, THE PRESENT VALUE OF WHICH TOTALED $2.2 MILLION AND WAS EXPENSED IN 2002. ADDITIONALLY, WE ENTERED INTO A FIVE YEAR SPONSORED RESEARCH AGREEMENT WITH CMCC WHEREBY WE HAVE COMMITTED $0.3 MILLION PER YEAR IN FUNDING.

FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE ANTHROGENESIS ACQUISITION, REFER TO NOTES 2 AND 18 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME: INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME DECREASED APPROXIMATELY 5.5% TO $21.8 MILLION IN 2003, FROM $23.1 IN 2002. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INTEREST INCOME AS A RESULT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES IN 2003, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $1.4 MILLION IN REALIZED GAINS ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES. INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 10.4% TO $23.1 MILLION IN 2002, FROM $20.9 MILLION IN 2001. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO HIGHER REALIZED GAINS OF APPROXIMATELY $5.0 MILLION ON SALES OF CERTAIN MARKETABLE SECURITIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST INCOME ON LOWER AVERAGE CASH BALANCES AND LOWER YIELDS ON OUR SECURITIES DURING 2002. INTEREST EXPENSE: INTEREST EXPENSE WAS APPROXIMATELY $5.7 MILLION IN 2003 AND REFLECTS INTEREST ON THE $400 MILLION UNSECURED CONVERTIBLE NOTES ISSUED ON JUNE 3, 2003.

SINCE OUR INITIAL PRODUCT LAUNCH IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 1998, WE HAVE RECORDED NET PRODUCT SALES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $541.2 MILLION THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2003. ON JUNE 3, 2003, WE ISSUED CONVERTIBLE NOTES TO INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS IN THE AMOUNT OF $400.0 MILLION. PROCEEDS FROM THE TRANSACTION, NET OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS, WERE APPROXIMATELY $387.8 MILLION. NET WORKING CAPITAL, (I.E., CURRENT ASSETS MINUS CURRENT LIABILITIES) AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 161% TO $658.3 MILLION FROM $251.8 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER TOTAL CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES, AS WELL AS 37 INCREASES IN BOTH INVENTORY, WITH THE ADDITION OF ALKERAN, AND TRADE RECEIVABLES, DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THALOMID SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ACCRUED EXPENSES. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS INCREASED TO $267.5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 FROM $85.5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE INCREASED TO $399.5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, FROM $175.7 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE INCREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NET PROCEEDS OF $387.8 MILLION RECEIVED IN CONNECTION WITH THE $400 MILLION CONVERTIBLE NOTE OFFERING ON JUNE 3, 2003. WE EXPECT THE RATE OF SPENDING TO INCREASE AS A RESULT OF RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SPENDING, INCREASED CLINICAL TRIAL COSTS, INCREASED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF PRODUCTS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT, INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF THALOMID AND INCREASED CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, COMBINED WITH INCREASING THALOMID PRODUCT SALES, THE INTRODUCTION OF ALKERAN AND VARIOUS RESEARCH AGREEMENTS AND COLLABORATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL FOR OUR OPERATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS IN WHICH PENN GRANTED US AN OPTION TO PURCHASE THEIR THALIDOMIDE DCF AND RELATED THALIDOMIDE ASSETS. WE HAVE THREE YEARS IN WHICH TO EXERCISE THE OPTION. THE PURCHASE PRICE WILL BE DETERMINED IN THE FUTURE BASED ON A FORMULA DEFINED IN THE AGREEMENT. IN OCTOBER 2003, WE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT WITH INSTITUTE OF DRUG TECHNOLOGY AUSTRALIA LIMITED ("IDT") FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF FINISHED DOSAGE FORM OF THALOMID CAPSULES. THE AGREEMENT REQUIRES MINIMUM PAYMENTS FOR THALOMID CAPSULES OF $4.7 MILLION FOR THE THREE-YEAR TERM COMMENCING WITH THE FDA'S APPROVAL OF IDT AS AN ALTERNATE SUPPLIER. THIS AGREEMENT PROVIDES US WITH ADDITIONAL CAPACITY AND REDUCES OUR DEPENDENCY ON ONE MANUFACTURER FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THALOMID. 2004 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK IN ITS JANUARY 29, 2004 EARNINGS RELEASE, WE SET FORTH MANAGEMENT'S EARNINGS ESTIMATE FOR FULL YEAR 2004. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE JANUARY 29, 2004 EARNINGS PROJECTION CONTINUES TO REFLECT THE CURRENT THINKING OF MANAGEMENT, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SALES OR EARNINGS WILL DEVELOP IN THE MANNER PROJECTED OR IF THE ANALYSIS, ON WHICH THE EARNINGS PROJECTION WERE BASED, WERE TO BE REDONE ON THE DATE HEREOF THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE GUIDANCE. REVENUES: WE ANTICIPATE REVENUES FOR 2004 TO BE IN THE RANGE OF $360 TO $380 MILLION, A PROJECTED INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 33% TO 40% OVER TOTAL 2003 REVENUES OF $271.5 MILLION. THALOMID NET SALES ARE TARGETED TO BE IN THE RANGE OF $280 TO $290 MILLION, REPRESENTING A PROJECTED INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 25% TO 30% OVER THALOMID NET SALES OF $223.5 MILLION IN 2003. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE MAINTAINING OUR TARGET REVENUES FOR THE RITALIN FAMILY OF DRUGS OF APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION IN 2004, WHICH INCLUDES A MILESTONE PAYMENT FOR FILING AN NDA FOR FOCALIN LA. R&D SPENDING: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES IN 2004 ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN THE RANGE OF $160 TO $170 MILLION, A PROJECTED INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 34% COMPARED TO 2003, AS WE CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE SPENDING TO SUPPORT MULTIPLE PIVOTAL PHASE III AND OTHER ACCELERATED REGULATORY PROGRAMS. IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF OUR 2004 R&D SPENDING INCLUDE (1) EXPANDED INVESTMENT IN OUR HEMATOLOGICAL AND MALIGNANT BLOOD DISORDER DISEASE PROGRAMS, (2) INVESTMENT IN THE INVESTIGATION OF OUR AGENTS IN COMBINATION USE IN SOLID TUMOR CLINICAL TRIALS, AND (3) ADVANCEMENT OF MULTIPLE HIGH POTENTIAL PRE-CLINICAL 40 AND CLINICAL COMPOUNDS, INCLUDING; SELCIDS(TM), KINASE INHIBITORS, LIGASE INHIBITORS, TUBULIN INHIBITORS AND BENZOPYRANS. SG&A EXPENSES: SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2004 ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN THE RANGE OF $115 TO $125 MILLION, A PROJECTED INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 17% COMPARED TO 2003. EARNINGS PER SHARE: DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN THE RANGE OF $0.40 TO $0.50 PER SHARE IN 2004, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 180 % OVER OUR 2003 RESULTS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IS ONE WHICH IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENT'S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL: REVENUE RECOGNITION ON COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS: WE HAVE FORMED COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS AND ALLIANCES WITH SEVERAL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE IN THE FORM OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS. THE AGREEMENTS ARE FOR BOTH EARLY AND LATE STAGE COMPOUNDS AND ARE FOCUSED ON SPECIFIC DISEASE AREAS. FOR THE EARLY STAGE COMPOUNDS, THE AGREEMENTS ARE RELATIVELY SHORT-TERM AGREEMENTS THAT ARE RENEWABLE DEPENDING ON THE SUCCESS OF THE COMPOUNDS AS THEY MOVE THROUGH PRECLINICAL DEVELOPMENT. THE AGREEMENTS CALL FOR NONREFUNDABLE UPFRONT PAYMENTS, MILESTONE PAYMENTS ON ACHIEVING SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE EVENTS, AND IN SOME CASES ONGOING RESEARCH FUNDING. THE AGREEMENTS ALSO CONTEMPLATE ROYALTY PAYMENTS ON SALES IF AND WHEN THE COMPOUND RECEIVES FDA MARKETING APPROVAL. IN ACCORDANCE WITH STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 104 ("SAB 104") "REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS," UPFRONT PAYMENTS ARE RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE ESTIMATED SERVICE PERIOD. IF THE ESTIMATED SERVICE PERIOD IS SUBSEQUENTLY MODIFIED, THE PERIOD OVER WHICH THE UPFRONT FEE IS RECOGNIZED IS MODIFIED ACCORDINGLY ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS. CONTINUATION OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ACHIEVING SPECIFIC CONTRACTUAL MILESTONES; HOWEVER, NONE OF THE PAYMENTS RECEIVED TO DATE ARE REFUNDABLE REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF THE PROJECT. RESEARCH FUNDING IS RECORDED IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE EXPENSES COVERED BY THE FUNDING OCCURRED. SAB NO. 104 UPDATES THE GUIDANCE IN SAB NO. 101 AND REQUIRES COMPANIES TO IDENTIFY SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING BASED ON THE CONSENSUS REACHED ON EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ("EITF") ISSUE NO. 00-21, "REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES" ("EITF 00-21"). EITF 00-21 PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON HOW TO DETERMINE WHEN AN ARRANGEMENT THAT INVOLVES MULTIPLE REVENUE-GENERATING ACTIVITIES OR DELIVERABLES SHOULD BE DIVIDED INTO SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION PURPOSES, AND IF THIS DIVISION IS REQUIRED, HOW THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE ALLOCATED AMONG THE SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING. EITF 00-21 IS EFFECTIVE FOR REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO IN QUARTERS BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 15, 2003. IF THE DELIVERABLES IN A REVENUE ARRANGEMENT CONSTITUTE SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING ACCORDING TO THE EITF'S SEPARATION CRITERIA, THE REVENUE-RECOGNITION POLICY MUST BE DETERMINED FOR EACH IDENTIFIED UNIT. IF THE ARRANGEMENT IS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING UNDER THE SEPARATION CRITERIA, THE REVENUE-RECOGNITION POLICY MUST BE DETERMINED FOR THE ENTIRE ARRANGEMENT. THE ADOPTION OF EITF 00-21 DID NOT IMPACT THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, BUT COULD AFFECT THE TIMING OR PATTERN OF REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR FUTURE COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AND/OR LICENSE AGREEMENTS. PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF EITF 00-21, REVENUES FROM THE ACHIEVEMENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES, WHICH 41 REPRESENT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A SIGNIFICANT STEP IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, WERE RECOGNIZED WHEN AND IF THE MILESTONES WERE ACHIEVED. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS, MEDICAID REBATES AND CHARGEBACKS: WE RECORD AN ALLOWANCE FOR SALES RETURNS BASED ON THE ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY FOR CONSUMED LOTS AND THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED. WE RECORD MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION. WE RECORD CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS BASED ON ACTUAL SALES TO CUSTOMERS WHO ARE COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DEFERRED TAX ASSET VALUATION ALLOWANCE: WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. WE RECOGNIZED A 100% VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BASED ON A CUMULATIVE THREE-YEAR HISTORY OF LOSSES (INCLUDING OPERATING LOSSES IN EACH OF THE LAST THREE YEARS). ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: WE RECORDED A LIABILITY FOR THE 2003 - 2005 PLAN BASED ON ACHIEVING AN ESTIMATED AWARD OF 75% OF THE TARGET. THE PLAN PROVIDES PAYOUT IN THE RANGE OF 0% TO 200%. ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ("IPR&D"): THE VALUE ASSIGNED TO ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS DETERMINED BY IDENTIFYING THOSE ACQUIRED SPECIFIC IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE CONTINUED AND FOR WHICH (A) TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AT THE ACQUISITION DATE, (B) THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE, AND (C) THE FAIR VALUE IS ESTIMABLE WITH REASONABLE RELIABILITY. AMOUNTS ASSIGNED TO IPR&D ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AT THE ACQUISITION DATE. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THESE PROJECTS IS DETERMINED BY EMPLOYMENT OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL. THE DISCOUNT RATES USED TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE STAGE OF COMPLETION AND THE RISKS SURROUNDING THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF EACH OF THE PURCHASED IN-PROCESS TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS THAT ARE VALUED. THE ANALYSIS INCLUDES FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE PROGRESS MADE ON THE IN-PROCESS PROJECT PRIOR TO THE PURCHASE DATES. APPROPRIATE OPERATING EXPENSES ARE DEDUCTED FROM THE TOTAL FORECASTED NET REVENUES TO ESTABLISH A FORECAST OF NET RETURNS ON THE COMPLETED PORTION OF THE IN-PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. FINALLY, THESE NET RETURNS ARE DISCOUNTED TO A PRESENT VALUE USING DISCOUNT RATES THAT INCORPORATE THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL RELATIVE TO THE BIOTECH INDUSTRY AND THE COMPANY AS WELL AS PRODUCT SPECIFIC RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PRODUCTS. THE PRODUCT SPECIFIC RISK FACTORS INCLUDE THE PRODUCT'S PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT, LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS, MANUFACTURING PROCESS CAPABILITY, SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE, PRECLINICAL SAFETY AND EFFICACY DATA, TARGET PRODUCT PROFILE, AND DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION AN OVERALL DISCOUNT RATE, WHICH REPRESENTS A RISK PREMIUM TO THE COMPANY'S WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL FOR PURCHASE VALUATION PURPOSES. THE FORECAST DATA IN THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON INTERNAL PRODUCT LEVEL FORECAST INFORMATION MAINTAINED BY MANAGEMENT IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF MANAGING THE BUSINESS. THE INPUTS USED BY MANAGEMENT IN ANALYZING IPR&D IS BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS, WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES TO BE REASONABLE BUT WHICH ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND UNPREDICTABLE. THESE ASSUMPTIONS MAY BE INCOMPLETE OR INACCURATE, AND NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT UNANTICIPATED EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES WILL NOT OCCUR. THE VALUATIONS USED TO ESTIMATE IPR&D REQUIRE US TO USE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, THAT IF CHANGED, MAY RESULT IN A DIFFERENT VALUATION FOR IPR&D. VALUATIONS FOR THE ANTHROGENESIS ACQUISITION WERE COMPLETED BY AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY CONSULTING FIRM IN ACCORDANCE WITH SEC GUIDELINES. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES FORWARD-LOOKING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM 42 ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RISK OF LOSS IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES, CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE EARNINGS. THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR ITS INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND WILL DECREASE IN VALUE IF MARKET INTEREST RATES INCREASE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR INVESTMENT OR TRADING PURPOSES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY'S MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS CONSISTED OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, A SENIOR CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTE DUE FROM PHARMION CORPORATION AND UNSECURED CONVERTIBLE NOTES ISSUED BY THE COMPANY. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 THE COMPANY'S MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE CONSISTED OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS, U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY BONDS AND CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, WHICH HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE. SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE HELD FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED TO BE USED TO MEET THE ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF THE COMPANY. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES (WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY) ON AVAILABLE FOR SALE SECURITIES, IF ANY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY. THE COST OF ALL DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME. THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS AND RELATED WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES BY MATURITIES FOR THE MARKETABLE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2003: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FIXED RATE SECURITIES -------------------------------------- 0 TO 1 1 TO 3 3 TO 5 5 TO 7 VARIABLE TOTAL YEAR YEAR YEAR YEAR RATE -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (IN THOUSANDS $) PRINCIPAL AMOUNT $77,662 $176,765 $14,422 $73,275 $37,150 $379,274 FAIR VALUE $65,831 $207,496 $15,064 $74,884 $36,239 $399,514 AVERAGE INTEREST RATE 3.49% 5.62% 3.32% 5.10% 6.71% 5.10% PHARMION NOTE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY HELD A $12.0 MILLION, FIVE YEAR, 6% PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUAL SENIOR CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTE DUE FROM PHARMION CORPORATION. THE NOTE HAS A CONVERSION PRICE OF $11.00 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK ADJUSTED FOR PHARMION'S FOUR-FOR-ONE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT (FOR MORE INFORMATION SEE NOTE 15 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). THE PHARMION NOTE IS CLASSIFIED UNDER "OTHER ASSETS" ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND MEASURED AT COST. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE PHARMION NOTE EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE BY APPROXIMATELY $5.2 MILLION, WHICH REFLECTS THE INCREASE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF PHARMION CORPORATION'S COMMON STOCK PRICE TO $15.25 PER SHARE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003 (EFFECTIVE MARCH 1, 2004, THE NOTE WAS CONVERTED INTO 1,150,511 SHARES OF PHARMION COMMON STOCK). 43 CONVERTIBLE DEBT: AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY HAD $400.0 MILLION OF UNSECURED CONVERTIBLE NOTES OUTSTANDING. THE NOTES HAVE A FIVE-YEAR TERM AND A COUPON RATE OF 1.75% PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY. THE NOTES CAN BE CONVERTED AT ANY TIME INTO 8,255,920 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A CONVERSION PRICE OF $48.45 PER SHARE (FOR MORE INFORMATION SEE NOTE 9 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S CONVERTIBLE NOTES EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE OF $400.0 MILLION BY APPROXIMATELY $78.1 MILLION, WHICH THE COMPANY BELIEVES REFLECTS THE INCREASE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK TO $44.88 PER SHARE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003. ASSUMING OTHER FACTORS ARE HELD CONSTANT, AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES GENERALLY RESULTS IN A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF FIXED-RATE CONVERTIBLE DEBT, BUT DOES NOT IMPACT THE CARRYING VALUE, AND AN INCREASE IN THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE GENERALLY RESULTS IN AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT, BUT DOES NOT IMPACT THE CARRYING VALUE. 44
