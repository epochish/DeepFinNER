GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES, SALES DISCOUNTS, GOVERNMENT REBATES, CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES.REVLIMID®, POMALYST® AND THALOMID® ARE DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES UNDER THE REVLIMID® RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY (REMS), POMALYST REMSTM AND THALOMID REMSTM PROGRAMS, RESPECTIVELY. THESE ARE PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®, POMALYST® AND THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID®, THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENETM AND IMNOVID® ARE DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL AUTHORITIES’ SPECIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE FOR THE PRODUCT’S SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. VIDAZA®, ABRAXANE®, ISTODAX® AND OTEZLA® ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® AND THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENETM.WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE 37TABLE OF CONTENTSMADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. AS NOTED ABOVE, REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® AND THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENETM ARE DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY SUBJECT TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY. SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF THE REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE ALSO ANALYZE ACTUAL BILLINGS RECEIVED FROM THE STATES TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE ACCRUAL RATES. SUBSEQUENT TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010 (COLLECTIVELY, THE 2010 U.S. HEALTH CARE REFORM LAW), CERTAIN STATES HAVE NOT COMPLETED THEIR MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION BILLING FOR THE YEARS OF 2010 THROUGH 2015. OUR ACCRUALS FOR THESE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION REBATES HAD BEEN AT ELEVATED LEVELS GIVEN THE DELAYS IN THE RECEIPT OF COMPLETE INVOICES FROM CERTAIN STATES. DUE TO THE RECEIPT OF MORE COMPLETE CLAIMS DATA DURING 2013, 2014 AND 2015, THE ACCRUALS FOR CERTAIN STATES WERE REDUCED FROM THESE ELEVATED LEVELS AS A RESULT OF BOTH PAYMENTS BEING APPLIED TO THE ACCRUAL DURING 2013, 2014 AND 2015 AND CHANGES IN ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE OBLIGATION DURING THE FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2013, 2014 AND 2015. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ADJUST THE REBATE ACCRUALS AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND TO REFLECT ACTUAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE. MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT’S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL INVOICES. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES.REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE RECORD A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY. CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE INCLUDED IN CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS AND ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA.

THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSSES RECORDED IN THE 2014 PERIOD COMPARED TO GAINS RECORDED IN THE 2013 PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE 2014 PERIOD INCLUDED AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN SPREADS BETWEEN FORWARD AND SPOT RATES RELATED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS COMPARED TO A FAVORABLE CHANGE IN SPREADS BETWEEN FORWARD AND SPOT RATES IN THE 2013 PERIOD.INCOME TAX PROVISION: THE INCOME TAX PROVISION INCREASED BY $94.0 MILLION TO $421.5 MILLION IN 2015 COMPARED TO 2014 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN INCOME BEFORE TAXES. THE FULL YEAR 2015 UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 20.0% REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS FOOTPRINT.

WE EXPECT CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR EXPENDITURES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TRIALS, COMMERCIALIZATION OF NEW PRODUCTS, INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND EXISTING SOURCES OF AND ACCESS TO FINANCING ARE ADEQUATE TO FUND OUR OPERATING NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AND OUR PLANS TO REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK OR PURSUE OTHER STRATEGIC BUSINESS INITIATIVES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE HELD INTERNATIONALLY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, WE HELD APPROXIMATELY $4.488 BILLION OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE IN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS. THE AMOUNT OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE HELD IN U.S. TAX JURISDICTIONS CAN FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS INCLUDING INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS FOR OTHER REASONS, SUCH AS REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, INTERNAL REORGANIZATIONS, BUSINESS-DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND DEBT ISSUANCES. AS PART OF OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY ASSESSMENTS, WE REGULARLY MONITOR THE MIX OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CASH FLOWS (BOTH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS).

THE REMAINING FOREIGN EARNINGS ARE UNREMITTED AND EXPECTED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE DO NOT RELY ON THESE EARNINGS AS A SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR OUR DOMESTIC BUSINESS AS WE EXPECT TO HAVE SUFFICIENT CURRENT CASH RESOURCES COMBINED WITH FUTURE CASH FLOWS IN THE UNITED STATES TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC NEEDS.SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM: OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED AN AGGREGATE $17.500 BILLION COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF WHICH WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $3.890 BILLION REMAINING FOR FUTURE SHARE REPURCHASES. DURING 2015, WE USED $3.257 BILLION FOR REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, MEASURED ON A SETTLEMENT DATE BASIS.COMPONENTS OF WORKING CAPITALCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: WE INVEST OUR EXCESS CASH PRIMARILY IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS, U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND SUPRANATIONAL SECURITIES, GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES AND ASSET BACKED SECURITIES.

SALES MADE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES TYPICALLY HAVE PAYMENT TERMS THAT ARE GREATER THAN 60 DAYS, THEREBY EXTENDING COLLECTION PERIODS BEYOND THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE EXPECT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE TO CONTINUE TO GROW AS OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES CONTINUE TO EXPAND.46TABLE OF CONTENTSWE CONTINUE TO MONITOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES, THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS IN CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND ASSOCIATED IMPACTS ON THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OUR BUSINESS. OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL IN THESE MARKETS IS TYPICALLY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO PRINCIPALLY GOVERNMENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED HOSPITALS, WHICH IN TURN DIRECTLY DELIVER CRITICAL CARE TO PATIENTS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE USED TO TREAT LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES AND WE BELIEVE THIS BUSINESS MODEL ENABLES TIMELY DELIVERY AND ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS. MANY OF THE OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE RELATED TO GOVERNMENT-FUNDED HOSPITALS AND WE BELIEVE THE RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE ULTIMATELY COLLECTIBLE. SIMILARLY, WE BELIEVE THAT FUTURE SALES TO THESE CUSTOMERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE COLLECTIBLE. THE CREDIT AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WITHIN SPAIN, ITALY, PORTUGAL AND GREECE, AS WELL AS INCREASING SALES LEVELS IN THOSE COUNTRIES HAVE IN THE PAST RESULTED IN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN, AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES TO COLLECT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. OUR TOTAL NET RECEIVABLES IN SPAIN, ITALY AND PORTUGAL ARE COMPOSED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR CONTROLLED HOSPITALS AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND AMOUNTED TO $187.8 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 COMPARED TO $241.8 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014. APPROXIMATELY $31.3 MILLION OF THE $187.8 MILLION RECEIVABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 WAS GREATER THAN ONE YEAR PAST DUE. OUR EXPOSURE TO THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS IN GREECE IS LIMITED, AS WE DO NOT HAVE A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF RECEIVABLES IN GREECE. WE MAINTAIN TIMELY AND DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH HOSPITAL CUSTOMERS IN SPAIN, ITALY AND PORTUGAL REGARDING BOTH THE CURRENT AND PAST DUE RECEIVABLE BALANCES. WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS FROM THESE COUNTRIES AND CLOSELY MONITOR THE PLANS FOR PAYMENT AT THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL. PAYMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS IN THESE COUNTRIES ARE NOT RECEIVED ON REGULAR INTERVALS AND SEVERAL MONTHS COULD ELAPSE BETWEEN SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS. WE ALSO REGULARLY REQUEST AND RECEIVE POSITIVE CONFIRMATION OF THE VALIDITY OF OUR RECEIVABLES FROM MOST OF THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES. IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR SPAIN, ITALY AND PORTUGAL, WE CONSIDERED THE BALANCE OF PAST DUE RECEIVABLES RELATED TO SALES MADE TO GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR SUPPORTED CUSTOMERS. WE REGULARLY MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS IN EUROPE TO ASSESS WHETHER THE LEVEL OF RISK OF DEFAULT FOR ANY CUSTOMERS HAS INCREASED AND NOTE THE ONGOING EFFORTS BY THE EUROPEAN UNION, EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION AND INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND TO SUPPORT COUNTRIES WITH LARGE PUBLIC DEFICITS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT BALANCES. WE ALSO MONITOR THE EFFORTS OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES TO SUPPORT THEIR REGIONS WITH LARGE PUBLIC DEFICITS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT BALANCES. WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR WRITE-OFFS WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLECTION OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN THESE COUNTRIES AS A RESULT OF THEIR ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES AND WE DO NOT EXPECT TO HAVE WRITE-OFFS OR ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.INVENTORY: INVENTORY BALANCES INCREASED BY $50.3 MILLION TO $443.4 MILLION AT THE END OF 2015 COMPARED TO 2014. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED DEMAND AND AN INITIATIVE TO INCREASE ABRAXANE® SAFETY STOCK GLOBALLY.OTHER CURRENT ASSETS: OTHER CURRENT ASSETS INCREASED BY $378.6 MILLION TO $984.7 MILLION AT THE END OF 2015 COMPARED TO 2014 PRIMARILY DUE TO A $137.3 MILLION INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, A $182.1 MILLION INCREASE IN PREPAID TAXES AND AN $80.9 MILLION NET INCREASE IN OTHER PREPAID ACCOUNTS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RECEPTOS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY.COMMERCIAL PAPER: WE HAVE A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM (PROGRAM) UNDER WHICH WE ISSUE UNSECURED COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES (COMMERCIAL PAPER) ON A PRIVATE PLACEMENT BASIS, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH ARE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.

THE MATURITIES OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MAY VARY, BUT MAY NOT EXCEED 270 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ISSUE. THE COMMERCIAL PAPER IS SOLD UNDER CUSTOMARY TERMS TO A DEALER OR IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET AND IS ISSUED AT A DISCOUNT FROM PAR OR, ALTERNATIVELY, IS SOLD AT PAR AND BEARS VARYING INTEREST RATES ON A FIXED OR FLOATING BASIS. BORROWINGS UNDER THE PROGRAM ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS.SENIOR UNSECURED CREDIT FACILITY: WE MAINTAIN A SENIOR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (CREDIT FACILITY) THAT PROVIDES REVOLVING CREDIT IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $1.750 BILLION, WHICH WAS INCREASED FROM $1.500 BILLION IN APRIL 2015. ALSO IN APRIL 2015, THE TERM OF THE CREDIT FACILITY WAS EXTENDED FROM APRIL 18, 2018 TO APRIL 17, 2020. SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT FACILITY (BUT IN NO EVENT MORE THAN ONE TIME PER ANNUM) UP TO A MAXIMUM AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $2.000 BILLION. AMOUNTS MAY BE BORROWED IN U.S. DOLLARS FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE CREDIT FACILITY CURRENTLY SERVES AS BACKUP LIQUIDITY FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, THERE WAS NO OUTSTANDING BORROWING AGAINST THE CREDIT FACILITY.THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS, INCLUDING CERTAIN CUSTOMARY FINANCIAL COVENANTS. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL FINANCIAL COVENANTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015.

THE INCREASES WERE OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $131.2 MILLION IN DEFERRED TAXES.INCOME TAXES PAYABLE (CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT): INCOME TAXES PAYABLE INCREASED BY $58.4 MILLION TO $344.0 MILLION AT THE END OF 2015 COMPARED TO 2014, PRIMARILY FROM THE CURRENT PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES OF $454.9 MILLION, NET DEFERRED INTERCOMPANY CREDITS OF $152.3 MILLION, AND AN INCREASE IN REFUNDABLE INCOME TAXES OF $115.6 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCOME TAX PAYMENTS OF $361.1 MILLION, AND A TAX BENEFIT OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION OF $302.1 MILLION.SENIOR NOTES: IN AUGUST 2015, WE ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL $8.000 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $1.000 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2.125% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2018 (THE 2018 NOTES), $1.500 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2.875% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2020 (THE 2020 NOTES), $1.000 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.550% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2022 (THE 2022 NOTES), $2.500 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.875% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2025 (THE 2025 NOTES) AND $2.000 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 5.000% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2045 (THE 2045 NOTES AND TOGETHER WITH THE 2018 NOTES, THE 2020 NOTES, THE 2022 NOTES, AND THE 2025 NOTES, REFERRED TO HEREIN AS THE “2015 ISSUED NOTES”). THE 2015 ISSUED NOTES WERE ISSUED AT 99.994%, 99.819%, 99.729%, 99.034%, AND 99.691% OF PAR, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE DISCOUNT IS BEING AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. OFFERING COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $50.0 MILLION HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. INTEREST ON THE 2015 ISSUED NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON FEBRUARY 15 AND AUGUST 15 EACH YEAR BEGINNING FEBRUARY 15, 2016 AND THE PRINCIPAL ON EACH 2015 ISSUED NOTE IS DUE IN FULL AT THEIR RESPECTIVE MATURITY DATES.

IF WE EXPERIENCE A CHANGE OF CONTROL ACCOMPANIED BY A DOWNGRADE OF THE DEBT TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO OFFER TO REPURCHASE THE 2015 ISSUED NOTES AT A PURCHASE PRICE EQUAL TO 101% OF THEIR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST. WE ARE SUBJECT TO COVENANTS WHICH LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PLEDGE PROPERTIES AS SECURITY UNDER BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING OUR PROPERTY.IN 2015, THE 2.45% SENIOR NOTES WITH A PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $500.0 MILLION MATURED AND WERE REPAID. WE ALSO ASSUMED $13.9 MILLION OF DEBT OBLIGATIONS AS PART OF THE ACQUISITION OF QUANTICEL IN 2015 THAT WERE REPAID DURING 2015.CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014 AND 2013 WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS):OPERATING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED BY $322.4 MILLION TO $2.484 BILLION IN 2015 COMPARED TO 2014. THE DECREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DECREASE IN NET INCOME OF $397.9 MILLION IN 2015 COMPARED TO 2014 DRIVEN BY INCREASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION RELATED EXPENSES. NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY $580.4 MILLION TO $2.806 BILLION IN 2014 COMPARED TO 2013 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF AN EXPANSION OF OUR OPERATIONS AND A RELATED INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS.48TABLE OF CONTENTSINVESTING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY $4.821 BILLION IN 2015 COMPARED TO 2014. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $7.695 BILLION OF PAYMENTS FOR THE ACQUISITIONS OF RECEPTOS AND QUANTICEL, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET PROCEEDS OF $1.910 BILLION FROM NET SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DURING 2015 COMPARED WITH $485.5 MILLION OF NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DURING 2014. IN ADDITION, $710.0 MILLION WAS USED FOR THE ACQUISITION OF NOGRA IN 2014.NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY $909.4 MILLION IN 2014 COMPARED TO 2013. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO A CASH USE OF $710.0 MILLION FOR THE NOGRA ACQUISITION. IN ADDITION, NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DURING 2014 WERE $144.2 MILLION HIGHER THAN IN 2013.FINANCING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY $5.002 BILLION IN 2015 COMPARED TO 2014. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE $5.443 BILLION INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE $513.9 MILLION RE-PAYMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT.NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DECREASED BY $136.3 MILLION IN 2014 COMPARED TO 2013. THE DECREASE WAS PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO A $991.0 MILLION INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN 2014 COMPARED TO 2013, PARTLY OFFSET BY A $210.5 MILLION INCREASE IN PAYMENTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF TREASURY SHARES IN 2014 COMPARED TO 2013 AND A NET REPAYMENT OF $445.3 MILLION IN SHORT-TERM BORROWING IN 2014 COMPARED TO A NET INCREASE OF $234.1 MILLION IN SHORT-TERM BORROWING IN 2013.

THE NON-CANCELABLE LEASE TERMS FOR OPERATING LEASES EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES BETWEEN 2016 AND 2025 AND INCLUDE RENEWAL OPTIONS. IN GENERAL, WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE LESSORS FOR REAL ESTATE TAXES, INSURANCE, UTILITIES, MAINTENANCE AND OTHER OPERATING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEASES. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE MAJOR FACILITIES THAT WE OCCUPY UNDER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS REFER TO PART I, ITEM 2. "PROPERTIES" OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.49TABLE OF CONTENTSOTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS: OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS OF $208.1 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 PRIMARILY INCLUDED $183.7 MILLION IN CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPLY CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE COMMITTED TO INVEST AN AGGREGATE $20.4 MILLION IN AN INVESTMENT FUND, WHICH IS CALLABLE AT ANY TIME, AND A REMAINING $4.0 MILLION BALANCE DUE IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF A MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN SWITZERLAND.COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS: WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT INCLUDE THE FUNDING OF CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE MILESTONE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED DEVELOPMENTAL, REGULATORY AND/OR COMMERCIAL TARGETS. OUR OBLIGATION TO FUND THESE EFFORTS IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROGRAMS AND/OR THE LACK OF ANY ADVERSE EVENTS WHICH COULD CAUSE THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE PROGRAMS. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE ATTAINMENT OF SPECIFIED DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND ACCORDINGLY, NO AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED FOR THESE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014 CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. POTENTIAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS (NOT INCLUDING POTENTIAL ROYALTY PAYMENTS) TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $3.849 BILLION, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $3.326 BILLION CONTINGENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF VARIOUS RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES AND APPROXIMATELY $523.1 MILLION IN SALES-BASED MILESTONES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS, SEE NOTE 17 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSFOR A DISCUSSION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS PLEASE SEE NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.50TABLE OF CONTENTSCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IS ONE THAT IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENT'S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL:REVENUE RECOGNITION: REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS OF THE PRODUCT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER AND THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED AND DETERMINABLE. PROVISIONS FOR DISCOUNTS, EARLY PAYMENTS, REBATES, SALES RETURNS AND DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS UNDER TERMS CUSTOMARY IN THE INDUSTRY ARE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SAME PERIOD THE RELATED SALES ARE RECORDED. WE RECORD ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SALE. THE ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR SUCH VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES ARE BASED ON THE SALES TERMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND TREND ANALYSIS.WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM ROYALTIES BASED ON LICENSEES' SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS USING OUR TECHNOLOGIES. ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACT TERMS WHEN ROYALTIES FROM LICENSEES CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED. IF ROYALTIES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR COLLECTABILITY OF A ROYALTY AMOUNT IS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED, ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE CASH IS RECEIVED.GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® AND THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENETM ARE DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY SUBJECT TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY.SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF THE REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE ALSO ANALYZE ACTUAL BILLINGS RECEIVED FROM THE STATES TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE ACCRUAL RATES. SUBSEQUENT TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010 (COLLECTIVELY, THE 2010 U.S. HEALTH CARE REFORM LAW), CERTAIN STATES HAVE NOT COMPLETED THEIR MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION BILLING FOR THE YEARS OF 2010 THROUGH 2015. OUR ACCRUALS FOR THESE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION REBATES HAD BEEN AT ELEVATED LEVELS GIVEN THE DELAYS IN THE RECEIPT OF COMPLETE INVOICES FROM CERTAIN STATES. DUE TO THE RECEIPT OF MORE COMPLETE CLAIMS DATA DURING 2013, 2014 AND 2015, THE ACCRUALS FOR CERTAIN STATES WERE REDUCED FROM THESE ELEVATED LEVELS AS A RESULT OF BOTH PAYMENTS BEING APPLIED TO THE ACCRUAL DURING 2013, 2014 AND 2015 AND CHANGES IN ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE OBLIGATION DURING THE FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2013, 2014 AND 2015. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ADJUST THE REBATE ACCRUALS AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND TO REFLECT ACTUAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE. MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT’S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL INVOICES. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES.REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE RECORD A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. 51TABLE OF CONTENTSASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY. CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE INCLUDED IN CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS AND ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA.ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: WE ESTIMATE AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, HISTORICAL PAYMENT PATTERNS, AGING OF RECEIVABLE BALANCES AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF COUNTRIES THEMSELVES AND PROVINCES OR AREAS WITHIN SUCH COUNTRIES WHERE THEY ARE THE ULTIMATE CUSTOMERS.INCOME TAXES: WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. WE PROVIDE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED.WE ACCOUNT FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS PART OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THESE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATE PRIMARILY TO ISSUES COMMON AMONG MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE APPLY A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES WHICH INCLUDE STUDIES PERFORMED BY INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS, ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY AND SUBJECT EXPERTS, EVALUATION OF PUBLIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. WE PROVIDE ESTIMATES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. IF OUR ESTIMATES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ACTUAL OUTCOMES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED.WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE A PORTION WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR RECENT CUMULATIVE EARNINGS EXPERIENCE BY TAXING JURISDICTION, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, CARRYFORWARD PERIODS AVAILABLE TO US FOR TAX REPORTING PURPOSES, VARIOUS INCOME TAX STRATEGIES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT AND, TO THE EXTENT FUTURE EXPECTATIONS CHANGE, WE WOULD HAVE TO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THAT TIME. AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES.SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION: WE UTILIZE SHARE BASED COMPENSATION IN THE FORM OF STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, OR RSUS, AND PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, OR PSUS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARDS AT GRANT DATE. COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED REFLECTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF AWARDS EXPECTED TO VEST AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AN ESTIMATE OF AWARD FORFEITURES BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE VESTING PERIOD REQUIRED TO OBTAIN FULL VESTING. MANAGEMENT EXPECTATIONS RELATED TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PERFORMANCE GOALS ASSOCIATED WITH PSU GRANTS IS ASSESSED REGULARLY AND THAT ASSESSMENT IS USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER PSU GRANTS ARE EXPECTED TO VEST. IF PERFORMANCE-BASED MILESTONES RELATED TO PSU GRANTS ARE NOT MET OR NOT EXPECTED TO BE MET, ANY COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED TO DATE ASSOCIATED WITH GRANTS THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO VEST WILL BE REVERSED.OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES: A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF ANY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY BELOW ITS COST THAT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN CARRYING AMOUNT TO FAIR VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT IS CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AND A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE SECURITY ESTABLISHED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INCLUDE: SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE ISSUER'S EARNINGS PERFORMANCE, CREDIT RATING, ASSET QUALITY, BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE ISSUER OPERATES, LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW OUR COST, OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE SECURITY, OUR INTENT NOT TO SELL, AN EVALUATION AS TO WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO SELL BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR COST BASIS, AND ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ISSUER'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD DIFFER FROM OUR ASSESSMENT.DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES: ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN CURRENT EARNINGS OR OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), DEPENDING 52TABLE OF CONTENTSON WHETHER A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION AND, IF IT IS, THE TYPE OF HEDGING TRANSACTION. FOR A DERIVATIVE TO QUALIFY AS A HEDGE AT INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE HEDGED PERIOD, WE FORMALLY DOCUMENT THE NATURE AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEM. WE ASSESS, BOTH AT INCEPTION AND ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING TRANSACTIONS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING THE CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS. WE ASSESS HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND RECORD THE GAIN OR LOSS RELATED TO THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IF ANY, TO CURRENT EARNINGS. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER PROBABLE OF OCCURRING, WE DISCONTINUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING AND ANY RELATED UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE NOT DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION, TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE, OUR STOCK PRICE AND INTEREST RATES. THE USE OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE EXPOSURE OF THESE RISKS WITH THE INTENT TO REDUCE OUR RISK OR COST.INVESTMENTS IN OTHER ENTITIES: WE HOLD A PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER EITHER THE EQUITY METHOD OR COST METHOD. INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES OR CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS OVER WHICH WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD, WITH OUR SHARE OF EARNINGS OR LOSSES REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES OF COMPANIES THAT BECOME PUBLICLY TRADED ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES PROSPECTIVELY FROM THE DATE OF SUCH COMPANIES' INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING.OUR COST METHOD AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.ALL INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT. IF AN INVESTMENT'S FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN ITS NET CARRYING VALUE AND THE DECLINE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE. SUCH AN EVALUATION IS JUDGMENTAL AND DEPENDENT ON SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE HAS OCCURRED INCLUDE: MARKET VALUE OR EXIT PRICE OF THE INVESTMENT BASED ON EITHER MARKET-QUOTED PRICES OR FUTURE ROUNDS OF FINANCING BY THE INVESTEE; LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE MARKET VALUE WAS BELOW ITS COST BASIS; FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE INVESTEE; OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT; ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INVESTEE'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN; ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE MAY BE AWARE OF RELATED TO THE INVESTMENT.ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, OR LTIP, DESIGNED TO PROVIDE KEY OFFICERS AND EXECUTIVES WITH PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES CONTINGENT UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED CORPORATE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES COVERING A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE SEPARATE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLES RUNNING CONCURRENTLY ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2017 AND 2018. PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR EACH OF THE PERFORMANCE CYCLES ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS: 37.5% ON NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE, AS DEFINED; 37.5% ON TOTAL NON-GAAP REVENUE, AS DEFINED; AND 25% ON RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, WHICH IS A MEASUREMENT OF OUR STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE DURING THE APPLICABLE THREE-YEAR PERIOD, COMPARED WITH A GROUP OF OTHER COMPANIES IN THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. THRESHOLD, TARGET AND MAXIMUM CASH PAYOUT LEVELS UNDER THE THREE CURRENT LTIP PERFORMANCE CYCLES ARE CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE BETWEEN 0% AND 200% OF EACH PARTICIPANT’S BASE SALARY AT THE TIME THE LTIP WAS APPROVED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE. SUCH AWARDS ARE PAYABLE IN CASH OR COMMON STOCK OR A MIXTURE OF CASH AND COMMON STOCK, WHICH WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AT THE TIME OF AWARD DELIVERY. SHARE-BASED PAYOUT LEVELS ARE CALCULATED USING THE CASH-BASED THRESHOLD, TARGET AND MAXIMUM LEVELS, DIVIDED BY THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE OF CELGENE STOCK FOR THE 30 TRADING DAYS PRIOR TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF EACH PERFORMANCE CYCLE. THEREFORE, FINAL SHARE-BASED AWARD VALUES ARE REFLECTIVE OF THE STOCK PRICE AT THE END OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAY DETERMINE THAT PAYMENTS MADE IN COMMON STOCK ARE RESTRICTED FROM TRADING FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. WE ACCRUE THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE LIABILITY OVER EACH THREE-YEAR CYCLE. PRIOR TO THE END OF A THREE-YEAR CYCLE, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT DURING THE CYCLE. UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT EQUAL TO THEIR TARGET AWARD OR, IF HIGHER, AN AWARD BASED ON ACTUAL PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL.ACCRUALS RECORDED FOR THE LTIP ENTAIL MAKING CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE, NON-GAAP REVENUES AND RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, AS DEFINED; THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED. ACCRUALS FOR THE LTIP ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND REVISED ACCORDINGLY SO THAT THE LIABILITY RECORDED REFLECTS UPDATED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PAYOUTS. IN ESTIMATING THE ACCRUALS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DATE FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, EXPECTED RESULTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, OPERATING TRENDS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICING AND COMPETITION.VALUATION OF GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, OTHER ASSETS AND IPR&D: WE HAVE RECORDED GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IPR&D THROUGH ACQUISITIONS ACCOUNTED FOR AS BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. WHEN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS ARE ACQUIRED, WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS AS OF THE 53TABLE OF CONTENTSACQUISITION DATE. DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS ARE TYPICALLY USED IN THESE VALUATIONS IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, AND THE MODELS REQUIRE THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:•PROJECTING REGULATORY APPROVALS;•ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM PRODUCT SALES RESULTING FROM COMPLETED PRODUCTS AND IN-PROCESS PROJECTS OR ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED; AND•DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES AND PROBABILITY RATES.GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT IS SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING. WE TEST OUR GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT BY ASSESSING QUALITATIVE FACTORS OR PERFORMING A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS IN DETERMINING WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ARE BELOW THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE AMORTIZED TO THEIR ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR. INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO IPR&D PRODUCT RIGHTS ARE TREATED AS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND NOT AMORTIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS APPROVED FOR SALE BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN SPECIFIED MARKETS. AT THAT TIME, WE WILL DETERMINE THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET, RECLASSIFY THE ASSET OUT OF IPR&D AND BEGIN AMORTIZATION. IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS ALSO PERFORMED AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. SUCH TEST ENTAILS COMPLETING AN UPDATED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE IPR&D ASSET. IF REQUIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES IS COMPLETED BY COMPARING AN UPDATED NON-DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO THE BOOK VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET. VALUATION OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION: WE RECORD CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION AT ITS FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE, AND FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT REPORTING PERIOD REVALUE THESE OBLIGATIONS AND RECORD INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPERATING EARNINGS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. CHANGES TO CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION OBLIGATIONS CAN RESULT FROM MOVEMENTS IN PUBLICLY TRADED SHARE PRICES OF CVRS, ADJUSTMENTS TO DISCOUNT RATES AND PERIODS, UPDATES IN THE ASSUMED ACHIEVEMENT OR TIMING OF ANY DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES OR CHANGES IN THE PROBABILITY OF CERTAIN CLINICAL EVENTS AND CHANGES IN THE ASSUMED PROBABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATORY APPROVAL. THE ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT AND ANY CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION EXPENSE RECORDED IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. OUR CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES WERE RECORDED IN THE ACQUISITIONS OF GLOUCESTER, ABRAXIS, AVILA, NOGRA, AND QUANTICEL. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE GLOUCESTER, AVILA, NOGRA, AND QUANTICEL CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE DISCOUNT RATE, PROBABILITY AND ESTIMATED TIMING OF CASH MILESTONE PAYMENTS TO THE FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OF EACH BUSINESS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ABRAXIS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY IS BASED ON THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKTHE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES FORWARD-LOOKING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RISK OF LOSS IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES, CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE EARNINGS.WE HAVE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, OUR MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS CONSISTED OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, OUR LONG-TERM DEBT AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE CONSISTED OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED (MBS) SECURITIES, GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, ASSET BACKED SECURITIES AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MBS INCLUDE MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION AND THE GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION. CORPORATE DEBT – GLOBAL INCLUDES OBLIGATIONS ISSUED BY INVESTMENT-GRADE CORPORATIONS INCLUDING SOME ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN GUARANTEED BY GOVERNMENTS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. ASSET BACKED SECURITIES CONSIST OF TRIPLE-A RATED SECURITIES WITH CASH FLOWS COLLATERALIZED BY CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND AUTO LOANS.OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE PRIMARILY EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN THE PUBLICLY TRADED COMMON STOCK OF COMPANIES, INCLUDING COMMON STOCK OF COMPANIES WITH WHOM WE HAVE ENTERED INTO COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE INVEST IN DEBT SECURITIES THAT ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING 54TABLE OF CONTENTSLIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET.AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, FAIR VALUES AND RELATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS):DEBT OBLIGATIONS:SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT: THE CARRYING VALUE OF SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014 INCLUDES (IN MILLIONS):LONG-TERM DEBT: WE HAVE ISSUED AN AGGREGATE $14.250 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES AT VARYING MATURITY DATES AND INTEREST RATES. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS AND CARRYING VALUES OF THE LONG-TERM PORTION OF THESE SENIOR NOTES AS OF THE END OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW (IN MILLIONS): AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SENIOR NOTES OUTSTANDING WAS $14.299 BILLION. 55TABLE OF CONTENTSMARKET RISK MANAGEMENTOUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN BE IMPACTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES. WE ACTIVELY MANAGE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE AND INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS THROUGH OPERATIONAL MEANS AND THROUGH THE USE OF VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. IN INSTANCES WHERE THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OR FAIR VALUE HEDGES, WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME TERMINATE THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP. IF A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED WE GENERALLY EITHER SETTLE THE INSTRUMENT OR ENTER INTO AN OFFSETTING INSTRUMENT.FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENTWE MAINTAIN A FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS, TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THROUGH OUR REVENUE HEDGING PROGRAM, WE ENDEAVOR TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF POSSIBLE UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON OUR FUTURE U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS THAT ARE DERIVED FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, TYPICALLY WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. WE MANAGE OUR ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION EXPOSURE PRINCIPALLY WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND OCCASIONALLY FOREIGN CURRENCY PUT AND CALL OPTIONS.FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS: WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, MANAGE EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY IN THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS AND REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.WE MANAGE A PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PROTECT AGAINST CHANGES IN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014 HAD SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 36 MONTHS. THE SPOT RATE COMPONENTS OF THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AND, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI) AND RECLASSIFIED TO OPERATIONS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS. IF A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED WITH RESPECT TO A FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACT, ACCUMULATED GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACT REMAIN IN OCI UNTIL THE HEDGED FORECASTED TRANSACTION OCCURS AND ARE RECLASSIFIED TO OPERATIONS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. ANY INEFFECTIVENESS ON THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IS REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. THE FORWARD POINT COMPONENTS OF THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AND ALL FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS OF FORWARD POINT AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES WERE AS FOLLOWS AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014 (IN MILLIONS):WE CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF OUR OWN AND THE COUNTERPARTIES’ CREDIT RISK ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO EXECUTE ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONTRACT ON AN ONGOING BASIS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, CREDIT RISK DID NOT MATERIALLY CHANGE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS.WE ALSO MANAGE A PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN RECOGNIZED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE RELATED TO TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS HEDGES 56TABLE OF CONTENTSAND, ACCORDINGLY, ANY CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD NON-DESIGNATED HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014 WERE $920.0 MILLION AND $835.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, WE BELIEVE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS A REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES. ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2015 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WOULD CHANGE BY APPROXIMATELY $477.4 MILLION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS EITHER HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES OR RELATE TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE ENTITIES' FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE EITHER REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS OR RE-MEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR LIABILITY.FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS: FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE BY UTILIZING A STRATEGY THAT INVOLVES BOTH A PURCHASED LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTION AND A WRITTEN LOCAL CURRENCY CALL OPTION THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS HEDGES OF FUTURE SALES DENOMINATED IN THAT LOCAL CURRENCY. SPECIFICALLY, WE SELL (OR WRITE) A LOCAL CURRENCY CALL OPTION AND PURCHASE A LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTION WITH THE SAME EXPIRATION DATES AND LOCAL CURRENCY NOTIONAL AMOUNTS BUT WITH DIFFERENT STRIKE PRICES. THIS COMBINATION OF TRANSACTIONS IS GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS A “COLLAR.” THE EXPIRATION DATES AND NOTIONAL AMOUNTS CORRESPOND TO THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY SALES. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS RELATIVE TO THE CURRENCY OF THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED SALES, THE PURCHASED PUT OPTION VALUE REDUCES TO ZERO AND WE BENEFIT FROM THE INCREASE IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF OUR ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS; HOWEVER, THIS BENEFIT WOULD BE CAPPED AT THE STRIKE LEVEL OF THE WRITTEN CALL, WHICH FORMS THE UPPER END OF THE COLLAR. THE PREMIUM COLLECTED FROM THE SALE OF THE CALL OPTION IS EQUAL TO THE PREMIUM PAID FOR THE PURCHASED PUT OPTION, RESULTING IN A NET ZERO COST FOR EACH COLLAR. OUTSTANDING FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE WERE AS FOLLOWS AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014 (IN MILLIONS):1 U.S. DOLLAR NOTIONAL AMOUNTS ARE CALCULATED AS THE HEDGED LOCAL CURRENCY AMOUNT MULTIPLIED BY THE STRIKE VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION. THE LOCAL CURRENCY NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF OUR PURCHASED PUT AND WRITTEN CALL THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE EQUAL TO EACH OTHER.ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2015 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS WOULD INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $50.1 MILLION IF THE US DOLLAR WERE TO STRENGTHEN AND DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $49.1 MILLION IF THE US DOLLAR WERE TO WEAKEN. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS.INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENTIN ANTICIPATION OF ISSUING FIXED-RATE DEBT, WE MAY USE FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS (FORWARD STARTING SWAPS) OR TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS (TREASURY RATE LOCKS) THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES TO HEDGE AGAINST CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES THAT COULD IMPACT EXPECTED FUTURE ISSUANCES OF DEBT. TO THE EXTENT THESE HEDGES OF CASH FLOWS RELATED TO ANTICIPATED DEBT ARE EFFECTIVE, ANY REALIZED OR UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE TREASURY RATE LOCKS OR FORWARD STARTING SWAPS ARE REPORTED IN OCI AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME OVER THE LIFE OF THE ANTICIPATED FIXED-RATE NOTES.FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND TREASURY RATE LOCKS: DURING 2014, WE ENTERED INTO FORWARD STARTING SWAPS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES TO HEDGE AGAINST CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES THAT COULD IMPACT AN ANTICIPATED ISSUANCE OF DEBT IN 2015. DURING 2015, WE ENTERED INTO ADDITIONAL FORWARD STARTING SWAPS AND TREASURY RATE LOCKS. FORWARD STARTING SWAPS AND TREASURY RATE LOCKS WITH A COMBINED AGGREGATE NOTIONAL VALUE OF $2.900 BILLION WERE SETTLED UPON THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT IN AUGUST 2015, WHEN THE NET FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD STARTING SWAPS AND TREASURY RATE LOCKS IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WAS IN A LOSS POSITION OF $21.6 MILLION. THE NET LOSS WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIFE OF THE ASSOCIATED SENIOR NOTES. DURING 2015 AND IN JANUARY 2016, WE ENTERED INTO FORWARD STARTING SWAPS WITH EFFECTIVE DATES IN SEPTEMBER 2017 AND MATURING IN TEN YEARS.A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO MEASURE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS FROM A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES INDICATED THAT A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 WOULD HAVE INCREASED 57TABLE OF CONTENTSTHE FAIR VALUE OF OUR CONTRACTS BY $16.1 MILLION. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 WOULD HAVE DECREASED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR CONTRACTS BY $18.4 MILLION.INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS: FROM TIME TO TIME WE HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN DEBT OBLIGATIONS THROUGH THE USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. THE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED HEDGES OF THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE NOTES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. SINCE THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE SWAP ARE INTENDED TO MATCH THOSE OF THE DEBT BEING HEDGED, IT IS ASSUMED TO BE A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE HEDGE AND ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP ARE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WITH NO NET IMPACT RECORDED IN INCOME. ANY NET INTEREST PAYMENTS MADE OR RECEIVED ON INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST EXPENSE. IF A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED FOR AN INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACT, ACCUMULATED GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACT ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OR INCREASE OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY HEDGED DEBT OBLIGATIONS.WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SWAP CONTRACTS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF CERTAIN OF OUR FIXED RATE NOTES AND ALSO TERMINATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP BY SETTLING CERTAIN OF THOSE SWAP CONTRACTS DURING 2013, 2014 AND 2015. THE SETTLEMENT OF SWAP CONTRACTS DUE TO TERMINATIONS AND MATURITIES RESULTED IN THE RECEIPT OF NET PROCEEDS OF $10.8 MILLION AND $25.5 MILLION IN 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE NOTES. SEE NOTE 11 FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO REDUCTIONS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE.THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF OUR OUTSTANDING INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014 (IN MILLIONS): A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO MEASURE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR DEBT AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS FROM A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES INDICATED THAT A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET PAYABLE BY $877.4 MILLION. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET PAYABLE BY $1.032 BILLION.58TABLE OF CONTENTSITEM 7.

POMALYST®/IMNOVID® WAS APPROVED IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) FOR INDICATIONS IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA BASED ON PHASE II AND PHASE III TRIAL RESULTS, RESPECTIVELY, AND AN ADDITIONAL PHASE III TRIAL IS UNDERWAY WITH POMALYST®/IMNOVID® IN RELAPSED AND REFRACTORY MULTIPLE MYELOMA. IN SOLID TUMORS, ABRAXANE® IS CURRENTLY IN VARIOUS STAGES OF INVESTIGATION FOR BREAST, PANCREATIC AND NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCERS. IN INFLAMMATION AND IMMUNOLOGY, OTEZLA® IS BEING EVALUATED IN PHASE III TRIALS FOR BEHÇET'S DISEASE AND EXPANDED INDICATIONS IN PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS AND PLAQUE PSORIASIS. WE ALSO HAVE A GROWING NUMBER OF POTENTIAL PRODUCTS IN PHASE III TRIALS ACROSS MULTIPLE DISEASES. IN THE INFLAMMATION AND IMMUNOLOGY THERAPEUTIC AREA, WE HAVE PHASE III TRIALS UNDERWAY FOR OZANIMOD IN ULCERATIVE COLITIS (UC) AND RELAPSING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (RMS) AND FOR GED-0301 IN CROHN’S DISEASE. IN HEMATOLOGY, PHASE III TRIALS ARE UNDERWAY FOR CC-486 IN MDS AND ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA (AML), FOR AG-221 IN AML, AND FOR LUSPATERCEPT IN MDS.ON AUGUST 27, 2015, WE ACQUIRED ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK OF RECEPTOS, INC. (RECEPTOS) WHICH RESULTED IN RECEPTOS BECOMING OUR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY. RECEPTOS' LEAD DRUG CANDIDATE, OZANIMOD, IS A SMALL MOLECULE THAT MODULATES SPHINGOSINE 1-PHOSPHATE 1 AND 5 RECEPTORS AND IT IS IN DEVELOPMENT FOR IMMUNE-INFLAMMATORY INDICATIONS, INCLUDING INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE AND RMS.THE ACQUISITION OF RECEPTOS ALSO INCLUDED OTHER PIPELINE AND PRE-CLINICAL STAGE COMPOUNDS. IN CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS, OZANIMOD DEMONSTRATED SEVERAL AREAS OF POTENTIAL ADVANTAGE OVER EXISTING ORAL THERAPIES FOR THE TREATMENT OF UC AND RMS, INCLUDING ITS CARDIAC, HEPATOTOXICITY AND LYMPHOCYTE RECOVERY PROFILE. THE PHASE III TRUE NORTH TRIAL IN UC IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY WITH DATA EXPECTED IN 2018. THE PHASE III RADIANCE AND SUNBEAM RMS TRIALS ARE ONGOING AND DATA ARE EXPECTED IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2017. SEE NOTE 2 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR MORE INFORMATION RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF RECEPTOS.BEYOND OUR PHASE III PROGRAMS, WE HAVE ACCESS TO A GROWING EARLY-TO-MID-STAGE PIPELINE OF NOVEL POTENTIAL THERAPIES TO ADDRESS SIGNIFICANT UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS THAT CONSISTS OF NEW DRUG CANDIDATES AND CELL THERAPIES DEVELOPED IN-HOUSE, LICENSED FROM OTHER COMPANIES OR ABLE TO BE OPTIONED FROM COLLABORATION PARTNERS. WE BELIEVE THAT CONTINUED USE OF OUR PRIMARY COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS, PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS, DEPTH OF OUR PRODUCT PIPELINE, REGULATORY APPROVALS OF NEW PRODUCTS AND EXPANDED USE OF EXISTING PRODUCTS WILL PROVIDE THE CATALYSTS FOR FUTURE GROWTH.34TABLE OF CONTENTSTHE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES TOTAL REVENUE AND EARNINGS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014 AND 2013 (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA):* 2013 DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE TWO-FOR-ONE COMMON STOCK SPLIT EFFECTED IN JUNE 2014.REVENUE INCREASED BY $1.586 BILLION IN 2015 COMPARED TO 2014 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CONTINUED GROWTH IN SALES OF REVLIMID®, OTEZLA®, AND POMALYST®/IMNOVID®. OTEZLA® WAS APPROVED BY THE FDA IN MARCH 2014 FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH ACTIVE PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS AND IN SEPTEMBER 2014 FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE PLAQUE PSORIASIS WHO ARE CANDIDATES FOR PHOTOTHERAPY OR SYSTEMIC THERAPY. IN JANUARY 2015, OTEZLA® WAS APPROVED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION (EC) FOR THE TREATMENT OF BOTH PSORIASIS AND PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS IN CERTAIN ADULT PATIENTS.

GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES, SALES DISCOUNTS, GOVERNMENT REBATES, CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES.REVLIMID®, POMALYST® AND THALOMID® ARE DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES UNDER THE REVLIMID® RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY (REMS), POMALYST REMSTM AND THALOMID REMSTM PROGRAMS, RESPECTIVELY. THESE ARE PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®, POMALYST® AND THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID®, THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENETM AND IMNOVID® ARE DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL AUTHORITIES’ SPECIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE FOR THE PRODUCT’S SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. VIDAZA®, ABRAXANE®, ISTODAX® AND OTEZLA® ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® AND THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENETM.WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE 37TABLE OF CONTENTSMADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. AS NOTED ABOVE, REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® AND THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENETM ARE DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY SUBJECT TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY. SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF THE REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE ALSO ANALYZE ACTUAL BILLINGS RECEIVED FROM THE STATES TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE ACCRUAL RATES. SUBSEQUENT TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010 (COLLECTIVELY, THE 2010 U.S. HEALTH CARE REFORM LAW), CERTAIN STATES HAVE NOT COMPLETED THEIR MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION BILLING FOR THE YEARS OF 2010 THROUGH 2015. OUR ACCRUALS FOR THESE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION REBATES HAD BEEN AT ELEVATED LEVELS GIVEN THE DELAYS IN THE RECEIPT OF COMPLETE INVOICES FROM CERTAIN STATES. DUE TO THE RECEIPT OF MORE COMPLETE CLAIMS DATA DURING 2013, 2014 AND 2015, THE ACCRUALS FOR CERTAIN STATES WERE REDUCED FROM THESE ELEVATED LEVELS AS A RESULT OF BOTH PAYMENTS BEING APPLIED TO THE ACCRUAL DURING 2013, 2014 AND 2015 AND CHANGES IN ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE OBLIGATION DURING THE FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2013, 2014 AND 2015. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ADJUST THE REBATE ACCRUALS AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND TO REFLECT ACTUAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE. MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT’S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL INVOICES. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES.REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE RECORD A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY. CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE INCLUDED IN CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS AND ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA.

THE $30.2 MILLION DECREASE IN NET EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN 2014 RELATED TO CERTAIN INVESTMENTS AND GAINS RELATED TO THE SALE OF PUTS ON OUR COMMON STOCK IN 2014. THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSSES RECORDED IN THE 2014 PERIOD COMPARED TO GAINS RECORDED IN THE 2013 PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE 2014 PERIOD INCLUDED AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN SPREADS BETWEEN FORWARD AND SPOT RATES RELATED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS COMPARED TO A FAVORABLE CHANGE IN SPREADS BETWEEN FORWARD AND SPOT RATES IN THE 2013 PERIOD.INCOME TAX PROVISION: THE INCOME TAX PROVISION INCREASED BY $94.0 MILLION TO $421.5 MILLION IN 2015 COMPARED TO 2014 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN INCOME BEFORE TAXES. THE FULL YEAR 2015 UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 20.0% REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS FOOTPRINT.

THE INCREASED COLLABORATION AND ACQUISITION RELATED EXPENSES IN 2015 WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET PRODUCT SALES AS WELL AS AN $85.9 MILLION REALIZED GAIN ON THE SALE OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENT IN FLEXUS BIOSCIENCES, INC. IN APRIL 2015. THE $0.45 DECREASE IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN 2015 COMPARED TO 2014 WAS FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY THE REPURCHASE OF 28.1 MILLION COMMON SHARES UNDER OUR COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, REDUCING OUR OUTSTANDING SHARE BASE.THE $550.0 MILLION INCREASE IN NET INCOME TO $2.000 BILLION IN 2014 COMPARED TO 2013 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF NET PRODUCT SALES PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN EXPENSES, INCLUDING A $129.2 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR IPR&D, INCREASE IN SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, INCREASE IN DRUG DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR GROWING ORGANIZATION TO SUPPORT INFLAMMATION AND IMMUNOLOGY PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES AND AN INCREASE IN SELLING AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY RELATED TO LAUNCH ACTIVITIES IN RECENTLY APPROVED INDICATIONS FOR OTEZLA®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® AND ABRAXANE®.

WE EXPECT CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR EXPENDITURES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TRIALS, COMMERCIALIZATION OF NEW PRODUCTS, INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND EXISTING SOURCES OF AND ACCESS TO FINANCING ARE ADEQUATE TO FUND OUR OPERATING NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AND OUR PLANS TO REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK OR PURSUE OTHER STRATEGIC BUSINESS INITIATIVES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE HELD INTERNATIONALLY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, WE HELD APPROXIMATELY $4.488 BILLION OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE IN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS. THE AMOUNT OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE HELD IN U.S. TAX JURISDICTIONS CAN FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS INCLUDING INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS FOR OTHER REASONS, SUCH AS REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, INTERNAL REORGANIZATIONS, BUSINESS-DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND DEBT ISSUANCES. AS PART OF OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY ASSESSMENTS, WE REGULARLY MONITOR THE MIX OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CASH FLOWS (BOTH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS). REPATRIATION OF OVERSEAS FUNDS CAN RESULT IN ADDITIONAL U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAX PAYMENTS. WE RECORD U.S. DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES FOR CERTAIN UNREMITTED EARNINGS, BUT WHEN AMOUNTS EARNED OVERSEAS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, NO ACCRUAL FOR U.S. TAXES IS PROVIDED. APPROXIMATELY $900.0 MILLION OF OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS, INCLUDED IN THE $4.488 BILLION OF SHORT-TERM FUNDS IN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS, MAY NOT BE REQUIRED FOR USE IN OFFSHORE OPERATIONS AND MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR USE IN THE UNITED STATES.

THE REMAINING FOREIGN EARNINGS ARE UNREMITTED AND EXPECTED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE DO NOT RELY ON THESE EARNINGS AS A SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR OUR DOMESTIC BUSINESS AS WE EXPECT TO HAVE SUFFICIENT CURRENT CASH RESOURCES COMBINED WITH FUTURE CASH FLOWS IN THE UNITED STATES TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC NEEDS.SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM: OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED AN AGGREGATE $17.500 BILLION COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF WHICH WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $3.890 BILLION REMAINING FOR FUTURE SHARE REPURCHASES. DURING 2015, WE USED $3.257 BILLION FOR REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, MEASURED ON A SETTLEMENT DATE BASIS.COMPONENTS OF WORKING CAPITALCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: WE INVEST OUR EXCESS CASH PRIMARILY IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS, U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND SUPRANATIONAL SECURITIES, GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES AND ASSET BACKED SECURITIES. ALL LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND ALL INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. THE $994.8 MILLION DECREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 COMPARED TO 2014 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $7.695 BILLION OF PAYMENTS FOR THE ACQUISITIONS OF RECEPTOS AND QUANTICEL, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED, $3.257 BILLION OF PAYMENTS UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND $513.9 MILLION FOR REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $7.913 BILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM THE AUGUST 2015 DEBT ISSUANCE OF AN ADDITIONAL $8.000 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES, $2.484 BILLION OF NET CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OTHER ACTIVITIES RESULTING IN NET CASH PROCEEDS OF $73.8 MILLION.MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY.

SALES MADE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES TYPICALLY HAVE PAYMENT TERMS THAT ARE GREATER THAN 60 DAYS, THEREBY EXTENDING COLLECTION PERIODS BEYOND THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE EXPECT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE TO CONTINUE TO GROW AS OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES CONTINUE TO EXPAND.46TABLE OF CONTENTSWE CONTINUE TO MONITOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES, THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS IN CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND ASSOCIATED IMPACTS ON THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OUR BUSINESS. OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL IN THESE MARKETS IS TYPICALLY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO PRINCIPALLY GOVERNMENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED HOSPITALS, WHICH IN TURN DIRECTLY DELIVER CRITICAL CARE TO PATIENTS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE USED TO TREAT LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES AND WE BELIEVE THIS BUSINESS MODEL ENABLES TIMELY DELIVERY AND ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS. MANY OF THE OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE RELATED TO GOVERNMENT-FUNDED HOSPITALS AND WE BELIEVE THE RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE ULTIMATELY COLLECTIBLE. SIMILARLY, WE BELIEVE THAT FUTURE SALES TO THESE CUSTOMERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE COLLECTIBLE. THE CREDIT AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WITHIN SPAIN, ITALY, PORTUGAL AND GREECE, AS WELL AS INCREASING SALES LEVELS IN THOSE COUNTRIES HAVE IN THE PAST RESULTED IN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN, AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES TO COLLECT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. OUR TOTAL NET RECEIVABLES IN SPAIN, ITALY AND PORTUGAL ARE COMPOSED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR CONTROLLED HOSPITALS AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND AMOUNTED TO $187.8 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 COMPARED TO $241.8 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014. APPROXIMATELY $31.3 MILLION OF THE $187.8 MILLION RECEIVABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 WAS GREATER THAN ONE YEAR PAST DUE. OUR EXPOSURE TO THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS IN GREECE IS LIMITED, AS WE DO NOT HAVE A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF RECEIVABLES IN GREECE. WE MAINTAIN TIMELY AND DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH HOSPITAL CUSTOMERS IN SPAIN, ITALY AND PORTUGAL REGARDING BOTH THE CURRENT AND PAST DUE RECEIVABLE BALANCES. WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS FROM THESE COUNTRIES AND CLOSELY MONITOR THE PLANS FOR PAYMENT AT THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL. PAYMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS IN THESE COUNTRIES ARE NOT RECEIVED ON REGULAR INTERVALS AND SEVERAL MONTHS COULD ELAPSE BETWEEN SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS. WE ALSO REGULARLY REQUEST AND RECEIVE POSITIVE CONFIRMATION OF THE VALIDITY OF OUR RECEIVABLES FROM MOST OF THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES. IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR SPAIN, ITALY AND PORTUGAL, WE CONSIDERED THE BALANCE OF PAST DUE RECEIVABLES RELATED TO SALES MADE TO GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR SUPPORTED CUSTOMERS. WE REGULARLY MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS IN EUROPE TO ASSESS WHETHER THE LEVEL OF RISK OF DEFAULT FOR ANY CUSTOMERS HAS INCREASED AND NOTE THE ONGOING EFFORTS BY THE EUROPEAN UNION, EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION AND INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND TO SUPPORT COUNTRIES WITH LARGE PUBLIC DEFICITS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT BALANCES. WE ALSO MONITOR THE EFFORTS OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES TO SUPPORT THEIR REGIONS WITH LARGE PUBLIC DEFICITS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT BALANCES. WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR WRITE-OFFS WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLECTION OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN THESE COUNTRIES AS A RESULT OF THEIR ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES AND WE DO NOT EXPECT TO HAVE WRITE-OFFS OR ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.INVENTORY: INVENTORY BALANCES INCREASED BY $50.3 MILLION TO $443.4 MILLION AT THE END OF 2015 COMPARED TO 2014.

THE COMMERCIAL PAPER IS SOLD UNDER CUSTOMARY TERMS TO A DEALER OR IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET AND IS ISSUED AT A DISCOUNT FROM PAR OR, ALTERNATIVELY, IS SOLD AT PAR AND BEARS VARYING INTEREST RATES ON A FIXED OR FLOATING BASIS. BORROWINGS UNDER THE PROGRAM ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS.SENIOR UNSECURED CREDIT FACILITY: WE MAINTAIN A SENIOR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (CREDIT FACILITY) THAT PROVIDES REVOLVING CREDIT IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $1.750 BILLION, WHICH WAS INCREASED FROM $1.500 BILLION IN APRIL 2015.

THE NON-CANCELABLE LEASE TERMS FOR OPERATING LEASES EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES BETWEEN 2016 AND 2025 AND INCLUDE RENEWAL OPTIONS. IN GENERAL, WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE LESSORS FOR REAL ESTATE TAXES, INSURANCE, UTILITIES, MAINTENANCE AND OTHER OPERATING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEASES. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE MAJOR FACILITIES THAT WE OCCUPY UNDER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS REFER TO PART I, ITEM 2. "PROPERTIES" OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.49TABLE OF CONTENTSOTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS: OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS OF $208.1 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 PRIMARILY INCLUDED $183.7 MILLION IN CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPLY CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE COMMITTED TO INVEST AN AGGREGATE $20.4 MILLION IN AN INVESTMENT FUND, WHICH IS CALLABLE AT ANY TIME, AND A REMAINING $4.0 MILLION BALANCE DUE IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF A MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN SWITZERLAND.COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS: WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT INCLUDE THE FUNDING OF CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE MILESTONE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED DEVELOPMENTAL, REGULATORY AND/OR COMMERCIAL TARGETS. OUR OBLIGATION TO FUND THESE EFFORTS IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROGRAMS AND/OR THE LACK OF ANY ADVERSE EVENTS WHICH COULD CAUSE THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE PROGRAMS. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE ATTAINMENT OF SPECIFIED DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND ACCORDINGLY, NO AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED FOR THESE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014 CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. POTENTIAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS (NOT INCLUDING POTENTIAL ROYALTY PAYMENTS) TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $3.849 BILLION, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $3.326 BILLION CONTINGENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF VARIOUS RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES AND APPROXIMATELY $523.1 MILLION IN SALES-BASED MILESTONES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS, SEE NOTE 17 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSFOR A DISCUSSION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS PLEASE SEE NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.50TABLE OF CONTENTSCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IS ONE THAT IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENT'S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL:REVENUE RECOGNITION: REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS OF THE PRODUCT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER AND THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED AND DETERMINABLE. PROVISIONS FOR DISCOUNTS, EARLY PAYMENTS, REBATES, SALES RETURNS AND DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS UNDER TERMS CUSTOMARY IN THE INDUSTRY ARE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SAME PERIOD THE RELATED SALES ARE RECORDED. WE RECORD ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SALE. THE ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR SUCH VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES ARE BASED ON THE SALES TERMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND TREND ANALYSIS.WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM ROYALTIES BASED ON LICENSEES' SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS USING OUR TECHNOLOGIES. ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACT TERMS WHEN ROYALTIES FROM LICENSEES CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED. IF ROYALTIES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR COLLECTABILITY OF A ROYALTY AMOUNT IS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED, ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE CASH IS RECEIVED.GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® AND THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENETM ARE DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY SUBJECT TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY.SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF THE REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE ALSO ANALYZE ACTUAL BILLINGS RECEIVED FROM THE STATES TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE ACCRUAL RATES. SUBSEQUENT TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010 (COLLECTIVELY, THE 2010 U.S. HEALTH CARE REFORM LAW), CERTAIN STATES HAVE NOT COMPLETED THEIR MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION BILLING FOR THE YEARS OF 2010 THROUGH 2015. OUR ACCRUALS FOR THESE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION REBATES HAD BEEN AT ELEVATED LEVELS GIVEN THE DELAYS IN THE RECEIPT OF COMPLETE INVOICES FROM CERTAIN STATES. DUE TO THE RECEIPT OF MORE COMPLETE CLAIMS DATA DURING 2013, 2014 AND 2015, THE ACCRUALS FOR CERTAIN STATES WERE REDUCED FROM THESE ELEVATED LEVELS AS A RESULT OF BOTH PAYMENTS BEING APPLIED TO THE ACCRUAL DURING 2013, 2014 AND 2015 AND CHANGES IN ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE OBLIGATION DURING THE FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2013, 2014 AND 2015. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ADJUST THE REBATE ACCRUALS AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND TO REFLECT ACTUAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE. MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT’S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL INVOICES. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES.REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE RECORD A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. 51TABLE OF CONTENTSASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY. CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE INCLUDED IN CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS AND ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA.ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: WE ESTIMATE AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, HISTORICAL PAYMENT PATTERNS, AGING OF RECEIVABLE BALANCES AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF COUNTRIES THEMSELVES AND PROVINCES OR AREAS WITHIN SUCH COUNTRIES WHERE THEY ARE THE ULTIMATE CUSTOMERS.INCOME TAXES: WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. WE PROVIDE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED.WE ACCOUNT FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS PART OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THESE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATE PRIMARILY TO ISSUES COMMON AMONG MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE APPLY A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES WHICH INCLUDE STUDIES PERFORMED BY INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS, ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY AND SUBJECT EXPERTS, EVALUATION OF PUBLIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. WE PROVIDE ESTIMATES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. IF OUR ESTIMATES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ACTUAL OUTCOMES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED.WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE A PORTION WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR RECENT CUMULATIVE EARNINGS EXPERIENCE BY TAXING JURISDICTION, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, CARRYFORWARD PERIODS AVAILABLE TO US FOR TAX REPORTING PURPOSES, VARIOUS INCOME TAX STRATEGIES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT AND, TO THE EXTENT FUTURE EXPECTATIONS CHANGE, WE WOULD HAVE TO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THAT TIME. AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES.SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION: WE UTILIZE SHARE BASED COMPENSATION IN THE FORM OF STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, OR RSUS, AND PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, OR PSUS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARDS AT GRANT DATE. COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED REFLECTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF AWARDS EXPECTED TO VEST AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AN ESTIMATE OF AWARD FORFEITURES BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE VESTING PERIOD REQUIRED TO OBTAIN FULL VESTING. MANAGEMENT EXPECTATIONS RELATED TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PERFORMANCE GOALS ASSOCIATED WITH PSU GRANTS IS ASSESSED REGULARLY AND THAT ASSESSMENT IS USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER PSU GRANTS ARE EXPECTED TO VEST. IF PERFORMANCE-BASED MILESTONES RELATED TO PSU GRANTS ARE NOT MET OR NOT EXPECTED TO BE MET, ANY COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED TO DATE ASSOCIATED WITH GRANTS THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO VEST WILL BE REVERSED.OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES: A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF ANY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY BELOW ITS COST THAT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN CARRYING AMOUNT TO FAIR VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT IS CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AND A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE SECURITY ESTABLISHED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INCLUDE: SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE ISSUER'S EARNINGS PERFORMANCE, CREDIT RATING, ASSET QUALITY, BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE ISSUER OPERATES, LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW OUR COST, OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE SECURITY, OUR INTENT NOT TO SELL, AN EVALUATION AS TO WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO SELL BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR COST BASIS, AND ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ISSUER'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD DIFFER FROM OUR ASSESSMENT.DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES: ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN CURRENT EARNINGS OR OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), DEPENDING 52TABLE OF CONTENTSON WHETHER A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION AND, IF IT IS, THE TYPE OF HEDGING TRANSACTION. FOR A DERIVATIVE TO QUALIFY AS A HEDGE AT INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE HEDGED PERIOD, WE FORMALLY DOCUMENT THE NATURE AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEM. WE ASSESS, BOTH AT INCEPTION AND ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING TRANSACTIONS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING THE CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS. WE ASSESS HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND RECORD THE GAIN OR LOSS RELATED TO THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IF ANY, TO CURRENT EARNINGS. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER PROBABLE OF OCCURRING, WE DISCONTINUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING AND ANY RELATED UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE NOT DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION, TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE, OUR STOCK PRICE AND INTEREST RATES. THE USE OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE EXPOSURE OF THESE RISKS WITH THE INTENT TO REDUCE OUR RISK OR COST.INVESTMENTS IN OTHER ENTITIES: WE HOLD A PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER EITHER THE EQUITY METHOD OR COST METHOD. INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES OR CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS OVER WHICH WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD, WITH OUR SHARE OF EARNINGS OR LOSSES REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES OF COMPANIES THAT BECOME PUBLICLY TRADED ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES PROSPECTIVELY FROM THE DATE OF SUCH COMPANIES' INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING.OUR COST METHOD AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.ALL INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT. IF AN INVESTMENT'S FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN ITS NET CARRYING VALUE AND THE DECLINE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE. SUCH AN EVALUATION IS JUDGMENTAL AND DEPENDENT ON SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE HAS OCCURRED INCLUDE: MARKET VALUE OR EXIT PRICE OF THE INVESTMENT BASED ON EITHER MARKET-QUOTED PRICES OR FUTURE ROUNDS OF FINANCING BY THE INVESTEE; LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE MARKET VALUE WAS BELOW ITS COST BASIS; FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE INVESTEE; OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT; ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INVESTEE'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN; ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE MAY BE AWARE OF RELATED TO THE INVESTMENT.ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, OR LTIP, DESIGNED TO PROVIDE KEY OFFICERS AND EXECUTIVES WITH PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES CONTINGENT UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED CORPORATE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES COVERING A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE SEPARATE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLES RUNNING CONCURRENTLY ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2017 AND 2018. PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR EACH OF THE PERFORMANCE CYCLES ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS: 37.5% ON NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE, AS DEFINED; 37.5% ON TOTAL NON-GAAP REVENUE, AS DEFINED; AND 25% ON RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, WHICH IS A MEASUREMENT OF OUR STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE DURING THE APPLICABLE THREE-YEAR PERIOD, COMPARED WITH A GROUP OF OTHER COMPANIES IN THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. THRESHOLD, TARGET AND MAXIMUM CASH PAYOUT LEVELS UNDER THE THREE CURRENT LTIP PERFORMANCE CYCLES ARE CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE BETWEEN 0% AND 200% OF EACH PARTICIPANT’S BASE SALARY AT THE TIME THE LTIP WAS APPROVED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE. SUCH AWARDS ARE PAYABLE IN CASH OR COMMON STOCK OR A MIXTURE OF CASH AND COMMON STOCK, WHICH WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AT THE TIME OF AWARD DELIVERY. SHARE-BASED PAYOUT LEVELS ARE CALCULATED USING THE CASH-BASED THRESHOLD, TARGET AND MAXIMUM LEVELS, DIVIDED BY THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE OF CELGENE STOCK FOR THE 30 TRADING DAYS PRIOR TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF EACH PERFORMANCE CYCLE. THEREFORE, FINAL SHARE-BASED AWARD VALUES ARE REFLECTIVE OF THE STOCK PRICE AT THE END OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAY DETERMINE THAT PAYMENTS MADE IN COMMON STOCK ARE RESTRICTED FROM TRADING FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. WE ACCRUE THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE LIABILITY OVER EACH THREE-YEAR CYCLE. PRIOR TO THE END OF A THREE-YEAR CYCLE, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT DURING THE CYCLE. UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT EQUAL TO THEIR TARGET AWARD OR, IF HIGHER, AN AWARD BASED ON ACTUAL PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL.ACCRUALS RECORDED FOR THE LTIP ENTAIL MAKING CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE, NON-GAAP REVENUES AND RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, AS DEFINED; THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED. ACCRUALS FOR THE LTIP ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND REVISED ACCORDINGLY SO THAT THE LIABILITY RECORDED REFLECTS UPDATED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PAYOUTS. IN ESTIMATING THE ACCRUALS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DATE FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, EXPECTED RESULTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, OPERATING TRENDS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICING AND COMPETITION.VALUATION OF GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, OTHER ASSETS AND IPR&D: WE HAVE RECORDED GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IPR&D THROUGH ACQUISITIONS ACCOUNTED FOR AS BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. WHEN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS ARE ACQUIRED, WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS AS OF THE 53TABLE OF CONTENTSACQUISITION DATE. DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS ARE TYPICALLY USED IN THESE VALUATIONS IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, AND THE MODELS REQUIRE THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:•PROJECTING REGULATORY APPROVALS;•ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM PRODUCT SALES RESULTING FROM COMPLETED PRODUCTS AND IN-PROCESS PROJECTS OR ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED; AND•DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES AND PROBABILITY RATES.GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT IS SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING. WE TEST OUR GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT BY ASSESSING QUALITATIVE FACTORS OR PERFORMING A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS IN DETERMINING WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ARE BELOW THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE AMORTIZED TO THEIR ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR. INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO IPR&D PRODUCT RIGHTS ARE TREATED AS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND NOT AMORTIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS APPROVED FOR SALE BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN SPECIFIED MARKETS. AT THAT TIME, WE WILL DETERMINE THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET, RECLASSIFY THE ASSET OUT OF IPR&D AND BEGIN AMORTIZATION. IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS ALSO PERFORMED AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. SUCH TEST ENTAILS COMPLETING AN UPDATED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE IPR&D ASSET. IF REQUIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES IS COMPLETED BY COMPARING AN UPDATED NON-DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO THE BOOK VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET. VALUATION OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION: WE RECORD CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION AT ITS FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE, AND FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT REPORTING PERIOD REVALUE THESE OBLIGATIONS AND RECORD INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPERATING EARNINGS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. CHANGES TO CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION OBLIGATIONS CAN RESULT FROM MOVEMENTS IN PUBLICLY TRADED SHARE PRICES OF CVRS, ADJUSTMENTS TO DISCOUNT RATES AND PERIODS, UPDATES IN THE ASSUMED ACHIEVEMENT OR TIMING OF ANY DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES OR CHANGES IN THE PROBABILITY OF CERTAIN CLINICAL EVENTS AND CHANGES IN THE ASSUMED PROBABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATORY APPROVAL. THE ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT AND ANY CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION EXPENSE RECORDED IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. OUR CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES WERE RECORDED IN THE ACQUISITIONS OF GLOUCESTER, ABRAXIS, AVILA, NOGRA, AND QUANTICEL. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE GLOUCESTER, AVILA, NOGRA, AND QUANTICEL CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE DISCOUNT RATE, PROBABILITY AND ESTIMATED TIMING OF CASH MILESTONE PAYMENTS TO THE FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OF EACH BUSINESS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ABRAXIS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY IS BASED ON THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKTHE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES FORWARD-LOOKING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RISK OF LOSS IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES, CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE EARNINGS.WE HAVE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, OUR MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS CONSISTED OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, OUR LONG-TERM DEBT AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE CONSISTED OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED (MBS) SECURITIES, GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, ASSET BACKED SECURITIES AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MBS INCLUDE MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION AND THE GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION. CORPORATE DEBT – GLOBAL INCLUDES OBLIGATIONS ISSUED BY INVESTMENT-GRADE CORPORATIONS INCLUDING SOME ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN GUARANTEED BY GOVERNMENTS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. ASSET BACKED SECURITIES CONSIST OF TRIPLE-A RATED SECURITIES WITH CASH FLOWS COLLATERALIZED BY CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND AUTO LOANS.OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE PRIMARILY EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN THE PUBLICLY TRADED COMMON STOCK OF COMPANIES, INCLUDING COMMON STOCK OF COMPANIES WITH WHOM WE HAVE ENTERED INTO COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE INVEST IN DEBT SECURITIES THAT ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING 54TABLE OF CONTENTSLIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET.AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, FAIR VALUES AND RELATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS):DEBT OBLIGATIONS:SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT: THE CARRYING VALUE OF SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014 INCLUDES (IN MILLIONS):LONG-TERM DEBT: WE HAVE ISSUED AN AGGREGATE $14.250 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES AT VARYING MATURITY DATES AND INTEREST RATES. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS AND CARRYING VALUES OF THE LONG-TERM PORTION OF THESE SENIOR NOTES AS OF THE END OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW (IN MILLIONS): AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SENIOR NOTES OUTSTANDING WAS $14.299 BILLION. 55TABLE OF CONTENTSMARKET RISK MANAGEMENTOUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN BE IMPACTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES. WE ACTIVELY MANAGE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE AND INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS THROUGH OPERATIONAL MEANS AND THROUGH THE USE OF VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. IN INSTANCES WHERE THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OR FAIR VALUE HEDGES, WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME TERMINATE THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP. IF A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED WE GENERALLY EITHER SETTLE THE INSTRUMENT OR ENTER INTO AN OFFSETTING INSTRUMENT.FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENTWE MAINTAIN A FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS, TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THROUGH OUR REVENUE HEDGING PROGRAM, WE ENDEAVOR TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF POSSIBLE UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON OUR FUTURE U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS THAT ARE DERIVED FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, TYPICALLY WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. WE MANAGE OUR ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION EXPOSURE PRINCIPALLY WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND OCCASIONALLY FOREIGN CURRENCY PUT AND CALL OPTIONS.FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS: WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, MANAGE EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY IN THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS AND REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.WE MANAGE A PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PROTECT AGAINST CHANGES IN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014 HAD SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 36 MONTHS. THE SPOT RATE COMPONENTS OF THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AND, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI) AND RECLASSIFIED TO OPERATIONS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS. IF A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED WITH RESPECT TO A FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACT, ACCUMULATED GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACT REMAIN IN OCI UNTIL THE HEDGED FORECASTED TRANSACTION OCCURS AND ARE RECLASSIFIED TO OPERATIONS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. ANY INEFFECTIVENESS ON THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IS REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. THE FORWARD POINT COMPONENTS OF THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AND ALL FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS OF FORWARD POINT AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES WERE AS FOLLOWS AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014 (IN MILLIONS):WE CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF OUR OWN AND THE COUNTERPARTIES’ CREDIT RISK ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO EXECUTE ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONTRACT ON AN ONGOING BASIS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, CREDIT RISK DID NOT MATERIALLY CHANGE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS.WE ALSO MANAGE A PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN RECOGNIZED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE RELATED TO TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS HEDGES 56TABLE OF CONTENTSAND, ACCORDINGLY, ANY CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD NON-DESIGNATED HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014 WERE $920.0 MILLION AND $835.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, WE BELIEVE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS A REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES. ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2015 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WOULD CHANGE BY APPROXIMATELY $477.4 MILLION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS EITHER HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES OR RELATE TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE ENTITIES' FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE EITHER REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS OR RE-MEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR LIABILITY.FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS: FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE BY UTILIZING A STRATEGY THAT INVOLVES BOTH A PURCHASED LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTION AND A WRITTEN LOCAL CURRENCY CALL OPTION THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS HEDGES OF FUTURE SALES DENOMINATED IN THAT LOCAL CURRENCY. SPECIFICALLY, WE SELL (OR WRITE) A LOCAL CURRENCY CALL OPTION AND PURCHASE A LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTION WITH THE SAME EXPIRATION DATES AND LOCAL CURRENCY NOTIONAL AMOUNTS BUT WITH DIFFERENT STRIKE PRICES. THIS COMBINATION OF TRANSACTIONS IS GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS A “COLLAR.” THE EXPIRATION DATES AND NOTIONAL AMOUNTS CORRESPOND TO THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY SALES. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS RELATIVE TO THE CURRENCY OF THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED SALES, THE PURCHASED PUT OPTION VALUE REDUCES TO ZERO AND WE BENEFIT FROM THE INCREASE IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF OUR ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS; HOWEVER, THIS BENEFIT WOULD BE CAPPED AT THE STRIKE LEVEL OF THE WRITTEN CALL, WHICH FORMS THE UPPER END OF THE COLLAR. THE PREMIUM COLLECTED FROM THE SALE OF THE CALL OPTION IS EQUAL TO THE PREMIUM PAID FOR THE PURCHASED PUT OPTION, RESULTING IN A NET ZERO COST FOR EACH COLLAR. OUTSTANDING FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE WERE AS FOLLOWS AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014 (IN MILLIONS):1 U.S. DOLLAR NOTIONAL AMOUNTS ARE CALCULATED AS THE HEDGED LOCAL CURRENCY AMOUNT MULTIPLIED BY THE STRIKE VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION. THE LOCAL CURRENCY NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF OUR PURCHASED PUT AND WRITTEN CALL THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE EQUAL TO EACH OTHER.ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2015 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS WOULD INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $50.1 MILLION IF THE US DOLLAR WERE TO STRENGTHEN AND DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $49.1 MILLION IF THE US DOLLAR WERE TO WEAKEN. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS.INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENTIN ANTICIPATION OF ISSUING FIXED-RATE DEBT, WE MAY USE FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS (FORWARD STARTING SWAPS) OR TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS (TREASURY RATE LOCKS) THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES TO HEDGE AGAINST CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES THAT COULD IMPACT EXPECTED FUTURE ISSUANCES OF DEBT. TO THE EXTENT THESE HEDGES OF CASH FLOWS RELATED TO ANTICIPATED DEBT ARE EFFECTIVE, ANY REALIZED OR UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE TREASURY RATE LOCKS OR FORWARD STARTING SWAPS ARE REPORTED IN OCI AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME OVER THE LIFE OF THE ANTICIPATED FIXED-RATE NOTES.FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND TREASURY RATE LOCKS: DURING 2014, WE ENTERED INTO FORWARD STARTING SWAPS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES TO HEDGE AGAINST CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES THAT COULD IMPACT AN ANTICIPATED ISSUANCE OF DEBT IN 2015. DURING 2015, WE ENTERED INTO ADDITIONAL FORWARD STARTING SWAPS AND TREASURY RATE LOCKS. FORWARD STARTING SWAPS AND TREASURY RATE LOCKS WITH A COMBINED AGGREGATE NOTIONAL VALUE OF $2.900 BILLION WERE SETTLED UPON THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT IN AUGUST 2015, WHEN THE NET FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD STARTING SWAPS AND TREASURY RATE LOCKS IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WAS IN A LOSS POSITION OF $21.6 MILLION. THE NET LOSS WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIFE OF THE ASSOCIATED SENIOR NOTES. DURING 2015 AND IN JANUARY 2016, WE ENTERED INTO FORWARD STARTING SWAPS WITH EFFECTIVE DATES IN SEPTEMBER 2017 AND MATURING IN TEN YEARS.A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO MEASURE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS FROM A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES INDICATED THAT A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 WOULD HAVE INCREASED 57TABLE OF CONTENTSTHE FAIR VALUE OF OUR CONTRACTS BY $16.1 MILLION. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 WOULD HAVE DECREASED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR CONTRACTS BY $18.4 MILLION.INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS: FROM TIME TO TIME WE HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN DEBT OBLIGATIONS THROUGH THE USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. THE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED HEDGES OF THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE NOTES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. SINCE THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE SWAP ARE INTENDED TO MATCH THOSE OF THE DEBT BEING HEDGED, IT IS ASSUMED TO BE A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE HEDGE AND ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP ARE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WITH NO NET IMPACT RECORDED IN INCOME. ANY NET INTEREST PAYMENTS MADE OR RECEIVED ON INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST EXPENSE. IF A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED FOR AN INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACT, ACCUMULATED GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACT ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OR INCREASE OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY HEDGED DEBT OBLIGATIONS.WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SWAP CONTRACTS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF CERTAIN OF OUR FIXED RATE NOTES AND ALSO TERMINATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP BY SETTLING CERTAIN OF THOSE SWAP CONTRACTS DURING 2013, 2014 AND 2015. THE SETTLEMENT OF SWAP CONTRACTS DUE TO TERMINATIONS AND MATURITIES RESULTED IN THE RECEIPT OF NET PROCEEDS OF $10.8 MILLION AND $25.5 MILLION IN 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE NOTES. SEE NOTE 11 FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO REDUCTIONS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE.THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF OUR OUTSTANDING INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014 (IN MILLIONS): A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO MEASURE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR DEBT AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS FROM A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES INDICATED THAT A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET PAYABLE BY $877.4 MILLION. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET PAYABLE BY $1.032 BILLION.58TABLE OF CONTENTS
