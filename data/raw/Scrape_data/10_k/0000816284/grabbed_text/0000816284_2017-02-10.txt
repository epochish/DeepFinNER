GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES, SALES DISCOUNTS, GOVERNMENT REBATES, CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES.REVLIMID®, POMALYST® AND THALOMID® ARE DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES UNDER THE REVLIMID RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY (REMS), POMALYST REMS® AND THALOMID REMS® PROGRAMS, RESPECTIVELY. THESE ARE PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®, POMALYST® AND THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID®, THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENE® AND IMNOVID® ARE DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL AUTHORITIES’ SPECIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE FOR THE PRODUCT’S SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. OTEZLA®, ABRAXANE®, ISTODAX® AND VIDAZA® ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® AND THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENE®.WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. AS NOTED ABOVE, REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® AND THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENE® ARE DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY SUBJECT TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY. SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF THE REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE ALSO ANALYZE ACTUAL BILLINGS RECEIVED FROM THE STATES TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE ACCRUAL RATES. MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT’S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL INVOICES. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES.REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE RECORD A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY.36CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE INCLUDED IN CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS AND ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2016 IS 15.7%. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS A FUNCTION OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRE-TAX INCOME AMONG THE MANY JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. OUR PRE-TAX INCOME IS EARNED AND TAXED IN EITHER THE U.S. AT A STATUTORY TAX RATE OF 35%, OR OUTSIDE THE U.S. AT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES. THE DIFFERENCES IN TAX RATES BETWEEN JURISDICTIONS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AS OUR BUSINESS CHANGES AND PRE-TAX EARNINGS SHIFT FROM YEAR TO YEAR. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2015 WAS 20.8%. THE 5.1 PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2016 COMPARED TO 2015 IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO A LOSS ON OUR INVESTMENT IN AVILA, OFFSET BY A NON-DEDUCTIBLE PRE-TAX CHARGE RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF ACETYLON AND NON-RECURRING CHARGES TO TAX EXPENSE RECORDED IN 2015 RELATED TO BOTH THE GLOBAL MIX OF FUNDING SOURCES FOR PAYMENTS TO COLLABORATION PARTNERS, PRIMARILY THE INITIATION OF OUR COLLABORATIONS WITH ASTRAZENECA PLC (ASTRAZENECA) AND JUNO, AND AN INCREASE IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OBTAINED IN OUR ACQUISITION OF RECEPTOS, INC.

THE 6.7 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2015 COMPARED TO 2014 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO THE GLOBAL MIX OF FUNDING SOURCES FOR PAYMENTS TO COLLABORATION PARTNERS, PRIMARILY THE INITIATION OF OUR COLLABORATIONS WITH ASTRAZENECA AND JUNO, AND AN INCREASE IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OBTAINED IN OUR ACQUISITION OF RECEPTOS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NON-RECURRING TAX EXPENSE RECORDED IN 2014 RELATED TO THE LAUNCH OF NEW PRODUCTS.ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE NO. 2016-09, "COMPENSATION-STOCK COMPENSATION" (ASU 2016-09) CHANGES SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING REQUIRING ALL EXCESS TAX BENEFITS AND TAX DEFICIENCIES TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME TAX PROVISION. THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US ON JANUARY 1, 2017. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE NEW STANDARD WILL HAVE A FAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2017. THE AMOUNT OF THE REDUCTION TO OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WILL DEPEND UPON FUTURE MOVEMENTS IN OUR SHARE PRICE AS WELL AS THE MAGNITUDE OF STOCK AWARD EXERCISES, WHICH ARE BOTH DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. SEE NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD UPDATE.IN ADDITION TO OUR FUTURE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-09, OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE CAN BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED BY SHIFTS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRE-TAX INCOME AMONG THE JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE OPERATE, AS WELL AS PAYMENTS TO COLLABORATION PARTNERS, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, AUDIT SETTLEMENTS, AND MANY OTHER FACTORS WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST.NET INCOME: NET INCOME AND PER COMMON SHARE AMOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014 WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA):THE $397.2 MILLION INCREASE IN NET INCOME TO $1.999 BILLION IN 2016 COMPARED TO 2015 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF NET PRODUCT SALES AND A $601.9 MILLION REDUCTION IN COLLABORATION-RELATED EXPENSES, PARTLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN OTHER EXPENSES, INCLUDING $892.9 MILLION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSET ACQUISITION EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASES OF ENGMAB, ACETYLON AND TRIPHASE, $345.3 MILLION OF INCREASED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO STRATEGIC EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WHICH INCLUDED $272.2 MILLION RELATED TO OUR EQUITY INVESTMENT IN JUNO, AN INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES PRIMARILY DUE TO A $198.5 MILLION LITIGATION-RELATED LOSS CONTINGENCY ACCRUAL EXPENSE, AND AN $83.1 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO THE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM OBTAINED IN OUR 2012 ACQUISITION OF AVILA.43THE $397.9 MILLION DECREASE IN NET INCOME TO $1.602 BILLION IN 2015 COMPARED TO 2014 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION RELATED EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDED UPFRONT EXPENSES OF $575.1 MILLION, $450.0 MILLION, AND $149.8 MILLION FOR OUR COLLABORATIONS WITH JUNO, ASTRAZENECA AND NURIX, RESPECTIVELY, AS WELL AS $400.4 MILLION OF EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION AND OPERATIONS OF RECEPTOS. THE INCREASED COLLABORATION AND ACQUISITION RELATED EXPENSES IN 2015 WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET PRODUCT SALES AS WELL AS AN $85.9 MILLION REALIZED GAIN ON THE SALE OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENT IN FLEXUS BIOSCIENCES, INC. IN APRIL 2015. THE $0.45 DECREASE IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN 2015 COMPARED TO 2014 WAS FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY THE REPURCHASE OF 28.1 MILLION COMMON SHARES UNDER OUR COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, REDUCING OUR OUTSTANDING SHARE BASE.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESTHE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE COMPONENTS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014 (IN MILLIONS):1INCLUDES CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET OF ALLOWANCES, INVENTORY AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, LESS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES, AND INCOME TAXES PAYABLE.WE RELY PRIMARILY ON POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND BORROWINGS IN THE FORM OF LONG-TERM NOTES PAYABLE AND SHORT-TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER TO PROVIDE FOR OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. WE EXPECT CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR EXPENDITURES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TRIALS, COMMERCIALIZATION OF NEW PRODUCTS, INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND EXISTING SOURCES OF AND ACCESS TO FINANCING ARE ADEQUATE TO FUND OUR OPERATING NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AND OUR PLANS TO PURCHASE OUR STOCK AND PURSUE STRATEGIC BUSINESS INITIATIVES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE HELD INTERNATIONALLY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, WE HELD APPROXIMATELY $6.113 BILLION OF THESE SHORT-TERM FUNDS IN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS. THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS HELD IN U.S. TAX JURISDICTIONS CAN FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS FOR OTHER REASONS, SUCH AS REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, INTERNAL REORGANIZATIONS, BUSINESS-DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND DEBT ISSUANCES. AS PART OF OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY ASSESSMENTS, WE REGULARLY MONITOR THE MIX OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CASH FLOWS (BOTH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS). REPATRIATION OF OVERSEAS FUNDS CAN RESULT IN ADDITIONAL U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAX PAYMENTS. WE RECORD U.S. DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES FOR CERTAIN UNREMITTED EARNINGS, BUT WHEN AMOUNTS EARNED OVERSEAS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, NO ACCRUAL FOR U.S. TAXES IS PROVIDED. APPROXIMATELY $900.0 MILLION OF OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS, INCLUDED IN THE $6.113 BILLION OF SHORT-TERM FUNDS IN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS, MAY NOT BE REQUIRED FOR USE IN OFFSHORE OPERATIONS AND MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR USE IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE EARNINGS ARE NOT TREATED AS PERMANENTLY REINVESTED AND ACCORDINGLY, OUR DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015 INCLUDED $316.5 MILLION FOR THE ESTIMATED U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAXES THAT MAY BE INCURRED SHOULD THESE EARNINGS BE REPATRIATED. THE REMAINING FOREIGN EARNINGS ARE UNREMITTED AND EXPECTED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE DO NOT RELY ON THESE EARNINGS AS A SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR OUR DOMESTIC BUSINESS AS WE EXPECT TO HAVE SUFFICIENT CURRENT CASH RESOURCES COMBINED WITH FUTURE CASH FLOWS IN THE UNITED STATES TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC NEEDS.44SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM: IN JUNE 2016, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED AN INCREASE OF $3.000 BILLION TO OUR AUTHORIZED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, BRINGING THE TOTAL AMOUNT AUTHORIZED SINCE APRIL 2009 TO AN AGGREGATE OF UP TO $20.500 BILLION OF OUR COMMON STOCK OF WHICH WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $4.731 BILLION REMAINING FOR FUTURE SHARE REPURCHASES.

ALL LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND ALL INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. THE $1.418 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 COMPARED TO 2015 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $3.976 BILLION OF NET CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $2.160 BILLION OF PAYMENTS UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND $562.5 MILLION OF NET UNREALIZED HOLDING LOSSES ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE.MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. FOR MORE INFORMATION RELATED TO THE FAIR VALUE AND VALUATION OF OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES, SEE NOTE 4 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET INCREASED BY $199.7 MILLION TO $1.621 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 2015. SALES MADE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES TYPICALLY HAVE PAYMENT TERMS THAT ARE GREATER THAN 60 DAYS, THEREBY EXTENDING COLLECTION PERIODS BEYOND THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE EXPECT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE TO GROW AS OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES CONTINUE TO EXPAND.WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES, THE SOVEREIGN DEBT SITUATION IN CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND ASSOCIATED IMPACTS ON THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OUR BUSINESS. OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL IN THESE MARKETS IS TYPICALLY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO PRINCIPALLY GOVERNMENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED HOSPITALS, WHICH IN TURN DIRECTLY DELIVER CRITICAL CARE TO PATIENTS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE USED TO TREAT LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES AND WE BELIEVE THIS BUSINESS MODEL ENABLES TIMELY DELIVERY AND ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS. MANY OF THE OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE RELATED TO GOVERNMENT-FUNDED HOSPITALS AND WE BELIEVE THE RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE ULTIMATELY COLLECTIBLE. SIMILARLY, WE BELIEVE THAT FUTURE SALES TO THESE CUSTOMERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE COLLECTIBLE.INVENTORY: INVENTORY BALANCES INCREASED BY $54.5 MILLION TO $497.9 MILLION AT THE END OF 2016 COMPARED TO 2015. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN ABRAXANE® RAW MATERIALS.OTHER CURRENT ASSETS: OTHER CURRENT ASSETS DECREASED BY $205.4 MILLION TO $779.3 MILLION AT THE END OF 2016 COMPARED TO 2015 DUE TO A $47.7 MILLION DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RECORDED AS OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, A $115.5 MILLION DECREASE IN PREPAID TAXES AND A $42.2 MILLION NET DECREASE IN OTHER ACCOUNTS.COMMERCIAL PAPER: WE HAVE A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM (PROGRAM) UNDER WHICH WE ISSUE UNSECURED COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES (COMMERCIAL PAPER) ON A PRIVATE PLACEMENT BASIS, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH ARE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.

THE DECREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE 2015 ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT WHICH PROVIDED $7.913 BILLION.NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY $5.002 BILLION IN 2015 COMPARED TO 2014. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE $5.443 BILLION INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE $513.9 MILLION RE-PAYMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSTHE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016 (IN MILLIONS):1 THE SENIOR NOTE OBLIGATION AMOUNTS INCLUDE FUTURE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS FOR BOTH CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT OBLIGATIONS.SENIOR NOTES: IN AUGUST 2015, WE ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL $8.000 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $1.000 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2.125% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2018, $1.500 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2.875% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2020, $1.000 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.550% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2022, $2.500 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.875% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2025 AND $2.000 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 5.000% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2045.IN MAY 2014, WE ISSUED A TOTAL OF $2.500 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2.250% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2019, $1.000 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.625% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2024 AND $1.000 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 4.625% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2044.

THE NON-CANCELABLE LEASE TERMS FOR OPERATING LEASES EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES BETWEEN 2017 AND 2025 AND INCLUDE RENEWAL OPTIONS. IN GENERAL, WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE LESSORS FOR REAL ESTATE TAXES, INSURANCE, UTILITIES, MAINTENANCE AND OTHER OPERATING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEASES. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE MAJOR FACILITIES THAT WE OCCUPY UNDER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS REFER TO PART I, ITEM 2. "PROPERTIES" OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS: OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS OF $238.2 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016 PRIMARILY INCLUDED $172.2 MILLION IN CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPLY CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE COMMITTED TO INVEST AN AGGREGATE $66.0 MILLION IN INVESTMENT FUNDS, WHICH ARE CALLABLE AT ANY TIME.COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS AND ACQUIRED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSETS: WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES AND HAVE ACQUIRED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSETS FROM THIRD PARTIES WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE MILESTONE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED DEVELOPMENTAL, REGULATORY AND/OR COMMERCIAL TARGETS. OUR OBLIGATION TO FUND THESE EFFORTS IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROGRAMS AND/OR THE LACK OF ANY ADVERSE EVENTS WHICH COULD CAUSE THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE PROGRAMS. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE ATTAINMENT OF SPECIFIED DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY APPROVAL AND SALES-BASED MILESTONES 47OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND ACCORDINGLY, NO AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED FOR THESE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015 CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. POTENTIAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS (NOT INCLUDING POTENTIAL ROYALTY PAYMENTS) TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $8.568 BILLION, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $4.006 BILLION CONTINGENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF VARIOUS RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES AND APPROXIMATELY $4.562 BILLION IN SALES-BASED MILESTONES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSETS, SEE NOTE 17 AND NOTE 2, RESPECTIVELY, OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSFOR A DISCUSSION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS PLEASE SEE NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IS ONE THAT IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENT'S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL:REVENUE RECOGNITION: REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS OF THE PRODUCT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER AND THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED AND DETERMINABLE. PROVISIONS FOR DISCOUNTS, EARLY PAYMENTS, REBATES, SALES RETURNS AND DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS UNDER TERMS CUSTOMARY IN THE INDUSTRY ARE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SAME PERIOD THE RELATED SALES ARE RECORDED. WE RECORD ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SALE. THE ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR SUCH VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES ARE BASED ON THE SALES TERMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND TREND ANALYSIS.WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM ROYALTIES BASED ON LICENSEES' SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS USING OUR TECHNOLOGIES. ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACT TERMS WHEN ROYALTIES FROM LICENSEES CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED. IF ROYALTIES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR COLLECTABILITY OF A ROYALTY AMOUNT IS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED, ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE CASH IS RECEIVED.GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® AND THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENE® ARE DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY SUBJECT TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY.SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF THE REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE ALSO ANALYZE ACTUAL BILLINGS RECEIVED FROM THE STATES TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE ACCRUAL RATES. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ADJUST THE REBATE ACCRUALS AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND TO REFLECT ACTUAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE. MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT’S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL INVOICES. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS GOVERNMENT-48SPONSORED PROGRAMS REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES.REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE RECORD A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY. CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE INCLUDED IN CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS AND ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA.ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: WE ESTIMATE AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, HISTORICAL PAYMENT PATTERNS, AGING OF RECEIVABLE BALANCES AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF COUNTRIES THEMSELVES AND PROVINCES OR AREAS WITHIN SUCH COUNTRIES WHERE THEY ARE THE ULTIMATE CUSTOMERS.INCOME TAXES: WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. WE PROVIDE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED.WE ACCOUNT FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS PART OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THESE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATE PRIMARILY TO ISSUES COMMON AMONG MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE APPLY A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES WHICH INCLUDE STUDIES PERFORMED BY INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS, ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY AND SUBJECT EXPERTS, EVALUATION OF PUBLIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. WE PROVIDE ESTIMATES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. IF OUR ESTIMATES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ACTUAL OUTCOMES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED.WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE A PORTION WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR RECENT CUMULATIVE EARNINGS EXPERIENCE BY TAXING JURISDICTION, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, CARRYFORWARD PERIODS AVAILABLE TO US FOR TAX REPORTING PURPOSES, VARIOUS INCOME TAX STRATEGIES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT AND, TO THE EXTENT FUTURE EXPECTATIONS CHANGE, WE WOULD HAVE TO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THAT TIME. AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES.SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION: WE UTILIZE SHARE BASED COMPENSATION IN THE FORM OF STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, OR RSUS, AND PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, OR PSUS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARDS AT GRANT DATE. COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED REFLECTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF AWARDS EXPECTED TO VEST AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AN ESTIMATE OF AWARD FORFEITURES BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE VESTING PERIOD REQUIRED TO OBTAIN FULL VESTING. MANAGEMENT EXPECTATIONS RELATED TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PERFORMANCE GOALS ASSOCIATED WITH PSU GRANTS IS ASSESSED REGULARLY AND THAT ASSESSMENT IS USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER PSU GRANTS ARE EXPECTED TO VEST. IF PERFORMANCE-BASED MILESTONES RELATED TO PSU GRANTS ARE NOT MET OR NOT EXPECTED TO BE MET, ANY COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED TO DATE ASSOCIATED WITH GRANTS THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO VEST WILL BE REVERSED.OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES: A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF ANY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY BELOW ITS COST THAT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN CARRYING AMOUNT TO FAIR VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT IS CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AND A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE SECURITY ESTABLISHED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INCLUDE: SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE ISSUER'S EARNINGS PERFORMANCE, CREDIT RATING, ASSET QUALITY, BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE ISSUER OPERATES, LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW OUR COST, OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE 49SECURITY, OUR INTENT NOT TO SELL, AN EVALUATION AS TO WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO SELL BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR COST BASIS, AND ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ISSUER'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD DIFFER FROM OUR ASSESSMENT.DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES: ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN CURRENT EARNINGS OR OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), DEPENDING ON WHETHER A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION AND, IF IT IS, THE TYPE OF HEDGING TRANSACTION. FOR A DERIVATIVE TO QUALIFY AS A HEDGE AT INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE HEDGED PERIOD, WE FORMALLY DOCUMENT THE NATURE AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEM. WE ASSESS, BOTH AT INCEPTION AND ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING TRANSACTIONS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING THE CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS. WE ASSESS HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND RECORD THE GAIN OR LOSS RELATED TO THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IF ANY, TO CURRENT EARNINGS. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER PROBABLE OF OCCURRING, WE DISCONTINUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING AND ANY RELATED UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE NOT DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION, TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE, OUR STOCK PRICE AND INTEREST RATES. THE USE OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE EXPOSURE OF THESE RISKS WITH THE INTENT TO REDUCE OUR RISK OR COST.INVESTMENTS IN OTHER ENTITIES: WE HOLD A PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER EITHER THE EQUITY METHOD OR COST METHOD. INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES OR CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS OVER WHICH WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD, WITH OUR SHARE OF EARNINGS OR LOSSES REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES OF COMPANIES THAT BECOME PUBLICLY TRADED ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES PROSPECTIVELY FROM THE DATE OF SUCH COMPANIES' INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING.OUR COST METHOD AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.ALL INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT. IF AN INVESTMENT'S FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN ITS NET CARRYING VALUE AND THE DECLINE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE. SUCH AN EVALUATION IS JUDGMENTAL AND DEPENDENT ON SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE HAS OCCURRED INCLUDE: MARKET VALUE OR EXIT PRICE OF THE INVESTMENT BASED ON EITHER MARKET-QUOTED PRICES OR FUTURE ROUNDS OF FINANCING BY THE INVESTEE; LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE MARKET VALUE WAS BELOW ITS COST BASIS; FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE INVESTEE; OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT; ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INVESTEE'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN; ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE MAY BE AWARE OF RELATED TO THE INVESTMENT.ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, OR LTIP, DESIGNED TO PROVIDE KEY OFFICERS AND EXECUTIVES WITH PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES CONTINGENT UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED CORPORATE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES COVERING A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, WE HAD RECORDED LIABILITIES FOR THREE SEPARATE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLES RUNNING CONCURRENTLY AND ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2017 AND 2018. PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR EACH OF THE PERFORMANCE CYCLES ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS: 37.5% ON NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE (AS DEFINED IN THE LTIP); 37.5% ON TOTAL NON-GAAP REVENUE (AS DEFINED IN THE LTIP); AND 25% ON RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, WHICH IS A MEASUREMENT OF OUR STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE DURING THE APPLICABLE THREE-YEAR PERIOD COMPARED WITH A GROUP OF OTHER COMPANIES IN THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.THRESHOLD, TARGET AND MAXIMUM CASH PAYOUT LEVELS ARE CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE BETWEEN 0% TO 200% OF EACH PARTICIPANT’S BASE SALARY AT THE TIME THE LTIP WAS APPROVED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE. SUCH AWARDS ARE PAYABLE IN CASH OR COMMON STOCK OR A MIXTURE OF CASH AND COMMON STOCK, WHICH WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AT THE TIME OF AWARD DELIVERY. SHARE-BASED PAYOUT LEVELS ARE CALCULATED USING THE CASH-BASED THRESHOLD, TARGET AND MAXIMUM LEVELS, DIVIDED BY THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE OF CELGENE STOCK FOR THE 30 TRADING DAYS PRIOR TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF EACH PERFORMANCE CYCLE. THEREFORE, FINAL SHARE-BASED AWARD VALUES ARE REFLECTIVE OF THE STOCK PRICE AT THE END OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAY DETERMINE THAT PAYMENTS MADE IN COMMON STOCK ARE RESTRICTED FROM TRADING FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. WE ACCRUE THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE LIABILITY OVER EACH THREE-YEAR CYCLE. PRIOR TO THE END OF A THREE-YEAR CYCLE, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT DURING THE CYCLE. UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT EQUAL TO THEIR TARGET AWARD OR, IF HIGHER, AN AWARD BASED ON ACTUAL PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL.ACCRUALS RECORDED FOR THE LTIP ENTAIL MAKING CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE, NON-GAAP REVENUES AND RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, AS DEFINED; THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED. ACCRUALS FOR THE LTIP ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND REVISED ACCORDINGLY SO THAT THE LIABILITY RECORDED REFLECTS UPDATED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PAYOUTS. IN ESTIMATING THE ACCRUALS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DATE FOR THE 50PERFORMANCE PERIOD, EXPECTED RESULTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, OPERATING TRENDS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICING AND COMPETITION.VALUATION OF GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, OTHER ASSETS AND IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D): WE HAVE RECORDED GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IPR&D THROUGH ACQUISITIONS ACCOUNTED FOR AS BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. WHEN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS ARE ACQUIRED, WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS ARE TYPICALLY USED IN THESE VALUATIONS IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, AND THE MODELS REQUIRE THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:•PROJECTING REGULATORY APPROVALS;•ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM PRODUCT SALES RESULTING FROM COMPLETED PRODUCTS AND IN-PROCESS PROJECTS OR ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED; AND•DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES AND PROBABILITY RATES.GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT IS SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING. WE TEST OUR GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT BY ASSESSING QUALITATIVE FACTORS OR PERFORMING A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS IN DETERMINING WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ARE BELOW THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE AMORTIZED TO THEIR ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR. INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO IPR&D PRODUCT RIGHTS ARE TREATED AS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND NOT AMORTIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS APPROVED FOR SALE BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN SPECIFIED MARKETS. AT THAT TIME, WE WILL DETERMINE THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET, RECLASSIFY THE ASSET OUT OF IPR&D AND BEGIN AMORTIZATION. IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS ALSO PERFORMED AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. SUCH TEST ENTAILS COMPLETING AN UPDATED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE IPR&D ASSET. IF REQUIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES IS COMPLETED BY COMPARING AN UPDATED NON-DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO THE BOOK VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET. VALUATION OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION: WE RECORD CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION AT ITS FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE, AND FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT REPORTING PERIOD REVALUE THESE OBLIGATIONS AND RECORD INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPERATING EARNINGS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. CHANGES TO CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION OBLIGATIONS CAN RESULT FROM MOVEMENTS IN PUBLICLY TRADED SHARE PRICES OF CVRS, ADJUSTMENTS TO DISCOUNT RATES AND PERIODS, UPDATES IN THE ASSUMED ACHIEVEMENT OR TIMING OF ANY DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES OR CHANGES IN THE PROBABILITY OF CERTAIN CLINICAL EVENTS AND CHANGES IN THE ASSUMED PROBABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATORY APPROVAL. THE ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT AND ANY CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION EXPENSE RECORDED IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. OUR CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES WERE RECORDED IN THE ACQUISITIONS OF GLOUCESTER, ABRAXIS, AVILA, NOGRA, AND QUANTICEL. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE GLOUCESTER, AVILA, NOGRA, AND QUANTICEL CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE DISCOUNT RATE, PROBABILITY AND ESTIMATED TIMING OF CASH MILESTONE PAYMENTS TO THE FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OF EACH BUSINESS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ABRAXIS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY IS BASED ON THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS.51ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKTHE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES FORWARD-LOOKING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RISK OF LOSS IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES, CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE EARNINGS.WE HAVE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, OUR MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS CONSISTED OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, OUR LONG-TERM DEBT AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE CONSISTED OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED (MBS) SECURITIES, GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, ASSET BACKED SECURITIES, TIME DEPOSITS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MBS INCLUDE MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION AND THE GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION. CORPORATE DEBT – GLOBAL INCLUDES OBLIGATIONS ISSUED BY INVESTMENT-GRADE CORPORATIONS INCLUDING SOME ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN GUARANTEED BY GOVERNMENTS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. ASSET BACKED SECURITIES CONSIST OF TRIPLE-A RATED SECURITIES WITH CASH FLOWS COLLATERALIZED BY CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND AUTO LOANS.OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE PRIMARILY EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN THE PUBLICLY TRADED COMMON STOCK OF COMPANIES, INCLUDING COMMON STOCK OF COMPANIES WITH WHOM WE HAVE ENTERED INTO COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE INVEST IN DEBT SECURITIES THAT ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO DEBT SECURITIES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO EQUITY SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET.AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, FAIR VALUES AND RELATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES, EXCLUDING TIME DEPOSITS, CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS):DEBT OBLIGATIONSSHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT: WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING SHORT-TERM BORROWING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016 OR DECEMBER 31, 2015. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015 INCLUDES (IN MILLIONS):52LONG-TERM DEBT: OUR OUTSTANDING SENIOR NOTES WITH MATURITY DATES IN EXCESS OF ONE YEAR AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2016 HAVE AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $13.750 BILLION WITH VARYING MATURITY DATES AND INTEREST RATES. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS AND CARRYING VALUES OF THESE SENIOR NOTES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016 ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW (IN MILLIONS):AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SENIOR NOTES OUTSTANDING WAS $14.572 BILLION. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENTOUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN BE IMPACTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES. WE ACTIVELY MANAGE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE AND INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS THROUGH OPERATIONAL MEANS AND THROUGH THE USE OF VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. IN INSTANCES WHERE THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OR FAIR VALUE HEDGES WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME TERMINATE THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP. IF A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED WE GENERALLY EITHER SETTLE THE INSTRUMENT OR ENTER INTO AN OFFSETTING INSTRUMENT.FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENTWE MAINTAIN A FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS, TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.THROUGH OUR REVENUE HEDGING PROGRAM, WE ENDEAVOR TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF POSSIBLE UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON OUR FUTURE U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS THAT ARE DERIVED FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, TYPICALLY WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS, WITH A MAXIMUM OF FIVE YEARS. WE MANAGE OUR ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION EXPOSURE PRINCIPALLY WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, A COMBINATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY PUT AND CALL OPTIONS, AND OCCASIONALLY PURCHASED FOREIGN CURRENCY PUT OPTIONS.FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS: WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, MANAGE EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY IN THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS, AND REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.WE MANAGE A PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PROTECT AGAINST CHANGES IN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 53AND DECEMBER 31, 2015 HAD SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 31 MONTHS AND 36 MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY. THE SPOT RATE COMPONENTS OF THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AND, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI) AND RECLASSIFIED TO OPERATIONS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS. IF A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED WITH RESPECT TO A FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACT, ACCUMULATED GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACT REMAIN IN OCI UNTIL THE HEDGED FORECASTED TRANSACTION OCCURS AND ARE RECLASSIFIED TO OPERATIONS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. ANY INEFFECTIVENESS ON THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IS REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. THE FORWARD POINT COMPONENTS OF THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AND ALL FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS OF FORWARD POINT AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES WERE AS FOLLOWS AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015 (IN MILLIONS):WE CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF OUR OWN AND THE COUNTERPARTIES’ CREDIT RISK ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO EXECUTE ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONTRACT ON AN ONGOING BASIS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, CREDIT RISK DID NOT MATERIALLY CHANGE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS.WE ALSO MANAGE A PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN RECOGNIZED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE RELATED TO TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND, ACCORDINGLY, ANY CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD NON-DESIGNATED HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015 WERE $933.8 MILLION AND $920.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, WE BELIEVE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS A REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES. ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2016 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WOULD CHANGE BY APPROXIMATELY $336.8 MILLION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS EITHER HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES OR RELATE TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE ENTITIES' FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE EITHER REPORTED IN OCI AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS OR RE-MEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR LIABILITY.FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS: FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE BY UTILIZING A STRATEGY THAT INVOLVES BOTH A PURCHASED LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTION AND A WRITTEN LOCAL CURRENCY CALL OPTION THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS HEDGES OF FUTURE SALES DENOMINATED IN THAT LOCAL CURRENCY. SPECIFICALLY, WE SELL (OR WRITE) A LOCAL CURRENCY CALL OPTION AND PURCHASE A LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTION WITH THE SAME EXPIRATION DATES AND LOCAL CURRENCY NOTIONAL AMOUNTS BUT WITH DIFFERENT STRIKE PRICES. THIS COMBINATION OF TRANSACTIONS IS GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS A “COLLAR.” THE EXPIRATION DATES AND NOTIONAL AMOUNTS CORRESPOND TO THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY SALES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015 HAD SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 48 MONTHS AND 36 MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS RELATIVE TO THE CURRENCY OF THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED SALES, THE PURCHASED PUT OPTION VALUE REDUCES TO ZERO AND WE BENEFIT FROM THE INCREASE IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF OUR ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS; HOWEVER, THIS BENEFIT WOULD BE CAPPED AT THE STRIKE LEVEL OF THE WRITTEN CALL, WHICH FORMS THE UPPER END OF THE COLLAR. THE PREMIUM COLLECTED FROM THE SALE OF THE CALL OPTION IS EQUAL TO THE PREMIUM PAID FOR THE PURCHASED PUT OPTION, RESULTING IN A NET ZERO COST FOR EACH COLLAR. 54OUTSTANDING FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE WERE AS FOLLOWS AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015:1 U.S. DOLLAR NOTIONAL AMOUNTS ARE CALCULATED AS THE HEDGED LOCAL CURRENCY AMOUNT MULTIPLIED BY THE STRIKE VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION. THE LOCAL CURRENCY NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF OUR PURCHASED PUT AND WRITTEN CALL THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE EQUAL TO EACH OTHER.WE ALSO HAVE ENTERED INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY PUT OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE WHICH WERE NOT PART OF A COLLAR STRATEGY. SUCH PUT OPTION CONTRACTS HAD A NOTIONAL VALUE OF $386.8 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 24 MONTHS.ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2016 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS WOULD INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $153.4 MILLION IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WERE TO STRENGTHEN AND DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $139.0 MILLION IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WERE TO WEAKEN. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS.INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENTFORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND TREASURY RATE LOCKS: IN ANTICIPATION OF ISSUING FIXED-RATE DEBT, WE MAY USE FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS (FORWARD STARTING SWAPS) OR TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS (TREASURY RATE LOCKS) THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES TO HEDGE AGAINST CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES THAT COULD IMPACT EXPECTED FUTURE ISSUANCES OF DEBT. TO THE EXTENT THESE HEDGES OF CASH FLOWS RELATED TO ANTICIPATED DEBT ARE EFFECTIVE, ANY REALIZED OR UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE FORWARD STARTING SWAPS OR TREASURY RATE LOCKS ARE REPORTED IN OCI AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME OVER THE LIFE OF THE ANTICIPATED FIXED-RATE NOTES.DURING 2014, WE ENTERED INTO FORWARD STARTING SWAPS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES TO HEDGE AGAINST CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES THAT COULD IMPACT AN ANTICIPATED ISSUANCE OF DEBT IN 2015. DURING 2015, WE ENTERED INTO ADDITIONAL FORWARD STARTING SWAPS AND TREASURY RATE LOCKS. FORWARD STARTING SWAPS AND TREASURY RATE LOCKS WITH A COMBINED AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $2.900 BILLION WERE SETTLED UPON THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT IN AUGUST 2015, WHEN THE NET FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD STARTING SWAPS AND TREASURY RATE LOCKS IN ACCUMULATED OCI WAS IN A LOSS POSITION OF $21.6 MILLION. THE NET LOSS WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIFE OF THE ASSOCIATED SENIOR NOTES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015, WE HAD OUTSTANDING FORWARD STARTING SWAPS WITH EFFECTIVE DATES IN 2017 AND 2018 AND MATURING IN TEN YEARS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS AS SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW: NOTIONAL AMOUNT DECEMBER 31, 2016 DECEMBER 31, 2015FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS: FORWARD STARTING SWAPS WITH EFFECTIVE DATES IN 2017$500.0 $200.0FORWARD STARTING SWAPS WITH EFFECTIVE DATES IN 2018$500.0 $—A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO MEASURE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS FROM A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES INDICATED THAT A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR CONTRACTS BY $80.2 MILLION. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 WOULD HAVE DECREASED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR CONTRACTS BY $90.4 MILLION.INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS: FROM TIME TO TIME WE HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN DEBT OBLIGATIONS THROUGH THE USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. THE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED HEDGES OF THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE NOTES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. SINCE THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE SWAP ARE INTENDED TO MATCH THOSE OF THE DEBT BEING HEDGED, IT IS ASSUMED TO BE A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE HEDGE AND ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP ARE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WITH NO NET IMPACT RECORDED IN INCOME. ANY NET INTEREST PAYMENTS MADE OR RECEIVED ON INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST EXPENSE. IF A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED FOR AN INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACT, ACCUMULATED GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACT ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OR INCREASE OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY HEDGED DEBT OBLIGATIONS.55WE HAD ENTERED INTO SWAP CONTRACTS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF CERTAIN OF OUR FIXED RATE NOTES AND ALSO TERMINATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP BY SETTLING CERTAIN OF THOSE SWAP CONTRACTS DURING 2016 AND 2015. IN JULY 2016, WE TERMINATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP ON ALL OF OUR THEN OUTSTANDING SWAP CONTRACTS, AMOUNTING TO $3.600 BILLION NOTIONAL AMOUNT, BY SETTLING SUCH SWAP CONTRACTS. THE SETTLEMENT OF SWAP CONTRACTS RESULTED IN THE RECEIPT OF NET PROCEEDS OF $195.6 MILLION AND $10.8 MILLION DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE NOTES. SEE NOTE 11 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO REDUCTIONS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE.A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO MEASURE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR DEBT AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS FROM A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES INDICATED THAT A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET PAYABLE BY $992.5 MILLION. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET PAYABLE BY $1.151 BILLION.56ITEM 7.

OTEZLA® WAS APPROVED FOR PLAQUE PSORIASIS AND PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS IN THE EU IN JANUARY 2015. LAUNCH ACTIVITIES FOR OTEZLA® COMMENCED IN MARCH 2014 AND WE BEGAN RECOGNIZING REVENUE RELATED TO OTEZLA® DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014. ABRAXANE® NET SALES INCREASED BY $5.9 MILLION, OR 0.6% TO $973.4 MILLION IN 2016 COMPARED TO 2015. U.S. SALES OF $633.8 MILLION AND INTERNATIONAL SALES OF $339.6 MILLION DECREASED 3.0 PERCENT AND INCREASED 8.2 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED UNIT SALES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PRICE DECREASES. THE DECREASE IN U.S. SALES WAS DUE TO VOLUME DECREASES PARTLY OFFSET BY PRICE INCREASES. THE DECREASE IN U.S. SALES REFLECTS THE INCREASED COMPETITION IN BREAST CANCER AND LUNG CANCER INDICATIONS FROM NEW MARKET ENTRANTS.NET SALES OF ABRAXANE® INCREASED BY $119.3 MILLION, OR 14.1%, TO $967.5 MILLION IN 2015 COMPARED TO 2014, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED UNIT VOLUMES IN BOTH THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS REFLECTING INCREASED ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRODUCT FOR THE TREATMENT OF BOTH METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE PANCREAS AND NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER (NSCLC).

THE "OTHER" NET PRODUCT SALES CATEGORY DECREASED BY $0.8 MILLION TO $8.4 MILLION IN 2015 COMPARED TO 2014. OTHER REVENUE: OTHER REVENUE DECREASED BY $50.3 MILLION TO $44.6 MILLION FOR 2016 COMPARED TO 2015 PRIMARILY DUE TO A $36.0 MILLION DECREASE IN ROYALTY REVENUE FROM NOVARTIS AG (NOVARTIS) BASED UPON ITS SALES OF BOTH RITALIN® AND FOCALIN XR®, BOTH OF WHICH HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY GENERIC COMPETITION IN CERTAIN MARKETS AND WE EXPECT THAT TREND TO CONTINUE IN 2017. GENERIC COMPETITION ENTERED THE MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES FOR CERTAIN STRENGTHS OF FOCALIN XR IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013. OTHER REVENUE DECREASED BY $11.7 MILLION TO $94.9 MILLION FOR 2015 COMPARED TO 2014 PRIMARILY DUE TO A $14.1 MILLION DECREASE IN ROYALTY REVENUE.

GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES, SALES DISCOUNTS, GOVERNMENT REBATES, CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES.REVLIMID®, POMALYST® AND THALOMID® ARE DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES UNDER THE REVLIMID RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY (REMS), POMALYST REMS® AND THALOMID REMS® PROGRAMS, RESPECTIVELY. THESE ARE PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®, POMALYST® AND THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID®, THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENE® AND IMNOVID® ARE DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL AUTHORITIES’ SPECIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE FOR THE PRODUCT’S SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. OTEZLA®, ABRAXANE®, ISTODAX® AND VIDAZA® ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® AND THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENE®.WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. AS NOTED ABOVE, REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® AND THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENE® ARE DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY SUBJECT TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY. SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF THE REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE ALSO ANALYZE ACTUAL BILLINGS RECEIVED FROM THE STATES TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE ACCRUAL RATES. MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT’S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL INVOICES. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES.REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE RECORD A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY.36CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2016 IS 15.7%. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS A FUNCTION OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRE-TAX INCOME AMONG THE MANY JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. OUR PRE-TAX INCOME IS EARNED AND TAXED IN EITHER THE U.S. AT A STATUTORY TAX RATE OF 35%, OR OUTSIDE THE U.S. AT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES. THE DIFFERENCES IN TAX RATES BETWEEN JURISDICTIONS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AS OUR BUSINESS CHANGES AND PRE-TAX EARNINGS SHIFT FROM YEAR TO YEAR. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2015 WAS 20.8%. THE 5.1 PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2016 COMPARED TO 2015 IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO A LOSS ON OUR INVESTMENT IN AVILA, OFFSET BY A NON-DEDUCTIBLE PRE-TAX CHARGE RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF ACETYLON AND NON-RECURRING CHARGES TO TAX EXPENSE RECORDED IN 2015 RELATED TO BOTH THE GLOBAL MIX OF FUNDING SOURCES FOR PAYMENTS TO COLLABORATION PARTNERS, PRIMARILY THE INITIATION OF OUR COLLABORATIONS WITH ASTRAZENECA PLC (ASTRAZENECA) AND JUNO, AND AN INCREASE IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OBTAINED IN OUR ACQUISITION OF RECEPTOS, INC.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2015 WAS 20.8%. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2014 WAS 14.1%. THE 6.7 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2015 COMPARED TO 2014 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO THE GLOBAL MIX OF FUNDING SOURCES FOR PAYMENTS TO COLLABORATION PARTNERS, PRIMARILY THE INITIATION OF OUR COLLABORATIONS WITH ASTRAZENECA AND JUNO, AND AN INCREASE IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OBTAINED IN OUR ACQUISITION OF RECEPTOS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NON-RECURRING TAX EXPENSE RECORDED IN 2014 RELATED TO THE LAUNCH OF NEW PRODUCTS.ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE NO. 2016-09, "COMPENSATION-STOCK COMPENSATION" (ASU 2016-09) CHANGES SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING REQUIRING ALL EXCESS TAX BENEFITS AND TAX DEFICIENCIES TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME TAX PROVISION. THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US ON JANUARY 1, 2017. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE NEW STANDARD WILL HAVE A FAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2017. THE AMOUNT OF THE REDUCTION TO OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WILL DEPEND UPON FUTURE MOVEMENTS IN OUR SHARE PRICE AS WELL AS THE MAGNITUDE OF STOCK AWARD EXERCISES, WHICH ARE BOTH DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. SEE NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD UPDATE.IN ADDITION TO OUR FUTURE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-09, OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE CAN BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED BY SHIFTS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRE-TAX INCOME AMONG THE JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE OPERATE, AS WELL AS PAYMENTS TO COLLABORATION PARTNERS, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, AUDIT SETTLEMENTS, AND MANY OTHER FACTORS WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST.NET INCOME: NET INCOME AND PER COMMON SHARE AMOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014 WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA):THE $397.2 MILLION INCREASE IN NET INCOME TO $1.999 BILLION IN 2016 COMPARED TO 2015 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF NET PRODUCT SALES AND A $601.9 MILLION REDUCTION IN COLLABORATION-RELATED EXPENSES, PARTLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN OTHER EXPENSES, INCLUDING $892.9 MILLION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSET ACQUISITION EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASES OF ENGMAB, ACETYLON AND TRIPHASE, $345.3 MILLION OF INCREASED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO STRATEGIC EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WHICH INCLUDED $272.2 MILLION RELATED TO OUR EQUITY INVESTMENT IN JUNO, AN INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES PRIMARILY DUE TO A $198.5 MILLION LITIGATION-RELATED LOSS CONTINGENCY ACCRUAL EXPENSE, AND AN $83.1 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO THE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM OBTAINED IN OUR 2012 ACQUISITION OF AVILA.43THE $397.9 MILLION DECREASE IN NET INCOME TO $1.602 BILLION IN 2015 COMPARED TO 2014 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION RELATED EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDED UPFRONT EXPENSES OF $575.1 MILLION, $450.0 MILLION, AND $149.8 MILLION FOR OUR COLLABORATIONS WITH JUNO, ASTRAZENECA AND NURIX, RESPECTIVELY, AS WELL AS $400.4 MILLION OF EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION AND OPERATIONS OF RECEPTOS. THE INCREASED COLLABORATION AND ACQUISITION RELATED EXPENSES IN 2015 WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET PRODUCT SALES AS WELL AS AN $85.9 MILLION REALIZED GAIN ON THE SALE OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENT IN FLEXUS BIOSCIENCES, INC. IN APRIL 2015. THE $0.45 DECREASE IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN 2015 COMPARED TO 2014 WAS FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY THE REPURCHASE OF 28.1 MILLION COMMON SHARES UNDER OUR COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, REDUCING OUR OUTSTANDING SHARE BASE.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESTHE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE COMPONENTS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014 (IN MILLIONS):1INCLUDES CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET OF ALLOWANCES, INVENTORY AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, LESS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES, AND INCOME TAXES PAYABLE.WE RELY PRIMARILY ON POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND BORROWINGS IN THE FORM OF LONG-TERM NOTES PAYABLE AND SHORT-TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER TO PROVIDE FOR OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. WE EXPECT CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR EXPENDITURES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TRIALS, COMMERCIALIZATION OF NEW PRODUCTS, INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND EXISTING SOURCES OF AND ACCESS TO FINANCING ARE ADEQUATE TO FUND OUR OPERATING NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AND OUR PLANS TO PURCHASE OUR STOCK AND PURSUE STRATEGIC BUSINESS INITIATIVES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE HELD INTERNATIONALLY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, WE HELD APPROXIMATELY $6.113 BILLION OF THESE SHORT-TERM FUNDS IN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS. THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS HELD IN U.S. TAX JURISDICTIONS CAN FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS FOR OTHER REASONS, SUCH AS REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, INTERNAL REORGANIZATIONS, BUSINESS-DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND DEBT ISSUANCES. AS PART OF OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY ASSESSMENTS, WE REGULARLY MONITOR THE MIX OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CASH FLOWS (BOTH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS). REPATRIATION OF OVERSEAS FUNDS CAN RESULT IN ADDITIONAL U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAX PAYMENTS. WE RECORD U.S. DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES FOR CERTAIN UNREMITTED EARNINGS, BUT WHEN AMOUNTS EARNED OVERSEAS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, NO ACCRUAL FOR U.S. TAXES IS PROVIDED. APPROXIMATELY $900.0 MILLION OF OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS, INCLUDED IN THE $6.113 BILLION OF SHORT-TERM FUNDS IN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS, MAY NOT BE REQUIRED FOR USE IN OFFSHORE OPERATIONS AND MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR USE IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE EARNINGS ARE NOT TREATED AS PERMANENTLY REINVESTED AND ACCORDINGLY, OUR DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015 INCLUDED $316.5 MILLION FOR THE ESTIMATED U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAXES THAT MAY BE INCURRED SHOULD THESE EARNINGS BE REPATRIATED. THE REMAINING FOREIGN EARNINGS ARE UNREMITTED AND EXPECTED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE DO NOT RELY ON THESE EARNINGS AS A SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR OUR DOMESTIC BUSINESS AS WE EXPECT TO HAVE SUFFICIENT CURRENT CASH RESOURCES COMBINED WITH FUTURE CASH FLOWS IN THE UNITED STATES TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC NEEDS.44SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM: IN JUNE 2016, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED AN INCREASE OF $3.000 BILLION TO OUR AUTHORIZED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, BRINGING THE TOTAL AMOUNT AUTHORIZED SINCE APRIL 2009 TO AN AGGREGATE OF UP TO $20.500 BILLION OF OUR COMMON STOCK OF WHICH WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $4.731 BILLION REMAINING FOR FUTURE SHARE REPURCHASES.

ALL LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND ALL INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. THE $1.418 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 COMPARED TO 2015 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $3.976 BILLION OF NET CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $2.160 BILLION OF PAYMENTS UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND $562.5 MILLION OF NET UNREALIZED HOLDING LOSSES ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE.MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET.

WE EXPECT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE TO GROW AS OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES CONTINUE TO EXPAND.WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES, THE SOVEREIGN DEBT SITUATION IN CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND ASSOCIATED IMPACTS ON THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OUR BUSINESS. OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL IN THESE MARKETS IS TYPICALLY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO PRINCIPALLY GOVERNMENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED HOSPITALS, WHICH IN TURN DIRECTLY DELIVER CRITICAL CARE TO PATIENTS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE USED TO TREAT LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES AND WE BELIEVE THIS BUSINESS MODEL ENABLES TIMELY DELIVERY AND ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS. MANY OF THE OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE RELATED TO GOVERNMENT-FUNDED HOSPITALS AND WE BELIEVE THE RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE ULTIMATELY COLLECTIBLE. SIMILARLY, WE BELIEVE THAT FUTURE SALES TO THESE CUSTOMERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE COLLECTIBLE.INVENTORY: INVENTORY BALANCES INCREASED BY $54.5 MILLION TO $497.9 MILLION AT THE END OF 2016 COMPARED TO 2015.

"PROPERTIES" OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS: OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS OF $238.2 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016 PRIMARILY INCLUDED $172.2 MILLION IN CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPLY CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE COMMITTED TO INVEST AN AGGREGATE $66.0 MILLION IN INVESTMENT FUNDS, WHICH ARE CALLABLE AT ANY TIME.COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS AND ACQUIRED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSETS: WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES AND HAVE ACQUIRED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSETS FROM THIRD PARTIES WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE MILESTONE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED DEVELOPMENTAL, REGULATORY AND/OR COMMERCIAL TARGETS. OUR OBLIGATION TO FUND THESE EFFORTS IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROGRAMS AND/OR THE LACK OF ANY ADVERSE EVENTS WHICH COULD CAUSE THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE PROGRAMS. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE ATTAINMENT OF SPECIFIED DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY APPROVAL AND SALES-BASED MILESTONES 47OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND ACCORDINGLY, NO AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED FOR THESE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015 CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. POTENTIAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS (NOT INCLUDING POTENTIAL ROYALTY PAYMENTS) TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $8.568 BILLION, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $4.006 BILLION CONTINGENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF VARIOUS RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES AND APPROXIMATELY $4.562 BILLION IN SALES-BASED MILESTONES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSETS, SEE NOTE 17 AND NOTE 2, RESPECTIVELY, OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSFOR A DISCUSSION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS PLEASE SEE NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IS ONE THAT IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENT'S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL:REVENUE RECOGNITION: REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS OF THE PRODUCT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER AND THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED AND DETERMINABLE. PROVISIONS FOR DISCOUNTS, EARLY PAYMENTS, REBATES, SALES RETURNS AND DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS UNDER TERMS CUSTOMARY IN THE INDUSTRY ARE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SAME PERIOD THE RELATED SALES ARE RECORDED. WE RECORD ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SALE. THE ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR SUCH VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES ARE BASED ON THE SALES TERMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND TREND ANALYSIS.WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM ROYALTIES BASED ON LICENSEES' SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS USING OUR TECHNOLOGIES. ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACT TERMS WHEN ROYALTIES FROM LICENSEES CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED. IF ROYALTIES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR COLLECTABILITY OF A ROYALTY AMOUNT IS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED, ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE CASH IS RECEIVED.GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® AND THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENE® ARE DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY SUBJECT TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY.SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF THE REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE ALSO ANALYZE ACTUAL BILLINGS RECEIVED FROM THE STATES TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE ACCRUAL RATES. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ADJUST THE REBATE ACCRUALS AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND TO REFLECT ACTUAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE. MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT’S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL INVOICES. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS GOVERNMENT-48SPONSORED PROGRAMS REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES.REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE RECORD A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY. CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE INCLUDED IN CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS AND ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA.ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: WE ESTIMATE AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, HISTORICAL PAYMENT PATTERNS, AGING OF RECEIVABLE BALANCES AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF COUNTRIES THEMSELVES AND PROVINCES OR AREAS WITHIN SUCH COUNTRIES WHERE THEY ARE THE ULTIMATE CUSTOMERS.INCOME TAXES: WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. WE PROVIDE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED.WE ACCOUNT FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS PART OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THESE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATE PRIMARILY TO ISSUES COMMON AMONG MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE APPLY A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES WHICH INCLUDE STUDIES PERFORMED BY INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS, ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY AND SUBJECT EXPERTS, EVALUATION OF PUBLIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. WE PROVIDE ESTIMATES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. IF OUR ESTIMATES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ACTUAL OUTCOMES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED.WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE A PORTION WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR RECENT CUMULATIVE EARNINGS EXPERIENCE BY TAXING JURISDICTION, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, CARRYFORWARD PERIODS AVAILABLE TO US FOR TAX REPORTING PURPOSES, VARIOUS INCOME TAX STRATEGIES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT AND, TO THE EXTENT FUTURE EXPECTATIONS CHANGE, WE WOULD HAVE TO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THAT TIME. AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES.SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION: WE UTILIZE SHARE BASED COMPENSATION IN THE FORM OF STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, OR RSUS, AND PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, OR PSUS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARDS AT GRANT DATE. COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED REFLECTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF AWARDS EXPECTED TO VEST AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AN ESTIMATE OF AWARD FORFEITURES BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE VESTING PERIOD REQUIRED TO OBTAIN FULL VESTING. MANAGEMENT EXPECTATIONS RELATED TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PERFORMANCE GOALS ASSOCIATED WITH PSU GRANTS IS ASSESSED REGULARLY AND THAT ASSESSMENT IS USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER PSU GRANTS ARE EXPECTED TO VEST. IF PERFORMANCE-BASED MILESTONES RELATED TO PSU GRANTS ARE NOT MET OR NOT EXPECTED TO BE MET, ANY COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED TO DATE ASSOCIATED WITH GRANTS THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO VEST WILL BE REVERSED.OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES: A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF ANY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY BELOW ITS COST THAT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN CARRYING AMOUNT TO FAIR VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT IS CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AND A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE SECURITY ESTABLISHED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INCLUDE: SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE ISSUER'S EARNINGS PERFORMANCE, CREDIT RATING, ASSET QUALITY, BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE ISSUER OPERATES, LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW OUR COST, OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE 49SECURITY, OUR INTENT NOT TO SELL, AN EVALUATION AS TO WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO SELL BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR COST BASIS, AND ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ISSUER'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD DIFFER FROM OUR ASSESSMENT.DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES: ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN CURRENT EARNINGS OR OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), DEPENDING ON WHETHER A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION AND, IF IT IS, THE TYPE OF HEDGING TRANSACTION. FOR A DERIVATIVE TO QUALIFY AS A HEDGE AT INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE HEDGED PERIOD, WE FORMALLY DOCUMENT THE NATURE AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEM. WE ASSESS, BOTH AT INCEPTION AND ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING TRANSACTIONS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING THE CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS. WE ASSESS HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND RECORD THE GAIN OR LOSS RELATED TO THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IF ANY, TO CURRENT EARNINGS. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER PROBABLE OF OCCURRING, WE DISCONTINUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING AND ANY RELATED UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE NOT DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION, TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE, OUR STOCK PRICE AND INTEREST RATES. THE USE OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE EXPOSURE OF THESE RISKS WITH THE INTENT TO REDUCE OUR RISK OR COST.INVESTMENTS IN OTHER ENTITIES: WE HOLD A PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER EITHER THE EQUITY METHOD OR COST METHOD. INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES OR CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS OVER WHICH WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD, WITH OUR SHARE OF EARNINGS OR LOSSES REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES OF COMPANIES THAT BECOME PUBLICLY TRADED ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES PROSPECTIVELY FROM THE DATE OF SUCH COMPANIES' INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING.OUR COST METHOD AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.ALL INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT. IF AN INVESTMENT'S FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN ITS NET CARRYING VALUE AND THE DECLINE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE. SUCH AN EVALUATION IS JUDGMENTAL AND DEPENDENT ON SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE HAS OCCURRED INCLUDE: MARKET VALUE OR EXIT PRICE OF THE INVESTMENT BASED ON EITHER MARKET-QUOTED PRICES OR FUTURE ROUNDS OF FINANCING BY THE INVESTEE; LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE MARKET VALUE WAS BELOW ITS COST BASIS; FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE INVESTEE; OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT; ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INVESTEE'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN; ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE MAY BE AWARE OF RELATED TO THE INVESTMENT.ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, OR LTIP, DESIGNED TO PROVIDE KEY OFFICERS AND EXECUTIVES WITH PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES CONTINGENT UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED CORPORATE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES COVERING A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, WE HAD RECORDED LIABILITIES FOR THREE SEPARATE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLES RUNNING CONCURRENTLY AND ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2017 AND 2018. PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR EACH OF THE PERFORMANCE CYCLES ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS: 37.5% ON NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE (AS DEFINED IN THE LTIP); 37.5% ON TOTAL NON-GAAP REVENUE (AS DEFINED IN THE LTIP); AND 25% ON RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, WHICH IS A MEASUREMENT OF OUR STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE DURING THE APPLICABLE THREE-YEAR PERIOD COMPARED WITH A GROUP OF OTHER COMPANIES IN THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.THRESHOLD, TARGET AND MAXIMUM CASH PAYOUT LEVELS ARE CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE BETWEEN 0% TO 200% OF EACH PARTICIPANT’S BASE SALARY AT THE TIME THE LTIP WAS APPROVED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE. SUCH AWARDS ARE PAYABLE IN CASH OR COMMON STOCK OR A MIXTURE OF CASH AND COMMON STOCK, WHICH WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AT THE TIME OF AWARD DELIVERY. SHARE-BASED PAYOUT LEVELS ARE CALCULATED USING THE CASH-BASED THRESHOLD, TARGET AND MAXIMUM LEVELS, DIVIDED BY THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE OF CELGENE STOCK FOR THE 30 TRADING DAYS PRIOR TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF EACH PERFORMANCE CYCLE. THEREFORE, FINAL SHARE-BASED AWARD VALUES ARE REFLECTIVE OF THE STOCK PRICE AT THE END OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAY DETERMINE THAT PAYMENTS MADE IN COMMON STOCK ARE RESTRICTED FROM TRADING FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. WE ACCRUE THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE LIABILITY OVER EACH THREE-YEAR CYCLE. PRIOR TO THE END OF A THREE-YEAR CYCLE, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT DURING THE CYCLE. UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT EQUAL TO THEIR TARGET AWARD OR, IF HIGHER, AN AWARD BASED ON ACTUAL PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL.ACCRUALS RECORDED FOR THE LTIP ENTAIL MAKING CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE, NON-GAAP REVENUES AND RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, AS DEFINED; THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED. ACCRUALS FOR THE LTIP ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND REVISED ACCORDINGLY SO THAT THE LIABILITY RECORDED REFLECTS UPDATED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PAYOUTS. IN ESTIMATING THE ACCRUALS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DATE FOR THE 50PERFORMANCE PERIOD, EXPECTED RESULTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, OPERATING TRENDS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICING AND COMPETITION.VALUATION OF GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, OTHER ASSETS AND IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D): WE HAVE RECORDED GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IPR&D THROUGH ACQUISITIONS ACCOUNTED FOR AS BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. WHEN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS ARE ACQUIRED, WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS ARE TYPICALLY USED IN THESE VALUATIONS IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, AND THE MODELS REQUIRE THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:•PROJECTING REGULATORY APPROVALS;•ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM PRODUCT SALES RESULTING FROM COMPLETED PRODUCTS AND IN-PROCESS PROJECTS OR ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED; AND•DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES AND PROBABILITY RATES.GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT IS SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING. WE TEST OUR GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT BY ASSESSING QUALITATIVE FACTORS OR PERFORMING A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS IN DETERMINING WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ARE BELOW THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE AMORTIZED TO THEIR ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR. INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO IPR&D PRODUCT RIGHTS ARE TREATED AS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND NOT AMORTIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS APPROVED FOR SALE BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN SPECIFIED MARKETS. AT THAT TIME, WE WILL DETERMINE THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET, RECLASSIFY THE ASSET OUT OF IPR&D AND BEGIN AMORTIZATION. IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS ALSO PERFORMED AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. SUCH TEST ENTAILS COMPLETING AN UPDATED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE IPR&D ASSET. IF REQUIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES IS COMPLETED BY COMPARING AN UPDATED NON-DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO THE BOOK VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET. VALUATION OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION: WE RECORD CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION AT ITS FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE, AND FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT REPORTING PERIOD REVALUE THESE OBLIGATIONS AND RECORD INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPERATING EARNINGS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. CHANGES TO CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION OBLIGATIONS CAN RESULT FROM MOVEMENTS IN PUBLICLY TRADED SHARE PRICES OF CVRS, ADJUSTMENTS TO DISCOUNT RATES AND PERIODS, UPDATES IN THE ASSUMED ACHIEVEMENT OR TIMING OF ANY DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES OR CHANGES IN THE PROBABILITY OF CERTAIN CLINICAL EVENTS AND CHANGES IN THE ASSUMED PROBABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATORY APPROVAL. THE ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT AND ANY CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION EXPENSE RECORDED IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. OUR CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES WERE RECORDED IN THE ACQUISITIONS OF GLOUCESTER, ABRAXIS, AVILA, NOGRA, AND QUANTICEL. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE GLOUCESTER, AVILA, NOGRA, AND QUANTICEL CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE DISCOUNT RATE, PROBABILITY AND ESTIMATED TIMING OF CASH MILESTONE PAYMENTS TO THE FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OF EACH BUSINESS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ABRAXIS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY IS BASED ON THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS.51ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKTHE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES FORWARD-LOOKING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RISK OF LOSS IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES, CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE EARNINGS.WE HAVE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, OUR MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS CONSISTED OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, OUR LONG-TERM DEBT AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE CONSISTED OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED (MBS) SECURITIES, GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, ASSET BACKED SECURITIES, TIME DEPOSITS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MBS INCLUDE MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION AND THE GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION. CORPORATE DEBT – GLOBAL INCLUDES OBLIGATIONS ISSUED BY INVESTMENT-GRADE CORPORATIONS INCLUDING SOME ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN GUARANTEED BY GOVERNMENTS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. ASSET BACKED SECURITIES CONSIST OF TRIPLE-A RATED SECURITIES WITH CASH FLOWS COLLATERALIZED BY CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND AUTO LOANS.OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE PRIMARILY EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN THE PUBLICLY TRADED COMMON STOCK OF COMPANIES, INCLUDING COMMON STOCK OF COMPANIES WITH WHOM WE HAVE ENTERED INTO COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE INVEST IN DEBT SECURITIES THAT ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO DEBT SECURITIES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO EQUITY SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET.AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, FAIR VALUES AND RELATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES, EXCLUDING TIME DEPOSITS, CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS):DEBT OBLIGATIONSSHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT: WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING SHORT-TERM BORROWING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016 OR DECEMBER 31, 2015. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015 INCLUDES (IN MILLIONS):52LONG-TERM DEBT: OUR OUTSTANDING SENIOR NOTES WITH MATURITY DATES IN EXCESS OF ONE YEAR AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2016 HAVE AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $13.750 BILLION WITH VARYING MATURITY DATES AND INTEREST RATES. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS AND CARRYING VALUES OF THESE SENIOR NOTES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016 ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW (IN MILLIONS):AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SENIOR NOTES OUTSTANDING WAS $14.572 BILLION. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENTOUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN BE IMPACTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES. WE ACTIVELY MANAGE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE AND INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS THROUGH OPERATIONAL MEANS AND THROUGH THE USE OF VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. IN INSTANCES WHERE THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OR FAIR VALUE HEDGES WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME TERMINATE THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP. IF A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED WE GENERALLY EITHER SETTLE THE INSTRUMENT OR ENTER INTO AN OFFSETTING INSTRUMENT.FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENTWE MAINTAIN A FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS, TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.THROUGH OUR REVENUE HEDGING PROGRAM, WE ENDEAVOR TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF POSSIBLE UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON OUR FUTURE U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS THAT ARE DERIVED FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, TYPICALLY WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS, WITH A MAXIMUM OF FIVE YEARS. WE MANAGE OUR ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION EXPOSURE PRINCIPALLY WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, A COMBINATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY PUT AND CALL OPTIONS, AND OCCASIONALLY PURCHASED FOREIGN CURRENCY PUT OPTIONS.FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS: WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, MANAGE EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY IN THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS, AND REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.WE MANAGE A PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PROTECT AGAINST CHANGES IN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 53AND DECEMBER 31, 2015 HAD SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 31 MONTHS AND 36 MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY. THE SPOT RATE COMPONENTS OF THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AND, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI) AND RECLASSIFIED TO OPERATIONS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS. IF A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED WITH RESPECT TO A FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACT, ACCUMULATED GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACT REMAIN IN OCI UNTIL THE HEDGED FORECASTED TRANSACTION OCCURS AND ARE RECLASSIFIED TO OPERATIONS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. ANY INEFFECTIVENESS ON THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IS REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. THE FORWARD POINT COMPONENTS OF THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AND ALL FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS OF FORWARD POINT AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES WERE AS FOLLOWS AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015 (IN MILLIONS):WE CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF OUR OWN AND THE COUNTERPARTIES’ CREDIT RISK ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO EXECUTE ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONTRACT ON AN ONGOING BASIS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, CREDIT RISK DID NOT MATERIALLY CHANGE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS.WE ALSO MANAGE A PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN RECOGNIZED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE RELATED TO TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND, ACCORDINGLY, ANY CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD NON-DESIGNATED HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015 WERE $933.8 MILLION AND $920.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, WE BELIEVE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS A REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES. ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2016 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WOULD CHANGE BY APPROXIMATELY $336.8 MILLION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS EITHER HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES OR RELATE TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE ENTITIES' FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE EITHER REPORTED IN OCI AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS OR RE-MEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR LIABILITY.FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS: FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE BY UTILIZING A STRATEGY THAT INVOLVES BOTH A PURCHASED LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTION AND A WRITTEN LOCAL CURRENCY CALL OPTION THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS HEDGES OF FUTURE SALES DENOMINATED IN THAT LOCAL CURRENCY. SPECIFICALLY, WE SELL (OR WRITE) A LOCAL CURRENCY CALL OPTION AND PURCHASE A LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTION WITH THE SAME EXPIRATION DATES AND LOCAL CURRENCY NOTIONAL AMOUNTS BUT WITH DIFFERENT STRIKE PRICES. THIS COMBINATION OF TRANSACTIONS IS GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS A “COLLAR.” THE EXPIRATION DATES AND NOTIONAL AMOUNTS CORRESPOND TO THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY SALES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015 HAD SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 48 MONTHS AND 36 MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS RELATIVE TO THE CURRENCY OF THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED SALES, THE PURCHASED PUT OPTION VALUE REDUCES TO ZERO AND WE BENEFIT FROM THE INCREASE IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF OUR ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS; HOWEVER, THIS BENEFIT WOULD BE CAPPED AT THE STRIKE LEVEL OF THE WRITTEN CALL, WHICH FORMS THE UPPER END OF THE COLLAR. THE PREMIUM COLLECTED FROM THE SALE OF THE CALL OPTION IS EQUAL TO THE PREMIUM PAID FOR THE PURCHASED PUT OPTION, RESULTING IN A NET ZERO COST FOR EACH COLLAR. 54OUTSTANDING FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE WERE AS FOLLOWS AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015:1 U.S. DOLLAR NOTIONAL AMOUNTS ARE CALCULATED AS THE HEDGED LOCAL CURRENCY AMOUNT MULTIPLIED BY THE STRIKE VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION. THE LOCAL CURRENCY NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF OUR PURCHASED PUT AND WRITTEN CALL THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE EQUAL TO EACH OTHER.WE ALSO HAVE ENTERED INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY PUT OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE WHICH WERE NOT PART OF A COLLAR STRATEGY. SUCH PUT OPTION CONTRACTS HAD A NOTIONAL VALUE OF $386.8 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 24 MONTHS.ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2016 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS WOULD INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $153.4 MILLION IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WERE TO STRENGTHEN AND DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $139.0 MILLION IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WERE TO WEAKEN. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS.INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENTFORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND TREASURY RATE LOCKS: IN ANTICIPATION OF ISSUING FIXED-RATE DEBT, WE MAY USE FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS (FORWARD STARTING SWAPS) OR TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS (TREASURY RATE LOCKS) THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES TO HEDGE AGAINST CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES THAT COULD IMPACT EXPECTED FUTURE ISSUANCES OF DEBT. TO THE EXTENT THESE HEDGES OF CASH FLOWS RELATED TO ANTICIPATED DEBT ARE EFFECTIVE, ANY REALIZED OR UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE FORWARD STARTING SWAPS OR TREASURY RATE LOCKS ARE REPORTED IN OCI AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME OVER THE LIFE OF THE ANTICIPATED FIXED-RATE NOTES.DURING 2014, WE ENTERED INTO FORWARD STARTING SWAPS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES TO HEDGE AGAINST CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES THAT COULD IMPACT AN ANTICIPATED ISSUANCE OF DEBT IN 2015. DURING 2015, WE ENTERED INTO ADDITIONAL FORWARD STARTING SWAPS AND TREASURY RATE LOCKS. FORWARD STARTING SWAPS AND TREASURY RATE LOCKS WITH A COMBINED AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $2.900 BILLION WERE SETTLED UPON THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT IN AUGUST 2015, WHEN THE NET FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD STARTING SWAPS AND TREASURY RATE LOCKS IN ACCUMULATED OCI WAS IN A LOSS POSITION OF $21.6 MILLION. THE NET LOSS WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIFE OF THE ASSOCIATED SENIOR NOTES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015, WE HAD OUTSTANDING FORWARD STARTING SWAPS WITH EFFECTIVE DATES IN 2017 AND 2018 AND MATURING IN TEN YEARS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS AS SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW: NOTIONAL AMOUNT DECEMBER 31, 2016 DECEMBER 31, 2015FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS: FORWARD STARTING SWAPS WITH EFFECTIVE DATES IN 2017$500.0 $200.0FORWARD STARTING SWAPS WITH EFFECTIVE DATES IN 2018$500.0 $—A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO MEASURE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS FROM A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES INDICATED THAT A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR CONTRACTS BY $80.2 MILLION. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 WOULD HAVE DECREASED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR CONTRACTS BY $90.4 MILLION.INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS: FROM TIME TO TIME WE HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN DEBT OBLIGATIONS THROUGH THE USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. THE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED HEDGES OF THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE NOTES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. SINCE THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE SWAP ARE INTENDED TO MATCH THOSE OF THE DEBT BEING HEDGED, IT IS ASSUMED TO BE A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE HEDGE AND ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP ARE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WITH NO NET IMPACT RECORDED IN INCOME. ANY NET INTEREST PAYMENTS MADE OR RECEIVED ON INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST EXPENSE. IF A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED FOR AN INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACT, ACCUMULATED GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACT ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OR INCREASE OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY HEDGED DEBT OBLIGATIONS.55WE HAD ENTERED INTO SWAP CONTRACTS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF CERTAIN OF OUR FIXED RATE NOTES AND ALSO TERMINATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP BY SETTLING CERTAIN OF THOSE SWAP CONTRACTS DURING 2016 AND 2015. IN JULY 2016, WE TERMINATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP ON ALL OF OUR THEN OUTSTANDING SWAP CONTRACTS, AMOUNTING TO $3.600 BILLION NOTIONAL AMOUNT, BY SETTLING SUCH SWAP CONTRACTS. THE SETTLEMENT OF SWAP CONTRACTS RESULTED IN THE RECEIPT OF NET PROCEEDS OF $195.6 MILLION AND $10.8 MILLION DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE NOTES. SEE NOTE 11 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO REDUCTIONS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE.A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO MEASURE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR DEBT AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS FROM A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES INDICATED THAT A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET PAYABLE BY $992.5 MILLION. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET PAYABLE BY $1.151 BILLION.56
