MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSEXECUTIVE SUMMARYCELGENE CORPORATION, TOGETHER WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY “WE,” “OUR,” “US,” “CELGENE” OR THE “COMPANY”), IS AN INTEGRATED GLOBAL BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY ENGAGED PRIMARILY IN THE DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF INNOVATIVE THERAPIES FOR THE TREATMENT OF CANCER AND INFLAMMATORY DISEASES THROUGH NEXT-GENERATION SOLUTIONS IN PROTEIN HOMEOSTASIS, IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY, EPIGENETICS, IMMUNOLOGY AND NEURO-INFLAMMATION. CELGENE CORPORATION WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE IN 1986.OUR PRIMARY COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS INCLUDE REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID®, OTEZLA®, ABRAXANE®, VIDAZA®, AZACITIDINE FOR INJECTION (GENERIC VERSION OF VIDAZA®), THALOMID® (SOLD AS THALOMID® OR THALIDOMIDE CELGENE® OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.) AND IDHIFA®. IDHIFA® WAS APPROVED BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) IN AUGUST 2017 FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH RELAPSED OR REFRACTORY ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA (AML) OR (R/R AML) WITH AN ISOCITRATE DEHYDROGENASE-2 (IDH2) MUTATION AS DETECTED BY AN FDA APPROVED DIAGNOSTIC TEST. WE BEGAN RECOGNIZING REVENUE RELATED TO IDHIFA® DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2017. IN ADDITION, WE EARN REVENUE FROM OTHER PRODUCT SALES AND LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS.WE CONTINUE TO INVEST SUBSTANTIALLY IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN SUPPORT OF MULTIPLE ONGOING PROPRIETARY CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WHICH SUPPORT OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND PIPELINE OF NEW DRUG CANDIDATES. OUR CLINICAL TRIAL ACTIVITY INCLUDES TRIALS ACROSS THE DISEASE AREAS OF HEMATOLOGY, SOLID TUMORS, AND INFLAMMATION AND IMMUNOLOGY. REVLIMID® IS IN SEVERAL PHASE III TRIALS COVERING A RANGE OF HEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES THAT INCLUDE MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND LYMPHOMAS. ALSO, WITHIN HEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES, POMALYST® IS IN SEVERAL PHASE III AND POST-APPROVAL TRIALS FOR RELAPSED/REFRACTORY MULTIPLE MYELOMA (RRMM). IN SOLID TUMORS, ABRAXANE® IS CURRENTLY IN VARIOUS STAGES OF INVESTIGATION FOR PANCREATIC AND NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCERS. IN INFLAMMATION AND IMMUNOLOGY, OTEZLA® IS BEING EVALUATED IN PHASE III TRIALS FOR BEHÇET'S DISEASE AND SCALP PSORIASIS, AND IS CONTINUING TO BE STUDIED IN ULCERATIVE COLITIS (UC), PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS AND PLAQUE PSORIASIS. WE ALSO HAVE A GROWING NUMBER OF POTENTIAL PRODUCTS IN PHASE III TRIALS ACROSS MULTIPLE DISEASES. IN THE INFLAMMATION AND IMMUNOLOGY THERAPEUTIC AREA, WE HAVE PHASE III TRIALS UNDERWAY FOR OZANIMOD IN RELAPSING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (RMS), UC AND A PHASE III TRIAL IN CROHN'S DISEASE (CD) THAT IS INITIATING. IN HEMATOLOGY, PHASE III TRIALS ARE UNDERWAY FOR CC-486 AND LUSPATERCEPT IN MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES (MDS), FOR CC-486 IN AML AND FOR LUSPATERCEPT IN BETA-THALASSEMIA. IN JULY 2017, CELGENE CORPORATION ENTERED INTO GLOBAL STRATEGIC IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY COLLABORATION WITH BEIGENE, LTD. (BEIGENE) TO ADVANCE A PD-1 INHIBITOR (BGB-A317) PROGRAM FOR SOLID TUMOR CANCERS. IN COLLABORATION WITH BLUEBIRD BIO, BB2121, A BCMA CAR T CELL THERAPY, HAS SHOWN IMPRESSIVE EFFICACY IN RRMM WITH A MANAGEABLE SAFETY PROFILE. BREAKTHROUGH THERAPY DESIGNATION HAS BEEN GRANTED BY THE FDA AND BB2121 HAS BEEN GIVEN ACCESS TO THE PRIORITY MEDICINES SCHEME BY THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY (EMA) COMMITTEE FOR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE (CHMP). A PIVOTAL STUDY IN RRMM WAS INITIATED IN DECEMBER 2017.BEYOND OUR PHASE III PROGRAMS, WE HAVE ACCESS TO A GROWING EARLY-TO-MID-STAGE PIPELINE OF NOVEL POTENTIAL THERAPIES TO ADDRESS SIGNIFICANT UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS THAT CONSISTS OF NEW DRUG CANDIDATES AND CELL THERAPIES DEVELOPED IN-HOUSE, LICENSED FROM OTHER COMPANIES OR ABLE TO BE OPTIONED FROM COLLABORATION PARTNERS. WE BELIEVE THAT CONTINUED USE OF OUR PRIMARY COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS, PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS, DEPTH OF OUR PRODUCT PIPELINE, POTENTIAL REGULATORY APPROVALS OF NEW PRODUCTS AND NEW INDICATIONS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS WILL PROVIDE THE CATALYSTS FOR FUTURE GROWTH.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 2017 TAX ACT: IN DECEMBER 2017, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED U.S. TAX REFORM LEGISLATION (2017 TAX ACT), WHICH INCLUDES A BROAD RANGE OF PROVISIONS, MANY OF WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN PREVIOUS U.S. TAX LAW. CHANGES IN TAX LAW ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PERIOD OF ENACTMENT. AS SUCH, THE 2017 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFLECT THE IMMEDIATE TAX EFFECT OF THE 2017 TAX ACT, WHICH WAS ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22, 2017. THE 2017 TAX ACT CONTAINS SEVERAL KEY PROVISIONS INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS:•A ONE-TIME TAX ON THE MANDATORY DEEMED REPATRIATION OF POST-1986 UNTAXED FOREIGN EARNINGS AND PROFITS (E&P), REFERRED TO AS THE TOLL CHARGE;•REDUCTION IN THE CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21% FOR TAX YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2017;•INTRODUCTION OF A NEW U.S. TAX ON CERTAIN OFF-SHORE EARNINGS REFERRED TO AS GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW-TAXED INCOME (GILTI) AT AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 10.5% FOR TAX YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2017 (INCREASING TO 13.125% FOR TAX YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2025) WITH A PARTIAL OFFSET BY FOREIGN TAX CREDITS; AND •INTRODUCTION OF A TERRITORIAL TAX SYSTEM BEGINNING IN 2018 BY PROVIDING A 100% DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION ON CERTAIN QUALIFIED DIVIDENDS FROM FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.34DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017, WE RECORDED AN INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $1,269 MILLION, WHICH WAS COMPRISED OF THE FOLLOWING:•AN INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $1,890 MILLION FOR THE ONE-TIME DEEMED REPATRIATION OF E&P. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 2017 TAX ACT, THE TOLL CHARGE LIABILITY MAY BE PAID OVER EIGHT YEARS. AS SUCH, WE HAVE RECORDED $1,732 MILLION AND $150 MILLION IN NON-CURRENT AND CURRENT INCOME TAX LIABILITY ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS, RESPECTIVELY, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017; AND•AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $621 MILLION, PRIMARILY FOR THE REMEASUREMENT OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE ENACTED TAX RATE OF 21%.THE NET CHARGE RECORDED WAS BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND INTERPRETATIONS OF APPLYING THE PROVISIONS OF THE 2017 TAX ACT AS OF THE TIME OF FILING THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC), THE INCOME TAX EFFECT FOR CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE 2017 TAX ACT REPRESENT PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS FOR WHICH OUR ACCOUNTING IS INCOMPLETE BUT A REASONABLE ESTIMATE COULD BE DETERMINED AND RECORDED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FURTHER GUIDANCE THAT MAY BE ISSUED BY U.S. TAX AUTHORITIES OR REGULATORY BODIES INCLUDING THE SEC AND THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD TO INTERPRET THE 2017 TAX ACT. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ANALYZE THE 2017 TAX ACT AND ANY ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE THAT MAY BE ISSUED SO WE CAN FINALIZE THE FULL EFFECTS OF APPLYING THE NEW LEGISLATION ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. SEE NOTE 16 TO NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO THE 2017 TAX ACT.DISCONTINUANCE OF CERTAIN GED-0301 PHASE III TRIALS: ON OCTOBER 19, 2017, WE ANNOUNCED OUR DECISION TO DISCONTINUE THE GED-0301 PHASE III REVOLVE (CD-002) TRIAL IN CD AND THE SUSTAIN (CD-004) EXTENSION TRIAL (THE TRIALS). AT THAT TIME, WE CONCLUDED WE WOULD RECORD A SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GED-0301 IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D) ASSET, INCUR WIND-DOWN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DISCONTINUING THE TRIALS AND CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND RECORD A BENEFIT RELATED TO THE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF GED-0301 CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES. AT THE DATE GED-0301 WAS ACQUIRED BY CELGENE, A PHASE II TRIAL OF GED-0301 IN PATIENTS WITH ACTIVE CD HAD BEEN COMPLETED AND A MULTI-YEAR CLINICAL PROGRAM DESIGNED TO SUPPORT GLOBAL REGISTRATIONS OF GED-0301 IN CD WAS PLANNED, WHILE OTHER INDICATIONS WERE NOT AS ADVANCED. AS SUCH, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE IPR&D ASSET AND CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES WERE ATTRIBUTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF GED-0301 FOR THE TREATMENT OF CD. AS A RESULT OF THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE TRIALS, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NET PRE-TAX CHARGE TO EARNINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $411 MILLION DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017. THE NET PRE-TAX CHARGE WAS COMPRISED OF THE FOLLOWING:•AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATING TO THE ENTIRE GED-0301 IPR&D ASSET OF APPROXIMATELY $1,620 MILLION. SEE NOTE 10 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THE IMPAIRMENT OF THE GED-0301 IPR&D ASSET; •OTHER ONE-TIME CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $188 MILLION THAT WILL REQUIRE CASH PAYMENTS PRIMARILY RELATED TO WIND-DOWN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DISCONTINUING THE TRIALS AND CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES; AND•A REDUCTION IN CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $1,397 MILLION RELATED TO GED-0301. SEE NOTE 4 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES.

U.S. SALES GROWTH INCREASED DUE TO BOTH PRICE INCREASES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, AN INCREASE IN UNIT SALES FROM MARKET PENETRATION AND TREATMENT DURATION OF PATIENTS USING REVLIMID®. IN ADDITION, UNIT SALES INCREASED ACROSS ALL INTERNATIONAL REGIONS, PRIMARILY IN EUROPE AND JAPAN, DRIVEN BY INCREASED DURATION OF USE AND MARKET SHARE GAINS. INTERNATIONAL VOLUME GROWTH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET PRICE DECREASES.37REVLIMID® NET SALES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION, OR 20.2%, TO APPROXIMATELY $7.0 BILLION IN 2016 COMPARED TO 2015, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED UNIT SALES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND PRICE INCREASES IN THE U.S. MARKET. INCREASES IN MARKET PENETRATION AND TREATMENT DURATION OF PATIENTS USING REVLIMID® IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN U.S. UNIT SALES. THE GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS RESULTED FROM VOLUME INCREASES, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED DURATION OF USE AND MARKET SHARE GAINS. REVLIMID® LAUNCHED IN THE U.S. AND EU FOR NEWLY DIAGNOSED MULTIPLE MYELOMA FOLLOWING APPROVAL IN FEBRUARY 2015.POMALYST®/IMNOVID® POMALYST®/IMNOVID® NET SALES INCREASED BY $303 MILLION, OR 23.1%, TO APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION FOR 2017 COMPARED TO 2016, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES IN THE U.S. AND TO A LESSER EXTENT INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. IN THE U.S., SALES GROWTH INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN UNIT SALES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, PRICE INCREASES. IN ADDITION, UNIT SALES INCREASED ACROSS ALL INTERNATIONAL REGIONS, PRIMARILY IN EUROPE. INCREASES IN MARKET SHARE AND TREATMENT DURATION CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASES IN U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL REGIONS. INTERNATIONAL VOLUME GROWTH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET PRICE DECREASES.POMALYST®/IMNOVID® NET SALES INCREASED BY $327 MILLION, OR 33.2%, TO APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION IN 2016 COMPARED TO 2015, REFLECTING NET SALES OF $778 MILLION IN THE U.S. AND $533 MILLION IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. INCREASES IN TREATMENT DURATION CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL NET SALES OF POMALYST®/IMNOVID®. ACHIEVING REIMBURSEMENT IN ADDITIONAL COUNTRIES, NOTABLY IN JAPAN, ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE GROWTH OF POMALYST®/IMNOVID® NET SALES IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.OTEZLA® OTEZLA® NET SALES INCREASED BY $262 MILLION, OR 25.8%, TO APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION FOR 2017 COMPARED TO 2016, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED WORLDWIDE UNIT SALES. NET SALES IN THE U.S. WERE VOLUME DRIVEN REFLECTING INCREASED MARKET SHARE AND EXPANDING PATIENT ACCESS. WE ANTICIPATE A SLOWING IN MARKET GROWTH, OFFSET BY CONTINUED MARKET SHARE EXPANSION IN THE U.S. DUE TO NEW MANAGED CARE CONTRACTS, AS WELL AS INCREASING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM EARLY LAUNCH COUNTRIES IN EUROPE, THE LAUNCH IN JAPAN, AND LAUNCHES SUBSEQUENT TO ADDITIONAL INTERNATIONAL APPROVALS. INTERNATIONAL VOLUME GROWTH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET PRICE DECREASES.OTEZLA® NET SALES INCREASED BY $545 MILLION TO APPROXIMATELY $1.0 BILLION IN 2016 COMPARED TO 2015, REFLECTING NET SALES OF $904 MILLION IN THE U.S. AND $113 MILLION IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. AS 2016 WAS THE SECOND FULL YEAR ON THE MARKET IN THE U.S., GROWTH IN THE U.S. REFLECTS INCREASED MARKET SHARE AND EXPANDING ACCESSIBILITY TO PATIENTS. SALES IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS CONTINUED TO EXPAND DURING 2016, WITH GROWING SALES IN EARLY LAUNCH COUNTRIES IN EUROPE AND ADDITIONAL INTERNATIONAL APPROVALS.ABRAXANE® 38ABRAXANE® NET SALES INCREASED BY $19 MILLION, OR 2.0%, TO $992 MILLION FOR 2017 COMPARED TO 2016, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN UNIT SALES IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

THE INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED UNIT SALES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PRICE DECREASES. THE DECREASE IN U.S. SALES WAS DUE TO VOLUME DECREASES PARTLY OFFSET BY PRICE INCREASES. THE DECREASE IN U.S. SALES REFLECTS THE INCREASED COMPETITION IN BREAST CANCER AND LUNG CANCER INDICATIONS FROM NEW MARKET ENTRANTS.OTHER PRODUCT SALESALL OTHER PRODUCT SALES, WHICH INCLUDE IDHIFA®, VIDAZA®, AZACITIDINE FOR INJECTION, WHICH IS AN AUTHORIZED GENERIC VERSION OF VIDAZA® (GENERIC AZACITIDINE FOR INJECTION), THALOMID®, AND ISTODAX®, DECREASED BY $9 MILLION IN 2017 COMPARED TO 2016, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN GENERIC AZACITIDINE FOR INJECTION AND THALOMID® NET SALES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN NET SALES FROM THE LAUNCH OF IDHIFA® AND VIDAZA® NET SALES.ALL OTHER PRODUCT SALES, DECREASED BY $27 MILLION IN 2016 COMPARED TO 2015, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN THALOMID® AND GENERIC AZACITIDINE FOR INJECTION NET SALES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN VIDAZA® AND ISTODAX® NET SALES.OTHER REVENUE: OTHER REVENUE DECREASED BY $14 MILLION TO $30 MILLION FOR 2017 COMPARED TO 2016. THIS DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN ROYALTY REVENUE FROM NOVARTIS AG (NOVARTIS) BASED UPON ITS SALES OF BOTH RITALIN® AND FOCALIN XR®, BOTH OF WHICH HAVE BEEN UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED BY GENERIC COMPETITION IN CERTAIN MARKETS. BEGINNING IN FISCAL 2018, WE ARE NO LONGER ENTITLED TO RECEIVE ROYALTIES ON RITALIN® AND FOCALIN XR®.OTHER REVENUE DECREASED BY $51 MILLION TO $44 MILLION FOR 2016 COMPARED TO 2015 PRIMARILY DUE TO A $36 MILLION DECREASE IN ROYALTY REVENUE FROM NOVARTIS BASED UPON ITS SALES OF BOTH RITALIN® AND FOCALIN XR®, BOTH OF WHICH WERE UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED BY GENERIC COMPETITION IN CERTAIN MARKETS.GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR GOVERNMENT REBATES, CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES, SALES DISCOUNTS, AND SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES.REVLIMID®, POMALYST® AND THALOMID® ARE DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES UNDER THE REVLIMID RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY (REMS), POMALYST REMS® AND THALOMID REMS® PROGRAMS, RESPECTIVELY. THESE ARE PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®, POMALYST® AND THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID®, THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENE® AND IMNOVID® ARE DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL AUTHORITIES’ SPECIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE FOR THE PRODUCT’S SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. OTEZLA®, ABRAXANE®, ISTODAX® AND VIDAZA® ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® AND THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENE®. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF THE REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE ALSO ANALYZE ACTUAL BILLINGS RECEIVED FROM THE STATES TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE ACCRUAL RATES. MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT’S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP 39RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL INVOICES. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES.REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE RECORD A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY.CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE INCLUDED IN CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS AND ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA.SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS.WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2017 WAS 31.8%, AN INCREASE OF 16.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 15.7% FOR 2016. THE INCREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A 29.4 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE RELATED TO THE ONE-TIME TAX EFFECTS OF THE 2017 TAX ACT, WHICH WAS ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22, 2017. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION DEDUCTIONS, FOR WHICH OUR 2017 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS REDUCED BY 6.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS (SEE NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K), U.S. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND ORPHAN DRUG TAX CREDITS, FOR WHICH OUR 2017 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS REDUCED BY 1.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS, AND AN INCREASE IN PRE-TAX EARNINGS FROM JURISDICTIONS WITH LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES, ALL OF WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NON-RECURRING PRIOR YEAR TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO A LOSS ON OUR INVESTMENT IN AVILA. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN 2017 FOR U.S. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND ORPHAN DRUG TAX CREDITS WERE THE RESULT OF A CHANGE IN ESTIMATE UPON COMPLETION OF A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS (SEE NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K).OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS A FUNCTION OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRE-TAX INCOME AMONG THE MANY JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. OUR PRE-TAX INCOME IS EARNED AND TAXED IN EITHER THE U.S. AT A STATUTORY TAX RATE OF 35%, OR OUTSIDE THE U.S. AT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES. OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS EXPECTED TO BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED BY THE 2017 TAX ACT, WHICH, AMONG OTHER CHANGES, REDUCES THE U.S. CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21% AND INTRODUCES A NEW U.S. TAX ON CERTAIN OFF-SHORE EARNINGS REFERRED TO AS GILTI AT AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 10.5% FOR TAX YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2017 (INCREASING TO 13.125% FOR TAX YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2025). SEE NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER DETAILS RELATED TO THE 2017 TAX ACT. OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE CAN ALSO BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED BY SHIFTS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRE-TAX INCOME AMONG THE JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE OPERATE, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF TAX BENEFITS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION, PAYMENTS TO COLLABORATION PARTNERS, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, AUDIT SETTLEMENTS, AND MANY OTHER FACTORS WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST. THE INCOME TAX PROVISION DECREASED BY $48 MILLION TO $373 MILLION IN 2016 COMPARED TO 2015 AS A RESULT OF A DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INCOME BEFORE TAXES. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2016 WAS 15.7%. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2015 WAS 20.8%. THE 5.1 PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2016 COMPARED TO 2015 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO A LOSS ON OUR INVESTMENT IN AVILA, OFFSET BY A NON-DEDUCTIBLE PRE-TAX CHARGE RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF ACETYLON AND NON-RECURRING CHARGES TO TAX EXPENSE RECORDED IN 2015 RELATED TO BOTH THE GLOBAL MIX OF FUNDING SOURCES FOR PAYMENTS TO COLLABORATION PARTNERS, PRIMARILY THE INITIATION OF OUR COLLABORATIONS WITH ASTRAZENECA PLC (ASTRAZENECA) AND JUNO, AND AN INCREASE IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OBTAINED IN OUR ACQUISITION OF RECEPTOS, INC. (RECEPTOS).46LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESTHE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE COMPONENTS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2016 AND 2015 (IN MILLIONS):1 INCLUDES CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET OF ALLOWANCES, INVENTORY AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, LESS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES, AND THE CURRENT PORTION OF INCOME TAXES PAYABLE.WE RELY PRIMARILY ON POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND BORROWINGS IN THE FORM OF LONG-TERM NOTES PAYABLE AND SHORT-TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER TO PROVIDE FOR OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. WE EXPECT CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR EXPENDITURES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TRIALS, COMMERCIALIZATION OF NEW PRODUCTS, INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND EXISTING SOURCES OF AND ACCESS TO FINANCING ARE ADEQUATE TO FUND OUR OPERATING NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AND OUR PLANS TO PURCHASE OUR STOCK AND PURSUE STRATEGIC BUSINESS INITIATIVES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE HELD INTERNATIONALLY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE HELD APPROXIMATELY $6.0 BILLION OF THESE SHORT-TERM FUNDS IN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS. AS A RESULT OF THE 2017 TAX ACT AND THE TOLL CHARGE, WE EXPECT TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS CASH WITH MINIMAL TO NO ADDITIONAL U.S. TAX IMPACT. THEREFORE, WE NO LONGER CONSIDER THESE FUNDS PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OFFSHORE. THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS HELD IN U.S. TAX JURISDICTIONS CAN FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS FOR OTHER REASONS, SUCH AS REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, INTERNAL REORGANIZATIONS, BUSINESS-DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, RESTRICTIONS ON DISTRIBUTIONS OUT OF FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS AND DEBT ISSUANCES. AS PART OF OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY ASSESSMENTS, WE REGULARLY MONITOR THE MIX OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CASH FLOWS (BOTH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS). UNDER THE 2017 TAX ACT, A COMPANY’S POST-1986 PREVIOUSLY UNTAXED FOREIGN E&P ARE MANDATORILY DEEMED TO BE REPATRIATED AND TAXED, WHICH IS ALSO REFERRED TO AS THE TOLL CHARGE. THE TOLL CHARGE IS ASSESSED REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT A COMPANY HAS CASH IN ITS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THE COMPANY WILL ACTUALLY BRING BACK ITS ACCUMULATED UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS. HOWEVER, THE CHARGE CAN BE PAID IN INSTALLMENTS OVER EIGHT YEARS. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017, WE RECORDED AN INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $1,890 MILLION WHICH REPRESENTS THE TOLL CHARGE LIABILITY FOR THE DEEMED REPATRIATION OF E&P. WE HAVE ELECTED TO PAY THE TOLL CHARGE IN INSTALLMENTS OVER EIGHT YEARS, OR THROUGH 2025. HOWEVER, THE TOLL CHARGE LIABILITY IS NOT DISCOUNTED ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS SUCH, WE HAVE RECORDED $1,732 MILLION AND $150 MILLION AS A NON-CURRENT AND CURRENT INCOME TAX LIABILITY, RESPECTIVELY, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017. IN PRIOR YEARS, WE RECORDED U.S. DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES OF $317 MILLION FOR CERTAIN OFFSHORE EARNINGS THAT WERE EXPECTED TO BE REMITTED TO OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS. THESE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES REDUCED THE INCOME TAX EXPENSE RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017 FOR THE TOLL CHARGE. THE REMAINING AMOUNTS EARNED OVERSEAS WERE EXPECTED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND THEREFORE, NO ACCRUAL FOR U.S. TAXES WAS PROVIDED. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM: SINCE APRIL 2009, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED AN AGGREGATE $20.5 BILLION COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF WHICH WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $822 MILLION REMAINING FOR FUTURE REPURCHASES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017. DURING 2017, WE USED $3.9 BILLION FOR REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, MEASURED ON A SETTLEMENT DATE BASIS.47COMPONENTS OF WORKING CAPITALCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: WE INVEST OUR EXCESS CASH PRIMARILY IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS, REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, TIME DEPOSITS, COMMERCIAL PAPER, U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (MBS), AN ULTRA SHORT INCOME FUND, GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, ASSET BACKED SECURITIES AND ULTRA-SHORT INCOME FUND INVESTMENTS. ALL LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND ALL INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. SEE NOTE 6 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THE $4.1 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 COMPARED TO 2016 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO APPROXIMATELY $5.2 BILLION OF CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND $611 MILLION OF NET UNREALIZED HOLDING GAINS ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION OF NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES.MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. FOR MORE INFORMATION RELATED TO THE FAIR VALUE AND VALUATION OF OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES, SEE NOTE 4 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. FOR MORE INFORMATION RELATED TO THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT, BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, FOR OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS, SEE NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET INCREASED BY $300 MILLION TO APPROXIMATELY $1.9 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 2016. SALES MADE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES TYPICALLY HAVE PAYMENT TERMS THAT ARE GREATER THAN 60 DAYS, THEREBY EXTENDING COLLECTION PERIODS BEYOND THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE EXPECT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE TO GROW AS OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES CONTINUE TO EXPAND.WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES, THE SOVEREIGN DEBT SITUATION IN CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND ASSOCIATED IMPACTS ON THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OUR BUSINESS. OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL IN THESE MARKETS IS TYPICALLY TO SELL OUR HEMATOLOGY AND ONCOLOGY PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO PRINCIPALLY GOVERNMENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED HOSPITALS, WHICH IN TURN DIRECTLY DELIVER CRITICAL CARE TO PATIENTS. MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE USED TO TREAT LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES AND WE BELIEVE THIS BUSINESS MODEL ENABLES TIMELY DELIVERY AND ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS. MANY OF THE OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE RELATED TO GOVERNMENT-FUNDED HOSPITALS AND WE BELIEVE THE RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE ULTIMATELY COLLECTIBLE. SIMILARLY, WE BELIEVE THAT FUTURE SALES TO THESE CUSTOMERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE COLLECTIBLE.INVENTORY: INVENTORY BALANCES INCREASED BY $43 MILLION TO $541 MILLION AT THE END OF 2017 COMPARED TO 2016. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS: OTHER CURRENT ASSETS DECREASED BY $391 MILLION TO $388 MILLION AT THE END OF 2017 COMPARED TO 2016 PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES OF $347 MILLION IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND $112 MILLION IN PREPAID TAXES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $68 MILLION OF NET OTHER INCREASES.COMMERCIAL PAPER: WE HAVE A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM (PROGRAM) UNDER WHICH WE ISSUE UNSECURED COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES (COMMERCIAL PAPER) ON A PRIVATE PLACEMENT BASIS, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH ARE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. IN APRIL 2016, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED AN INCREASE IN THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUABLE TO $2.0 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE HAD AVAILABLE CAPACITY TO ISSUE UP TO $2.0 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS UNDER THE PROGRAM. THE MATURITIES OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MAY VARY, BUT MAY NOT EXCEED 270 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ISSUE. THE COMMERCIAL PAPER IS SOLD UNDER CUSTOMARY TERMS TO A DEALER OR IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET AND IS ISSUED AT A DISCOUNT FROM PAR OR, ALTERNATIVELY, IS SOLD AT PAR AND BEARS VARYING INTEREST RATES ON A FIXED OR FLOATING BASIS. BORROWINGS UNDER THE PROGRAM, IF ANY, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS.SENIOR UNSECURED CREDIT FACILITY: WE MAINTAIN A SENIOR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (CREDIT FACILITY) THAT PROVIDES REVOLVING CREDIT IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $2.0 BILLION, WHICH WAS INCREASED FROM $1.8 BILLION IN APRIL 2016. WE EXTENDED THE CREDIT FACILITY IN APRIL 2017 FROM APRIL 17, 2021 TO APRIL 17, 2022. AMOUNTS MAY BE BORROWED IN U.S. DOLLARS FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE CREDIT FACILITY CURRENTLY SERVES AS BACKUP LIQUIDITY FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, THERE WAS NO OUTSTANDING BORROWING AGAINST THE CREDIT FACILITY.THE CREDIT FACILITY AND THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAIN AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS, INCLUDING CERTAIN CUSTOMARY FINANCIAL COVENANTS.

DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES DURING 2016 INCLUDED CASH RECEIPTS OF $196 MILLION RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS THAT HAD BEEN DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF CERTAIN OF OUR FIXED RATE NOTES. INCREASES IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WERE ALSO DRIVEN BY A $420 MILLION INCREASE IN CHANGE IN OTHER OPERATING ASSETS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A $298 MILLION DECREASE IN PREPAID TAXES AND A $92 MILLION INCREASE IN CHANGE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER OPERATING LIABILITIES PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE OF $199 MILLION OF ACCRUED EXPENSES RELATED TO A LITIGATION-RELATED LOSS CONTINGENCY ACCRUAL AS WELL AS OTHER BALANCE SHEET FLUCTUATIONS.INVESTING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $1.9 BILLION IN 2017 COMPARED TO 2016. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE APPROXIMATELY $2.5 BILLION OF NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DURING 2017 COMPARED TO $648 MILLION OF NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DURING 2016.NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $5.3 BILLION IN 2016 COMPARED TO 2015. THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE PURCHASES OF RECEPTOS AND QUANTICEL IN 2015 WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING PURCHASE IN 2016, RESULTING IN A CASH USAGE OF APPROXIMATELY $7.7 BILLION DURING 2015, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY NET PURCHASES AND SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE. NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE DURING 2016 AMOUNTED TO A NET CASH USAGE OF $648 MILLION DURING 2016 COMPARED TO NET CASH PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.9 BILLION FROM NET SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE DURING 2015.49FINANCING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DECREASED BY $250 MILLION IN 2017 COMPARED TO 2016.

SEE NOTE 11 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS.OPERATING LEASES: WE LEASE OFFICE AND RESEARCH FACILITIES UNDER VARIOUS OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE NON-CANCELABLE LEASE TERMS FOR OPERATING LEASES EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES BETWEEN 2018 AND 2025 AND INCLUDE RENEWAL OPTIONS. IN GENERAL, WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE LESSORS FOR REAL ESTATE TAXES, INSURANCE, UTILITIES, MAINTENANCE AND OTHER OPERATING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEASES.

THE TOLL CHARGE IS ASSESSED REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT A COMPANY HAS CASH IN ITS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THE COMPANY WILL ACTUALLY BRING BACK ITS ACCUMULATED UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS. HOWEVER, THE CHARGE CAN BE PAID IN INSTALLMENTS OVER EIGHT YEARS. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017, WE RECORDED AN INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $1,890 MILLION WHICH REPRESENTS THE TOLL CHARGE LIABILITY FOR THE DEEMED REPATRIATION OF E&P. WE HAVE ELECTED TO PAY THE TOLL CHARGE IN INSTALLMENTS OVER EIGHT YEARS, OR THROUGH 2025. HOWEVER, THE TOLL CHARGE LIABILITY IS NOT DISCOUNTED ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS SUCH, WE HAVE RECORDED $1,732 MILLION AND $150 MILLION AS A NON-CURRENT AND CURRENT INCOME TAX LIABILITY, RESPECTIVELY, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017. COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS AND ACQUIRED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSETS: WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES AND HAVE ACQUIRED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSETS FROM THIRD PARTIES WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE MILESTONE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED DEVELOPMENTAL, REGULATORY AND/OR COMMERCIAL TARGETS. OUR OBLIGATION TO FUND THESE EFFORTS IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROGRAMS AND/OR 50THE LACK OF ANY ADVERSE EVENTS WHICH COULD CAUSE THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE PROGRAMS. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE ATTAINMENT OF SPECIFIED DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY APPROVAL AND SALES-BASED MILESTONES OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND ACCORDINGLY, NO AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED FOR THESE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016 CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. POTENTIAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS (NOT INCLUDING POTENTIAL ROYALTY PAYMENTS) TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $10.7 BILLION, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $5.6 BILLION CONTINGENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF VARIOUS RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES AND APPROXIMATELY $5.1 BILLION IN SALES-BASED MILESTONES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR ACQUISITIONS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSETS AND COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS, SEE NOTE 2 AND NOTE 17, RESPECTIVELY, OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS: WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT THE TIMING OF TAX SETTLEMENTS RELATED TO OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS TAX AUDITS CAN INVOLVE COMPLEX ISSUES AND THE RESOLUTION OF THOSE ISSUES MAY SPAN MULTIPLE YEARS, PARTICULARLY IF SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATION OR LITIGATION. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE NOT INCLUDED OBLIGATIONS FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS IN OUR TABLE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS (SEE NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K).NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSFOR A DISCUSSION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS PLEASE SEE NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IS ONE THAT IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENT'S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL:REVENUE RECOGNITION: REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS OF THE PRODUCT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER AND THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED AND DETERMINABLE. PROVISIONS FOR DISCOUNTS, EARLY PAYMENTS, REBATES, SALES RETURNS AND DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS UNDER TERMS CUSTOMARY IN THE INDUSTRY ARE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SAME PERIOD THE RELATED SALES ARE RECORDED. WE RECORD ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SALE. THE ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR SUCH VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES ARE BASED ON THE SALES TERMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND TREND ANALYSIS.WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM ROYALTIES BASED ON LICENSEES' SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS USING OUR TECHNOLOGIES. ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACT TERMS WHEN ROYALTIES FROM LICENSEES CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED. IF ROYALTIES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR COLLECTABILITY OF A ROYALTY AMOUNT IS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED, ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE CASH IS RECEIVED.GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES, SALES DISCOUNTS, GOVERNMENT REBATES, CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES.REVLIMID®, POMALYST® AND THALOMID® ARE DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES UNDER THE REVLIMID REMS®, POMALYST REMS® AND THALOMID REMS® PROGRAMS, RESPECTIVELY. THESE ARE PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®, POMALYST® AND THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID®, THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENE® AND IMNOVID® ARE DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL AUTHORITIES’ SPECIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE FOR THE PRODUCT’S SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. OTEZLA®, ABRAXANE®, ISTODAX®, VIDAZA® AND IDHIFA® ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® AND THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENE®. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF THE REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED 51HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE ALSO ANALYZE ACTUAL BILLINGS RECEIVED FROM THE STATES TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE ACCRUAL RATES. MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT’S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL INVOICES. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES.REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE RECORD A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY.CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE INCLUDED IN CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS AND ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA.SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS.WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. AS NOTED ABOVE, REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® AND THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENE® ARE DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY SUBJECT TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY.ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: WE ESTIMATE AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, HISTORICAL PAYMENT PATTERNS, AGING OF RECEIVABLE BALANCES AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF COUNTRIES THEMSELVES AND PROVINCES OR AREAS WITHIN SUCH COUNTRIES WHERE THEY ARE THE ULTIMATE CUSTOMERS.INCOME TAXES: WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. WE PROVIDE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME PORTION OR ALL OF A DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL NOT BE REALIZED.WE ACCOUNT FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS PART OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THESE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATE PRIMARILY TO ISSUES COMMON AMONG MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE APPLY A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES WHICH INCLUDE STUDIES PERFORMED BY INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS, ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY AND SUBJECT EXPERTS, EVALUATION OF PUBLIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. WE PROVIDE ESTIMATES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. IF OUR ESTIMATES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ACTUAL OUTCOMES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED.WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE A PORTION WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR RECENT CUMULATIVE EARNINGS EXPERIENCE BY TAXING JURISDICTION, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, CARRYFORWARD PERIODS AVAILABLE TO US FOR TAX REPORTING PURPOSES, VARIOUS INCOME TAX STRATEGIES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT AND, TO THE EXTENT FUTURE EXPECTATIONS CHANGE, WE WOULD HAVE TO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THAT TIME. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES.52SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION: WE UTILIZE SHARE BASED COMPENSATION IN THE FORM OF STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, OR RSUS, AND PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, OR PSUS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARDS AT GRANT DATE. COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED REFLECTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF AWARDS EXPECTED TO VEST AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AN ESTIMATE OF AWARD FORFEITURES BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE VESTING PERIOD REQUIRED TO OBTAIN FULL VESTING. MANAGEMENT EXPECTATIONS RELATED TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PERFORMANCE GOALS ASSOCIATED WITH PSU GRANTS IS ASSESSED REGULARLY AND THAT ASSESSMENT IS USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER PSU GRANTS ARE EXPECTED TO VEST. IF PERFORMANCE-BASED MILESTONES RELATED TO PSU GRANTS ARE NOT MET OR NOT EXPECTED TO BE MET, ANY COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED TO DATE ASSOCIATED WITH GRANTS THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO VEST WILL BE REVERSED.OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES: A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF ANY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY BELOW ITS COST THAT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN CARRYING AMOUNT TO FAIR VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT IS CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AND A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE SECURITY ESTABLISHED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INCLUDE: SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE ISSUER'S EARNINGS PERFORMANCE, CREDIT RATING, ASSET QUALITY, BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE ISSUER OPERATES, LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW OUR COST, OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE SECURITY, OUR INTENT NOT TO SELL, AN EVALUATION AS TO WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO SELL BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR COST BASIS, AND ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ISSUER'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD DIFFER FROM OUR ASSESSMENT.DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES: ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN CURRENT EARNINGS OR OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), DEPENDING ON WHETHER A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION AND, IF IT IS, THE TYPE OF HEDGING TRANSACTION. FOR A DERIVATIVE TO QUALIFY AS A HEDGE AT INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE HEDGED PERIOD, WE FORMALLY DOCUMENT THE NATURE AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEM. WE ASSESS, BOTH AT INCEPTION AND ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WHETHER DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING THE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER PROBABLE OF OCCURRING, WE DISCONTINUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING AND ANY RELATED UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE NOT DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION, TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE, OUR STOCK PRICE AND INTEREST RATES. THE USE OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE EXPOSURE OF THESE RISKS WITH THE INTENT TO REDUCE OUR RISK OR COST.PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE NO. 2017-12, "DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING" (ASU 2017-12), WE WERE REQUIRED TO SEPARATELY MEASURE AND REFLECT THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT DID NOT OFFSET THE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS, WHICH WAS REFERRED TO AS THE INEFFECTIVE AMOUNT. WE ASSESSED HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND RECORDED THE GAIN OR LOSS RELATED TO THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IF ANY, IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF ASU 2017-12, WE ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED TO SEPARATELY MEASURE AND RECOGNIZE HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS. UPON ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-12, WE NO LONGER RECOGNIZE HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, BUT WE INSTEAD RECOGNIZE THE ENTIRE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF:•CASH FLOW HEDGES INCLUDED IN THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS). THE AMOUNTS RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) WILL SUBSEQUENTLY BE RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME LINE ITEM IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AS IMPACTED BY THE HEDGED ITEM WHEN THE HEDGED ITEM AFFECTS EARNINGS; AND•FAIR VALUE HEDGES INCLUDED IN THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IN THE SAME LINE ITEM IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME THAT IS USED TO PRESENT THE EARNINGS EFFECT OF THE HEDGED ITEM.PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-12, WE EXCLUDED OPTION PREMIUMS AND FORWARD POINTS (EXCLUDED COMPONENTS) FROM OUR ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS FOR OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE CASH FLOW HEDGES. WE RECOGNIZED ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE EXCLUDED COMPONENTS IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THE AMENDMENTS IN ASU 2017-12 CONTINUE TO ALLOW THOSE COMPONENTS TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS, WHICH WE HAVE ELECTED TO CONTINUE TO APPLY. PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF ASU 2017-12, WE NO LONGER RECOGNIZE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE EXCLUDED COMPONENTS IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET, BUT WE INSTEAD RECOGNIZE THE INITIAL VALUE OF THE EXCLUDED COMPONENT ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LIFE OF THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT, WITHIN THE SAME LINE ITEM IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME THAT IS USED TO PRESENT THE EARNINGS EFFECT OF THE HEDGED ITEM.53INVESTMENTS IN OTHER ENTITIES: WE HOLD A PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER EITHER THE EQUITY METHOD OR COST METHOD. INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES OR CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS OVER WHICH WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD, WITH OUR SHARE OF EARNINGS OR LOSSES REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES OF COMPANIES THAT BECOME PUBLICLY TRADED AND ARE NOT CLASSIFIED AS EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES PROSPECTIVELY FROM THE DATE OF SUCH COMPANIES' INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING.OUR COST METHOD AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.ALL INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT. IF AN INVESTMENT'S FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN ITS NET CARRYING VALUE AND THE DECLINE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE. SUCH AN EVALUATION IS JUDGMENTAL AND DEPENDENT ON SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE HAS OCCURRED INCLUDE: MARKET VALUE OR EXIT PRICE OF THE INVESTMENT BASED ON EITHER MARKET-QUOTED PRICES OR FUTURE ROUNDS OF FINANCING BY THE INVESTEE; LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE MARKET VALUE WAS BELOW ITS COST BASIS; FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE INVESTEE; OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT; ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INVESTEE'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN; ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE MAY BE AWARE OF RELATED TO THE INVESTMENT.ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, OR LTIP, DESIGNED TO PROVIDE KEY OFFICERS AND EXECUTIVES WITH PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES CONTINGENT UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED CORPORATE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES COVERING A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE HAD RECORDED LIABILITIES FOR THREE SEPARATE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLES RUNNING CONCURRENTLY AND ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2018 AND 2019. PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR EACH OF THE PERFORMANCE CYCLES ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS: 37.5% ON NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE (AS DEFINED IN THE LTIP); 37.5% ON TOTAL NON-GAAP REVENUE (AS DEFINED IN THE LTIP); AND 25% ON RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, WHICH IS A MEASUREMENT OF OUR STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE DURING THE APPLICABLE THREE-YEAR PERIOD COMPARED WITH A GROUP OF OTHER COMPANIES IN THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.THRESHOLD, TARGET AND MAXIMUM CASH PAYOUT LEVELS ARE CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE BETWEEN 0% TO 200% OF EACH PARTICIPANT’S BASE SALARY AT THE TIME THE LTIP WAS APPROVED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE. SUCH AWARDS ARE PAYABLE IN CASH OR COMMON STOCK OR A MIXTURE OF CASH AND COMMON STOCK, WHICH WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AT THE TIME OF AWARD DELIVERY. SHARE-BASED PAYOUT LEVELS ARE CALCULATED USING THE CASH-BASED THRESHOLD, TARGET AND MAXIMUM LEVELS, DIVIDED BY THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE OF CELGENE STOCK FOR THE 30 TRADING DAYS PRIOR TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF EACH PERFORMANCE CYCLE. THEREFORE, FINAL SHARE-BASED AWARD VALUES ARE REFLECTIVE OF THE STOCK PRICE AT THE END OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAY DETERMINE THAT PAYMENTS MADE IN COMMON STOCK ARE RESTRICTED FROM TRADING FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. WE ACCRUE THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE LIABILITY OVER EACH THREE-YEAR CYCLE. PRIOR TO THE END OF A THREE-YEAR CYCLE, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT DURING THE CYCLE. UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT EQUAL TO THEIR TARGET AWARD OR, IF HIGHER, AN AWARD BASED ON ACTUAL PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL.ACCRUALS RECORDED FOR THE LTIP ENTAIL MAKING CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE, NON-GAAP REVENUES AND RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, AS DEFINED; THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED. ACCRUALS FOR THE LTIP ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND REVISED ACCORDINGLY SO THAT THE LIABILITY RECORDED REFLECTS UPDATED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PAYOUTS. IN ESTIMATING THE ACCRUALS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DATE FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, EXPECTED RESULTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, OPERATING TRENDS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICING AND COMPETITION.VALUATION OF GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, OTHER ASSETS AND IPR&D: WE HAVE RECORDED GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IPR&D THROUGH ACQUISITIONS ACCOUNTED FOR AS BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. WHEN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING IPR&D AND TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS ARE ACQUIRED, WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS ARE TYPICALLY USED IN THESE VALUATIONS IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, AND THE MODELS REQUIRE THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:•PROJECTING REGULATORY APPROVALS;•ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM PRODUCT SALES RESULTING FROM COMPLETED PRODUCTS AND IN-PROCESS PROJECTS OR ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED; AND•DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES AND PROBABILITY RATES.GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT IS SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING. WE TEST OUR GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT BY ASSESSING QUALITATIVE 54FACTORS OR PERFORMING A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS IN DETERMINING WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ARE BELOW THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE AMORTIZED TO THEIR ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR. INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO IPR&D PRODUCT RIGHTS ARE TREATED AS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND NOT AMORTIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS APPROVED FOR SALE BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN SPECIFIED MARKETS. AT THAT TIME, WE WILL DETERMINE THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET, RECLASSIFY THE ASSET OUT OF IPR&D AND BEGIN AMORTIZATION. IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS ALSO PERFORMED AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. SUCH TEST ENTAILS COMPLETING AN UPDATED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE IPR&D ASSET. IF REQUIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES IS COMPLETED BY COMPARING AN UPDATED NON-DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO THE BOOK VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET. VALUATION OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION: WE RECORD CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION AT ITS FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE, AND FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT REPORTING PERIOD REVALUE THESE OBLIGATIONS AND RECORD INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPERATING EARNINGS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. CHANGES TO CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION OBLIGATIONS CAN RESULT FROM MOVEMENTS IN PUBLICLY TRADED SHARE PRICES OF CVRS, ADJUSTMENTS TO DISCOUNT RATES AND PERIODS, UPDATES IN THE ASSUMED ACHIEVEMENT OR TIMING OF ANY DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES OR CHANGES IN THE PROBABILITY OF CERTAIN CLINICAL EVENTS AND CHANGES IN THE ASSUMED PROBABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATORY APPROVAL. THE ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT AND ANY CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION EXPENSE RECORDED IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. OUR CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES WERE RECORDED IN THE ACQUISITIONS OF GLOUCESTER, ABRAXIS, AVILA, NOGRA, AND QUANTICEL. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE GLOUCESTER, AVILA, NOGRA, AND QUANTICEL CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE DISCOUNT RATE, PROBABILITY AND ESTIMATED TIMING OF CASH MILESTONE PAYMENTS TO THE FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OF EACH BUSINESS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ABRAXIS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY IS BASED ON THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKTHE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES FORWARD-LOOKING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RISK OF LOSS IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES, CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE EARNINGS.WE HAVE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, OUR MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS CONSISTED OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, OUR LONG-TERM DEBT AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE: AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE CONSISTED OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED (MBS) SECURITIES, GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, ASSET BACKED SECURITIES, ULTRA SHORT INCOME-FUND SECURITIES, TIME DEPOSITS AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES. U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES INCLUDE GOVERNMENT DEBT INSTRUMENTS ISSUED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES INCLUDE GENERAL UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS EITHER ISSUED DIRECTLY BY OR GUARANTEED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTERPRISES. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MBS INCLUDE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION AND THE GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION. CORPORATE DEBT-GLOBAL INCLUDES OBLIGATIONS ISSUED BY INVESTMENT-GRADE CORPORATIONS, INCLUDING SOME ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN GUARANTEED BY GOVERNMENTS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. ASSET BACKED SECURITIES CONSIST OF TRIPLE-A RATED SECURITIES WITH CASH FLOWS COLLATERALIZED BY CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND AUTO LOANS. ULTRA SHORT INCOME FUND INCLUDES INVESTMENTS IN CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND CORPORATE NOTES. OUR TIME DEPOSITS AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS HAVE ORIGINAL MATURITIES GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS. OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE COLLATERALIZED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, CASH, BONDS, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND BANK CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT.OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE PRIMARILY EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN THE PUBLICLY TRADED COMMON STOCK OF COMPANIES, INCLUDING COMMON STOCK OF COMPANIES WITH WHOM WE HAVE ENTERED INTO COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE INVEST IN DEBT SECURITIES THAT ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO DEBT SECURITIES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. 55REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO EQUITY SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, FAIR VALUES AND RELATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS):DEBT OBLIGATIONSSHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT: WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING SHORT-TERM BORROWING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 OR DECEMBER 31, 2016. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016 INCLUDES (IN MILLIONS):LONG-TERM DEBT: OUR OUTSTANDING SENIOR NOTES WITH MATURITY DATES IN EXCESS OF ONE YEAR AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2017 HAVE AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $15.850 BILLION WITH VARYING MATURITY DATES AND INTEREST RATES. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS AND CARRYING VALUES OF THESE SENIOR NOTES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW (IN MILLIONS):AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SENIOR NOTES OUTSTANDING WAS $16.573 BILLION. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENTOUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN BE IMPACTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES. WE ACTIVELY MANAGE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE AND INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS THROUGH OPERATIONAL MEANS AND THROUGH THE USE OF VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION 56CONTRACTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. IN INSTANCES WHERE THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OR FAIR VALUE HEDGES WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME TERMINATE THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP. IF A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, WE GENERALLY EITHER SETTLE THE INSTRUMENT OR ENTER INTO AN OFFSETTING INSTRUMENT.FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENTWE MAINTAIN A FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS, TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.THROUGH OUR REVENUE HEDGING PROGRAM, WE ENDEAVOR TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF POSSIBLE UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON OUR FUTURE U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS THAT ARE DERIVED FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, TYPICALLY WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS, WITH A MAXIMUM OF FIVE YEARS. WE MANAGE OUR ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION EXPOSURE PRINCIPALLY WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, A COMBINATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY PUT AND CALL OPTIONS, AND OCCASIONALLY PURCHASED FOREIGN CURRENCY PUT OPTIONS.FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS: WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, MANAGE EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY IN THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS, AND REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.WE MANAGE A PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PROTECT AGAINST CHANGES IN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016 HAD SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 20 MONTHS AND 31 MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY. THE SPOT RATE COMPONENTS OF THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AND ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI) AND RECLASSIFIED TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS. IF A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED WITH RESPECT TO A FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACT, ACCUMULATED GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACT REMAIN IN OCI UNTIL THE HEDGED FORECASTED TRANSACTION OCCURS AND ARE RECLASSIFIED TO OPERATIONS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS. PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-12, THE FORWARD POINT COMPONENTS OF THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WERE EXCLUDED FROM ASSESSING EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP AND ALL FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS OF FORWARD POINT AMOUNTS WERE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. UPON ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-12, WE RECOGNIZE IN EARNINGS THE INITIAL VALUE OF THE FORWARD POINT COMPONENTS ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LIFE OF THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT WITHIN THE SAME LINE ITEM IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME THAT IS USED TO PRESENT THE EARNINGS EFFECT OF THE HEDGED ITEM. SEE NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-12.FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES WERE AS FOLLOWS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016 (IN MILLIONS):WE CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF OUR OWN AND THE COUNTERPARTIES’ CREDIT RISK ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO EXECUTE ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONTRACT ON AN ONGOING BASIS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, CREDIT RISK DID NOT MATERIALLY CHANGE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS.57WE ALSO MANAGE A PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN RECOGNIZED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE RELATED TO TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND, ACCORDINGLY, ANY CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD NON-DESIGNATED HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016 WERE $885 MILLION AND $934 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, WE BELIEVE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS A REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES. ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2017 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WOULD CHANGE BY APPROXIMATELY $260 MILLION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS EITHER HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES OR RELATE TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE ENTITIES' FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE EITHER REPORTED IN OCI AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS OR RE-MEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR LIABILITY.FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS: FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE BY UTILIZING A STRATEGY THAT INVOLVES BOTH A PURCHASED LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTION AND A WRITTEN LOCAL CURRENCY CALL OPTION THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS HEDGES OF FUTURE SALES DENOMINATED IN THAT LOCAL CURRENCY. SPECIFICALLY, WE SELL (OR WRITE) A LOCAL CURRENCY CALL OPTION AND PURCHASE A LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTION WITH THE SAME EXPIRATION DATES AND LOCAL CURRENCY NOTIONAL AMOUNTS BUT WITH DIFFERENT STRIKE PRICES. THIS COMBINATION OF TRANSACTIONS IS GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS A “COLLAR.” THE EXPIRATION DATES AND NOTIONAL AMOUNTS CORRESPOND TO THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY SALES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016 HAD SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 36 MONTHS AND 48 MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS RELATIVE TO THE CURRENCY OF THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED SALES, THE PURCHASED PUT OPTION VALUE REDUCES TO ZERO AND WE BENEFIT FROM THE INCREASE IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF OUR ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS; HOWEVER, THIS BENEFIT WOULD BE CAPPED AT THE STRIKE LEVEL OF THE WRITTEN CALL, WHICH FORMS THE UPPER END OF THE COLLAR. THE PREMIUM COLLECTED FROM THE SALE OF THE CALL OPTION IS EQUAL TO THE PREMIUM PAID FOR THE PURCHASED PUT OPTION, RESULTING IN A NET ZERO COST FOR EACH COLLAR. OUTSTANDING FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE WERE AS FOLLOWS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016:1 U.S. DOLLAR NOTIONAL AMOUNTS ARE CALCULATED AS THE HEDGED LOCAL CURRENCY AMOUNT MULTIPLIED BY THE STRIKE VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION. THE LOCAL CURRENCY NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF OUR PURCHASED PUT AND WRITTEN CALL THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE EQUAL TO EACH OTHER.WE ALSO HAVE ENTERED INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY PUT OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE WHICH WERE NOT PART OF A COLLAR STRATEGY. SUCH PUT OPTION CONTRACTS HAD A NOTIONAL VALUE OF $258 MILLION AND $387 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016, RESPECTIVELY, AND SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 12 MONTHS AND 24 MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY.ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2017 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS WOULD INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $228 MILLION IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WERE TO STRENGTHEN AND DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $270 MILLION IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WERE TO WEAKEN. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS.INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENTFORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND TREASURY RATE LOCKS: IN ANTICIPATION OF ISSUING FIXED-RATE DEBT, WE MAY USE FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS (FORWARD STARTING SWAPS) OR TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS (TREASURY RATE LOCKS) THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES TO HEDGE AGAINST CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES THAT COULD IMPACT EXPECTED FUTURE ISSUANCES OF DEBT. TO THE EXTENT THESE HEDGES OF CASH FLOWS RELATED TO ANTICIPATED DEBT ARE EFFECTIVE, ANY REALIZED OR UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE FORWARD STARTING SWAPS OR TREASURY RATE LOCKS ARE REPORTED IN OCI AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME OVER THE LIFE OF THE ANTICIPATED FIXED-RATE NOTES.WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SWAP CONTRACTS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF CERTAIN OF OUR FIXED RATE NOTES IN 2017 AND 2016 AND ALSO TERMINATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP BY SETTLING CERTAIN OF THOSE SWAP CONTRACTS DURING 2017. DURING 2017, WE SETTLED $500 MILLION NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF CERTAIN SWAP CONTRACTS, AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY ENTERED INTO NEW $500 MILLION NOTIONAL AMOUNT SWAP CONTRACTS. 58WE TERMINATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP ON THOSE CERTAIN OUTSTANDING SWAP CONTRACTS AMOUNTING TO $500 MILLION NOTIONAL AMOUNT BY SETTLING SUCH SWAP CONTRACTS. THE NET SETTLEMENT AND TERMINATION OF THOSE SWAP CONTRACTS RESULTED IN A NET LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION. SEE NOTE 11 FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO REDUCTIONS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE. ADDITIONALLY, WE RE-DESIGNATED $500 MILLION 10-YEAR NOTIONAL AMOUNT FORWARD STARTING SWAPS TO CERTAIN OF OUR 30-YEAR OUTSTANDING FIXED RATE NOTES, RESULTING IN A GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY $29 MILLION. IN ADDITION, IN 2017, WE ENTERED INTO AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY SETTLED, $500 MILLION NOTIONAL TREASURY LOCKS ON 30-YEAR DEBT, RESULTING IN A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION.WE HAD OUTSTANDING FORWARD STARTING SWAPS WITH EFFECTIVE DATES IN 2017 AND 2018 AND MATURING IN TEN YEARS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS AS SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW: NOTIONAL AMOUNT DECEMBER 31, 2017 DECEMBER 31, 2016FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS: FORWARD STARTING SWAPS WITH EFFECTIVE DATES IN 2017$— $500FORWARD STARTING SWAPS WITH EFFECTIVE DATES IN 2018— 500INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS: FROM TIME TO TIME WE HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN DEBT OBLIGATIONS THROUGH THE USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. THE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED HEDGES OF THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE NOTES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN BENCHMARK INTEREST RATES. GAINS OR LOSSES RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING DEBT ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEDGED BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE RISK ARE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME WITHIN INTEREST (EXPENSE) WITH AN ASSOCIATED OFFSET TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTES RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. SINCE THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE SWAP ARE INTENDED TO MATCH THOSE OF THE DEBT BEING HEDGED ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP ARE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME WITHIN INTEREST (EXPENSE) WITH AN ASSOCIATED OFFSET TO THE DERIVATIVE ASSET OR LIABILITY ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE IS NO NET IMPACT RECORDED IN INCOME. ANY NET INTEREST PAYMENTS MADE OR RECEIVED ON INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. IF A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED FOR AN INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACT, ACCUMULATED GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACT ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OR INCREASE OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY HEDGED DEBT OBLIGATIONS.THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF OUR OUTSTANDING INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016: WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SWAP CONTRACTS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF CERTAIN OF OUR FIXED RATE NOTES IN 2017 AND 2016 AND ALSO TERMINATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP BY SETTLING CERTAIN OF THOSE SWAP CONTRACTS DURING 2017 AND 2016. IN 2017, WE TERMINATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP ON CERTAIN OUTSTANDING SWAP CONTRACTS AMOUNTING TO $200 MILLION NOTIONAL AMOUNT BY SETTLING SUCH SWAP CONTRACTS. IN JULY 2016, WE TERMINATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP ON ALL OF OUR THEN OUTSTANDING SWAP CONTRACTS, AMOUNTING TO $3.6 BILLION NOTIONAL AMOUNT, BY SETTLING SUCH SWAP CONTRACTS. THE SETTLEMENT OF SWAP CONTRACTS RESULTED IN THE RECEIPT OF NET PROCEEDS OF $3 MILLION AND $196 MILLION DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE NOTES. SEE NOTE 11 FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO REDUCTIONS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE.A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO MEASURE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR DEBT AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS FROM A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES INDICATED THAT A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET PAYABLE BY $1.3 BILLION. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET PAYABLE BY $1.5 BILLION.59ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSEXECUTIVE SUMMARYCELGENE CORPORATION, TOGETHER WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY “WE,” “OUR,” “US,” “CELGENE” OR THE “COMPANY”), IS AN INTEGRATED GLOBAL BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY ENGAGED PRIMARILY IN THE DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF INNOVATIVE THERAPIES FOR THE TREATMENT OF CANCER AND INFLAMMATORY DISEASES THROUGH NEXT-GENERATION SOLUTIONS IN PROTEIN HOMEOSTASIS, IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY, EPIGENETICS, IMMUNOLOGY AND NEURO-INFLAMMATION.

IN JULY 2017, CELGENE CORPORATION ENTERED INTO GLOBAL STRATEGIC IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY COLLABORATION WITH BEIGENE, LTD. (BEIGENE) TO ADVANCE A PD-1 INHIBITOR (BGB-A317) PROGRAM FOR SOLID TUMOR CANCERS. IN COLLABORATION WITH BLUEBIRD BIO, BB2121, A BCMA CAR T CELL THERAPY, HAS SHOWN IMPRESSIVE EFFICACY IN RRMM WITH A MANAGEABLE SAFETY PROFILE. BREAKTHROUGH THERAPY DESIGNATION HAS BEEN GRANTED BY THE FDA AND BB2121 HAS BEEN GIVEN ACCESS TO THE PRIORITY MEDICINES SCHEME BY THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY (EMA) COMMITTEE FOR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE (CHMP). A PIVOTAL STUDY IN RRMM WAS INITIATED IN DECEMBER 2017.BEYOND OUR PHASE III PROGRAMS, WE HAVE ACCESS TO A GROWING EARLY-TO-MID-STAGE PIPELINE OF NOVEL POTENTIAL THERAPIES TO ADDRESS SIGNIFICANT UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS THAT CONSISTS OF NEW DRUG CANDIDATES AND CELL THERAPIES DEVELOPED IN-HOUSE, LICENSED FROM OTHER COMPANIES OR ABLE TO BE OPTIONED FROM COLLABORATION PARTNERS. WE BELIEVE THAT CONTINUED USE OF OUR PRIMARY COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS, PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS, DEPTH OF OUR PRODUCT PIPELINE, POTENTIAL REGULATORY APPROVALS OF NEW PRODUCTS AND NEW INDICATIONS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS WILL PROVIDE THE CATALYSTS FOR FUTURE GROWTH.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 2017 TAX ACT: IN DECEMBER 2017, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED U.S. TAX REFORM LEGISLATION (2017 TAX ACT), WHICH INCLUDES A BROAD RANGE OF PROVISIONS, MANY OF WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN PREVIOUS U.S. TAX LAW. CHANGES IN TAX LAW ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PERIOD OF ENACTMENT. AS SUCH, THE 2017 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFLECT THE IMMEDIATE TAX EFFECT OF THE 2017 TAX ACT, WHICH WAS ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22, 2017. THE 2017 TAX ACT CONTAINS SEVERAL KEY PROVISIONS INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS:•A ONE-TIME TAX ON THE MANDATORY DEEMED REPATRIATION OF POST-1986 UNTAXED FOREIGN EARNINGS AND PROFITS (E&P), REFERRED TO AS THE TOLL CHARGE;•REDUCTION IN THE CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21% FOR TAX YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2017;•INTRODUCTION OF A NEW U.S. TAX ON CERTAIN OFF-SHORE EARNINGS REFERRED TO AS GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW-TAXED INCOME (GILTI) AT AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 10.5% FOR TAX YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2017 (INCREASING TO 13.125% FOR TAX YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2025) WITH A PARTIAL OFFSET BY FOREIGN TAX CREDITS; AND •INTRODUCTION OF A TERRITORIAL TAX SYSTEM BEGINNING IN 2018 BY PROVIDING A 100% DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION ON CERTAIN QUALIFIED DIVIDENDS FROM FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.34DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017, WE RECORDED AN INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $1,269 MILLION, WHICH WAS COMPRISED OF THE FOLLOWING:•AN INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $1,890 MILLION FOR THE ONE-TIME DEEMED REPATRIATION OF E&P.

THIS DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN ROYALTY REVENUE FROM NOVARTIS AG (NOVARTIS) BASED UPON ITS SALES OF BOTH RITALIN® AND FOCALIN XR®, BOTH OF WHICH HAVE BEEN UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED BY GENERIC COMPETITION IN CERTAIN MARKETS. BEGINNING IN FISCAL 2018, WE ARE NO LONGER ENTITLED TO RECEIVE ROYALTIES ON RITALIN® AND FOCALIN XR®.OTHER REVENUE DECREASED BY $51 MILLION TO $44 MILLION FOR 2016 COMPARED TO 2015 PRIMARILY DUE TO A $36 MILLION DECREASE IN ROYALTY REVENUE FROM NOVARTIS BASED UPON ITS SALES OF BOTH RITALIN® AND FOCALIN XR®, BOTH OF WHICH WERE UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED BY GENERIC COMPETITION IN CERTAIN MARKETS.GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR GOVERNMENT REBATES, CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES, SALES DISCOUNTS, AND SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES.REVLIMID®, POMALYST® AND THALOMID® ARE DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES UNDER THE REVLIMID RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY (REMS), POMALYST REMS® AND THALOMID REMS® PROGRAMS, RESPECTIVELY. THESE ARE PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®, POMALYST® AND THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID®, THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENE® AND IMNOVID® ARE DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL AUTHORITIES’ SPECIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE FOR THE PRODUCT’S SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. OTEZLA®, ABRAXANE®, ISTODAX® AND VIDAZA® ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® AND THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENE®. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF THE REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE ALSO ANALYZE ACTUAL BILLINGS RECEIVED FROM THE STATES TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE ACCRUAL RATES. MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT’S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP 39RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL INVOICES. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES.REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE RECORD A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY.CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE INCLUDED IN CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS AND ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA.SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS.WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. AS NOTED ABOVE, REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® AND THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENE® ARE DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY SUBJECT TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY.SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BELOW FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS.40GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS AND THE BALANCE IN THE RELATED ALLOWANCE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2016 AND 2015 WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS):A COMPARISON OF PROVISIONS FOR ALLOWANCES FOR SALES WITHIN EACH OF THE FOUR CATEGORIES NOTED ABOVE FOR 2017 AND 2016 FOLLOWS:2017 COMPARED TO 2016: GOVERNMENT REBATE PROVISIONS INCREASED BY $202 MILLION FOR 2017 COMPARED TO 2016, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $122 MILLION INCREASE IN THE U.S. MARKET AND AN $80 MILLION INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT REBATES.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2017 WAS 31.8%, AN INCREASE OF 16.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 15.7% FOR 2016. THE INCREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A 29.4 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE RELATED TO THE ONE-TIME TAX EFFECTS OF THE 2017 TAX ACT, WHICH WAS ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22, 2017. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION DEDUCTIONS, FOR WHICH OUR 2017 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS REDUCED BY 6.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS (SEE NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K), U.S. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND ORPHAN DRUG TAX CREDITS, FOR WHICH OUR 2017 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS REDUCED BY 1.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS, AND AN INCREASE IN PRE-TAX EARNINGS FROM JURISDICTIONS WITH LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES, ALL OF WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NON-RECURRING PRIOR YEAR TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO A LOSS ON OUR INVESTMENT IN AVILA. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN 2017 FOR U.S. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND ORPHAN DRUG TAX CREDITS WERE THE RESULT OF A CHANGE IN ESTIMATE UPON COMPLETION OF A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS (SEE NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K).OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS A FUNCTION OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRE-TAX INCOME AMONG THE MANY JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. OUR PRE-TAX INCOME IS EARNED AND TAXED IN EITHER THE U.S. AT A STATUTORY TAX RATE OF 35%, OR OUTSIDE THE U.S. AT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES. OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS EXPECTED TO BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED BY THE 2017 TAX ACT, WHICH, AMONG OTHER CHANGES, REDUCES THE U.S. CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21% AND INTRODUCES A NEW U.S. TAX ON CERTAIN OFF-SHORE EARNINGS REFERRED TO AS GILTI AT AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 10.5% FOR TAX YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2017 (INCREASING TO 13.125% FOR TAX YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2025). SEE NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER DETAILS RELATED TO THE 2017 TAX ACT. OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE CAN ALSO BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED BY SHIFTS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRE-TAX INCOME AMONG THE JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE OPERATE, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF TAX BENEFITS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION, PAYMENTS TO COLLABORATION PARTNERS, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, AUDIT SETTLEMENTS, AND MANY OTHER FACTORS WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST. THE INCOME TAX PROVISION DECREASED BY $48 MILLION TO $373 MILLION IN 2016 COMPARED TO 2015 AS A RESULT OF A DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INCOME BEFORE TAXES. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2016 WAS 15.7%. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2015 WAS 20.8%. THE 5.1 PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2016 COMPARED TO 2015 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO A LOSS ON OUR INVESTMENT IN AVILA, OFFSET BY A NON-DEDUCTIBLE PRE-TAX CHARGE RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF ACETYLON AND NON-RECURRING CHARGES TO TAX EXPENSE RECORDED IN 2015 RELATED TO BOTH THE GLOBAL MIX OF FUNDING SOURCES FOR PAYMENTS TO COLLABORATION PARTNERS, PRIMARILY THE INITIATION OF OUR COLLABORATIONS WITH ASTRAZENECA PLC (ASTRAZENECA) AND JUNO, AND AN INCREASE IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OBTAINED IN OUR ACQUISITION OF RECEPTOS, INC. (RECEPTOS).46LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESTHE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE COMPONENTS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2016 AND 2015 (IN MILLIONS):1 INCLUDES CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET OF ALLOWANCES, INVENTORY AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, LESS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES, AND THE CURRENT PORTION OF INCOME TAXES PAYABLE.WE RELY PRIMARILY ON POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND BORROWINGS IN THE FORM OF LONG-TERM NOTES PAYABLE AND SHORT-TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER TO PROVIDE FOR OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. WE EXPECT CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR EXPENDITURES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TRIALS, COMMERCIALIZATION OF NEW PRODUCTS, INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND EXISTING SOURCES OF AND ACCESS TO FINANCING ARE ADEQUATE TO FUND OUR OPERATING NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AND OUR PLANS TO PURCHASE OUR STOCK AND PURSUE STRATEGIC BUSINESS INITIATIVES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE HELD INTERNATIONALLY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE HELD APPROXIMATELY $6.0 BILLION OF THESE SHORT-TERM FUNDS IN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS. AS A RESULT OF THE 2017 TAX ACT AND THE TOLL CHARGE, WE EXPECT TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS CASH WITH MINIMAL TO NO ADDITIONAL U.S. TAX IMPACT. THEREFORE, WE NO LONGER CONSIDER THESE FUNDS PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OFFSHORE. THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS HELD IN U.S. TAX JURISDICTIONS CAN FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS FOR OTHER REASONS, SUCH AS REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, INTERNAL REORGANIZATIONS, BUSINESS-DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, RESTRICTIONS ON DISTRIBUTIONS OUT OF FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS AND DEBT ISSUANCES. AS PART OF OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY ASSESSMENTS, WE REGULARLY MONITOR THE MIX OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CASH FLOWS (BOTH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS). UNDER THE 2017 TAX ACT, A COMPANY’S POST-1986 PREVIOUSLY UNTAXED FOREIGN E&P ARE MANDATORILY DEEMED TO BE REPATRIATED AND TAXED, WHICH IS ALSO REFERRED TO AS THE TOLL CHARGE. THE TOLL CHARGE IS ASSESSED REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT A COMPANY HAS CASH IN ITS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THE COMPANY WILL ACTUALLY BRING BACK ITS ACCUMULATED UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS. HOWEVER, THE CHARGE CAN BE PAID IN INSTALLMENTS OVER EIGHT YEARS. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017, WE RECORDED AN INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $1,890 MILLION WHICH REPRESENTS THE TOLL CHARGE LIABILITY FOR THE DEEMED REPATRIATION OF E&P. WE HAVE ELECTED TO PAY THE TOLL CHARGE IN INSTALLMENTS OVER EIGHT YEARS, OR THROUGH 2025. HOWEVER, THE TOLL CHARGE LIABILITY IS NOT DISCOUNTED ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS SUCH, WE HAVE RECORDED $1,732 MILLION AND $150 MILLION AS A NON-CURRENT AND CURRENT INCOME TAX LIABILITY, RESPECTIVELY, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017. IN PRIOR YEARS, WE RECORDED U.S. DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES OF $317 MILLION FOR CERTAIN OFFSHORE EARNINGS THAT WERE EXPECTED TO BE REMITTED TO OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS. THESE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES REDUCED THE INCOME TAX EXPENSE RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017 FOR THE TOLL CHARGE. THE REMAINING AMOUNTS EARNED OVERSEAS WERE EXPECTED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND THEREFORE, NO ACCRUAL FOR U.S. TAXES WAS PROVIDED. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM: SINCE APRIL 2009, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED AN AGGREGATE $20.5 BILLION COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF WHICH WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $822 MILLION REMAINING FOR FUTURE REPURCHASES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017. DURING 2017, WE USED $3.9 BILLION FOR REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, MEASURED ON A SETTLEMENT DATE BASIS.47COMPONENTS OF WORKING CAPITALCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: WE INVEST OUR EXCESS CASH PRIMARILY IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS, REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, TIME DEPOSITS, COMMERCIAL PAPER, U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (MBS), AN ULTRA SHORT INCOME FUND, GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, ASSET BACKED SECURITIES AND ULTRA-SHORT INCOME FUND INVESTMENTS. ALL LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND ALL INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. SEE NOTE 6 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THE $4.1 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 COMPARED TO 2016 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO APPROXIMATELY $5.2 BILLION OF CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND $611 MILLION OF NET UNREALIZED HOLDING GAINS ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION OF NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES.MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. FOR MORE INFORMATION RELATED TO THE FAIR VALUE AND VALUATION OF OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES, SEE NOTE 4 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

SALES MADE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES TYPICALLY HAVE PAYMENT TERMS THAT ARE GREATER THAN 60 DAYS, THEREBY EXTENDING COLLECTION PERIODS BEYOND THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE EXPECT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE TO GROW AS OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES CONTINUE TO EXPAND.WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES, THE SOVEREIGN DEBT SITUATION IN CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND ASSOCIATED IMPACTS ON THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OUR BUSINESS. OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL IN THESE MARKETS IS TYPICALLY TO SELL OUR HEMATOLOGY AND ONCOLOGY PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO PRINCIPALLY GOVERNMENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED HOSPITALS, WHICH IN TURN DIRECTLY DELIVER CRITICAL CARE TO PATIENTS. MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE USED TO TREAT LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES AND WE BELIEVE THIS BUSINESS MODEL ENABLES TIMELY DELIVERY AND ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS. MANY OF THE OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE RELATED TO GOVERNMENT-FUNDED HOSPITALS AND WE BELIEVE THE RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE ULTIMATELY COLLECTIBLE. SIMILARLY, WE BELIEVE THAT FUTURE SALES TO THESE CUSTOMERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE COLLECTIBLE.INVENTORY: INVENTORY BALANCES INCREASED BY $43 MILLION TO $541 MILLION AT THE END OF 2017 COMPARED TO 2016. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS: OTHER CURRENT ASSETS DECREASED BY $391 MILLION TO $388 MILLION AT THE END OF 2017 COMPARED TO 2016 PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES OF $347 MILLION IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND $112 MILLION IN PREPAID TAXES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $68 MILLION OF NET OTHER INCREASES.COMMERCIAL PAPER: WE HAVE A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM (PROGRAM) UNDER WHICH WE ISSUE UNSECURED COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES (COMMERCIAL PAPER) ON A PRIVATE PLACEMENT BASIS, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH ARE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. IN APRIL 2016, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED AN INCREASE IN THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUABLE TO $2.0 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE HAD AVAILABLE CAPACITY TO ISSUE UP TO $2.0 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS UNDER THE PROGRAM. THE MATURITIES OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MAY VARY, BUT MAY NOT EXCEED 270 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ISSUE. THE COMMERCIAL PAPER IS SOLD UNDER CUSTOMARY TERMS TO A DEALER OR IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET AND IS ISSUED AT A DISCOUNT FROM PAR OR, ALTERNATIVELY, IS SOLD AT PAR AND BEARS VARYING INTEREST RATES ON A FIXED OR FLOATING BASIS. BORROWINGS UNDER THE PROGRAM, IF ANY, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS.SENIOR UNSECURED CREDIT FACILITY: WE MAINTAIN A SENIOR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (CREDIT FACILITY) THAT PROVIDES REVOLVING CREDIT IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $2.0 BILLION, WHICH WAS INCREASED FROM $1.8 BILLION IN APRIL 2016. WE EXTENDED THE CREDIT FACILITY IN APRIL 2017 FROM APRIL 17, 2021 TO APRIL 17, 2022. AMOUNTS MAY BE BORROWED IN U.S. DOLLARS FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE CREDIT FACILITY CURRENTLY SERVES AS BACKUP LIQUIDITY FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, THERE WAS NO OUTSTANDING BORROWING AGAINST THE CREDIT FACILITY.THE CREDIT FACILITY AND THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAIN AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS, INCLUDING CERTAIN CUSTOMARY FINANCIAL COVENANTS. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL FINANCIAL COVENANTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017.48ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES: ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES INCREASED BY $466 MILLION TO APPROXIMATELY $2.8 BILLION AT THE END OF 2017 COMPARED TO 2016. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES OF $250 MILLION FOR SALES ADJUSTMENT ACCRUALS, $188 MILLION OF ONE-TIME CHARGES RELATED TO GED-0301 WIND-DOWN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DISCONTINUING THE TRIALS AND CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, $92 MILLION FOR CLINICAL TRIALS AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE ACCRUALS, $73 MILLION FOR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER ACCRUALS, $64 MILLION FOR DERIVATIVE ACCRUALS, $39 MILLION RELATED TO COLLABORATION AGREEMENT ACCRUALS AND $15 MILLION FOR CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION ACCRUALS, WHICH INCLUDES THE NET CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE (SEE NOTE 4 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K) AS WELL AS TRANSFERS FROM LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $199 MILLION LITIGATION-RELATED LOSS CONTINGENCY ACCRUAL RECORDED IN 2016 (SEE NOTE 18 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K) AND A DECREASE OF $56 MILLION FOR COMPENSATION RELATED ACCRUALS. INCOME TAXES PAYABLE (CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT): INCOME TAXES PAYABLE INCREASED BY $2.1 BILLION TO APPROXIMATELY $2.6 BILLION AT THE END OF 2017 COMPARED TO 2016, PRIMARILY FROM THE CURRENT PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES OF $2.7 BILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCOME TAX PAYMENTS OF $0.5 BILLION AND INCOME TAX RECEIVABLES OF $0.1 BILLION.

NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION TO APPROXIMATELY $4.2 BILLION IN 2016 COMPARED TO 2015. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE IN NET INCOME OF $397 MILLION IN 2016 COMPARED TO 2015, WHICH INCLUDED A $492 MILLION NET INCREASE IN ADJUSTMENTS TO RECONCILE NET INCOME TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR ITEMS SUCH AS IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES, CHANGES IN DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES COMPARED TO 2015. DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES DURING 2016 INCLUDED CASH RECEIPTS OF $196 MILLION RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS THAT HAD BEEN DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF CERTAIN OF OUR FIXED RATE NOTES. INCREASES IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WERE ALSO DRIVEN BY A $420 MILLION INCREASE IN CHANGE IN OTHER OPERATING ASSETS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A $298 MILLION DECREASE IN PREPAID TAXES AND A $92 MILLION INCREASE IN CHANGE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER OPERATING LIABILITIES PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE OF $199 MILLION OF ACCRUED EXPENSES RELATED TO A LITIGATION-RELATED LOSS CONTINGENCY ACCRUAL AS WELL AS OTHER BALANCE SHEET FLUCTUATIONS.INVESTING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $1.9 BILLION IN 2017 COMPARED TO 2016. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE APPROXIMATELY $2.5 BILLION OF NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DURING 2017 COMPARED TO $648 MILLION OF NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DURING 2016.NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $5.3 BILLION IN 2016 COMPARED TO 2015. THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE PURCHASES OF RECEPTOS AND QUANTICEL IN 2015 WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING PURCHASE IN 2016, RESULTING IN A CASH USAGE OF APPROXIMATELY $7.7 BILLION DURING 2015, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY NET PURCHASES AND SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE. NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE DURING 2016 AMOUNTED TO A NET CASH USAGE OF $648 MILLION DURING 2016 COMPARED TO NET CASH PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.9 BILLION FROM NET SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE DURING 2015.49FINANCING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DECREASED BY $250 MILLION IN 2017 COMPARED TO 2016. THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCEEDS FROM THE AUGUST 2017 AND NOVEMBER 2017 DEBT ISSUANCES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS IN AUGUST 2017 AND DEBT REDEMPTIONS IN DECEMBER 2017. IN AUGUST 2017, WE ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL $500 MILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2.250% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2021 AND RECEIVED NET CASH PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $496 MILLION. IN AUGUST 2017, WE REPAID THE 1.900% SENIOR NOTES WITH A PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $500 MILLION UPON MATURITY. IN NOVEMBER 2017, WE ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL $3.0 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $750 MILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2.750% DUE 2023, $1.0 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.450% DUE 2027 AND $1.250 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 4.350% DUE 2047 AND RECEIVED NET CASH PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $3.0 BILLION. IN DECEMBER 2017, WE PAID APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION TO REDEEM ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING $1.0 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2.125% SENIOR NOTES AND $400 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2.300% SENIOR NOTES, EACH MATURING IN AUGUST 2018. SEE NOTE 11 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS. IN ADDITION TO THE DEBT ACTIVITY, NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DECREASED DUE TO THE APPROXIMATELY $3.8 BILLION OF PAYMENTS UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DURING 2017 COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $2.2 BILLION OF PAYMENTS UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DURING 2016.NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION IN 2016 COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $4.3 BILLION IN 2015. THE APPROXIMATELY $6.1 BILLION DECREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE 2015 ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT WHICH PROVIDED APPROXIMATELY $7.9 BILLION.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSTHE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 (IN MILLIONS):SENIOR NOTES: THE SENIOR NOTE OBLIGATION AMOUNTS INCLUDE FUTURE PRINCIPAL OF $15.850 BILLION AND INTEREST PAYMENTS FOR BOTH CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017. SEE NOTE 11 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS.OPERATING LEASES: WE LEASE OFFICE AND RESEARCH FACILITIES UNDER VARIOUS OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE NON-CANCELABLE LEASE TERMS FOR OPERATING LEASES EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES BETWEEN 2018 AND 2025 AND INCLUDE RENEWAL OPTIONS. IN GENERAL, WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE LESSORS FOR REAL ESTATE TAXES, INSURANCE, UTILITIES, MAINTENANCE AND OTHER OPERATING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEASES. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE MAJOR FACILITIES THAT WE OCCUPY UNDER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS REFER TO PART I, ITEM 2. "PROPERTIES" OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS: OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS OF $795 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 PRIMARILY INCLUDED $748 MILLION IN CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPLY CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE COMMITTED TO INVEST AN AGGREGATE $47 MILLION IN INVESTMENT FUNDS, WHICH ARE CALLABLE AT ANY TIME.2017 TAX ACT: UNDER THE 2017 TAX ACT, A COMPANY’S POST-1986 PREVIOUSLY UNTAXED FOREIGN E&P ARE MANDATORILY DEEMED TO BE REPATRIATED AND TAXED, WHICH IS ALSO REFERRED TO AS THE TOLL CHARGE. THE TOLL CHARGE IS ASSESSED REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT A COMPANY HAS CASH IN ITS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THE COMPANY WILL ACTUALLY BRING BACK ITS ACCUMULATED UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS. HOWEVER, THE CHARGE CAN BE PAID IN INSTALLMENTS OVER EIGHT YEARS. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017, WE RECORDED AN INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $1,890 MILLION WHICH REPRESENTS THE TOLL CHARGE LIABILITY FOR THE DEEMED REPATRIATION OF E&P. WE HAVE ELECTED TO PAY THE TOLL CHARGE IN INSTALLMENTS OVER EIGHT YEARS, OR THROUGH 2025. HOWEVER, THE TOLL CHARGE LIABILITY IS NOT DISCOUNTED ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS SUCH, WE HAVE RECORDED $1,732 MILLION AND $150 MILLION AS A NON-CURRENT AND CURRENT INCOME TAX LIABILITY, RESPECTIVELY, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017. COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS AND ACQUIRED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSETS: WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES AND HAVE ACQUIRED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSETS FROM THIRD PARTIES WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE MILESTONE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED DEVELOPMENTAL, REGULATORY AND/OR COMMERCIAL TARGETS. OUR OBLIGATION TO FUND THESE EFFORTS IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROGRAMS AND/OR 50THE LACK OF ANY ADVERSE EVENTS WHICH COULD CAUSE THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE PROGRAMS. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE ATTAINMENT OF SPECIFIED DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY APPROVAL AND SALES-BASED MILESTONES OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND ACCORDINGLY, NO AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED FOR THESE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016 CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. POTENTIAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS (NOT INCLUDING POTENTIAL ROYALTY PAYMENTS) TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $10.7 BILLION, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $5.6 BILLION CONTINGENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF VARIOUS RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES AND APPROXIMATELY $5.1 BILLION IN SALES-BASED MILESTONES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR ACQUISITIONS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSETS AND COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS, SEE NOTE 2 AND NOTE 17, RESPECTIVELY, OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS: WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT THE TIMING OF TAX SETTLEMENTS RELATED TO OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS TAX AUDITS CAN INVOLVE COMPLEX ISSUES AND THE RESOLUTION OF THOSE ISSUES MAY SPAN MULTIPLE YEARS, PARTICULARLY IF SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATION OR LITIGATION. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE NOT INCLUDED OBLIGATIONS FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS IN OUR TABLE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS (SEE NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K).NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSFOR A DISCUSSION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS PLEASE SEE NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IS ONE THAT IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENT'S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL:REVENUE RECOGNITION: REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS OF THE PRODUCT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER AND THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED AND DETERMINABLE. PROVISIONS FOR DISCOUNTS, EARLY PAYMENTS, REBATES, SALES RETURNS AND DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS UNDER TERMS CUSTOMARY IN THE INDUSTRY ARE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SAME PERIOD THE RELATED SALES ARE RECORDED. WE RECORD ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SALE. THE ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR SUCH VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES ARE BASED ON THE SALES TERMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND TREND ANALYSIS.WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM ROYALTIES BASED ON LICENSEES' SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS USING OUR TECHNOLOGIES. ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACT TERMS WHEN ROYALTIES FROM LICENSEES CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED. IF ROYALTIES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR COLLECTABILITY OF A ROYALTY AMOUNT IS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED, ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE CASH IS RECEIVED.GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES, SALES DISCOUNTS, GOVERNMENT REBATES, CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES.REVLIMID®, POMALYST® AND THALOMID® ARE DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES UNDER THE REVLIMID REMS®, POMALYST REMS® AND THALOMID REMS® PROGRAMS, RESPECTIVELY. THESE ARE PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®, POMALYST® AND THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID®, THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENE® AND IMNOVID® ARE DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL AUTHORITIES’ SPECIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE FOR THE PRODUCT’S SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. OTEZLA®, ABRAXANE®, ISTODAX®, VIDAZA® AND IDHIFA® ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® AND THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENE®. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF THE REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED 51HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE ALSO ANALYZE ACTUAL BILLINGS RECEIVED FROM THE STATES TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE ACCRUAL RATES. MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT’S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL INVOICES. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES.REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE RECORD A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY.CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE INCLUDED IN CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS AND ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA.SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS.WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. AS NOTED ABOVE, REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® AND THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENE® ARE DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY SUBJECT TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY.ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: WE ESTIMATE AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, HISTORICAL PAYMENT PATTERNS, AGING OF RECEIVABLE BALANCES AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF COUNTRIES THEMSELVES AND PROVINCES OR AREAS WITHIN SUCH COUNTRIES WHERE THEY ARE THE ULTIMATE CUSTOMERS.INCOME TAXES: WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. WE PROVIDE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME PORTION OR ALL OF A DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL NOT BE REALIZED.WE ACCOUNT FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS PART OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THESE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATE PRIMARILY TO ISSUES COMMON AMONG MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE APPLY A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES WHICH INCLUDE STUDIES PERFORMED BY INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS, ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY AND SUBJECT EXPERTS, EVALUATION OF PUBLIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. WE PROVIDE ESTIMATES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. IF OUR ESTIMATES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ACTUAL OUTCOMES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED.WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE A PORTION WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR RECENT CUMULATIVE EARNINGS EXPERIENCE BY TAXING JURISDICTION, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, CARRYFORWARD PERIODS AVAILABLE TO US FOR TAX REPORTING PURPOSES, VARIOUS INCOME TAX STRATEGIES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT AND, TO THE EXTENT FUTURE EXPECTATIONS CHANGE, WE WOULD HAVE TO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THAT TIME. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES.52SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION: WE UTILIZE SHARE BASED COMPENSATION IN THE FORM OF STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, OR RSUS, AND PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, OR PSUS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARDS AT GRANT DATE. COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED REFLECTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF AWARDS EXPECTED TO VEST AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AN ESTIMATE OF AWARD FORFEITURES BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE VESTING PERIOD REQUIRED TO OBTAIN FULL VESTING. MANAGEMENT EXPECTATIONS RELATED TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PERFORMANCE GOALS ASSOCIATED WITH PSU GRANTS IS ASSESSED REGULARLY AND THAT ASSESSMENT IS USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER PSU GRANTS ARE EXPECTED TO VEST. IF PERFORMANCE-BASED MILESTONES RELATED TO PSU GRANTS ARE NOT MET OR NOT EXPECTED TO BE MET, ANY COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED TO DATE ASSOCIATED WITH GRANTS THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO VEST WILL BE REVERSED.OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES: A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF ANY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY BELOW ITS COST THAT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN CARRYING AMOUNT TO FAIR VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT IS CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AND A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE SECURITY ESTABLISHED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INCLUDE: SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE ISSUER'S EARNINGS PERFORMANCE, CREDIT RATING, ASSET QUALITY, BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE ISSUER OPERATES, LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW OUR COST, OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE SECURITY, OUR INTENT NOT TO SELL, AN EVALUATION AS TO WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO SELL BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR COST BASIS, AND ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ISSUER'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD DIFFER FROM OUR ASSESSMENT.DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES: ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN CURRENT EARNINGS OR OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), DEPENDING ON WHETHER A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION AND, IF IT IS, THE TYPE OF HEDGING TRANSACTION. FOR A DERIVATIVE TO QUALIFY AS A HEDGE AT INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE HEDGED PERIOD, WE FORMALLY DOCUMENT THE NATURE AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEM. WE ASSESS, BOTH AT INCEPTION AND ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WHETHER DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING THE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER PROBABLE OF OCCURRING, WE DISCONTINUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING AND ANY RELATED UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE NOT DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION, TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE, OUR STOCK PRICE AND INTEREST RATES. THE USE OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE EXPOSURE OF THESE RISKS WITH THE INTENT TO REDUCE OUR RISK OR COST.PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE NO. 2017-12, "DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING" (ASU 2017-12), WE WERE REQUIRED TO SEPARATELY MEASURE AND REFLECT THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT DID NOT OFFSET THE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS, WHICH WAS REFERRED TO AS THE INEFFECTIVE AMOUNT. WE ASSESSED HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND RECORDED THE GAIN OR LOSS RELATED TO THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IF ANY, IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF ASU 2017-12, WE ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED TO SEPARATELY MEASURE AND RECOGNIZE HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS. UPON ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-12, WE NO LONGER RECOGNIZE HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, BUT WE INSTEAD RECOGNIZE THE ENTIRE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF:•CASH FLOW HEDGES INCLUDED IN THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS). THE AMOUNTS RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) WILL SUBSEQUENTLY BE RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME LINE ITEM IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AS IMPACTED BY THE HEDGED ITEM WHEN THE HEDGED ITEM AFFECTS EARNINGS; AND•FAIR VALUE HEDGES INCLUDED IN THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IN THE SAME LINE ITEM IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME THAT IS USED TO PRESENT THE EARNINGS EFFECT OF THE HEDGED ITEM.PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-12, WE EXCLUDED OPTION PREMIUMS AND FORWARD POINTS (EXCLUDED COMPONENTS) FROM OUR ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS FOR OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE CASH FLOW HEDGES. WE RECOGNIZED ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE EXCLUDED COMPONENTS IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THE AMENDMENTS IN ASU 2017-12 CONTINUE TO ALLOW THOSE COMPONENTS TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS, WHICH WE HAVE ELECTED TO CONTINUE TO APPLY. PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF ASU 2017-12, WE NO LONGER RECOGNIZE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE EXCLUDED COMPONENTS IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET, BUT WE INSTEAD RECOGNIZE THE INITIAL VALUE OF THE EXCLUDED COMPONENT ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LIFE OF THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT, WITHIN THE SAME LINE ITEM IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME THAT IS USED TO PRESENT THE EARNINGS EFFECT OF THE HEDGED ITEM.53INVESTMENTS IN OTHER ENTITIES: WE HOLD A PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER EITHER THE EQUITY METHOD OR COST METHOD. INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES OR CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS OVER WHICH WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD, WITH OUR SHARE OF EARNINGS OR LOSSES REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES OF COMPANIES THAT BECOME PUBLICLY TRADED AND ARE NOT CLASSIFIED AS EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES PROSPECTIVELY FROM THE DATE OF SUCH COMPANIES' INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING.OUR COST METHOD AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.ALL INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT. IF AN INVESTMENT'S FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN ITS NET CARRYING VALUE AND THE DECLINE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE. SUCH AN EVALUATION IS JUDGMENTAL AND DEPENDENT ON SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE HAS OCCURRED INCLUDE: MARKET VALUE OR EXIT PRICE OF THE INVESTMENT BASED ON EITHER MARKET-QUOTED PRICES OR FUTURE ROUNDS OF FINANCING BY THE INVESTEE; LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE MARKET VALUE WAS BELOW ITS COST BASIS; FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE INVESTEE; OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT; ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INVESTEE'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN; ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE MAY BE AWARE OF RELATED TO THE INVESTMENT.ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, OR LTIP, DESIGNED TO PROVIDE KEY OFFICERS AND EXECUTIVES WITH PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES CONTINGENT UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED CORPORATE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES COVERING A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE HAD RECORDED LIABILITIES FOR THREE SEPARATE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLES RUNNING CONCURRENTLY AND ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2018 AND 2019. PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR EACH OF THE PERFORMANCE CYCLES ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS: 37.5% ON NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE (AS DEFINED IN THE LTIP); 37.5% ON TOTAL NON-GAAP REVENUE (AS DEFINED IN THE LTIP); AND 25% ON RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, WHICH IS A MEASUREMENT OF OUR STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE DURING THE APPLICABLE THREE-YEAR PERIOD COMPARED WITH A GROUP OF OTHER COMPANIES IN THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.THRESHOLD, TARGET AND MAXIMUM CASH PAYOUT LEVELS ARE CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE BETWEEN 0% TO 200% OF EACH PARTICIPANT’S BASE SALARY AT THE TIME THE LTIP WAS APPROVED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE. SUCH AWARDS ARE PAYABLE IN CASH OR COMMON STOCK OR A MIXTURE OF CASH AND COMMON STOCK, WHICH WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AT THE TIME OF AWARD DELIVERY. SHARE-BASED PAYOUT LEVELS ARE CALCULATED USING THE CASH-BASED THRESHOLD, TARGET AND MAXIMUM LEVELS, DIVIDED BY THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE OF CELGENE STOCK FOR THE 30 TRADING DAYS PRIOR TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF EACH PERFORMANCE CYCLE. THEREFORE, FINAL SHARE-BASED AWARD VALUES ARE REFLECTIVE OF THE STOCK PRICE AT THE END OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAY DETERMINE THAT PAYMENTS MADE IN COMMON STOCK ARE RESTRICTED FROM TRADING FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. WE ACCRUE THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE LIABILITY OVER EACH THREE-YEAR CYCLE. PRIOR TO THE END OF A THREE-YEAR CYCLE, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT DURING THE CYCLE. UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT EQUAL TO THEIR TARGET AWARD OR, IF HIGHER, AN AWARD BASED ON ACTUAL PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL.ACCRUALS RECORDED FOR THE LTIP ENTAIL MAKING CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE, NON-GAAP REVENUES AND RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, AS DEFINED; THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED. ACCRUALS FOR THE LTIP ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND REVISED ACCORDINGLY SO THAT THE LIABILITY RECORDED REFLECTS UPDATED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PAYOUTS. IN ESTIMATING THE ACCRUALS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DATE FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, EXPECTED RESULTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, OPERATING TRENDS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICING AND COMPETITION.VALUATION OF GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, OTHER ASSETS AND IPR&D: WE HAVE RECORDED GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IPR&D THROUGH ACQUISITIONS ACCOUNTED FOR AS BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. WHEN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING IPR&D AND TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS ARE ACQUIRED, WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS ARE TYPICALLY USED IN THESE VALUATIONS IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, AND THE MODELS REQUIRE THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:•PROJECTING REGULATORY APPROVALS;•ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM PRODUCT SALES RESULTING FROM COMPLETED PRODUCTS AND IN-PROCESS PROJECTS OR ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED; AND•DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES AND PROBABILITY RATES.GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT IS SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING. WE TEST OUR GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT BY ASSESSING QUALITATIVE 54FACTORS OR PERFORMING A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS IN DETERMINING WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ARE BELOW THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE AMORTIZED TO THEIR ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR. INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO IPR&D PRODUCT RIGHTS ARE TREATED AS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND NOT AMORTIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS APPROVED FOR SALE BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN SPECIFIED MARKETS. AT THAT TIME, WE WILL DETERMINE THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET, RECLASSIFY THE ASSET OUT OF IPR&D AND BEGIN AMORTIZATION. IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS ALSO PERFORMED AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. SUCH TEST ENTAILS COMPLETING AN UPDATED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE IPR&D ASSET. IF REQUIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES IS COMPLETED BY COMPARING AN UPDATED NON-DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO THE BOOK VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET. VALUATION OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION: WE RECORD CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION AT ITS FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE, AND FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT REPORTING PERIOD REVALUE THESE OBLIGATIONS AND RECORD INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPERATING EARNINGS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. CHANGES TO CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION OBLIGATIONS CAN RESULT FROM MOVEMENTS IN PUBLICLY TRADED SHARE PRICES OF CVRS, ADJUSTMENTS TO DISCOUNT RATES AND PERIODS, UPDATES IN THE ASSUMED ACHIEVEMENT OR TIMING OF ANY DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES OR CHANGES IN THE PROBABILITY OF CERTAIN CLINICAL EVENTS AND CHANGES IN THE ASSUMED PROBABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATORY APPROVAL. THE ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT AND ANY CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION EXPENSE RECORDED IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. OUR CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES WERE RECORDED IN THE ACQUISITIONS OF GLOUCESTER, ABRAXIS, AVILA, NOGRA, AND QUANTICEL. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE GLOUCESTER, AVILA, NOGRA, AND QUANTICEL CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE DISCOUNT RATE, PROBABILITY AND ESTIMATED TIMING OF CASH MILESTONE PAYMENTS TO THE FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OF EACH BUSINESS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ABRAXIS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY IS BASED ON THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKTHE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES FORWARD-LOOKING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RISK OF LOSS IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES, CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE EARNINGS.WE HAVE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, OUR MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS CONSISTED OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, OUR LONG-TERM DEBT AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE: AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE CONSISTED OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED (MBS) SECURITIES, GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, ASSET BACKED SECURITIES, ULTRA SHORT INCOME-FUND SECURITIES, TIME DEPOSITS AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES.

U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES INCLUDE GENERAL UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS EITHER ISSUED DIRECTLY BY OR GUARANTEED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTERPRISES. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MBS INCLUDE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION AND THE GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION. CORPORATE DEBT-GLOBAL INCLUDES OBLIGATIONS ISSUED BY INVESTMENT-GRADE CORPORATIONS, INCLUDING SOME ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN GUARANTEED BY GOVERNMENTS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. ASSET BACKED SECURITIES CONSIST OF TRIPLE-A RATED SECURITIES WITH CASH FLOWS COLLATERALIZED BY CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND AUTO LOANS. ULTRA SHORT INCOME FUND INCLUDES INVESTMENTS IN CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND CORPORATE NOTES. OUR TIME DEPOSITS AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS HAVE ORIGINAL MATURITIES GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS. OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE COLLATERALIZED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, CASH, BONDS, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND BANK CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT.OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE PRIMARILY EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN THE PUBLICLY TRADED COMMON STOCK OF COMPANIES, INCLUDING COMMON STOCK OF COMPANIES WITH WHOM WE HAVE ENTERED INTO COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE INVEST IN DEBT SECURITIES THAT ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO DEBT SECURITIES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. 55REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO EQUITY SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, FAIR VALUES AND RELATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS):DEBT OBLIGATIONSSHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT: WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING SHORT-TERM BORROWING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 OR DECEMBER 31, 2016. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016 INCLUDES (IN MILLIONS):LONG-TERM DEBT: OUR OUTSTANDING SENIOR NOTES WITH MATURITY DATES IN EXCESS OF ONE YEAR AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2017 HAVE AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $15.850 BILLION WITH VARYING MATURITY DATES AND INTEREST RATES. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS AND CARRYING VALUES OF THESE SENIOR NOTES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW (IN MILLIONS):AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SENIOR NOTES OUTSTANDING WAS $16.573 BILLION. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENTOUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN BE IMPACTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES. WE ACTIVELY MANAGE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE AND INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS THROUGH OPERATIONAL MEANS AND THROUGH THE USE OF VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION 56CONTRACTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. IN INSTANCES WHERE THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OR FAIR VALUE HEDGES WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME TERMINATE THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP. IF A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, WE GENERALLY EITHER SETTLE THE INSTRUMENT OR ENTER INTO AN OFFSETTING INSTRUMENT.FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENTWE MAINTAIN A FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS, TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.THROUGH OUR REVENUE HEDGING PROGRAM, WE ENDEAVOR TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF POSSIBLE UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON OUR FUTURE U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS THAT ARE DERIVED FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, TYPICALLY WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS, WITH A MAXIMUM OF FIVE YEARS. WE MANAGE OUR ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION EXPOSURE PRINCIPALLY WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, A COMBINATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY PUT AND CALL OPTIONS, AND OCCASIONALLY PURCHASED FOREIGN CURRENCY PUT OPTIONS.FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS: WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, MANAGE EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY IN THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS, AND REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.WE MANAGE A PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PROTECT AGAINST CHANGES IN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016 HAD SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 20 MONTHS AND 31 MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY. THE SPOT RATE COMPONENTS OF THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AND ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI) AND RECLASSIFIED TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS. IF A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED WITH RESPECT TO A FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACT, ACCUMULATED GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACT REMAIN IN OCI UNTIL THE HEDGED FORECASTED TRANSACTION OCCURS AND ARE RECLASSIFIED TO OPERATIONS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS. PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-12, THE FORWARD POINT COMPONENTS OF THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WERE EXCLUDED FROM ASSESSING EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP AND ALL FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS OF FORWARD POINT AMOUNTS WERE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. UPON ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-12, WE RECOGNIZE IN EARNINGS THE INITIAL VALUE OF THE FORWARD POINT COMPONENTS ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LIFE OF THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT WITHIN THE SAME LINE ITEM IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME THAT IS USED TO PRESENT THE EARNINGS EFFECT OF THE HEDGED ITEM. SEE NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-12.FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES WERE AS FOLLOWS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016 (IN MILLIONS):WE CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF OUR OWN AND THE COUNTERPARTIES’ CREDIT RISK ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO EXECUTE ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONTRACT ON AN ONGOING BASIS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, CREDIT RISK DID NOT MATERIALLY CHANGE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS.57WE ALSO MANAGE A PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN RECOGNIZED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE RELATED TO TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND, ACCORDINGLY, ANY CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD NON-DESIGNATED HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016 WERE $885 MILLION AND $934 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, WE BELIEVE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS A REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES. ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2017 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WOULD CHANGE BY APPROXIMATELY $260 MILLION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS EITHER HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES OR RELATE TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE ENTITIES' FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE EITHER REPORTED IN OCI AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS OR RE-MEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR LIABILITY.FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS: FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE BY UTILIZING A STRATEGY THAT INVOLVES BOTH A PURCHASED LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTION AND A WRITTEN LOCAL CURRENCY CALL OPTION THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS HEDGES OF FUTURE SALES DENOMINATED IN THAT LOCAL CURRENCY. SPECIFICALLY, WE SELL (OR WRITE) A LOCAL CURRENCY CALL OPTION AND PURCHASE A LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTION WITH THE SAME EXPIRATION DATES AND LOCAL CURRENCY NOTIONAL AMOUNTS BUT WITH DIFFERENT STRIKE PRICES. THIS COMBINATION OF TRANSACTIONS IS GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS A “COLLAR.” THE EXPIRATION DATES AND NOTIONAL AMOUNTS CORRESPOND TO THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY SALES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016 HAD SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 36 MONTHS AND 48 MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS RELATIVE TO THE CURRENCY OF THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED SALES, THE PURCHASED PUT OPTION VALUE REDUCES TO ZERO AND WE BENEFIT FROM THE INCREASE IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF OUR ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS; HOWEVER, THIS BENEFIT WOULD BE CAPPED AT THE STRIKE LEVEL OF THE WRITTEN CALL, WHICH FORMS THE UPPER END OF THE COLLAR. THE PREMIUM COLLECTED FROM THE SALE OF THE CALL OPTION IS EQUAL TO THE PREMIUM PAID FOR THE PURCHASED PUT OPTION, RESULTING IN A NET ZERO COST FOR EACH COLLAR. OUTSTANDING FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE WERE AS FOLLOWS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016:1 U.S. DOLLAR NOTIONAL AMOUNTS ARE CALCULATED AS THE HEDGED LOCAL CURRENCY AMOUNT MULTIPLIED BY THE STRIKE VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION. THE LOCAL CURRENCY NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF OUR PURCHASED PUT AND WRITTEN CALL THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE EQUAL TO EACH OTHER.WE ALSO HAVE ENTERED INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY PUT OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE WHICH WERE NOT PART OF A COLLAR STRATEGY. SUCH PUT OPTION CONTRACTS HAD A NOTIONAL VALUE OF $258 MILLION AND $387 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016, RESPECTIVELY, AND SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 12 MONTHS AND 24 MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY.ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2017 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS WOULD INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $228 MILLION IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WERE TO STRENGTHEN AND DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $270 MILLION IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WERE TO WEAKEN. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS.INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENTFORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND TREASURY RATE LOCKS: IN ANTICIPATION OF ISSUING FIXED-RATE DEBT, WE MAY USE FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS (FORWARD STARTING SWAPS) OR TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS (TREASURY RATE LOCKS) THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES TO HEDGE AGAINST CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES THAT COULD IMPACT EXPECTED FUTURE ISSUANCES OF DEBT. TO THE EXTENT THESE HEDGES OF CASH FLOWS RELATED TO ANTICIPATED DEBT ARE EFFECTIVE, ANY REALIZED OR UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE FORWARD STARTING SWAPS OR TREASURY RATE LOCKS ARE REPORTED IN OCI AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME OVER THE LIFE OF THE ANTICIPATED FIXED-RATE NOTES.WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SWAP CONTRACTS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF CERTAIN OF OUR FIXED RATE NOTES IN 2017 AND 2016 AND ALSO TERMINATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP BY SETTLING CERTAIN OF THOSE SWAP CONTRACTS DURING 2017. DURING 2017, WE SETTLED $500 MILLION NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF CERTAIN SWAP CONTRACTS, AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY ENTERED INTO NEW $500 MILLION NOTIONAL AMOUNT SWAP CONTRACTS. 58WE TERMINATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP ON THOSE CERTAIN OUTSTANDING SWAP CONTRACTS AMOUNTING TO $500 MILLION NOTIONAL AMOUNT BY SETTLING SUCH SWAP CONTRACTS. THE NET SETTLEMENT AND TERMINATION OF THOSE SWAP CONTRACTS RESULTED IN A NET LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION. SEE NOTE 11 FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO REDUCTIONS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE. ADDITIONALLY, WE RE-DESIGNATED $500 MILLION 10-YEAR NOTIONAL AMOUNT FORWARD STARTING SWAPS TO CERTAIN OF OUR 30-YEAR OUTSTANDING FIXED RATE NOTES, RESULTING IN A GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY $29 MILLION. IN ADDITION, IN 2017, WE ENTERED INTO AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY SETTLED, $500 MILLION NOTIONAL TREASURY LOCKS ON 30-YEAR DEBT, RESULTING IN A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION.WE HAD OUTSTANDING FORWARD STARTING SWAPS WITH EFFECTIVE DATES IN 2017 AND 2018 AND MATURING IN TEN YEARS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS AS SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW: NOTIONAL AMOUNT DECEMBER 31, 2017 DECEMBER 31, 2016FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS: FORWARD STARTING SWAPS WITH EFFECTIVE DATES IN 2017$— $500FORWARD STARTING SWAPS WITH EFFECTIVE DATES IN 2018— 500INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS: FROM TIME TO TIME WE HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN DEBT OBLIGATIONS THROUGH THE USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. THE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED HEDGES OF THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE NOTES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN BENCHMARK INTEREST RATES. GAINS OR LOSSES RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING DEBT ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEDGED BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE RISK ARE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME WITHIN INTEREST (EXPENSE) WITH AN ASSOCIATED OFFSET TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTES RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. SINCE THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE SWAP ARE INTENDED TO MATCH THOSE OF THE DEBT BEING HEDGED ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP ARE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME WITHIN INTEREST (EXPENSE) WITH AN ASSOCIATED OFFSET TO THE DERIVATIVE ASSET OR LIABILITY ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE IS NO NET IMPACT RECORDED IN INCOME. ANY NET INTEREST PAYMENTS MADE OR RECEIVED ON INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. IF A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED FOR AN INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACT, ACCUMULATED GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACT ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OR INCREASE OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY HEDGED DEBT OBLIGATIONS.THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF OUR OUTSTANDING INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016: WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SWAP CONTRACTS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF CERTAIN OF OUR FIXED RATE NOTES IN 2017 AND 2016 AND ALSO TERMINATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP BY SETTLING CERTAIN OF THOSE SWAP CONTRACTS DURING 2017 AND 2016. IN 2017, WE TERMINATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP ON CERTAIN OUTSTANDING SWAP CONTRACTS AMOUNTING TO $200 MILLION NOTIONAL AMOUNT BY SETTLING SUCH SWAP CONTRACTS. IN JULY 2016, WE TERMINATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP ON ALL OF OUR THEN OUTSTANDING SWAP CONTRACTS, AMOUNTING TO $3.6 BILLION NOTIONAL AMOUNT, BY SETTLING SUCH SWAP CONTRACTS. THE SETTLEMENT OF SWAP CONTRACTS RESULTED IN THE RECEIPT OF NET PROCEEDS OF $3 MILLION AND $196 MILLION DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE NOTES. SEE NOTE 11 FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO REDUCTIONS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE.A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO MEASURE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR DEBT AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS FROM A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES INDICATED THAT A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET PAYABLE BY $1.3 BILLION. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET PAYABLE BY $1.5 BILLION.59
