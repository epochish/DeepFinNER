DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY CELGENE CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY WE OR OUR) IS A GLOBAL INTEGRATED BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN THE DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF INNOVATIVE THERAPIES DESIGNED TO TREAT CANCER AND IMMUNE-INFLAMMATORY RELATED DISEASES. OUR PRIMARY COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS INCLUDE REVLIMID®, THALOMID® (INCLUSIVE OF THALIDOMIDE CELGENETM AND THALIDOMIDE PHARMIONTM, SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION OF PHARMION CORPORATION, OR PHARMION) AND VIDAZA®. ALKERAN® WAS LICENSED FROM GLAXOSMITHKLINE, OR GSK, AND SOLD UNDER OUR LABEL THROUGH MARCH 31, 2009, THE CONCLUSION DATE OF THE ALKERAN® LICENSE WITH GSK. REVLIMID® IS AN ORAL IMMUNOMODULATORY DRUG MARKETED IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND ASIA / PACIFIC FOR PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE MYELOMA WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY AND IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA AND CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA FOR THE TREATMENT OF TRANSFUSION-DEPENDENT ANEMIA DUE TO LOW- OR INTERMEDIATE-1-RISK MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES, OR MDS, ASSOCIATED WITH A DELETION 5Q CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITY WITH OR WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITIES. THALOMID® IS MARKETED FOR PATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND FOR THE ACUTE TREATMENT OF THE CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF MODERATE TO SEVERE ERYTHEMA NODOSUM LEPROSUM, OR ENL, AN INFLAMMATORY COMPLICATION OF LEPROSY. VIDAZA® IS A PYRIMIDINE NUCLEOSIDE ANALOG THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF DNA HYPERMETHYLATION AND PROMOTE SUBSEQUENT GENE RE-EXPRESSION. VIDAZA® IS LICENSED FROM PFIZER, AND IS MARKETED IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALL SUBTYPES OF MDS AND WAS GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF MDS THROUGH MAY 2011. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009, THE NATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE CANCER NETWORK, OR NCCN, UPGRADED VIDAZA® TO A CATEGORY 1 RECOMMENDED TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH INTERMEDIATE-2 AND HIGH-RISK MDS. IN EUROPE, VIDAZA® IS MARKETED FOR THE TREATMENT OF CERTAIN QUALIFIED ADULT PATIENTS AND WAS GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF MDS AND ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA, OR AML, IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, OR EU, EXPIRING DECEMBER 2018. WE CONTINUE TO INVEST SUBSTANTIALLY IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND THE DRUG CANDIDATES IN OUR PIPELINE ARE AT VARIOUS STAGES OF PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT. THESE CANDIDATES INCLUDE OUR IMIDS® COMPOUNDS, WHICH ARE A CLASS OF COMPOUNDS PROPRIETARY TO US AND HAVING CERTAIN IMMUNOMODULATORY AND OTHER BIOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT PROPERTIES, IN ADDITION TO OUR LEADING ORAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS AND CELL PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THAT CONTINUED ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRIMARY COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS, DEPTH OF OUR PRODUCT PIPELINE, REGULATORY APPROVALS OF BOTH NEW PRODUCTS AND EXPANDED USE OF EXISTING PRODUCTS PROVIDE THE CATALYSTS FOR FUTURE GROWTH. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE REPORTED REVENUE OF $2.690 BILLION, NET INCOME OF $776.7 MILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $1.66. REVENUE INCREASED BY $435.1 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR CONTINUED EXPANSION INTO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND REVENUE GROWTH OF REVLIMID® AND VIDAZA®, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET DECREASES IN REVENUES FROM THALOMID® AND ALKERAN®. THE DECREASE IN THALOMID® WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER UNIT VOLUMES IN THE UNITED STATES RESULTING FROM THE INCREASED USE OF REVLIMID®, WHILE THE DECREASE IN ALKERAN® WAS DUE TO THE MARCH 31, 2009 CONCLUSION OF THE ALKERAN® LICENSE WITH GSK. NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR 2009 REFLECT THE EARNINGS CONTRIBUTIONS FROM HIGHER REVLIMID® AND VIDAZA® REVENUES, PARTLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SPENDING FOR NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES, RECURRING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND THE EXPANSION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 INCLUDED A $1.740 BILLION CHARGE FOR ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, OR IPR&D, RELATED TO THE PHARMION ACQUISITION IN MARCH 2008. 43 TABLE OF CONTENTS FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING DEMAND FOR OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS, REGULATORY APPROVALS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES, THE TIMING AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS LAUNCHED BY US OR COMPETING COMPANIES, THE TIMING OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES, CHALLENGES TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL COSTS. SEE RISK FACTORS CONTAINED IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND 2007 TOTAL REVENUE: TOTAL REVENUE AND RELATED PERCENTAGE CHANGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 2009 COMPARED TO 2008: TOTAL REVENUE INCREASED BY $435.1 MILLION, OR 19.3%, IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008. THE REVENUE INCREASE IN THE UNITED STATES WAS $132.5 MILLION, OR 8.3% AND THE INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS WAS $302.6 MILLION, OR 46.3%. 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: TOTAL REVENUE INCREASED BY $849.0 MILLION, OR 60.4%, IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007.

NET PRODUCT SALES: 2009 COMPARED TO 2008: NET PRODUCT SALES INCREASED BY $429.7 MILLION, OR 20.1% TO $2.567 BILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008. THE INCREASE WAS COMPRISED OF NET VOLUME INCREASES OF $428.0 MILLION AND PRICE INCREASES OF $61.5 MILLION, PARTLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE DUE TO THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE OF $59.8 MILLION. REVLIMID® NET SALES INCREASED BY $381.8 MILLION, OR 28.8% TO $1.706 BILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED UNIT SALES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. INCREASED MARKET PENETRATION AND THE INCREASE IN DURATION OF THERAPY AND NUMBER OF PATIENTS USING REVLIMID® IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA CONTRIBUTED TO U.S. GROWTH. THE GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS REFLECTS THE EXPANSION OF OUR COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES IN OVER 65 COUNTRIES AND PRODUCT REIMBURSEMENT APPROVALS. 44 TABLE OF CONTENTS THALOMID® NET SALES DECREASED BY $67.8 MILLION, OR 13.4%, TO $436.9 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER UNIT VOLUMES IN THE UNITED STATES RESULTING FROM THE INCREASED USE OF REVLIMID®, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PRICING AND VOLUME INCREASES IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. VIDAZA® NET SALES INCREASED BY $180.5 MILLION, OR 87.3%, TO $387.2 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECEMBER 2008 FULL MARKETING AUTHORIZATION GRANTED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, OR EC, FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR HAEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION WITH INTERMEDIATE-2 AND HIGH-RISK MDS ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL PROGNOSTIC SYSTEM SCORE, OR IPSS, OR CHRONIC MYELOMONOCYTIC LEUKAEMIA, OR CMML, WITH 10-29 PERCENT MARROW BLASTS WITHOUT MYELOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER, OR AML WITH 20-30 PERCENT BLASTS AND MULTI-LINEAGE DYSPLASIA, ACCORDING TO WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, OR WHO, CLASSIFICATION OF VIDAZA®.

REVLIMID® NET SALES INCREASED BY $550.8 MILLION, OR 71.2%, TO $1.325 BILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CONTINUED EXPANSION IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. INCREASED MARKET PENETRATION AND THE INCREASE IN DURATION OF PATIENTS USING REVLIMID® IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE U.S. GROWTH. INTERNATIONAL SALES GROWTH PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF THE JUNE 2007 ECS APPROVAL FOR THE USE OF REVLIMID® FOR TREATMENT IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE OF PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE MYELOMA WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY AND CONTINUED EXPANSION IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THALOMID® NET SALES INCREASED BY $57.6 MILLION, OR 12.9%, TO $504.7 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 2008 INCLUSION OF INTERNATIONAL SALES, RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION OF PHARMION. IN ADDITION, U.S. PRICE INCREASES WERE OFFSET BY LOWER SALES VOLUMES. VIDAZA® NET SALES OF $206.7 MILLION REPRESENTED SALES RECORDED SUBSEQUENT TO THE MARCH 7, 2008 PHARMION ACQUISITION IN BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. ALKERANÂ NET SALES INCREASED BY $8.2 MILLION, OR 11.1%, TO $81.7 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN UNIT SALES OF THE INJECTABLE FORM. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES, SALES DISCOUNTS, GOVERNMENT REBATES, AND CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES. THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER OUR S.T.E.P.S.® PROGRAM WHICH WE DEVELOPED AND IS A PROPRIETARY COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION AND RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF PROVIDING FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, THALOMID® IS ALSO DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES SPECIFICATIONS TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES UNDER THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID® IS ALSO DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES SPECIFICATIONS TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. VIDAZA® IS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN. VIDAZA® IS NOT SUBJECTED TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS THALOMID® AND REVLIMID®. 45 TABLE OF CONTENTS WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DOES NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY TO DATE. SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES. CHARGEBACKS ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. ON JANUARY 28, 2008, THE FISCAL YEAR 2008 NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT WAS ENACTED, WHICH EXPANDS TRICARE TO INCLUDE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS DISPENSED BY TRICARE RETAIL NETWORK PHARMACIES. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS REFLECT THIS PROGRAM EXPANSION AND ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA. SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS. 46 TABLE OF CONTENTS GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS AND THE BALANCE IN THE RELATED ALLOWANCE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 2009 COMPARED TO 2008: RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES DECREASED BY $5.9 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE COMPLETION OF AN INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVE CONDUCTED BY A MAJOR PHARMACY CHAIN DURING 2009, DECREASED REVENUE FROM PRODUCTS WITH A HIGHER RETURN RATE HISTORY IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 AND A DECREASE IN ALKERAN® RETURNS DUE TO THE MARCH 31, 2009 CONCLUSION OF THE ALKERAN® LICENSE WITH GSK. IN ADDITION, 2008 INCLUDES AN INCREASE IN THALOMID® RETURNS RESULTING FROM THE ANTICIPATED INCREASE IN THE USE OF REVLIMID® IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA. DISCOUNTS INCREASED BY $1.3 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUE INCREASES IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, BOTH OF WHICH OFFER DIFFERENT DISCOUNT PROGRAMS. GOVERNMENT REBATES INCREASED BY $12.6 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES LEVELS OF REVLIMID® AND VIDAZA® IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AS WELL AS REIMBURSEMENT APPROVALS IN NEW MARKETS. CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES DECREASED BY $11.5 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED REVENUE FROM PRODUCTS WITH A HIGHER CHARGEBACK HISTORY IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 AND A DECREASE IN ALKERAN® CHARGEBACKS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES DUE TO CERTAIN PROGRAMS COMMENCED IN 2009. 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES DECREASED BY $19.2 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED THALOMID® INVENTORY IN THE SALES CHANNEL RESULTING FROM THE 2007 THALOMID® INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION AT SEVERAL MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, WHICH ALSO RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL RETURNS DURING 2007. IN ADDITION, 2007 INCLUDES AN INCREASE IN THALOMID® RETURNS RESULTING FROM THE ANTICIPATED INCREASE IN USE OF REVLIMID® IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA. DISCOUNTS INCREASED BY $8.0 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES OF REVLIMIDÂ AS WELL AS THE INCLUSION OF FORMER PHARMION PRODUCTS, WHICH RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL DISCOUNTS TAKEN. 47 TABLE OF CONTENTS GOVERNMENT REBATES INCREASED BY $7.0 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT REBATES RESULTING FROM OUR GLOBAL EXPANSION, AS WELL AS THE INCLUSION OF FORMER PHARMION PRODUCTS.

COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER REVENUE: 2009 COMPARED TO 2008: REVENUES FROM COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER SOURCES DECREASED BY $1.2 MILLION TO $13.7 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ELIMINATION OF LICENSE FEES AND AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED REVENUES RELATED TO PHARMION SUBSEQUENT TO THE MARCH 7, 2008 ACQUISITION AND WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN MILESTONE PAYMENTS RECEIVED IN 2009. 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: REVENUES FROM COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER SOURCES TOTALED $14.9 MILLION AND $20.1 MILLION FOR 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE $5.2 MILLION DECREASE IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ELIMINATION OF LICENSE FEES AND AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED REVENUES RELATED TO PHARMION. ROYALTY REVENUE: 2009 COMPARED TO 2008: ROYALTY REVENUE INCREASED BY $6.6 MILLION TO $108.8 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 DUE TO THE 2009 INCLUSION OF $9.0 MILLION IN RESIDUAL ALKERAN® PAYMENTS EARNED BY US BASED UPON GSKS ALKERAN® REVENUES SUBSEQUENT TO THE CONCLUSION OF THE ALKERAN® LICENSE WITH GSK.

INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME DECREASED BY $25.0 MILLION TO $84.8 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES RESULTING FROM THE MARCH 2008 CASH PAYMENT OF $746.8 MILLION RELATED TO THE PHARMION ACQUISITION AND THE OCTOBER 3, 2008 PAYMENT OF $425.0 MILLION TO PFIZER WHERE WE PREPAID OUR ROYALTY OBLIGATION UNDER THE JUNE 7, 2001 5-AZACYTIDINE LICENSE IN FULL, IN ADDITION TO REDUCED YIELDS ON INVESTED BALANCES. INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET INCLUDED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE TOTALING $2.4 MILLION IN 2008 AND $5.5 MILLION IN 2007. 51 TABLE OF CONTENTS EQUITY IN LOSSES OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES: UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, WE RECORDED LOSSES OF $1.1 MILLION, $9.7 MILLION AND $4.5 MILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. INCLUDED IN 2008 WERE IMPAIRMENT LOSSES OF $6.0 MILLION WHICH WERE BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECREASE IN FAIR VALUE OF AN EQUITY INVESTMENT BELOW OUR COST. INTEREST EXPENSE: INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $2.0 MILLION, $4.4 MILLION AND $11.1 MILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE $2.4 MILLION DECREASE IN EXPENSE IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 AND THE $6.7 MILLION EXPENSE DECREASE IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE JUNE 2008 COMPLETION OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT CONVERSIONS RELATED TO OUR $400 MILLION CONVERTIBLE NOTES ISSUED ON JUNE 3, 2003 AND THE COMPLETION OF AMORTIZATION OF THEIR DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET: OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WERE AS FOLLOWS: OTHER INCOME INCREASED BY $35.7 MILLION TO $60.5 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO TRANSACTION EXCHANGE GAINS AND NET GAINS ON FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO OFFSET NET FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES. IN ADDITION, 2008 INCLUDED AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS OF $4.1 MILLION. OTHER INCOME INCREASED BY $27.1 MILLION TO $24.7 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, WHICH WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT LOSS RECORDED ON AN EQUITY INVESTMENT. THE $2.4 MILLION EXPENSE IN 2007 INCLUDED EXPENSES RELATED TO A TERMINATION BENEFIT RESULTING FROM THE MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS OF A TERMINATED EMPLOYEE AND WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS. INCOME TAX PROVISION: 2009 COMPARED TO 2008: THE INCOME TAX PROVISION INCREASED BY $34.2 MILLION TO $199.0 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008. THE 2009 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 20.4% REFLECTS THE IMPACT FROM OUR LOW TAX SWISS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS AND OUR OVERALL GLOBAL MIX OF INCOME. THE INCOME TAX PROVISION INCLUDED A $17.0 MILLION NET TAX BENEFIT, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF FILING 2008 INCOME TAX RETURNS WITH CERTAIN ITEMS BEING MORE FAVORABLE THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED, REDUCTION IN A VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATED TO CAPITAL LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND THE SETTLEMENT OF TAX EXAMINATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO CERTAIN ONGOING INCOME TAX AUDITS. 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: THE INCOME TAX PROVISION DECREASED BY $125.7 MILLION TO $164.8 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF NEGATIVE 12% REFLECTS NON-DEDUCTIBLE IPR&D CHARGES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF PHARMION. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF IPR&D AND THE EXPENSE RELATED TO THE PREPAYMENT OF OUR ROYALTY OBLIGATION FOR UNAPPROVED PRODUCTS, WAS 24.8%, WHICH REFLECTS THE BENEFIT OF OUR LOW TAX SWISS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS AND OUR OVERALL GLOBAL MIX OF INCOME. 52 TABLE OF CONTENTS NET INCOME (LOSS): NET INCOME (LOSS) AND PER COMMON SHARE AMOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (1) IN COMPUTING DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR 2007, THE NUMERATOR HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO ADD BACK THE AFTER-TAX AMOUNT OF INTEREST EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN THE YEAR ON OUR CONVERTIBLE DEBT. NO ADJUSTMENT TO THE NUMERATOR OR DENOMINATOR WAS MADE IN 2008 DUE TO THE ANTI-DILUTIVE EFFECT OF ANY POTENTIAL COMMON STOCK AS A RESULT OF OUR NET LOSS. AS OF THEIR MATURITY DATE, JUNE 1, 2008, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CONVERTIBLE NOTES WERE CONVERTED INTO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. 2009 COMPARED TO 2008: NET INCOME FOR 2009 REFLECTS THE EARNINGS IMPACT FROM HIGHER SALES OF REVLIMID® AND VIDAZA®, WHICH WAS PARTLY DUE TO SALES INCREASES IN THE UNITED STATES AND OUR CONTINUED EXPANSION INTO NEW INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND THE GRANTING OF FULL MARKETING AUTHORIZATION BY THE EC OF VIDAZA® FOR SPECIFIED TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS. THE EARNINGS GENERATED FROM INCREASED SALES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY INCREASED R&D SPENDING, THE COSTS RELATED TO NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES AND OUR ONGOING EXPANSION OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. NET LOSS FOR 2008 INCLUDED $1.74 BILLION IN IPR&D CHARGES RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF PHARMION AND A $303.1 MILLION CHARGE FOR THE OCTOBER 2008 ROYALTY OBLIGATION PAYMENT TO PFIZER RELATED TO UNAPPROVED FORMS OF VIDAZA®. 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: NET INCOME DECREASED BY $1.76 BILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO $1.74 BILLION IN IPR&D CHARGES AND $102.3 MILLION IN ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES AMORTIZATION RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF PHARMION IN MARCH 2008, IN ADDITION TO A $303.1 MILLION CHARGE FOR THE OCTOBER 2008 ROYALTY OBLIGATION PAYMENT TO PFIZER RELATED TO THE UNAPPROVED FORMS OF VIDAZA®. THESE COSTS WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NET REVENUES PROVIDED BY REVLIMID® AND VIDAZA®. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 53 TABLE OF CONTENTS OPERATING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2009 INCREASED BY $727.7 MILLION TO $909.9 MILLION AS COMPARED TO 2008. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO:  HIGHER NET INCOME,  TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND  THE OCTOBER 3, 2008 PREPAYMENT OF OUR ROYALTY OBLIGATION UNDER THE JUNE 7, 2001 5-AZACYTIDINE LICENSE IN FULL FOR $425.0 MILLION. ALSO SEE DISCUSSION OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND WORKING CAPITAL BELOW. INVESTING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2009 INCREASED BY $333.8 MILLION TO $856.1 MILLION AS COMPARED TO 2008. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE OF $749.3 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO NET PROCEEDS FROM NET SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE OF $312.1 MILLION IN 2008, PARTLY OFFSET BY THE $746.8 MILLION OF CASH PAID TO ACQUIRE PHARMION IN 2008. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES MADE IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007 RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE EXPANSION OF OUR MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES, UPGRADES TO OUR FACILITIES, AS WELL AS SPENDING ON COMPUTER AND LABORATORY EQUIPMENT TO ACCOMMODATE OUR BUSINESS GROWTH. IN 2009, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INCLUDED THE COST OF DEVELOPING AN ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND IN 2008, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INCLUDED THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING THE ORACLE ENTERPRISE BUSINESS SUITE, OR EBS. IN 2007, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INCLUDED THE COST OF BUILDING OUR INTERNATIONAL HEADQUARTERS IN BOUDRY, SWITZERLAND AND COMPUTER EQUIPMENT. FOR 2010, WE ARE FORECASTING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE RANGE OF APPROXIMATELY $140 MILLION TO $150 MILLION COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $93.4 MILLION IN 2009, AND WE EXPECT TO FUND THIS WITH OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS. FINANCING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $61.9 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $281.6 MILLION IN 2008. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO:  PURCHASE OF $209 MILLION OF TREASURY SHARES IN 2009  A DECREASE IN THE PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF COMMON STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS IN 2009 AND  A DECREASE IN THE TAX BENEFIT FROM SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS IN 2009. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND WORKING CAPITAL: WORKING CAPITAL AND CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (1) INCLUDES CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET OF ALLOWANCES, INVENTORY AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, LESS ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES, INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: WE INVEST OUR EXCESS CASH PRIMARILY IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS, U.S. TREASURY FIXED RATE SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY FIXED RATE SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED FIXED RATE SECURITIES, FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION, OR FDIC, GUARANTEED FIXED RATE CORPORATE DEBT, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT ISSUED SECURITIES AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT GUARANTEED SECURITIES. ALL LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND ALL INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE. WE DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. THE INCREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AT THE END OF 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET THE CASH PAID OUT UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ANNOUNCED IN APRIL 2009 AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. 54 TABLE OF CONTENTS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET INCREASED BY $126.4 MILLION TO $438.6 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES OF REVLIMID® AND VIDAZA®. DAYS OF SALES OUTSTANDING, OR DSO, IN 2009 AMOUNTED TO 56 DAYS COMPARED TO 42 DAYS IN 2008. THE DSO INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED INTERNATIONAL SALES FOR WHICH THE COLLECTION PERIOD IS LONGER THAN FOR U.S. SALES. WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE AS OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES CONTINUE TO EXPAND. INVENTORY: INVENTORY BALANCES INCREASED BY $0.5 MILLION TO $100.7 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008. THE INCREASE REFLECTED HIGHER LEVELS OF REVLIMID® AND VIDAZA® INVENTORIES, WHICH WERE MOSTLY OFFSET BY THE ELIMINATION OF ALKERAN® INVENTORIES RESULTING FROM THE CONCLUSION OF THE GSK SUPPLY AGREEMENT AND REDUCTIONS IN THALOMID® DUE TO LOWER SALES VOLUMES. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS: OTHER CURRENT ASSETS INCREASED BY $68.5 MILLION TO $258.9 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND AN INCREASE IN PREPAID EXPENSES, PRIMARILY SALES, USE AND VALUE ADDED TAXES. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES: ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES DECREASED BY $28.7 MILLION TO $446.0 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, WHICH WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN CLINICAL TRIAL ACCRUALS AND ACCRUED PAYROLL RELATED EXPENSES, RESULTING FROM OUR EXPANDED BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. INCOME TAXES PAYABLE (CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT): INCOME TAXES PAYABLE INCREASED $59.5 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY FROM THE CURRENT PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES OF $225.9 MILLION PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TAX PAYMENTS OF $60.0 MILLION AND A TAX BENEFIT ON STOCK OPTION EXERCISES OF $103.4 MILLION. WE EXPECT CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR EXPENDITURES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TRIALS, REGULATORY APPROVALS, INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION, COMMERCIALIZATION OF PRODUCTS AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, COMBINED WITH CASH RECEIVED FROM EXPECTED NET PRODUCT SALES AND ROYALTY AGREEMENTS, WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL RESOURCES TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009: PAYMENT DUE BY PERIOD LESS THAN MORE THAN IN THOUSANDS $ 1 YEAR 1 TO 3 YEARS 3 TO 5 YEARS 5 YEARS TOTAL OPERATING LEASES $ 26,578 $ 37,207 $ 15,815 $ 19,541 $ 99,141 MANUFACTURING FACILITY NOTE PAYABLE 3,964 7,832 7,736 7,736 27,268 OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS 97,121 60,424   157,545 TOTAL $ 127,663 $ 105,463 $ 23,551 $ 27,277 $ 283,954 OPERATING LEASES: WE LEASE OFFICE AND RESEARCH FACILITIES UNDER VARIOUS OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE NON-CANCELABLE LEASE TERMS FOR THE OPERATING LEASES EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES BETWEEN 2010 AND 2018 AND INCLUDE RENEWAL OPTIONS. IN GENERAL, WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE LESSORS FOR REAL ESTATE TAXES, INSURANCE, UTILITIES, MAINTENANCE AND OTHER OPERATING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEASES. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE MAJOR FACILITIES THAT WE OCCUPY UNDER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS REFER TO PART I, ITEM 2, PROPERTIES OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. 55 TABLE OF CONTENTS MANUFACTURING FACILITY NOTE PAYABLE: IN DECEMBER 2006, WE PURCHASED AN API MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FROM SIEGFRIED LOCATED IN ZOFINGEN, SWITZERLAND. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NOTE PAYABLE TO SIEGFRIED APPROXIMATED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTE OF $25.0 MILLION. OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS: OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS INCLUDE $146.2 MILLION IN CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPLY CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE COMMITTED TO INVEST $20.0 MILLION IN AN INVESTMENT FUND OVER A TEN-YEAR PERIOD, WHICH IS CALLABLE AT ANY TIME. ON DECEMBER 31, 2009, OUR REMAINING INVESTMENT COMMITMENT WAS $10.5 MILLION.

INCOME TAXES PAYABLE: WE HAVE PROVIDED A LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAX MATTERS OF $450.2 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 OF WHICH $27.8 MILLION IS CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT. THE REMAINING BALANCE OF $422.4 MILLION IS CLASSIFIED AS NON-CURRENT BECAUSE THE TIMING OF THE SETTLEMENT OF THESE AMOUNTS IS NOT REASONABLY ESTIMABLE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. WE DO NOT EXPECT A SETTLEMENT OF THE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS CLASSIFIED AS NON-CURRENT WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS: WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT INCLUDE THE FUNDING OF CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE MILESTONE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED DEVELOPMENTAL, REGULATORY AND /OR COMMERCIAL TARGETS. SEE NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON 10-K FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS. OUR OBLIGATION TO FUND THESE EFFORTS IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROGRAMS, THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF RESEARCH COMPOUNDS THAT WE CHOOSE TO LICENSE AND/OR THE LACK OF ANY ADVERSE EVENTS WHICH COULD CAUSE THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE PROGRAMS. THE TABLE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K DOES NOT INCLUDE POTENTIAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $3.750 BILLION, WHICH ARE EITHER CONTINGENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF VARIOUS RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES (APPROXIMATELY $2.220 BILLION) OR ARE SALES-BASED MILESTONES (APPROXIMATELY $1.530 BILLION). RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES DEPEND PRIMARILY UPON FUTURE FAVORABLE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND REGULATORY AGENCY ACTIONS, NEITHER OF WHICH MAY EVER OCCUR. SALES-BASED MILESTONES ARE CONTINGENT ON GENERATING CERTAIN LEVELS OF FUTURE SALES OF PRODUCTS. SINCE THE ACHIEVEMENT AND TIMING OF THESE MILESTONES IS NEITHER DETERMINABLE NOR REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, SUCH CONTINGENCIES HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TABLE OR RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. NEW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN JUNE 2009, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD, OR FASB, ESTABLISHED THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATIONTM, OR ASC, AS THE SOURCE OF AUTHORITATIVE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES RECOGNIZED BY THE FASB TO BE APPLIED BY NONGOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES IN PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES. ALL OTHER ACCOUNTING LITERATURE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ASC IS NOW NONAUTHORITATIVE. THE ASC WAS EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS ENDING AFTER SEPTEMBER 15, 2009 AND ITS ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE ASC IS UPDATED THROUGH THE FASBS ISSUANCE OF ACCOUNTING STANDARD UPDATES, OR ASUS. SUMMARIZED BELOW ARE RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AS DESCRIBED UNDER THE NEW ASC STRUCTURE. IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED ASC NO. 825, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, OR ASC 825, WHICH ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE FASB PARTIALLY DEFERRED THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF ASC 825 FOR NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A NONRECURRING BASIS TO FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2008. OUR ADOPTION OF ASC 825 RELATED TO NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. 56 TABLE OF CONTENTS IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB RATIFIED ASC NO. 808, ACCOUNTING FOR COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OR ASC 808, WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR ASC NO. 730, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, RELATED TO HOW THE PARTIES TO A COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENT SHOULD ACCOUNT FOR COSTS INCURRED AND REVENUE GENERATED ON SALES TO THIRD PARTIES, HOW SHARING PAYMENTS PURSUANT TO A COLLABORATION AGREEMENT SHOULD BE PRESENTED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT AND CERTAIN RELATED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. THE GUIDANCE FOR ASC 808 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 ON A RETROSPECTIVE BASIS AND DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED ASC NO. 805, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, OR ASC 805, WHICH REQUIRES AN ACQUIRER TO RECOGNIZE THE ASSETS ACQUIRED, THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND ANY NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE ACQUIREE AT THE ACQUISITION DATE, MEASURED AT THEIR FAIR VALUES AS OF THAT DATE, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS. THIS STATEMENT ALSO REQUIRES THE CAPITALIZATION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION AT THEIR ACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUES, SEPARATELY FROM GOODWILL. IN ADDITION, ASC 805 REQUIRES THAT ANY POST-ACQUISITION ADJUSTMENTS TO DEFERRED TAX ASSET VALUATION ALLOWANCES AND LIABILITIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS BE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT PERIOD INCOME TAX EXPENSE. ASC 805 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 AND WE ACCOUNTED FOR POST-ACQUISITION TAX-RELATED ADJUSTMENTS FOR PRE-2009 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND WILL ACCOUNT FOR FUTURE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND CERTAIN OTHER DEVELOPMENTS FROM PAST COMBINATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS PROVISIONS. IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC NO. 810, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH CHANGES THE ACCOUNTING FOR AND REPORTING OF NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS (FORMERLY KNOWN AS MINORITY INTERESTS) IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN MAY 2008, THE FASB ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC NO. 470 ACCOUNTING FOR CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT MAY BE SETTLED IN CASH UPON CONVERSION (INCLUDING PARTIAL CASH SETTLEMENT), WHICH REQUIRES SEPARATE ACCOUNTING FOR THE DEBT AND EQUITY COMPONENTS OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT ISSUANCES THAT HAVE A CASH SETTLEMENT FEATURE PERMITTING SETTLEMENT PARTIALLY OR FULLY IN CASH UPON CONVERSION. A COMPONENT OF SUCH DEBT ISSUANCES THAT IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONVERSION FEATURE AT INCEPTION SHOULD BE BIFURCATED AND RECORDED TO EQUITY, WITH THE RESULTING DEBT DISCOUNT AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE IN A MANNER THAT REFLECTS THE ISSUERS NONCONVERTIBLE, UNSECURED DEBT BORROWING RATE. THE REQUIREMENTS FOR SEPARATE ACCOUNTING MUST BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY TO PREVIOUSLY ISSUED CONVERTIBLE DEBT ISSUANCES AS WELL AS PROSPECTIVELY TO NEWLY ISSUED CONVERTIBLE DEBT ISSUANCES, NEGATIVELY AFFECTING BOTH NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE, IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008. SINCE OUR PAST CONVERTIBLE DEBT ISSUANCE DID NOT INCLUDE A CASH SETTLEMENT FEATURE, THE AMENDMENT DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. 57 TABLE OF CONTENTS IN JUNE 2008, THE FASB ISSUED ASC NO. 260, DETERMINING WHETHER INSTRUMENTS GRANTED IN SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS ARE PARTICIPATING SECURITIES, OR ASC 260. THE ASC ADDRESSES WHETHER INSTRUMENTS GRANTED IN SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS ARE PARTICIPATING SECURITIES PRIOR TO VESTING AND THEREFORE NEED TO BE INCLUDED IN THE EARNINGS ALLOCATION IN CALCULATING EARNINGS PER SHARE UNDER THE TWO-CLASS METHOD AND REQUIRES COMPANIES TO TREAT UNVESTED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS THAT HAVE NON-FORFEITABLE RIGHTS TO DIVIDENDS OR DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS AS A SEPARATE CLASS OF SECURITIES IN CALCULATING EARNINGS PER SHARE. ASC 260 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009. SINCE OUR PAST SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS DID NOT INCLUDE NON-FORFEITABLE RIGHTS TO DIVIDENDS OR DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS, THE ADOPTION OF ASC 260 DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FASB RATIFIED ASC NO. 323, EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS, OR ASC 323, WHICH CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS AND IMPAIRMENT CONSIDERATIONS INVOLVING EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS.

IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FASB RATIFIED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC NO. 350, ACCOUNTING FOR DEFENSIVE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS WHICH AN ACQUIRER DOES NOT INTEND TO ACTIVELY USE BUT INTENDS TO HOLD TO PREVENT ITS COMPETITORS FROM OBTAINING ACCESS TO THEM. THE AMENDMENT REQUIRES AN ACQUIRER IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION TO ACCOUNT FOR A DEFENSIVE INTANGIBLE ASSET AS A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, WHICH SHOULD BE AMORTIZED TO EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD THE ASSET DIMINISHES IN VALUE. THE AMENDMENT WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 AND WE WILL ACCOUNT FOR DEFENSIVE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN FUTURE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS PROVISIONS. IN APRIL 2009, THE FASB ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC NO. 820, DETERMINING FAIR VALUE WHEN THE VOLUME AND LEVEL OF ACTIVITY FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AND IDENTIFYING TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE NOT ORDERLY, OR ASC 820.

THIS AMENDMENT SHALL BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY WITH RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION NOT PERMITTED. THIS AMENDMENT WAS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS ENDING AFTER JUNE 15, 2009. THE ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN APRIL 2009, THE FASB ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC 320, RECOGNITION AND PRESENTATION OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS. THIS AMENDMENT WAS ISSUED TO MAKE THE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS GUIDANCE MORE OPERATIONAL AND TO IMPROVE THE PRESENTATION OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS AMENDMENT REPLACES THE EXISTING REQUIREMENT THAT THE ENTITYS MANAGEMENT ASSERT IT HAS BOTH THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD AN IMPAIRED DEBT SECURITY UNTIL RECOVERY WITH A REQUIREMENT THAT MANAGEMENT ASSERT IT DOES NOT HAVE THE INTENT TO SELL THE SECURITY, AND IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT IT WILL NOT HAVE TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF ITS COST BASIS. THIS AMENDMENT PROVIDES INCREASED DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE CREDIT AND NONCREDIT COMPONENTS OF IMPAIRED DEBT SECURITIES THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE SOLD AND ALSO REQUIRES INCREASED AND MORE FREQUENT DISCLOSURES REGARDING EXPECTED CASH FLOWS, CREDIT LOSSES AND AN AGING OF SECURITIES WITH UNREALIZED LOSSES. ALTHOUGH THIS AMENDMENT DOES NOT RESULT IN A CHANGE IN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURITIES, IT DOES REQUIRE THAT THE PORTION OF AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT NOT RELATED TO A CREDIT LOSS FOR A HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITY BE RECOGNIZED IN A NEW CATEGORY OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND BE AMORTIZED OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE DEBT SECURITY AS AN INCREASE IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE SECURITY. THIS AMENDMENT WAS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS ENDING AFTER JUNE 15, 2009. THE ADOPTION OF THIS AMENDMENT DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. 58 TABLE OF CONTENTS IN APRIL 2009, THE FASB ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC 825, INTERIM DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, TO REQUIRE DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT MEASURED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE IN INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS WELL AS IN ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. PRIOR TO THIS AMENDMENT, FAIR VALUES FOR THESE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WERE ONLY DISCLOSED ANNUALLY. THIS AMENDMENT APPLIES TO ALL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF ASC 825 AND REQUIRES ALL ENTITIES TO DISCLOSE THE METHOD(S) AND SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THIS AMENDMENT WAS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM PERIODS ENDING AFTER JUNE 15, 2009. THIS AMENDMENT DOES NOT REQUIRE DISCLOSURES FOR EARLIER PERIODS PRESENTED FOR COMPARATIVE PURPOSES AT INITIAL ADOPTION. IN PERIODS AFTER INITIAL ADOPTION, THIS AMENDMENT REQUIRES COMPARATIVE DISCLOSURES ONLY. THE ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN APRIL 2009, THE FASB ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC NO. 805, ACCOUNTING FOR ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION THAT ARISE FROM CONTINGENCIES. THIS AMENDMENT CLARIFIES APPLICATION ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH INITIAL RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT, SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT AND ACCOUNTING, AND DISCLOSURE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARISING FROM CONTINGENCIES IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. THIS AMENDMENT WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 AND WE WILL ACCOUNT FOR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARISING FROM CONTINGENCIES ACQUIRED IN FUTURE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS PROVISIONS. IN MAY 2009, THE FASB ISSUED ASC NO. 855, SUBSEQUENT EVENTS, OR ASC 855, WHICH ESTABLISHED GENERAL STANDARDS OF ACCOUNTING FOR AND DISCLOSURE OF EVENTS THAT OCCUR AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE BUT BEFORE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE ISSUED.

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC NO. 860, ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS, WHICH ELIMINATES THE CONCEPT OF A QUALIFYING SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITY, CHANGES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR DERECOGNIZING FINANCIAL ASSETS AND REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES. THIS AMENDMENT CLARIFIES THE DETERMINATION WHETHER A TRANSFEROR AND ALL OF THE ENTITIES INCLUDED IN THE TRANSFERORS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BEING PRESENTED HAVE SURRENDERED CONTROL OVER TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS. IT ALSO ENHANCES INFORMATION REPORTED TO USERS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BY PROVIDING GREATER TRANSPARENCY ABOUT TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND A COMPANYS CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT IN TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS. THIS AMENDMENT WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR OUR FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2010. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT, IF ANY, THAT THE ADOPTION OF THIS AMENDMENT WILL HAVE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC 810, CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, WHICH CHANGES HOW A COMPANY DETERMINES WHEN AN ENTITY THAT IS INSUFFICIENTLY CAPITALIZED OR IS NOT CONTROLLED THROUGH VOTING (OR SIMILAR RIGHTS) SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER A COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE AN ENTITY IS BASED ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AN ENTITYS PURPOSE AND DESIGN AND A COMPANYS ABILITY TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ENTITY THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ENTITYS ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. THIS AMENDMENT REQUIRES ONGOING REASSESSMENTS OF WHETHER AN ENTERPRISE IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY AND WILL REQUIRE A COMPANY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT ITS INVOLVEMENT WITH VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN RISK EXPOSURE DUE TO THAT INVOLVEMENT AND HOW ITS INVOLVEMENT WITH A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY AFFECTS THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS AMENDMENT WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR OUR FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2010. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT, IF ANY, THAT THE ADOPTION OF THIS AMENDMENT WILL HAVE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. 59 TABLE OF CONTENTS IN AUGUST 2009, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2009-05, MEASURING LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE, OR ASU 2009-05, WHICH AMENDS ASC 820 TO PROVIDE CLARIFICATION OF A CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH A QUOTED PRICE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET FOR AN IDENTICAL LIABILITY IS NOT AVAILABLE. A REPORTING ENTITY IS REQUIRED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE USING ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING METHODS: 1) A VALUATION TECHNIQUE THAT USES A) THE QUOTED PRICE OF THE IDENTICAL LIABILITY WHEN TRADED AS AN ASSET OR B) QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR LIABILITIES (OR SIMILAR LIABILITIES WHEN TRADED AS ASSETS) AND/OR 2) A VALUATION TECHNIQUE THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF ASC 820. ASU 2009-05 ALSO CLARIFIES THAT WHEN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY, A REPORTING ENTITY IS NOT REQUIRED TO ADJUST TO INCLUDE INPUTS RELATING TO THE EXISTENCE OF TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS ON THAT LIABILITY. THE ADOPTION OF THIS ASU DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN SEPTEMBER 2009, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2009-12, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURE, OR ASU 2009-12, WHICH PROVIDES ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ON USING THE NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE, PROVIDED BY AN INVESTEE, WHEN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF AN ALTERNATE INVESTMENT THAT DOES NOT HAVE A READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUE AND ENHANCES THE DISCLOSURES CONCERNING THESE INVESTMENTS. ASU 2009-12 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR OUR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS ENDING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2009. IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2009-13, MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS, OR ASU 2009-13, WHICH AMENDS EXISTING REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF ASC 605. THIS GUIDANCE ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENT TO ESTABLISH THE FAIR VALUE OF UNDELIVERED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND INSTEAD PROVIDES FOR SEPARATE REVENUE RECOGNITION BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF THE SELLING PRICE FOR AN UNDELIVERED ITEM WHEN THERE IS NO OTHER MEANS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THAT UNDELIVERED ITEM. ASU 2009-13 IS EFFECTIVE FOR US PROSPECTIVELY FOR REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO OR MATERIALLY MODIFIED BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2011. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT, IF ANY, THAT THE ADOPTION OF THIS AMENDMENT WILL HAVE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IS ONE THAT IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENTS MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL: REVENUE RECOGNITION: REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS OF THE PRODUCT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER. PROVISIONS FOR DISCOUNTS, EARLY PAYMENTS, REBATES, SALES RETURNS AND DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS UNDER TERMS CUSTOMARY IN THE INDUSTRY ARE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SAME PERIOD THE RELATED SALES ARE RECORDED. WE RECORD ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SALE. THE ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR SUCH VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES ARE BASED ON THE SALES TERMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND TREND ANALYSIS. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM ROYALTIES BASED ON LICENSEES SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS USING OUR TECHNOLOGIES. ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACT TERMS WHEN ROYALTIES FROM LICENSEES CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED. IF ROYALTIES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR COLLECTIBILITY OF A ROYALTY AMOUNT IS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED, ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE CASH IS RECEIVED. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES, SALES DISCOUNTS, GOVERNMENT REBATES, AND CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES. 60 TABLE OF CONTENTS THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER OUR S.T.E.P.S.® PROGRAM WHICH WE DEVELOPED AND IS A PROPRIETARY COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION AND RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF PROVIDING FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, THALOMID® IS ALSO DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES SPECIFICATIONS TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES UNDER THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID® IS ALSO DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES SPECIFICATIONS TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. VIDAZA® IS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN. VIDAZA® IS NOT SUBJECTED TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS THALOMID® AND REVLIMID®. WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DOES NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY TO DATE. SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE AMOUNT FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID AND ACCORDINGLY THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES. CHARGEBACKS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. ON JANUARY 28, 2008, THE FISCAL YEAR 2008 NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT WAS ENACTED, WHICH EXPANDS TRICARE TO INCLUDE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS DISPENSED BY TRICARE RETAIL NETWORK PHARMACIES. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS REFLECT THIS PROGRAM EXPANSION AND ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA. INCOME TAXES: WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. WE PROVIDE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE ACCOUNT FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS PART OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THESE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATE PRIMARILY TO ISSUES COMMON AMONG MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE APPLY A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES WHICH INCLUDE STUDIES PERFORMED BY INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS, ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY AND SUBJECT EXPERTS, EVALUATION OF PUBLIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE IRS AND OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. WE PROVIDE ESTIMATES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. IF OUR ESTIMATES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ACTUAL OUTCOMES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED. 61 TABLE OF CONTENTS WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE A PORTION WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR RECENT CUMULATIVE EARNINGS EXPERIENCE BY TAXING JURISDICTION, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, CARRYFORWARD PERIODS AVAILABLE TO US FOR TAX REPORTING PURPOSES, VARIOUS INCOME TAX STRATEGIES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT AND, TO THE EXTENT FUTURE EXPECTATIONS CHANGE, WE WOULD HAVE TO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THAT TIME. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION: THE COST OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IS RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL AWARDS GRANTED, USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES METHOD OF VALUATION. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH AWARD IS DETERMINED AND THE COMPENSATION COST IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD REQUIRED TO OBTAIN FULL VESTING. COMPENSATION COST TO BE RECOGNIZED REFLECTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF AWARDS EXPECTED TO VEST AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AN ESTIMATE OF AWARD FORFEITURES BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE. OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES: A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF ANY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY BELOW ITS COST THAT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN CARRYING AMOUNT TO FAIR VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT IS CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AND A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE SECURITY ESTABLISHED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INCLUDE: SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE ISSUERS EARNINGS PERFORMANCE, CREDIT RATING, ASSET QUALITY, BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE ISSUER OPERATES, LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW OUR COST, OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE SECURITY, OUR INTENT NOT TO SELL AND AN EVALUATION AS TO WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO SELL BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR COST BASIS. ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD DIFFER FROM OUR ASSESSMENT. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES: ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN CURRENT EARNINGS OR OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), DEPENDING ON WHETHER A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION AND, IF IT IS, THE TYPE OF HEDGING TRANSACTION. FOR A DERIVATIVE TO QUALIFY AS A HEDGE AT INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE HEDGED PERIOD, WE FORMALLY DOCUMENT THE NATURE AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEM. WE ASSESS, BOTH AT INCEPTION AND ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING TRANSACTIONS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING THE CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS. WE ASSESS HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND RECORD THE GAIN OR LOSS RELATED TO THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IF ANY, TO CURRENT EARNINGS. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER PROBABLE OF OCCURRING, WE DISCONTINUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING AND ANY RELATED UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE NOT DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION, TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. THE USE OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE EXPOSURE OF THESE RISKS WITH THE INTENT TO REDUCE OUR RISK OR COST. WE DO NOT USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR SPECULATIVE TRADING PURPOSES AND ARE NOT A PARTY TO LEVERAGED DERIVATIVES. 62 TABLE OF CONTENTS INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATED COMPANIES: WE APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING TO OUR INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS, WHICH PRIMARILY INVEST IN COMPANIES CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN LIFE SCIENCES SUCH AS BIOTECHNOLOGY, PHARMACEUTICALS, MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY, MEDICAL DEVICES, DIAGNOSTICS AND HEALTH AND WELLNESS. EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT. IF AN INVESTMENTS FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN ITS NET CARRYING VALUE AND THE DECLINE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE. SUCH AN EVALUATION IS JUDGMENTAL AND DEPENDENT ON SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE HAS OCCURRED INCLUDE: MARKET VALUE OR EXIT PRICE OF THE INVESTMENT BASED ON EITHER MARKET-QUOTED PRICES OR FUTURE ROUNDS OF FINANCING BY THE INVESTEE; LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE MARKET VALUE WAS BELOW ITS COST BASIS; FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE INVESTEE; OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT; ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INVESTEES ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN; AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE MAY BE AWARE OF RELATED TO THE INVESTMENT. ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, OR LTIP, DESIGNED TO PROVIDE KEY OFFICERS AND EXECUTIVES WITH PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES CONTINGENT UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED CORPORATE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES COVERING A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLES RUNNING CONCURRENTLY ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2011 AND 2012. PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR EACH LTIP ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE THREE-YEAR CYCLE: 25% ON NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE, 25% ON NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND 50% ON TOTAL NON-GAAP REVENUE, AS DEFINED. PAYOUTS MAY BE IN THE RANGE OF 0% TO 200% OF THE PARTICIPANTS SALARY FOR THE PLANS. AWARDS ARE PAYABLE IN CASH OR, AT OUR DISCRETION, IN OUR COMMON STOCK BASED UPON OUR STOCK PRICE AT THE PAYOUT DATE. WE ACCRUE THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE LIABILITY OVER EACH THREE-YEAR CYCLE. PRIOR TO THE END OF A THREE-YEAR CYCLE, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT DURING THE CYCLE. UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT EQUAL TO THEIR TARGET AWARD, OR AN AWARD BASED ON ACTUAL PERFORMANCE, IF HIGHER, THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL. ACCRUALS RECORDED FOR THE LTIP ENTAIL MAKING CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE, NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND NON-GAAP REVENUES, AS DEFINED; THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED. ACCRUALS FOR THE LTIP ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND REVISED ACCORDINGLY SO THAT THE LIABILITY RECORDED REFLECTS UPDATED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PAYOUTS. IN ESTIMATING THE ACCRUALS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DATE FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, EXPECTED RESULTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, OPERATING TRENDS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICING AND COMPETITION. 63 TABLE OF CONTENTS VALUATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: WE HAVE ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY THROUGH BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. WHEN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, ARE ACQUIRED WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS ARE TYPICALLY USED IN THESE VALUATIONS, AND THE MODELS REQUIRE THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:  PROJECTING REGULATORY APPROVALS,  ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM PRODUCT SALES RESULTING FROM COMPLETED PRODUCTS AND IN-PROCESS PROJECTS AND  DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES AND PROBABILITY RATES. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS: GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. WE TEST OUR GOODWILL ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT EACH NOVEMBER 30. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE AMORTIZED TO THEIR ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR. WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES. 64 TABLE OF CONTENTS ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES FORWARD-LOOKING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RISK OF LOSS IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES, CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE EARNINGS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, OUR MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS CONSISTED OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITY NOTE PAYABLE AND CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF U.S. TREASURY FIXED RATE SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY FIXED RATE SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED FIXED RATE SECURITIES, FDIC GUARANTEED FIXED RATE CORPORATE DEBT, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT ISSUED FIXED RATE SECURITIES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT GUARANTEED FIXED RATE SECURITIES AND A MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITY. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES INCLUDE GENERAL UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS OF THE ISSUING AGENCY, INCLUDING ISSUES FROM THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK, OR FHLB, FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, OR FANNIE MAE, AND FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION, OR FREDDIE MAC. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES INCLUDE FIXED RATE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC AND GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, OR GINNIE MAE. FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION, OR FDIC, GUARANTEED CORPORATE DEBT INCLUDES OBLIGATIONS OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA SET FORTH UNDER THE FEDERAL TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE PROGRAM, OR TLGP, AND IS UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY THE FDIC. FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC, FHLB AND GINNIE MAE ARE REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY, OR FHFA. WORKING WITH THE CONGRESS AND THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT, THE U.S. TREASURY AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAVE PLEDGED TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY TO THESE U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCIES. WE HAVE NOT RECORDED ANY IMPAIRMENT AGAINST OUR HOLDINGS IN THESE SECURITIES DUE TO THE SUPPORT OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT OF THESE AGENCIES. NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT ISSUED SECURITIES CONSIST OF DIRECT OBLIGATIONS OF HIGHLY-RATED GOVERNMENTS OF NATIONS OTHER THEN THE UNITED STATES. NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT GUARANTEED SECURITIES CONSIST OF OBLIGATIONS OF AGENCIES AND OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE EXPLICITLY GUARANTEED BY HIGHLY-RATED GOVERNMENTS OF NATIONS OTHER THEN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE NOT RECORDED IMPAIRMENTS AGAINST OUR HOLDINGS IN THESE SECURITIES DUE TO THE SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNMENTS OF THESE AGENCIES AND ENTITIES. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. 65 TABLE OF CONTENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, FAIR VALUES AND RELATED WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE WERE AS FOLLOWS: NOTE PAYABLE: IN DECEMBER 2006, WE PURCHASED AN API MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FROM SIEGFRIED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NOTE PAYABLE TO SIEGFRIED APPROXIMATED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTE OF $25.0 MILLION (SEE NOTE 11 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT). ASSUMING OTHER FACTORS ARE HELD CONSTANT, AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES GENERALLY WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NOTE. THE NOTE IS DENOMINATED IN SWISS FRANCS AND ITS FAIR VALUE WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR / SWISS FRANC EXCHANGE RATE. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTE REFLECTS THE U.S. DOLLAR / SWISS FRANC EXCHANGE RATE AND SWISS INTEREST RATES. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS: WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PROTECT AGAINST CHANGES IN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008 HAD SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 24 MONTHS. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES UNDER ASC 815 AND, ACCORDINGLY, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THEM ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), OR OCI, AND RECLASSIFIED TO OPERATIONS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT OPERATIONS. ANY INEFFECTIVENESS ON THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IS REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME, NET. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES WERE AS FOLLOWS: NOTIONAL AMOUNT FOREIGN CURRENCY 2009 2008 EURO $ 1,107,340 $ 704,198 THE NOTIONAL SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008 WERE $1.107 BILLION AND $704.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. WE CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF OUR OWN AND THE COUNTERPARTIES CREDIT RISK ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO EXECUTE ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONTRACT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, CREDIT RISK DID NOT MATERIALLY CHANGE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS. 66 TABLE OF CONTENTS WE RECOGNIZED REDUCTIONS IN NET PRODUCT SALES FOR CERTAIN EFFECTIVE CASH FLOW HEDGE INSTRUMENTS OF $36.4 MILLION FOR 2009 AND $0.4 MILLION FOR 2008. THESE SETTLEMENTS WERE RECORDED IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED FORECASTED SALES OCCURRED. WE RECOGNIZED AN INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN EFFECTIVE CASH FLOW HEDGE INSTRUMENTS OF $0.6 MILLION FOR 2009 AND A DECREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN EFFECTIVE CASH FLOW HEDGE INSTRUMENTS OF $4.0 MILLION FOR 2008. THESE SETTLEMENTS WERE RECORDED IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED FORECASTED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES OCCURRED. WE RECOGNIZED AN INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME, NET FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN EFFECTIVE CASH FLOW HEDGE INSTRUMENTS OF $11.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008. THESE SETTLEMENTS WERE RECORDED IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED FORECASTED EXPENSES OCCURRED. CHANGES IN TIME VALUE, WHICH WE EXCLUDED FROM THE HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT, WERE INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME, NET. WE ALSO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN RECOGNIZED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS HEDGES UNDER ASC 815 AND, ACCORDINGLY, ANY CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME, NET IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD NON-DESIGNATED HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008 WERE $483.2 MILLION AND $56.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, WE BELIEVE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS A REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES. ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2009 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WOULD CHANGE BY APPROXIMATELY $154.1 MILLION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS EITHER HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES OR HEDGE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE ENTITIES FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE EITHER REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS OR REMEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEM. 67 TABLE OF CONTENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY CELGENE CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY WE OR OUR) IS A GLOBAL INTEGRATED BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN THE DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF INNOVATIVE THERAPIES DESIGNED TO TREAT CANCER AND IMMUNE-INFLAMMATORY RELATED DISEASES. OUR PRIMARY COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS INCLUDE REVLIMID®, THALOMID® (INCLUSIVE OF THALIDOMIDE CELGENETM AND THALIDOMIDE PHARMIONTM, SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION OF PHARMION CORPORATION, OR PHARMION) AND VIDAZA®. ALKERAN® WAS LICENSED FROM GLAXOSMITHKLINE, OR GSK, AND SOLD UNDER OUR LABEL THROUGH MARCH 31, 2009, THE CONCLUSION DATE OF THE ALKERAN® LICENSE WITH GSK. REVLIMID® IS AN ORAL IMMUNOMODULATORY DRUG MARKETED IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND ASIA / PACIFIC FOR PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE MYELOMA WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY AND IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA AND CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA FOR THE TREATMENT OF TRANSFUSION-DEPENDENT ANEMIA DUE TO LOW- OR INTERMEDIATE-1-RISK MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES, OR MDS, ASSOCIATED WITH A DELETION 5Q CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITY WITH OR WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITIES. THALOMID® IS MARKETED FOR PATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND FOR THE ACUTE TREATMENT OF THE CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF MODERATE TO SEVERE ERYTHEMA NODOSUM LEPROSUM, OR ENL, AN INFLAMMATORY COMPLICATION OF LEPROSY. VIDAZA® IS A PYRIMIDINE NUCLEOSIDE ANALOG THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF DNA HYPERMETHYLATION AND PROMOTE SUBSEQUENT GENE RE-EXPRESSION. VIDAZA® IS LICENSED FROM PFIZER, AND IS MARKETED IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALL SUBTYPES OF MDS AND WAS GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF MDS THROUGH MAY 2011. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009, THE NATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE CANCER NETWORK, OR NCCN, UPGRADED VIDAZA® TO A CATEGORY 1 RECOMMENDED TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH INTERMEDIATE-2 AND HIGH-RISK MDS. IN EUROPE, VIDAZA® IS MARKETED FOR THE TREATMENT OF CERTAIN QUALIFIED ADULT PATIENTS AND WAS GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF MDS AND ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA, OR AML, IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, OR EU, EXPIRING DECEMBER 2018. WE CONTINUE TO INVEST SUBSTANTIALLY IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND THE DRUG CANDIDATES IN OUR PIPELINE ARE AT VARIOUS STAGES OF PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT. THESE CANDIDATES INCLUDE OUR IMIDS® COMPOUNDS, WHICH ARE A CLASS OF COMPOUNDS PROPRIETARY TO US AND HAVING CERTAIN IMMUNOMODULATORY AND OTHER BIOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT PROPERTIES, IN ADDITION TO OUR LEADING ORAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS AND CELL PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THAT CONTINUED ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRIMARY COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS, DEPTH OF OUR PRODUCT PIPELINE, REGULATORY APPROVALS OF BOTH NEW PRODUCTS AND EXPANDED USE OF EXISTING PRODUCTS PROVIDE THE CATALYSTS FOR FUTURE GROWTH. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE REPORTED REVENUE OF $2.690 BILLION, NET INCOME OF $776.7 MILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $1.66. REVENUE INCREASED BY $435.1 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR CONTINUED EXPANSION INTO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND REVENUE GROWTH OF REVLIMID® AND VIDAZA®, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET DECREASES IN REVENUES FROM THALOMID® AND ALKERAN®. THE DECREASE IN THALOMID® WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER UNIT VOLUMES IN THE UNITED STATES RESULTING FROM THE INCREASED USE OF REVLIMID®, WHILE THE DECREASE IN ALKERAN® WAS DUE TO THE MARCH 31, 2009 CONCLUSION OF THE ALKERAN® LICENSE WITH GSK. NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR 2009 REFLECT THE EARNINGS CONTRIBUTIONS FROM HIGHER REVLIMID® AND VIDAZA® REVENUES, PARTLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SPENDING FOR NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES, RECURRING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND THE EXPANSION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 INCLUDED A $1.740 BILLION CHARGE FOR ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, OR IPR&D, RELATED TO THE PHARMION ACQUISITION IN MARCH 2008. 43 TABLE OF CONTENTS FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING DEMAND FOR OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS, REGULATORY APPROVALS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES, THE TIMING AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS LAUNCHED BY US OR COMPETING COMPANIES, THE TIMING OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES, CHALLENGES TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL COSTS.

THE INCREASE WAS COMPRISED OF NET VOLUME INCREASES OF $428.0 MILLION AND PRICE INCREASES OF $61.5 MILLION, PARTLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE DUE TO THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE OF $59.8 MILLION. REVLIMID® NET SALES INCREASED BY $381.8 MILLION, OR 28.8% TO $1.706 BILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED UNIT SALES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. INCREASED MARKET PENETRATION AND THE INCREASE IN DURATION OF THERAPY AND NUMBER OF PATIENTS USING REVLIMID® IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA CONTRIBUTED TO U.S. GROWTH. THE GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS REFLECTS THE EXPANSION OF OUR COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES IN OVER 65 COUNTRIES AND PRODUCT REIMBURSEMENT APPROVALS. 44 TABLE OF CONTENTS THALOMID® NET SALES DECREASED BY $67.8 MILLION, OR 13.4%, TO $436.9 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER UNIT VOLUMES IN THE UNITED STATES RESULTING FROM THE INCREASED USE OF REVLIMID®, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PRICING AND VOLUME INCREASES IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. VIDAZA® NET SALES INCREASED BY $180.5 MILLION, OR 87.3%, TO $387.2 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECEMBER 2008 FULL MARKETING AUTHORIZATION GRANTED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, OR EC, FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR HAEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION WITH INTERMEDIATE-2 AND HIGH-RISK MDS ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL PROGNOSTIC SYSTEM SCORE, OR IPSS, OR CHRONIC MYELOMONOCYTIC LEUKAEMIA, OR CMML, WITH 10-29 PERCENT MARROW BLASTS WITHOUT MYELOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER, OR AML WITH 20-30 PERCENT BLASTS AND MULTI-LINEAGE DYSPLASIA, ACCORDING TO WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, OR WHO, CLASSIFICATION OF VIDAZA®.

REVLIMID® NET SALES INCREASED BY $550.8 MILLION, OR 71.2%, TO $1.325 BILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CONTINUED EXPANSION IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. INCREASED MARKET PENETRATION AND THE INCREASE IN DURATION OF PATIENTS USING REVLIMID® IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE U.S. GROWTH. INTERNATIONAL SALES GROWTH PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF THE JUNE 2007 ECS APPROVAL FOR THE USE OF REVLIMID® FOR TREATMENT IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE OF PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE MYELOMA WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY AND CONTINUED EXPANSION IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THALOMID® NET SALES INCREASED BY $57.6 MILLION, OR 12.9%, TO $504.7 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 2008 INCLUSION OF INTERNATIONAL SALES, RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION OF PHARMION. IN ADDITION, U.S. PRICE INCREASES WERE OFFSET BY LOWER SALES VOLUMES. VIDAZA® NET SALES OF $206.7 MILLION REPRESENTED SALES RECORDED SUBSEQUENT TO THE MARCH 7, 2008 PHARMION ACQUISITION IN BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. ALKERANÂ NET SALES INCREASED BY $8.2 MILLION, OR 11.1%, TO $81.7 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN UNIT SALES OF THE INJECTABLE FORM. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES, SALES DISCOUNTS, GOVERNMENT REBATES, AND CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES. THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER OUR S.T.E.P.S.® PROGRAM WHICH WE DEVELOPED AND IS A PROPRIETARY COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION AND RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF PROVIDING FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, THALOMID® IS ALSO DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES SPECIFICATIONS TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES UNDER THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID® IS ALSO DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES SPECIFICATIONS TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. VIDAZA® IS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN. VIDAZA® IS NOT SUBJECTED TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS THALOMID® AND REVLIMID®. 45 TABLE OF CONTENTS WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DOES NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY TO DATE. SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES. CHARGEBACKS ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. ON JANUARY 28, 2008, THE FISCAL YEAR 2008 NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT WAS ENACTED, WHICH EXPANDS TRICARE TO INCLUDE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS DISPENSED BY TRICARE RETAIL NETWORK PHARMACIES. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS REFLECT THIS PROGRAM EXPANSION AND ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA. SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS. 46 TABLE OF CONTENTS GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS AND THE BALANCE IN THE RELATED ALLOWANCE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 2009 COMPARED TO 2008: RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES DECREASED BY $5.9 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE COMPLETION OF AN INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVE CONDUCTED BY A MAJOR PHARMACY CHAIN DURING 2009, DECREASED REVENUE FROM PRODUCTS WITH A HIGHER RETURN RATE HISTORY IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 AND A DECREASE IN ALKERAN® RETURNS DUE TO THE MARCH 31, 2009 CONCLUSION OF THE ALKERAN® LICENSE WITH GSK.

CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES DECREASED BY $11.5 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED REVENUE FROM PRODUCTS WITH A HIGHER CHARGEBACK HISTORY IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 AND A DECREASE IN ALKERAN® CHARGEBACKS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES DUE TO CERTAIN PROGRAMS COMMENCED IN 2009. 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES DECREASED BY $19.2 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED THALOMID® INVENTORY IN THE SALES CHANNEL RESULTING FROM THE 2007 THALOMID® INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION AT SEVERAL MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, WHICH ALSO RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL RETURNS DURING 2007. IN ADDITION, 2007 INCLUDES AN INCREASE IN THALOMID® RETURNS RESULTING FROM THE ANTICIPATED INCREASE IN USE OF REVLIMID® IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA. DISCOUNTS INCREASED BY $8.0 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES OF REVLIMIDÂ AS WELL AS THE INCLUSION OF FORMER PHARMION PRODUCTS, WHICH RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL DISCOUNTS TAKEN. 47 TABLE OF CONTENTS GOVERNMENT REBATES INCREASED BY $7.0 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT REBATES RESULTING FROM OUR GLOBAL EXPANSION, AS WELL AS THE INCLUSION OF FORMER PHARMION PRODUCTS.

THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ELIMINATION OF LICENSE FEES AND AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED REVENUES RELATED TO PHARMION SUBSEQUENT TO THE MARCH 7, 2008 ACQUISITION AND WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN MILESTONE PAYMENTS RECEIVED IN 2009. 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: REVENUES FROM COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER SOURCES TOTALED $14.9 MILLION AND $20.1 MILLION FOR 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE $5.2 MILLION DECREASE IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ELIMINATION OF LICENSE FEES AND AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED REVENUES RELATED TO PHARMION. ROYALTY REVENUE: 2009 COMPARED TO 2008: ROYALTY REVENUE INCREASED BY $6.6 MILLION TO $108.8 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 DUE TO THE 2009 INCLUSION OF $9.0 MILLION IN RESIDUAL ALKERAN® PAYMENTS EARNED BY US BASED UPON GSKS ALKERAN® REVENUES SUBSEQUENT TO THE CONCLUSION OF THE ALKERAN® LICENSE WITH GSK.

THE $2.4 MILLION EXPENSE IN 2007 INCLUDED EXPENSES RELATED TO A TERMINATION BENEFIT RESULTING FROM THE MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS OF A TERMINATED EMPLOYEE AND WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS. INCOME TAX PROVISION: 2009 COMPARED TO 2008: THE INCOME TAX PROVISION INCREASED BY $34.2 MILLION TO $199.0 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008. THE 2009 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 20.4% REFLECTS THE IMPACT FROM OUR LOW TAX SWISS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS AND OUR OVERALL GLOBAL MIX OF INCOME. THE INCOME TAX PROVISION INCLUDED A $17.0 MILLION NET TAX BENEFIT, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF FILING 2008 INCOME TAX RETURNS WITH CERTAIN ITEMS BEING MORE FAVORABLE THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED, REDUCTION IN A VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATED TO CAPITAL LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND THE SETTLEMENT OF TAX EXAMINATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO CERTAIN ONGOING INCOME TAX AUDITS. 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: THE INCOME TAX PROVISION DECREASED BY $125.7 MILLION TO $164.8 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF NEGATIVE 12% REFLECTS NON-DEDUCTIBLE IPR&D CHARGES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF PHARMION. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF IPR&D AND THE EXPENSE RELATED TO THE PREPAYMENT OF OUR ROYALTY OBLIGATION FOR UNAPPROVED PRODUCTS, WAS 24.8%, WHICH REFLECTS THE BENEFIT OF OUR LOW TAX SWISS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS AND OUR OVERALL GLOBAL MIX OF INCOME. 52 TABLE OF CONTENTS NET INCOME (LOSS): NET INCOME (LOSS) AND PER COMMON SHARE AMOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (1) IN COMPUTING DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR 2007, THE NUMERATOR HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO ADD BACK THE AFTER-TAX AMOUNT OF INTEREST EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN THE YEAR ON OUR CONVERTIBLE DEBT. NO ADJUSTMENT TO THE NUMERATOR OR DENOMINATOR WAS MADE IN 2008 DUE TO THE ANTI-DILUTIVE EFFECT OF ANY POTENTIAL COMMON STOCK AS A RESULT OF OUR NET LOSS. AS OF THEIR MATURITY DATE, JUNE 1, 2008, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CONVERTIBLE NOTES WERE CONVERTED INTO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. 2009 COMPARED TO 2008: NET INCOME FOR 2009 REFLECTS THE EARNINGS IMPACT FROM HIGHER SALES OF REVLIMID® AND VIDAZA®, WHICH WAS PARTLY DUE TO SALES INCREASES IN THE UNITED STATES AND OUR CONTINUED EXPANSION INTO NEW INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND THE GRANTING OF FULL MARKETING AUTHORIZATION BY THE EC OF VIDAZA® FOR SPECIFIED TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS. THE EARNINGS GENERATED FROM INCREASED SALES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY INCREASED R&D SPENDING, THE COSTS RELATED TO NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES AND OUR ONGOING EXPANSION OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. NET LOSS FOR 2008 INCLUDED $1.74 BILLION IN IPR&D CHARGES RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF PHARMION AND A $303.1 MILLION CHARGE FOR THE OCTOBER 2008 ROYALTY OBLIGATION PAYMENT TO PFIZER RELATED TO UNAPPROVED FORMS OF VIDAZA®. 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: NET INCOME DECREASED BY $1.76 BILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO $1.74 BILLION IN IPR&D CHARGES AND $102.3 MILLION IN ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES AMORTIZATION RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF PHARMION IN MARCH 2008, IN ADDITION TO A $303.1 MILLION CHARGE FOR THE OCTOBER 2008 ROYALTY OBLIGATION PAYMENT TO PFIZER RELATED TO THE UNAPPROVED FORMS OF VIDAZA®. THESE COSTS WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NET REVENUES PROVIDED BY REVLIMID® AND VIDAZA®. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 53 TABLE OF CONTENTS OPERATING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2009 INCREASED BY $727.7 MILLION TO $909.9 MILLION AS COMPARED TO 2008. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO:  HIGHER NET INCOME,  TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND  THE OCTOBER 3, 2008 PREPAYMENT OF OUR ROYALTY OBLIGATION UNDER THE JUNE 7, 2001 5-AZACYTIDINE LICENSE IN FULL FOR $425.0 MILLION. ALSO SEE DISCUSSION OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND WORKING CAPITAL BELOW. INVESTING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2009 INCREASED BY $333.8 MILLION TO $856.1 MILLION AS COMPARED TO 2008. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE OF $749.3 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO NET PROCEEDS FROM NET SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE OF $312.1 MILLION IN 2008, PARTLY OFFSET BY THE $746.8 MILLION OF CASH PAID TO ACQUIRE PHARMION IN 2008. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES MADE IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007 RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE EXPANSION OF OUR MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES, UPGRADES TO OUR FACILITIES, AS WELL AS SPENDING ON COMPUTER AND LABORATORY EQUIPMENT TO ACCOMMODATE OUR BUSINESS GROWTH. IN 2009, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INCLUDED THE COST OF DEVELOPING AN ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND IN 2008, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INCLUDED THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING THE ORACLE ENTERPRISE BUSINESS SUITE, OR EBS. IN 2007, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INCLUDED THE COST OF BUILDING OUR INTERNATIONAL HEADQUARTERS IN BOUDRY, SWITZERLAND AND COMPUTER EQUIPMENT. FOR 2010, WE ARE FORECASTING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE RANGE OF APPROXIMATELY $140 MILLION TO $150 MILLION COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $93.4 MILLION IN 2009, AND WE EXPECT TO FUND THIS WITH OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS. FINANCING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $61.9 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $281.6 MILLION IN 2008. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO:  PURCHASE OF $209 MILLION OF TREASURY SHARES IN 2009  A DECREASE IN THE PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF COMMON STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS IN 2009 AND  A DECREASE IN THE TAX BENEFIT FROM SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS IN 2009. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND WORKING CAPITAL: WORKING CAPITAL AND CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (1) INCLUDES CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET OF ALLOWANCES, INVENTORY AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, LESS ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES, INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: WE INVEST OUR EXCESS CASH PRIMARILY IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS, U.S. TREASURY FIXED RATE SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY FIXED RATE SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED FIXED RATE SECURITIES, FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION, OR FDIC, GUARANTEED FIXED RATE CORPORATE DEBT, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT ISSUED SECURITIES AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT GUARANTEED SECURITIES. ALL LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND ALL INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE. WE DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. THE INCREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AT THE END OF 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET THE CASH PAID OUT UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ANNOUNCED IN APRIL 2009 AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. 54 TABLE OF CONTENTS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET INCREASED BY $126.4 MILLION TO $438.6 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES OF REVLIMID® AND VIDAZA®. DAYS OF SALES OUTSTANDING, OR DSO, IN 2009 AMOUNTED TO 56 DAYS COMPARED TO 42 DAYS IN 2008. THE DSO INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED INTERNATIONAL SALES FOR WHICH THE COLLECTION PERIOD IS LONGER THAN FOR U.S. SALES. WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE AS OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES CONTINUE TO EXPAND. INVENTORY: INVENTORY BALANCES INCREASED BY $0.5 MILLION TO $100.7 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008. THE INCREASE REFLECTED HIGHER LEVELS OF REVLIMID® AND VIDAZA® INVENTORIES, WHICH WERE MOSTLY OFFSET BY THE ELIMINATION OF ALKERAN® INVENTORIES RESULTING FROM THE CONCLUSION OF THE GSK SUPPLY AGREEMENT AND REDUCTIONS IN THALOMID® DUE TO LOWER SALES VOLUMES. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS: OTHER CURRENT ASSETS INCREASED BY $68.5 MILLION TO $258.9 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND AN INCREASE IN PREPAID EXPENSES, PRIMARILY SALES, USE AND VALUE ADDED TAXES. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES: ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES DECREASED BY $28.7 MILLION TO $446.0 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, WHICH WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN CLINICAL TRIAL ACCRUALS AND ACCRUED PAYROLL RELATED EXPENSES, RESULTING FROM OUR EXPANDED BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. INCOME TAXES PAYABLE (CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT): INCOME TAXES PAYABLE INCREASED $59.5 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY FROM THE CURRENT PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES OF $225.9 MILLION PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TAX PAYMENTS OF $60.0 MILLION AND A TAX BENEFIT ON STOCK OPTION EXERCISES OF $103.4 MILLION. WE EXPECT CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR EXPENDITURES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TRIALS, REGULATORY APPROVALS, INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION, COMMERCIALIZATION OF PRODUCTS AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, COMBINED WITH CASH RECEIVED FROM EXPECTED NET PRODUCT SALES AND ROYALTY AGREEMENTS, WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL RESOURCES TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009: PAYMENT DUE BY PERIOD LESS THAN MORE THAN IN THOUSANDS $ 1 YEAR 1 TO 3 YEARS 3 TO 5 YEARS 5 YEARS TOTAL OPERATING LEASES $ 26,578 $ 37,207 $ 15,815 $ 19,541 $ 99,141 MANUFACTURING FACILITY NOTE PAYABLE 3,964 7,832 7,736 7,736 27,268 OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS 97,121 60,424   157,545 TOTAL $ 127,663 $ 105,463 $ 23,551 $ 27,277 $ 283,954 OPERATING LEASES: WE LEASE OFFICE AND RESEARCH FACILITIES UNDER VARIOUS OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE NON-CANCELABLE LEASE TERMS FOR THE OPERATING LEASES EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES BETWEEN 2010 AND 2018 AND INCLUDE RENEWAL OPTIONS. IN GENERAL, WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE LESSORS FOR REAL ESTATE TAXES, INSURANCE, UTILITIES, MAINTENANCE AND OTHER OPERATING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEASES. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE MAJOR FACILITIES THAT WE OCCUPY UNDER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS REFER TO PART I, ITEM 2, PROPERTIES OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. 55 TABLE OF CONTENTS MANUFACTURING FACILITY NOTE PAYABLE: IN DECEMBER 2006, WE PURCHASED AN API MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FROM SIEGFRIED LOCATED IN ZOFINGEN, SWITZERLAND. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NOTE PAYABLE TO SIEGFRIED APPROXIMATED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTE OF $25.0 MILLION. OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS: OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS INCLUDE $146.2 MILLION IN CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPLY CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE COMMITTED TO INVEST $20.0 MILLION IN AN INVESTMENT FUND OVER A TEN-YEAR PERIOD, WHICH IS CALLABLE AT ANY TIME. ON DECEMBER 31, 2009, OUR REMAINING INVESTMENT COMMITMENT WAS $10.5 MILLION. FOR MORE INFORMATION REFER TO NOTE 19 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. INCOME TAXES PAYABLE: WE HAVE PROVIDED A LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAX MATTERS OF $450.2 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 OF WHICH $27.8 MILLION IS CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT. THE REMAINING BALANCE OF $422.4 MILLION IS CLASSIFIED AS NON-CURRENT BECAUSE THE TIMING OF THE SETTLEMENT OF THESE AMOUNTS IS NOT REASONABLY ESTIMABLE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. WE DO NOT EXPECT A SETTLEMENT OF THE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS CLASSIFIED AS NON-CURRENT WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS: WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT INCLUDE THE FUNDING OF CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE MILESTONE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED DEVELOPMENTAL, REGULATORY AND /OR COMMERCIAL TARGETS. SEE NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON 10-K FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS. OUR OBLIGATION TO FUND THESE EFFORTS IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROGRAMS, THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF RESEARCH COMPOUNDS THAT WE CHOOSE TO LICENSE AND/OR THE LACK OF ANY ADVERSE EVENTS WHICH COULD CAUSE THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE PROGRAMS. THE TABLE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K DOES NOT INCLUDE POTENTIAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $3.750 BILLION, WHICH ARE EITHER CONTINGENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF VARIOUS RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES (APPROXIMATELY $2.220 BILLION) OR ARE SALES-BASED MILESTONES (APPROXIMATELY $1.530 BILLION). RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES DEPEND PRIMARILY UPON FUTURE FAVORABLE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND REGULATORY AGENCY ACTIONS, NEITHER OF WHICH MAY EVER OCCUR. SALES-BASED MILESTONES ARE CONTINGENT ON GENERATING CERTAIN LEVELS OF FUTURE SALES OF PRODUCTS. SINCE THE ACHIEVEMENT AND TIMING OF THESE MILESTONES IS NEITHER DETERMINABLE NOR REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, SUCH CONTINGENCIES HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TABLE OR RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. NEW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN JUNE 2009, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD, OR FASB, ESTABLISHED THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATIONTM, OR ASC, AS THE SOURCE OF AUTHORITATIVE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES RECOGNIZED BY THE FASB TO BE APPLIED BY NONGOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES IN PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES. ALL OTHER ACCOUNTING LITERATURE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ASC IS NOW NONAUTHORITATIVE. THE ASC WAS EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS ENDING AFTER SEPTEMBER 15, 2009 AND ITS ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE ASC IS UPDATED THROUGH THE FASBS ISSUANCE OF ACCOUNTING STANDARD UPDATES, OR ASUS. SUMMARIZED BELOW ARE RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AS DESCRIBED UNDER THE NEW ASC STRUCTURE. IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED ASC NO. 825, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, OR ASC 825, WHICH ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE FASB PARTIALLY DEFERRED THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF ASC 825 FOR NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A NONRECURRING BASIS TO FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2008. OUR ADOPTION OF ASC 825 RELATED TO NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. 56 TABLE OF CONTENTS IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB RATIFIED ASC NO. 808, ACCOUNTING FOR COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OR ASC 808, WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR ASC NO. 730, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, RELATED TO HOW THE PARTIES TO A COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENT SHOULD ACCOUNT FOR COSTS INCURRED AND REVENUE GENERATED ON SALES TO THIRD PARTIES, HOW SHARING PAYMENTS PURSUANT TO A COLLABORATION AGREEMENT SHOULD BE PRESENTED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT AND CERTAIN RELATED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. THE GUIDANCE FOR ASC 808 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 ON A RETROSPECTIVE BASIS AND DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED ASC NO. 805, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, OR ASC 805, WHICH REQUIRES AN ACQUIRER TO RECOGNIZE THE ASSETS ACQUIRED, THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND ANY NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE ACQUIREE AT THE ACQUISITION DATE, MEASURED AT THEIR FAIR VALUES AS OF THAT DATE, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS. THIS STATEMENT ALSO REQUIRES THE CAPITALIZATION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION AT THEIR ACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUES, SEPARATELY FROM GOODWILL. IN ADDITION, ASC 805 REQUIRES THAT ANY POST-ACQUISITION ADJUSTMENTS TO DEFERRED TAX ASSET VALUATION ALLOWANCES AND LIABILITIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS BE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT PERIOD INCOME TAX EXPENSE. ASC 805 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 AND WE ACCOUNTED FOR POST-ACQUISITION TAX-RELATED ADJUSTMENTS FOR PRE-2009 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND WILL ACCOUNT FOR FUTURE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND CERTAIN OTHER DEVELOPMENTS FROM PAST COMBINATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS PROVISIONS. IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC NO. 810, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH CHANGES THE ACCOUNTING FOR AND REPORTING OF NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS (FORMERLY KNOWN AS MINORITY INTERESTS) IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE AMENDMENT WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 AND DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN MARCH 2008, THE FASB ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC NO. 815, DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, WHICH IS INTENDED TO IMPROVE FINANCIAL REPORTING ABOUT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES BY REQUIRING ENHANCED DISCLOSURES TO ENABLE INVESTORS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR EFFECTS ON AN ENTITYS FINANCIAL POSITION, FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND CASH FLOWS. THE AMENDMENT WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 AND THE EXPANDED DISCLOSURES ARE INCLUDED IN NOTE 6. IN APRIL 2008, THE FASB ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC NO. 350, DETERMINATION OF THE USEFUL LIFE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH AMENDS THE FACTORS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN DEVELOPING RENEWAL OR EXTENSION ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE THE USEFUL LIFE OF A RECOGNIZED INTANGIBLE ASSET. THE AMENDMENT WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 AND DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN MAY 2008, THE FASB ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC NO. 470 ACCOUNTING FOR CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT MAY BE SETTLED IN CASH UPON CONVERSION (INCLUDING PARTIAL CASH SETTLEMENT), WHICH REQUIRES SEPARATE ACCOUNTING FOR THE DEBT AND EQUITY COMPONENTS OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT ISSUANCES THAT HAVE A CASH SETTLEMENT FEATURE PERMITTING SETTLEMENT PARTIALLY OR FULLY IN CASH UPON CONVERSION. A COMPONENT OF SUCH DEBT ISSUANCES THAT IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONVERSION FEATURE AT INCEPTION SHOULD BE BIFURCATED AND RECORDED TO EQUITY, WITH THE RESULTING DEBT DISCOUNT AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE IN A MANNER THAT REFLECTS THE ISSUERS NONCONVERTIBLE, UNSECURED DEBT BORROWING RATE. THE REQUIREMENTS FOR SEPARATE ACCOUNTING MUST BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY TO PREVIOUSLY ISSUED CONVERTIBLE DEBT ISSUANCES AS WELL AS PROSPECTIVELY TO NEWLY ISSUED CONVERTIBLE DEBT ISSUANCES, NEGATIVELY AFFECTING BOTH NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE, IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008. SINCE OUR PAST CONVERTIBLE DEBT ISSUANCE DID NOT INCLUDE A CASH SETTLEMENT FEATURE, THE AMENDMENT DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. 57 TABLE OF CONTENTS IN JUNE 2008, THE FASB ISSUED ASC NO. 260, DETERMINING WHETHER INSTRUMENTS GRANTED IN SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS ARE PARTICIPATING SECURITIES, OR ASC 260. THE ASC ADDRESSES WHETHER INSTRUMENTS GRANTED IN SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS ARE PARTICIPATING SECURITIES PRIOR TO VESTING AND THEREFORE NEED TO BE INCLUDED IN THE EARNINGS ALLOCATION IN CALCULATING EARNINGS PER SHARE UNDER THE TWO-CLASS METHOD AND REQUIRES COMPANIES TO TREAT UNVESTED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS THAT HAVE NON-FORFEITABLE RIGHTS TO DIVIDENDS OR DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS AS A SEPARATE CLASS OF SECURITIES IN CALCULATING EARNINGS PER SHARE. ASC 260 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009. SINCE OUR PAST SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS DID NOT INCLUDE NON-FORFEITABLE RIGHTS TO DIVIDENDS OR DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS, THE ADOPTION OF ASC 260 DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FASB RATIFIED ASC NO. 323, EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS, OR ASC 323, WHICH CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS AND IMPAIRMENT CONSIDERATIONS INVOLVING EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS. ASC 323 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 AND DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FASB RATIFIED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC NO. 350, ACCOUNTING FOR DEFENSIVE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS WHICH AN ACQUIRER DOES NOT INTEND TO ACTIVELY USE BUT INTENDS TO HOLD TO PREVENT ITS COMPETITORS FROM OBTAINING ACCESS TO THEM. THE AMENDMENT REQUIRES AN ACQUIRER IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION TO ACCOUNT FOR A DEFENSIVE INTANGIBLE ASSET AS A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, WHICH SHOULD BE AMORTIZED TO EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD THE ASSET DIMINISHES IN VALUE. THE AMENDMENT WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 AND WE WILL ACCOUNT FOR DEFENSIVE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN FUTURE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS PROVISIONS. IN APRIL 2009, THE FASB ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC NO. 820, DETERMINING FAIR VALUE WHEN THE VOLUME AND LEVEL OF ACTIVITY FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AND IDENTIFYING TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE NOT ORDERLY, OR ASC 820. THIS AMENDMENT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE FOR ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 820 WHEN THE VOLUME AND LEVEL OF ACTIVITY FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AND ALSO INCLUDES GUIDANCE ON IDENTIFYING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT INDICATE A TRANSACTION IS NOT ORDERLY FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THIS AMENDMENT SHALL BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY WITH RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION NOT PERMITTED. THIS AMENDMENT WAS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS ENDING AFTER JUNE 15, 2009. THE ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN APRIL 2009, THE FASB ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC 320, RECOGNITION AND PRESENTATION OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS. THIS AMENDMENT WAS ISSUED TO MAKE THE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS GUIDANCE MORE OPERATIONAL AND TO IMPROVE THE PRESENTATION OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS AMENDMENT REPLACES THE EXISTING REQUIREMENT THAT THE ENTITYS MANAGEMENT ASSERT IT HAS BOTH THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD AN IMPAIRED DEBT SECURITY UNTIL RECOVERY WITH A REQUIREMENT THAT MANAGEMENT ASSERT IT DOES NOT HAVE THE INTENT TO SELL THE SECURITY, AND IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT IT WILL NOT HAVE TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF ITS COST BASIS. THIS AMENDMENT PROVIDES INCREASED DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE CREDIT AND NONCREDIT COMPONENTS OF IMPAIRED DEBT SECURITIES THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE SOLD AND ALSO REQUIRES INCREASED AND MORE FREQUENT DISCLOSURES REGARDING EXPECTED CASH FLOWS, CREDIT LOSSES AND AN AGING OF SECURITIES WITH UNREALIZED LOSSES. ALTHOUGH THIS AMENDMENT DOES NOT RESULT IN A CHANGE IN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURITIES, IT DOES REQUIRE THAT THE PORTION OF AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT NOT RELATED TO A CREDIT LOSS FOR A HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITY BE RECOGNIZED IN A NEW CATEGORY OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND BE AMORTIZED OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE DEBT SECURITY AS AN INCREASE IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE SECURITY. THIS AMENDMENT WAS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS ENDING AFTER JUNE 15, 2009. THE ADOPTION OF THIS AMENDMENT DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. 58 TABLE OF CONTENTS IN APRIL 2009, THE FASB ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC 825, INTERIM DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, TO REQUIRE DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT MEASURED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE IN INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS WELL AS IN ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. PRIOR TO THIS AMENDMENT, FAIR VALUES FOR THESE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WERE ONLY DISCLOSED ANNUALLY. THIS AMENDMENT APPLIES TO ALL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF ASC 825 AND REQUIRES ALL ENTITIES TO DISCLOSE THE METHOD(S) AND SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THIS AMENDMENT WAS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM PERIODS ENDING AFTER JUNE 15, 2009. THIS AMENDMENT DOES NOT REQUIRE DISCLOSURES FOR EARLIER PERIODS PRESENTED FOR COMPARATIVE PURPOSES AT INITIAL ADOPTION. IN PERIODS AFTER INITIAL ADOPTION, THIS AMENDMENT REQUIRES COMPARATIVE DISCLOSURES ONLY. THE ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN APRIL 2009, THE FASB ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC NO. 805, ACCOUNTING FOR ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION THAT ARISE FROM CONTINGENCIES. THIS AMENDMENT CLARIFIES APPLICATION ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH INITIAL RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT, SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT AND ACCOUNTING, AND DISCLOSURE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARISING FROM CONTINGENCIES IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. THIS AMENDMENT WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 AND WE WILL ACCOUNT FOR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARISING FROM CONTINGENCIES ACQUIRED IN FUTURE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS PROVISIONS. IN MAY 2009, THE FASB ISSUED ASC NO. 855, SUBSEQUENT EVENTS, OR ASC 855, WHICH ESTABLISHED GENERAL STANDARDS OF ACCOUNTING FOR AND DISCLOSURE OF EVENTS THAT OCCUR AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE BUT BEFORE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE ISSUED. IT SETS FORTH THE PERIOD AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE DURING WHICH MANAGEMENT OF A REPORTING ENTITY SHOULD EVALUATE EVENTS OR TRANSACTIONS THAT OCCUR FOR POTENTIAL RECOGNITION OR DISCLOSURE IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH AN ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE EVENTS OR TRANSACTIONS OCCURRING AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE DISCLOSURES THAT AN ENTITY SHOULD MAKE ABOUT EVENTS OR TRANSACTIONS THAT OCCURRED AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. ASC 855 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS ENDING AFTER JUNE 15, 2009. IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC NO. 860, ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS, WHICH ELIMINATES THE CONCEPT OF A QUALIFYING SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITY, CHANGES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR DERECOGNIZING FINANCIAL ASSETS AND REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES. THIS AMENDMENT CLARIFIES THE DETERMINATION WHETHER A TRANSFEROR AND ALL OF THE ENTITIES INCLUDED IN THE TRANSFERORS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BEING PRESENTED HAVE SURRENDERED CONTROL OVER TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS. IT ALSO ENHANCES INFORMATION REPORTED TO USERS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BY PROVIDING GREATER TRANSPARENCY ABOUT TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND A COMPANYS CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT IN TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS. THIS AMENDMENT WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR OUR FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2010. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT, IF ANY, THAT THE ADOPTION OF THIS AMENDMENT WILL HAVE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO ASC 810, CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, WHICH CHANGES HOW A COMPANY DETERMINES WHEN AN ENTITY THAT IS INSUFFICIENTLY CAPITALIZED OR IS NOT CONTROLLED THROUGH VOTING (OR SIMILAR RIGHTS) SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER A COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE AN ENTITY IS BASED ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AN ENTITYS PURPOSE AND DESIGN AND A COMPANYS ABILITY TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ENTITY THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ENTITYS ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. THIS AMENDMENT REQUIRES ONGOING REASSESSMENTS OF WHETHER AN ENTERPRISE IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY AND WILL REQUIRE A COMPANY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT ITS INVOLVEMENT WITH VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN RISK EXPOSURE DUE TO THAT INVOLVEMENT AND HOW ITS INVOLVEMENT WITH A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY AFFECTS THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS AMENDMENT WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR OUR FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2010. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT, IF ANY, THAT THE ADOPTION OF THIS AMENDMENT WILL HAVE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. 59 TABLE OF CONTENTS IN AUGUST 2009, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2009-05, MEASURING LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE, OR ASU 2009-05, WHICH AMENDS ASC 820 TO PROVIDE CLARIFICATION OF A CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH A QUOTED PRICE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET FOR AN IDENTICAL LIABILITY IS NOT AVAILABLE. A REPORTING ENTITY IS REQUIRED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE USING ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING METHODS: 1) A VALUATION TECHNIQUE THAT USES A) THE QUOTED PRICE OF THE IDENTICAL LIABILITY WHEN TRADED AS AN ASSET OR B) QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR LIABILITIES (OR SIMILAR LIABILITIES WHEN TRADED AS ASSETS) AND/OR 2) A VALUATION TECHNIQUE THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF ASC 820. ASU 2009-05 ALSO CLARIFIES THAT WHEN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY, A REPORTING ENTITY IS NOT REQUIRED TO ADJUST TO INCLUDE INPUTS RELATING TO THE EXISTENCE OF TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS ON THAT LIABILITY. THE ADOPTION OF THIS ASU DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN SEPTEMBER 2009, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2009-12, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURE, OR ASU 2009-12, WHICH PROVIDES ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ON USING THE NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE, PROVIDED BY AN INVESTEE, WHEN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF AN ALTERNATE INVESTMENT THAT DOES NOT HAVE A READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUE AND ENHANCES THE DISCLOSURES CONCERNING THESE INVESTMENTS. ASU 2009-12 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR OUR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS ENDING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2009. IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2009-13, MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS, OR ASU 2009-13, WHICH AMENDS EXISTING REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF ASC 605. THIS GUIDANCE ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENT TO ESTABLISH THE FAIR VALUE OF UNDELIVERED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND INSTEAD PROVIDES FOR SEPARATE REVENUE RECOGNITION BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF THE SELLING PRICE FOR AN UNDELIVERED ITEM WHEN THERE IS NO OTHER MEANS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THAT UNDELIVERED ITEM. ASU 2009-13 IS EFFECTIVE FOR US PROSPECTIVELY FOR REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO OR MATERIALLY MODIFIED BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2011. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT, IF ANY, THAT THE ADOPTION OF THIS AMENDMENT WILL HAVE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IS ONE THAT IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENTS MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL: REVENUE RECOGNITION: REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS OF THE PRODUCT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER. PROVISIONS FOR DISCOUNTS, EARLY PAYMENTS, REBATES, SALES RETURNS AND DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS UNDER TERMS CUSTOMARY IN THE INDUSTRY ARE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SAME PERIOD THE RELATED SALES ARE RECORDED. WE RECORD ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SALE. THE ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR SUCH VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES ARE BASED ON THE SALES TERMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND TREND ANALYSIS. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM ROYALTIES BASED ON LICENSEES SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS USING OUR TECHNOLOGIES. ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACT TERMS WHEN ROYALTIES FROM LICENSEES CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED. IF ROYALTIES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR COLLECTIBILITY OF A ROYALTY AMOUNT IS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED, ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE CASH IS RECEIVED. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES, SALES DISCOUNTS, GOVERNMENT REBATES, AND CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES. 60 TABLE OF CONTENTS THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER OUR S.T.E.P.S.® PROGRAM WHICH WE DEVELOPED AND IS A PROPRIETARY COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION AND RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF PROVIDING FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, THALOMID® IS ALSO DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES SPECIFICATIONS TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES UNDER THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID® IS ALSO DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES SPECIFICATIONS TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. VIDAZA® IS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN. VIDAZA® IS NOT SUBJECTED TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS THALOMID® AND REVLIMID®. WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DOES NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY TO DATE. SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE AMOUNT FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID AND ACCORDINGLY THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES. CHARGEBACKS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. ON JANUARY 28, 2008, THE FISCAL YEAR 2008 NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT WAS ENACTED, WHICH EXPANDS TRICARE TO INCLUDE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS DISPENSED BY TRICARE RETAIL NETWORK PHARMACIES. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS REFLECT THIS PROGRAM EXPANSION AND ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA. INCOME TAXES: WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. WE PROVIDE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE ACCOUNT FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS PART OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THESE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATE PRIMARILY TO ISSUES COMMON AMONG MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE APPLY A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES WHICH INCLUDE STUDIES PERFORMED BY INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS, ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY AND SUBJECT EXPERTS, EVALUATION OF PUBLIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE IRS AND OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. WE PROVIDE ESTIMATES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. IF OUR ESTIMATES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ACTUAL OUTCOMES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED. 61 TABLE OF CONTENTS WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE A PORTION WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR RECENT CUMULATIVE EARNINGS EXPERIENCE BY TAXING JURISDICTION, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, CARRYFORWARD PERIODS AVAILABLE TO US FOR TAX REPORTING PURPOSES, VARIOUS INCOME TAX STRATEGIES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT AND, TO THE EXTENT FUTURE EXPECTATIONS CHANGE, WE WOULD HAVE TO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THAT TIME. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION: THE COST OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IS RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL AWARDS GRANTED, USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES METHOD OF VALUATION. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH AWARD IS DETERMINED AND THE COMPENSATION COST IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD REQUIRED TO OBTAIN FULL VESTING. COMPENSATION COST TO BE RECOGNIZED REFLECTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF AWARDS EXPECTED TO VEST AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AN ESTIMATE OF AWARD FORFEITURES BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE. OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES: A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF ANY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY BELOW ITS COST THAT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN CARRYING AMOUNT TO FAIR VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT IS CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AND A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE SECURITY ESTABLISHED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INCLUDE: SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE ISSUERS EARNINGS PERFORMANCE, CREDIT RATING, ASSET QUALITY, BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE ISSUER OPERATES, LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW OUR COST, OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE SECURITY, OUR INTENT NOT TO SELL AND AN EVALUATION AS TO WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO SELL BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR COST BASIS. ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD DIFFER FROM OUR ASSESSMENT. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES: ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN CURRENT EARNINGS OR OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), DEPENDING ON WHETHER A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION AND, IF IT IS, THE TYPE OF HEDGING TRANSACTION. FOR A DERIVATIVE TO QUALIFY AS A HEDGE AT INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE HEDGED PERIOD, WE FORMALLY DOCUMENT THE NATURE AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEM. WE ASSESS, BOTH AT INCEPTION AND ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING TRANSACTIONS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING THE CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS. WE ASSESS HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND RECORD THE GAIN OR LOSS RELATED TO THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IF ANY, TO CURRENT EARNINGS. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER PROBABLE OF OCCURRING, WE DISCONTINUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING AND ANY RELATED UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE NOT DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION, TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. THE USE OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE EXPOSURE OF THESE RISKS WITH THE INTENT TO REDUCE OUR RISK OR COST. WE DO NOT USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR SPECULATIVE TRADING PURPOSES AND ARE NOT A PARTY TO LEVERAGED DERIVATIVES. 62 TABLE OF CONTENTS INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATED COMPANIES: WE APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING TO OUR INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS, WHICH PRIMARILY INVEST IN COMPANIES CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN LIFE SCIENCES SUCH AS BIOTECHNOLOGY, PHARMACEUTICALS, MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY, MEDICAL DEVICES, DIAGNOSTICS AND HEALTH AND WELLNESS. EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT. IF AN INVESTMENTS FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN ITS NET CARRYING VALUE AND THE DECLINE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE. SUCH AN EVALUATION IS JUDGMENTAL AND DEPENDENT ON SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE HAS OCCURRED INCLUDE: MARKET VALUE OR EXIT PRICE OF THE INVESTMENT BASED ON EITHER MARKET-QUOTED PRICES OR FUTURE ROUNDS OF FINANCING BY THE INVESTEE; LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE MARKET VALUE WAS BELOW ITS COST BASIS; FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE INVESTEE; OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT; ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INVESTEES ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN; AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE MAY BE AWARE OF RELATED TO THE INVESTMENT. ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, OR LTIP, DESIGNED TO PROVIDE KEY OFFICERS AND EXECUTIVES WITH PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES CONTINGENT UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED CORPORATE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES COVERING A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLES RUNNING CONCURRENTLY ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2011 AND 2012. PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR EACH LTIP ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE THREE-YEAR CYCLE: 25% ON NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE, 25% ON NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND 50% ON TOTAL NON-GAAP REVENUE, AS DEFINED. PAYOUTS MAY BE IN THE RANGE OF 0% TO 200% OF THE PARTICIPANTS SALARY FOR THE PLANS. AWARDS ARE PAYABLE IN CASH OR, AT OUR DISCRETION, IN OUR COMMON STOCK BASED UPON OUR STOCK PRICE AT THE PAYOUT DATE. WE ACCRUE THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE LIABILITY OVER EACH THREE-YEAR CYCLE. PRIOR TO THE END OF A THREE-YEAR CYCLE, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT DURING THE CYCLE. UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT EQUAL TO THEIR TARGET AWARD, OR AN AWARD BASED ON ACTUAL PERFORMANCE, IF HIGHER, THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL. ACCRUALS RECORDED FOR THE LTIP ENTAIL MAKING CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE, NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND NON-GAAP REVENUES, AS DEFINED; THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED. ACCRUALS FOR THE LTIP ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND REVISED ACCORDINGLY SO THAT THE LIABILITY RECORDED REFLECTS UPDATED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PAYOUTS. IN ESTIMATING THE ACCRUALS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DATE FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, EXPECTED RESULTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, OPERATING TRENDS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICING AND COMPETITION. 63 TABLE OF CONTENTS VALUATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: WE HAVE ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY THROUGH BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. WHEN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, ARE ACQUIRED WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS ARE TYPICALLY USED IN THESE VALUATIONS, AND THE MODELS REQUIRE THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:  PROJECTING REGULATORY APPROVALS,  ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM PRODUCT SALES RESULTING FROM COMPLETED PRODUCTS AND IN-PROCESS PROJECTS AND  DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES AND PROBABILITY RATES. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS: GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. WE TEST OUR GOODWILL ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT EACH NOVEMBER 30. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE AMORTIZED TO THEIR ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR. WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES. 64 TABLE OF CONTENTS ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES FORWARD-LOOKING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RISK OF LOSS IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES, CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE EARNINGS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, OUR MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS CONSISTED OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITY NOTE PAYABLE AND CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF U.S. TREASURY FIXED RATE SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY FIXED RATE SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED FIXED RATE SECURITIES, FDIC GUARANTEED FIXED RATE CORPORATE DEBT, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT ISSUED FIXED RATE SECURITIES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT GUARANTEED FIXED RATE SECURITIES AND A MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITY. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES INCLUDE GENERAL UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS OF THE ISSUING AGENCY, INCLUDING ISSUES FROM THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK, OR FHLB, FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, OR FANNIE MAE, AND FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION, OR FREDDIE MAC. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES INCLUDE FIXED RATE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC AND GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, OR GINNIE MAE. FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION, OR FDIC, GUARANTEED CORPORATE DEBT INCLUDES OBLIGATIONS OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA SET FORTH UNDER THE FEDERAL TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE PROGRAM, OR TLGP, AND IS UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY THE FDIC. FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC, FHLB AND GINNIE MAE ARE REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY, OR FHFA. WORKING WITH THE CONGRESS AND THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT, THE U.S. TREASURY AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAVE PLEDGED TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY TO THESE U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCIES. WE HAVE NOT RECORDED ANY IMPAIRMENT AGAINST OUR HOLDINGS IN THESE SECURITIES DUE TO THE SUPPORT OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT OF THESE AGENCIES. NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT ISSUED SECURITIES CONSIST OF DIRECT OBLIGATIONS OF HIGHLY-RATED GOVERNMENTS OF NATIONS OTHER THEN THE UNITED STATES. NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT GUARANTEED SECURITIES CONSIST OF OBLIGATIONS OF AGENCIES AND OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE EXPLICITLY GUARANTEED BY HIGHLY-RATED GOVERNMENTS OF NATIONS OTHER THEN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE NOT RECORDED IMPAIRMENTS AGAINST OUR HOLDINGS IN THESE SECURITIES DUE TO THE SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNMENTS OF THESE AGENCIES AND ENTITIES. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. 65 TABLE OF CONTENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, FAIR VALUES AND RELATED WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE WERE AS FOLLOWS: NOTE PAYABLE: IN DECEMBER 2006, WE PURCHASED AN API MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FROM SIEGFRIED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NOTE PAYABLE TO SIEGFRIED APPROXIMATED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTE OF $25.0 MILLION (SEE NOTE 11 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT). ASSUMING OTHER FACTORS ARE HELD CONSTANT, AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES GENERALLY WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NOTE. THE NOTE IS DENOMINATED IN SWISS FRANCS AND ITS FAIR VALUE WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR / SWISS FRANC EXCHANGE RATE. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTE REFLECTS THE U.S. DOLLAR / SWISS FRANC EXCHANGE RATE AND SWISS INTEREST RATES. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS: WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PROTECT AGAINST CHANGES IN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008 HAD SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 24 MONTHS. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES UNDER ASC 815 AND, ACCORDINGLY, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THEM ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), OR OCI, AND RECLASSIFIED TO OPERATIONS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT OPERATIONS. ANY INEFFECTIVENESS ON THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IS REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME, NET. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES WERE AS FOLLOWS: NOTIONAL AMOUNT FOREIGN CURRENCY 2009 2008 EURO $ 1,107,340 $ 704,198 THE NOTIONAL SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008 WERE $1.107 BILLION AND $704.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. WE CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF OUR OWN AND THE COUNTERPARTIES CREDIT RISK ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO EXECUTE ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONTRACT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, CREDIT RISK DID NOT MATERIALLY CHANGE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS. 66 TABLE OF CONTENTS WE RECOGNIZED REDUCTIONS IN NET PRODUCT SALES FOR CERTAIN EFFECTIVE CASH FLOW HEDGE INSTRUMENTS OF $36.4 MILLION FOR 2009 AND $0.4 MILLION FOR 2008. THESE SETTLEMENTS WERE RECORDED IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED FORECASTED SALES OCCURRED. WE RECOGNIZED AN INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN EFFECTIVE CASH FLOW HEDGE INSTRUMENTS OF $0.6 MILLION FOR 2009 AND A DECREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN EFFECTIVE CASH FLOW HEDGE INSTRUMENTS OF $4.0 MILLION FOR 2008. THESE SETTLEMENTS WERE RECORDED IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED FORECASTED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES OCCURRED. WE RECOGNIZED AN INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME, NET FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN EFFECTIVE CASH FLOW HEDGE INSTRUMENTS OF $11.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008. THESE SETTLEMENTS WERE RECORDED IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED FORECASTED EXPENSES OCCURRED. CHANGES IN TIME VALUE, WHICH WE EXCLUDED FROM THE HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT, WERE INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME, NET. WE ALSO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN RECOGNIZED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS HEDGES UNDER ASC 815 AND, ACCORDINGLY, ANY CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME, NET IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD NON-DESIGNATED HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008 WERE $483.2 MILLION AND $56.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, WE BELIEVE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS A REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES. ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2009 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WOULD CHANGE BY APPROXIMATELY $154.1 MILLION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS EITHER HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES OR HEDGE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE ENTITIES FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE EITHER REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS OR REMEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEM. 67 TABLE OF CONTENTS
