NET PRODUCT SALES: TOTAL NET PRODUCT SALES FOR 2010 INCREASED BY $941.1 MILLION, OR 36.7%, TO $3.508 BILLION COMPARED TO 2009. THE INCREASE WAS COMPRISED OF NET VOLUME INCREASES OF $892.5 MILLION, PRICE DECREASES OF $2.1 MILLION AND THE FAVORABLE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN EXCHANGE OF $50.7 MILLION. THE DECREASE IN PRICES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED MEDICAID REBATES RESULTING FROM THE HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT AND AN INCREASE IN REBATES TO U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTS RESULTING FROM THEIR ATTEMPTS TO REDUCE HEALTH CARE COSTS. TOTAL NET PRODUCT SALES FOR 2009 INCREASED BY $429.7 MILLION, OR 20.1%, TO $2.567 BILLION COMPARED TO 2008. THE INCREASE WAS COMPRISED OF NET VOLUME INCREASES OF $428.0 MILLION AND PRICE INCREASES OF $61.5 MILLION, PARTLY OFFSET BY AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN EXCHANGE OF $59.8 MILLION. REVLIMID® NET SALES INCREASED BY $762.7 MILLION, OR 44.7%, TO $2.469 BILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED UNIT SALES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. INCREASED MARKET PENETRATION AND THE INCREASE IN TREATMENT DURATION OF PATIENTS USING REVLIMID® IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA CONTRIBUTED TO U.S. GROWTH. THE 44 TABLE OF CONTENTS GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS REFLECTS THE EXPANSION OF OUR COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES IN OVER 65 COUNTRIES IN ADDITION TO PRODUCT REIMBURSEMENT APPROVALS AND THE LAUNCH OF REVLIMID® IN JAPAN IN THE LATTER PART OF 2010. NET SALES OF REVLIMID® INCREASED BY $381.8 MILLION, OR 28.8%, TO $1.706 BILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED UNIT SALES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, REFLECTING INCREASES IN MARKET PENETRATION AND DURATION OF THERAPY IN THE UNITED STATES, IN ADDITION TO THE EXPANSION OF OUR COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. VIDAZA® NET SALES INCREASED BY $147.1 MILLION, OR 38.0%, TO $534.3 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS RESULTING FROM THE COMPLETION OF PRODUCT LAUNCHES IN KEY EUROPEAN REGIONS DURING THE LATTER PART OF 2009 AND THE INCREASE IN TREATMENT DURATION OF PATIENTS USING VIDAZA®. NET SALES OF VIDAZA® INCREASED BY $180.5 MILLION, OR 87.3%, TO $387.2 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECEMBER 2008 FULL MARKETING AUTHORIZATION GRANTED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, OR E.C., FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR HAEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION WITH INTERMEDIATE-2 AND HIGH-RISK MDS ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL PROGNOSTIC SYSTEM SCORE, OR IPSS, OR CHRONIC MYELOMONOCYTIC LEUKEMIA, OR CMML, WITH 10-29 PERCENT MARROW BLASTS WITHOUT MYELOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER, OR AML WITH 20-30 PERCENT BLASTS AND MULTI-LINEAGE DYSPLASIA, ACCORDING TO WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, OR WHO, CLASSIFICATION OF VIDAZA®.

NET SALES OF THALOMID® DECREASED BY $67.8 MILLION, OR 13.4%, TO $436.9 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER UNIT VOLUMES IN THE UNITED STATES RESULTING FROM THE INCREASED USE OF REVLIMID®, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PRICING AND VOLUME INCREASES IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES, SALES DISCOUNTS, GOVERNMENT REBATES, AND CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES UNDER THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES SPECIFICATIONS TO HELP ENSURE THE PRODUCTS SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER OUR SYSTEM FOR THALIDOMIDE EDUCATION AND PRESCRIBING SAFETY, OR S.T.E.P.S.®, PROGRAM WHICH WE DEVELOPED AND IS A PROPRIETARY COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION AND RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF PROVIDING FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES SPECIFICATIONS TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND 45 TABLE OF CONTENTS THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. VIDAZA® AND ABRAXANE® ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS THALOMID® AND REVLIMID®. WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY TO DATE. THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT. SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. FULL YEAR 2010 REVENUES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE U.S. HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT WHICH INCREASED THE MEDICAID REBATE FROM 15.1% TO 23.1% AND EXTENDED THAT REBATE TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE UTILIZED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA TO ESTIMATE THE INCREMENTAL COSTS RELATED TO THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES. REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GPOS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM DATE OF SALE. WE PROVIDE A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON THE CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY. CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA.

CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES INCREASED BY $34.8 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, PRIMARILY DUE TO A $17.7 MILLION INCREASE IN CHARGEBACKS RESULTING FROM BOTH AN INCREASE IN SALES, INCLUDING THE ADDITION OF ABRAXANE®, AND AN INCREASE IN CERTAIN CHARGEBACK RATES, WHICH ARE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH MEDICAID REBATE RATES. OTHER INCREASES INCLUDED $5.6 MILLION FROM TRICARE DUE TO INCREASED UTILIZATION IN THE CURRENT YEAR, DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES OF $6.5 MILLION AND $2.3 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT. 2009 COMPARED TO 2008: RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES DECREASED BY $5.9 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE COMPLETION OF AN INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVE CONDUCTED BY A MAJOR PHARMACY CHAIN DURING 2009, DECREASED REVENUE FROM PRODUCTS WITH A HIGHER RETURN RATE HISTORY IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 AND A DECREASE IN ALKERAN® RETURNS DUE TO THE MARCH 31, 2009 CONCLUSION OF THE ALKERAN® LICENSE WITH GSK.

GOVERNMENT REBATES INCREASED BY $12.6 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES LEVELS OF REVLIMID® AND VIDAZA® IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AS WELL AS REIMBURSEMENT APPROVALS IN NEW MARKETS. CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES DECREASED BY $11.5 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED REVENUE FROM PRODUCTS WITH A HIGHER CHARGEBACK HISTORY IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 AND A DECREASE IN ALKERAN® CHARGEBACKS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES DUE TO CERTAIN PROGRAMS COMMENCED IN 2009. COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER REVENUE: REVENUES FROM COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER SOURCES DECREASED BY $3.2 MILLION TO $10.5 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO RECEIPT OF A $5.0 MILLION MILESTONE PAYMENT IN 2009 WHICH WAS NOT DUPLICATED IN 2010, PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN LICENSING FEES AND THE INCLUSION OF ABRAXIS OTHER REVENUES SUBSEQUENT TO THE OCTOBER 2010 ACQUISITION DATE.

THE NOTES WERE ISSUED AT 99.854%, 99.745% AND 99.813% OF PAR, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE DISCOUNT WILL BE AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. OFFERING COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $10.3 MILLION HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND ARE AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. OPERATING LEASES: WE LEASE OFFICE AND RESEARCH FACILITIES UNDER VARIOUS OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE NON-CANCELABLE LEASE TERMS FOR THE OPERATING LEASES EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES BETWEEN 2010 AND 2018 AND INCLUDE RENEWAL OPTIONS. IN GENERAL, WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE LESSORS FOR REAL ESTATE TAXES, INSURANCE, UTILITIES, MAINTENANCE AND OTHER OPERATING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEASES. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE MAJOR FACILITIES THAT WE OCCUPY UNDER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS REFER TO PART I, ITEM 2, PROPERTIES OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. MANUFACTURING FACILITY NOTE PAYABLE: IN DECEMBER 2006, WE PURCHASED AN API MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FROM SIEGFRIED LTD. AND SIEGFRIED DIENSTE AG (TOGETHER REFERRED TO HEREIN AS SIEGFRIED) LOCATED IN ZOFINGEN, SWITZERLAND. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NOTE PAYABLE TO SIEGFRIED APPROXIMATED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTE OF $25.0 MILLION. 54 TABLE OF CONTENTS OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS: OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS INCLUDE $362.5 MILLION IN CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPLY CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE COMMITTED TO INVEST $20.0 MILLION IN AN INVESTMENT FUND OVER A TEN-YEAR PERIOD, WHICH IS CALLABLE AT ANY TIME. ON DECEMBER 31, 2010, OUR REMAINING INVESTMENT COMMITMENT WAS $8.0 MILLION. FOR MORE INFORMATION REFER TO NOTE 19 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS: POTENTIAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $3.8 BILLION, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $2.3 BILLION CONTINGENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF VARIOUS RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES AND APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION IN SALES-BASED MILESTONES. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS, AS IDENTIFIED IN NOTE 18 OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT INCLUDE THE FUNDING OF CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE MILESTONE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED DEVELOPMENTAL, REGULATORY AND/OR COMMERCIAL TARGETS. OUR OBLIGATION TO FUND THESE EFFORTS IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROGRAMS AND/OR THE LACK OF ANY ADVERSE EVENTS WHICH COULD CAUSE THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE PROGRAMS. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND ACCORDINGLY NO AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. NEW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS: IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD, OR FASB, ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARD UPDATE, OR ASU, NO. 2009-13, MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS, OR ASU 2009-13, WHICH AMENDS EXISTING REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATIONTM, OR ASC, 605. THIS GUIDANCE ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENT TO ESTABLISH THE FAIR VALUE OF UNDELIVERED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND INSTEAD PROVIDES FOR SEPARATE REVENUE RECOGNITION BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF THE SELLING PRICE FOR AN UNDELIVERED ITEM WHEN THERE IS NO OTHER MEANS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THAT UNDELIVERED ITEM. ASU 2009-13 IS EFFECTIVE PROSPECTIVELY FOR REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO OR MATERIALLY MODIFIED IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER JUNE 15, 2010. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT, IF ANY, THAT THE ADOPTION OF THIS AMENDMENT WILL HAVE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN JANUARY 2010, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2010-06, IMPROVING DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, OR ASU 2010-06, WHICH AMENDS ASC 820 TO ADD NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURES ABOUT TRANSFERS INTO AND OUT OF LEVELS 1 AND 2 AND SEPARATE DISCLOSURES ABOUT PURCHASES, SALES, ISSUANCES, AND SETTLEMENTS RELATING TO LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENTS. ASU 2010-06 ALSO CLARIFIES EXISTING FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE LEVEL OF DISAGGREGATION AND ABOUT INPUTS AND VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE. FURTHER, ASU 2010-06 AMENDS GUIDANCE ON EMPLOYERS DISCLOSURES ABOUT POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS UNDER ASC 715 TO REQUIRE THAT DISCLOSURES BE PROVIDED BY CLASSES OF ASSETS INSTEAD OF BY MAJOR CATEGORIES OF ASSETS. ASU 2010-06 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRST REPORTING PERIOD (INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS) BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2009, EXCEPT FOR THE REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE THE LEVEL 3 ACTIVITY OF PURCHASES, SALES, ISSUANCES, AND SETTLEMENTS ON A GROSS BASIS, WHICH WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2010, AND FOR INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE SECTION OF THE AMENDMENT PERTAINING TO TRANSFERS INTO AND OUT OF LEVELS 1 AND 2 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2010. THE ADOPTION OF THIS SECTION OF THE AMENDMENT DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE SECTION OF THE AMENDMENT PERTAINING TO LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENTS WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2011. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT, IF ANY, THAT THE ADOPTION OF THIS AMENDMENT WILL HAVE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN APRIL 2010, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2010-17, MILESTONE METHOD OF REVENUE RECOGNITION, OR ASU 2010-17, TO (1) LIMIT THE SCOPE OF THIS ASU TO RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT ARRANGEMENTS AND (2) REQUIRE THAT GUIDANCE IN THIS ASU BE MET FOR AN ENTITY TO APPLY THE MILESTONE METHOD (RECORD THE MILESTONE PAYMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY IN THE PERIOD RECEIVED). HOWEVER, THE FASB CLARIFIED THAT, EVEN IF THE REQUIREMENTS IN ASU 2010-17 ARE MET, ENTITIES WOULD NOT BE PRECLUDED FROM MAKING AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION TO APPLY ANOTHER APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING POLICY THAT RESULTS IN THE DEFERRAL OF SOME PORTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION. THE GUIDANCE IN ASU 2010-17 WILL APPLY TO MILESTONES IN BOTH SINGLE-DELIVERABLE AND MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVING RESEARCH OR 55 TABLE OF CONTENTS DEVELOPMENT TRANSACTIONS. ASU 2010-17 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS (AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS) BEGINNING ON OR AFTER JUNE 15, 2010. EARLY APPLICATION IS PERMITTED. ENTITIES CAN APPLY THIS GUIDANCE PROSPECTIVELY TO MILESTONES ACHIEVED AFTER ADOPTION. HOWEVER, RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION TO ALL PRIOR PERIODS IS ALSO PERMITTED. THE ADOPTION OF THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD WILL NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN DECEMBER 2010, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2010-27, FEES PAID TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS, OR ASU 2010-27. ASU 2010-27 PROVIDES GUIDANCE CONCERNING THE RECOGNITION AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE NEW ANNUAL FEE PAYABLE BY BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUG MANUFACTURES AND IMPORTERS ON BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WHICH WAS MANDATED UNDER THE U.S. HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT ENACTED IN THE UNITED STATES IN MARCH 2010. UNDER THIS NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD, THE ANNUAL FEE WOULD BE PRESENTED AS A COMPONENT OF OPERATING EXPENSES AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE CALENDAR YEAR. SUCH FEES ARE PAYABLE USING A STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OF ALLOCATION UNLESS ANOTHER METHOD BETTER ALLOCATES THE FEE OVER THE CALENDAR YEAR. THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR CALENDAR YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2010. AS THIS STANDARD RELATES ONLY TO CLASSIFICATION, THE ADOPTION OF THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD WILL NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN DECEMBER 2010, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2010-29, DISCLOSURE OF SUPPLEMENTARY PRO FORMA INFORMATION, OR ASU 2010-29. ASU 2010-29 CLARIFIES DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS TO REQUIRE PUBLIC ENTITIES THAT ENTER INTO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS THAT ARE MATERIAL ON AN INDIVIDUAL OR AGGREGATE BASIS TO DISCLOSE PRO FORMA INFORMATION FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS THAT OCCURRED IN THE CURRENT REPORTING PERIOD, INCLUDING PRO FORMA REVENUE AND EARNINGS OF THE COMBINED ENTITY AS THOUGH THE ACQUISITION DATE HAD BEEN AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE COMPARABLE PRIOR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIOD ONLY. ASU 2010-29 IS EFFECTIVE FOR MATERIAL BUSINESS COMBINATIONS FOR WHICH THE ACQUISITION DATE IS ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2011 AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. WE HAVE CHOSEN EARLY ADOPTION OF ASU 2010-29 AND THE PRO FORMA INFORMATION RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITIONS OF ABRAXIS AND GLOUCESTER COMPLIES WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS STANDARD (SEE NOTE 2 OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K). CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IS ONE THAT IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENTS MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL: REVENUE RECOGNITION: REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS OF THE PRODUCT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER. PROVISIONS FOR DISCOUNTS, EARLY PAYMENTS, REBATES, SALES RETURNS AND DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS UNDER TERMS CUSTOMARY IN THE INDUSTRY ARE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SAME PERIOD THE RELATED SALES ARE RECORDED. WE RECORD ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SALE. THE ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR SUCH VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES ARE BASED ON THE SALES TERMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND TREND ANALYSIS. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM ROYALTIES BASED ON LICENSEES SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS USING OUR TECHNOLOGIES. ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACT TERMS WHEN ROYALTIES FROM LICENSEES CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED. IF ROYALTIES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR COLLECTIBILITY OF A ROYALTY AMOUNT IS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED, ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE CASH IS RECEIVED. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES, SALES DISCOUNTS, GOVERNMENT REBATES, AND CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES UNDER THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES SPECIFICATIONS TO HELP ENSURE THE PRODUCTS SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL 56 TABLE OF CONTENTS PHARMACIES. THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER OUR S.T.E.P.S.® PROGRAM WHICH WE DEVELOPED AND IS A PROPRIETARY COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION AND RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF PROVIDING FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES SPECIFICATIONS TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. VIDAZA® AND ABRAXANE® ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS THALOMID® AND REVLIMID®. WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY TO DATE. THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT. SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. FULL YEAR 2010 REVENUES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE U.S. HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT WHICH INCREASED THE MEDICAID REBATE FROM 15.1% TO 23.1% AND EXTENDED THAT REBATE TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE UTILIZED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA TO ESTIMATE THE INCREMENTAL COSTS RELATED TO THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES. REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GPOS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM DATE OF SALE. WE PROVIDE A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON THE CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. UPON RECEIPT OF CHARGEBACK, DUE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON THESE PROGRAMS, WE THEN ESTABLISH A SPECIFIC PROVISION FOR FEES OR REBATES BASED ON THE SPECIFIC TERMS OF EACH AGREEMENT. CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA. INCOME TAXES: WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. WE PROVIDE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. 57 TABLE OF CONTENTS WE ACCOUNT FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS PART OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THESE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATE PRIMARILY TO ISSUES COMMON AMONG MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE APPLY A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES WHICH INCLUDE STUDIES PERFORMED BY INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS, ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY AND SUBJECT EXPERTS, EVALUATION OF PUBLIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. WE PROVIDE ESTIMATES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. IF OUR ESTIMATES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ACTUAL OUTCOMES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE A PORTION WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR RECENT CUMULATIVE EARNINGS EXPERIENCE BY TAXING JURISDICTION, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, CARRYFORWARD PERIODS AVAILABLE TO US FOR TAX REPORTING PURPOSES, VARIOUS INCOME TAX STRATEGIES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT AND, TO THE EXTENT FUTURE EXPECTATIONS CHANGE, WE WOULD HAVE TO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THAT TIME. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION: THE COST OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IS RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL AWARDS GRANTED, USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES METHOD OF VALUATION. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH AWARD IS DETERMINED AND THE COMPENSATION COST IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD REQUIRED TO OBTAIN FULL VESTING. COMPENSATION COST TO BE RECOGNIZED REFLECTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF AWARDS EXPECTED TO VEST AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AN ESTIMATE OF AWARD FORFEITURES BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE. OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES: A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF ANY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY BELOW ITS COST THAT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN CARRYING AMOUNT TO FAIR VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT IS CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AND A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE SECURITY ESTABLISHED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INCLUDE: SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE ISSUERS EARNINGS PERFORMANCE, CREDIT RATING, ASSET QUALITY, BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE ISSUER OPERATES, LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW OUR COST, OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE SECURITY, OUR INTENT NOT TO SELL AND AN EVALUATION AS TO WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO SELL BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR COST BASIS. ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD DIFFER FROM OUR ASSESSMENT. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES: ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN CURRENT EARNINGS OR OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), DEPENDING ON WHETHER A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION AND, IF IT IS, THE TYPE OF HEDGING TRANSACTION. FOR A DERIVATIVE TO QUALIFY AS A HEDGE AT INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE HEDGED PERIOD, WE FORMALLY DOCUMENT THE NATURE AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEM. WE ASSESS, BOTH AT INCEPTION AND ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING TRANSACTIONS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING THE CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS. WE ASSESS HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND RECORD THE GAIN OR LOSS RELATED TO THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IF ANY, TO CURRENT EARNINGS. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER PROBABLE OF OCCURRING, WE DISCONTINUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING AND ANY RELATED UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE NOT DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION, TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES. THE USE OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE EXPOSURE OF THESE RISKS WITH THE INTENT TO REDUCE OUR RISK OR COST. WE DO NOT USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR SPECULATIVE TRADING PURPOSES AND ARE NOT A PARTY TO LEVERAGED DERIVATIVES. INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATED COMPANIES: WE APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING TO OUR INVESTMENT IN COMMON STOCK OF AN AFFILIATED COMPANY AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS, WHICH PRIMARILY INVEST IN COMPANIES CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN LIFE SCIENCES SUCH AS BIOTECHNOLOGY, PHARMACEUTICALS, MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY, MEDICAL DEVICES, DIAGNOSTICS AND HEALTH AND WELLNESS. 58 TABLE OF CONTENTS EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT. IF AN INVESTMENTS FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN ITS NET CARRYING VALUE AND THE DECLINE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE. SUCH AN EVALUATION IS JUDGMENTAL AND DEPENDENT ON SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE HAS OCCURRED INCLUDE: MARKET VALUE OR EXIT PRICE OF THE INVESTMENT BASED ON EITHER MARKET-QUOTED PRICES OR FUTURE ROUNDS OF FINANCING BY THE INVESTEE; LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE MARKET VALUE WAS BELOW ITS COST BASIS; FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE INVESTEE; OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT; ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INVESTEES ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN; AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE MAY BE AWARE OF RELATED TO THE INVESTMENT. ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, OR LTIP, DESIGNED TO PROVIDE KEY OFFICERS AND EXECUTIVES WITH PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES CONTINGENT UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED CORPORATE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES COVERING A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLES RUNNING CONCURRENTLY ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2012 AND 2013. PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR EACH LTIP ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE THREE-YEAR CYCLE: 25% ON NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE, 25% ON NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND 50% ON TOTAL NON-GAAP REVENUE, AS DEFINED. PAYOUTS MAY BE IN THE RANGE OF 0% TO 200% OF THE PARTICIPANTS SALARY FOR THE PLANS. AWARDS ARE PAYABLE IN CASH OR, AT OUR DISCRETION, IN OUR COMMON STOCK BASED UPON OUR STOCK PRICE AT THE PAYOUT DATE. WE ACCRUE THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE LIABILITY OVER EACH THREE-YEAR CYCLE. PRIOR TO THE END OF A THREE-YEAR CYCLE, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT DURING THE CYCLE. UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT EQUAL TO THEIR TARGET AWARD, OR AN AWARD BASED ON ACTUAL PERFORMANCE, IF HIGHER, THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL. ACCRUALS RECORDED FOR THE LTIP ENTAIL MAKING CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE, NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND NON-GAAP REVENUES, AS DEFINED; THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED. ACCRUALS FOR THE LTIP ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND REVISED ACCORDINGLY SO THAT THE LIABILITY RECORDED REFLECTS UPDATED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PAYOUTS. IN ESTIMATING THE ACCRUALS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DATE FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, EXPECTED RESULTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, OPERATING TRENDS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICING AND COMPETITION. VALUATION OF GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IPR&D: WE HAVE RECORDED GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IPR&D PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ACQUISITIONS OF PHARMION, GLOUCESTER AND ABRAXIS. WHEN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, ARE ACQUIRED, WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS ARE TYPICALLY USED IN THESE VALUATIONS IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, AND THE MODELS REQUIRE THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:  PROJECTING REGULATORY APPROVALS,  ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM PRODUCT SALES RESULTING FROM COMPLETED PRODUCTS AND IN-PROCESS PROJECTS AND  DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES AND PROBABILITY RATES GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. WE TEST OUR GOODWILL ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT EACH NOVEMBER 30. WE ARE ORGANIZED AS A SINGLE REPORTING UNIT AND THEREFORE THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS DONE USING OUR OVERALL MARKET VALUE, AS DETERMINED BY OUR TRADED SHARE PRICE, AS COMPARED TO OUR BOOK VALUE OF NET ASSETS. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE AMORTIZED TO THEIR ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR. INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO IPR&D PRODUCT RIGHTS ARE TREATED AS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND NOT AMORTIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS APPROVED FOR SALE BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN SPECIFIED MARKETS. AT THAT TIME, WE WILL DETERMINE THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET, RECLASSIFY THE ASSET OUT OF 59 TABLE OF CONTENTS IPR&D AND BEGIN AMORTIZATION. IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS ALSO PERFORMED AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. OUR IPR&D PRODUCT RIGHTS WERE OBTAINED IN THE GLOUCESTER AND ABRAXIS ACQUISITIONS. THE GLOUCESTER RELATED PRODUCT RIGHTS WILL BECOME DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES WHEN MARKETING APPROVAL IS RECEIVED FOR ISTODAX® FOR TREATMENT OF PTCL IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE ABRAXIS RELATED PRODUCT RIGHTS WILL BECOME DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES WHEN MARKETING APPROVAL IS RECEIVED FOR ABRAXANE® FOR TREATMENT OF EITHER NSCLC, PANCREATIC CANCER OR MELANOMA IN A MAJOR MARKET, TYPICALLY EITHER THE UNITED STATES OR THE EUROPEAN UNION, OR IN A SERIES OF OTHER COUNTRIES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN SPECIFIED CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. VALUATION OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION: WE RECORD CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION AT ITS FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE, AND FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT REPORTING PERIOD REVALUE THESE OBLIGATIONS AND RECORD INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPERATING EARNINGS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. CHANGES TO CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION OBLIGATIONS CAN RESULT FROM MOVEMENTS IN PUBLICLY TRADED SHARE PRICES OF CVRS, ADJUSTMENTS TO DISCOUNT RATES AND PERIODS, UPDATES IN THE ASSUMED ACHIEVEMENT OR TIMING OF ANY DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES OR CHANGES IN THE PROBABILITY OF CERTAIN CLINICAL EVENTS AND CHANGES IN THE ASSUMED PROBABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATORY APPROVAL. THE ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT AND ANY CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION EXPENSE RECORDED IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. OUR CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES WERE ACQUIRED IN THE ACQUISITIONS OF GLOUCESTER AND ABRAXIS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GLOUCESTER CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY IS BASED ON THE DISCOUNT RATES, PROBABILITIES AND ESTIMATED TIMING OF TWO CASH MILESTONE PAYMENTS TO THE FORMER GLOUCESTER SHAREHOLDERS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ABRAXIS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY IS BASED ON THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES FORWARD-LOOKING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RISK OF LOSS IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES, CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE EARNINGS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, OUR MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS CONSISTED OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, OUR LONG-TERM DEBT, OUR NOTE PAYABLE AND CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE CONSISTED OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT, AGENCY AND SUPRANATIONAL SECURITIES, GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SENIOR NOTES OUTSTANDING WAS $1.197 BILLION. NOTE PAYABLE: IN DECEMBER 2006, WE PURCHASED AN ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENT, OR API, MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FROM SIEGFRIED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NOTE PAYABLE TO SIEGFRIED APPROXIMATED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTE OF $25.0 MILLION. ASSUMING OTHER FACTORS ARE HELD CONSTANT, AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES GENERALLY WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NOTE. THE NOTE IS DENOMINATED IN SWISS FRANCS AND ITS FAIR VALUE WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR/SWISS FRANC EXCHANGE RATE. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTE REFLECTS THE U.S. DOLLAR/SWISS FRANC EXCHANGE RATE AND SWISS INTEREST RATES. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS: WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PROTECT AGAINST CHANGES IN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 HAD SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 36 MONTHS. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES UNDER ASC 815 AND, ACCORDINGLY, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THEM ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), OR OCI, AND RECLASSIFIED TO OPERATIONS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT OPERATIONS. 61 TABLE OF CONTENTS ANY INEFFECTIVENESS ON THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IS REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME, NET. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES WERE AS FOLLOWS: NOTIONAL AMOUNT DECEMBER 31, FOREIGN CURRENCY 2010 2009 IN THOUSANDS $ BRITISH POUND $ 58,440 $  CANADIAN DOLLAR 133,128  EURO 675,438 1,107,340 JAPANESE YEN 632,962  SWISS FRANC 77,669  OTHERS 54,644  TOTAL $ 1,632,281 $ 1,107,340 WE CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF OUR OWN AND THE COUNTERPARTIES CREDIT RISK ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO EXECUTE ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONTRACT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, CREDIT RISK DID NOT MATERIALLY CHANGE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS. WE RECOGNIZED AN INCREASE IN NET PRODUCT SALES FOR CERTAIN EFFECTIVE CASH FLOW HEDGE INSTRUMENTS OF $47.7 MILLION FOR 2010 AND A REDUCTION IN NET PRODUCT SALES OF $36.4 MILLION FOR 2009. THESE SETTLEMENTS WERE RECORDED IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED FORECASTED SALES OCCURRED. WE RECOGNIZED A DECREASE IN OTHER INCOME, NET FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN EFFECTIVE CASH FLOW HEDGE INSTRUMENTS OF $0.1 MILLION FOR 2010 COMPARED TO AN INCREASE OF $6.5 MILLION FOR 2009. THESE SETTLEMENTS WERE RECORDED IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED FORECASTED EXPENSES OCCURRED. CHANGES IN TIME VALUE, WHICH WE EXCLUDED FROM THE HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT, WERE INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME, NET. WE ALSO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN RECOGNIZED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS HEDGES UNDER ASC 815 AND, ACCORDINGLY, ANY CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME, NET IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD NON-DESIGNATED HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 WERE $848.6 MILLION AND $483.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, WE BELIEVE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS A REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES. ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2010 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WOULD CHANGE BY APPROXIMATELY $259.0 MILLION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS EITHER HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES OR RELATE TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE ENTITIES FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE EITHER REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS OR REMEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR LIABILITY. ON FEBRUARY 23, 2011, WE ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACT TO CONVERT A PORTION OF OUR INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE FROM FIXED RATE TO FLOATING RATE TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN INTEREST EXPENSE WITH INTEREST INCOME RECEIVED ON ITS CASH EQUIVALENT AND INVESTMENT BALANCES. THE FLOATING RATE IS BENCHMARKED TO LIBOR. THE SWAP IS DESIGNATED AS A FAIR VALUE HEDGE ON THE FIXED-RATE DEBT ISSUE MATURING OCTOBER 2015. SINCE THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE SWAP MATCH THOSE OF THE DEBT BEING HEDGED, IT IS ASSUMED TO BE A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE HEDGE AND ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAPS WILL BE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WITH NO NET IMPACT RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. AS OF THIS FILING, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF DEBT HEDGED WITH AN INTEREST RATE SWAP IS $125.0 MILLION. 62 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY CELGENE CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY WE, OUR OR US) IS A GLOBAL INTEGRATED BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN THE DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF INNOVATIVE THERAPIES DESIGNED TO TREAT CANCER AND IMMUNE-INFLAMMATORY RELATED DISEASES.

THE INCREASE WAS COMPRISED OF NET VOLUME INCREASES OF $892.5 MILLION, PRICE DECREASES OF $2.1 MILLION AND THE FAVORABLE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN EXCHANGE OF $50.7 MILLION. THE DECREASE IN PRICES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED MEDICAID REBATES RESULTING FROM THE HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT AND AN INCREASE IN REBATES TO U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTS RESULTING FROM THEIR ATTEMPTS TO REDUCE HEALTH CARE COSTS.

VIDAZA® NET SALES INCREASED BY $147.1 MILLION, OR 38.0%, TO $534.3 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS RESULTING FROM THE COMPLETION OF PRODUCT LAUNCHES IN KEY EUROPEAN REGIONS DURING THE LATTER PART OF 2009 AND THE INCREASE IN TREATMENT DURATION OF PATIENTS USING VIDAZA®.

NET SALES OF THALOMID® DECREASED BY $67.8 MILLION, OR 13.4%, TO $436.9 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER UNIT VOLUMES IN THE UNITED STATES RESULTING FROM THE INCREASED USE OF REVLIMID®, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PRICING AND VOLUME INCREASES IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY TO DATE. THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT. SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. FULL YEAR 2010 REVENUES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE U.S. HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT WHICH INCREASED THE MEDICAID REBATE FROM 15.1% TO 23.1% AND EXTENDED THAT REBATE TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE UTILIZED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA TO ESTIMATE THE INCREMENTAL COSTS RELATED TO THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES. REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GPOS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM DATE OF SALE. WE PROVIDE A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON THE CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY. CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008 WERE AS FOLLOWS: INCREASE (DECREASE) 2010 2009 VERSUS VERSUS 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 IN THOUSANDS $ NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES $ 1,181,556 $ 909,855 $ 182,187 $ 271,701 $ 727,668 NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES $ (2,107,305 ) $ (856,078 ) $ (522,246 ) $ (1,251,227 ) $ (333,832 ) NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES $ 1,177,167 $ (61,872 ) $ 281,629 $ 1,239,039 $ (343,501 ) OPERATING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2010 INCREASED BY $271.7 MILLION TO $1,181.6 MILLION AS COMPARED TO 2009. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN EXPANSION OF OUR OPERATIONS AND RELATED INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ASSOCIATED WITH EXPANDING INTERNATIONAL SALES, WHICH TAKE LONGER TO COLLECT AND THE TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. 52 TABLE OF CONTENTS INVESTING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2010 INCREASED BY $1.251 BILLION TO $2.107 BILLION AS COMPARED TO A NET CASH USE OF $856.1 MILLION IN 2009. THE 2010 INVESTING ACTIVITIES ARE PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO PROCEEDS FROM THE SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES THAT WERE SOLD IN PREPARATION FOR THE PURCHASE OF ABRAXIS AND NET CASH USED IN THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS OF $2.315 BILLION AND THE ACQUISITION OF GLOUCESTER OF $337.6 MILLION. NET SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AMOUNTED TO $659.7 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO NET PURCHASES OF $749.3 MILLION IN 2009. FINANCING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2010 WAS $1.177 BILLION COMPARED TO A NET CASH USAGE OF $61.9 MILLION IN 2009. THE $1.239 BILLION INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2010 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN 2010 THAT PROVIDED NET CASH OF $1.237 BILLION. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND WORKING CAPITAL: CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND WORKING CAPITAL FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 2010 2010 2009 INCREASE IN THOUSANDS $ CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE $ 2,601,301 $ 2,996,752 $ (395,451 ) WORKING CAPITAL(1) $ 2,835,427 $ 3,302,109 $ (466,682 ) (1) INCLUDES CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET OF ALLOWANCES, INVENTORY AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, LESS ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES, INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: WE INVEST OUR EXCESS CASH PRIMARILY IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS, U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT, AGENCY AND SUPRANATIONAL SECURITIES AND GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES. ALL LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND ALL INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE. WE DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. THE $395.5 MILLION DECREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AT THE END OF 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $2.315 BILLION NET CASH PAYMENT MADE FOR THE ABRAXIS ACQUISITION, $337.6 MILLION NET CASH PAYMENT MADE FOR THE GLOUCESTER ACQUISITION, $121.2 MILLION UPFRONT PAYMENT MADE TO AGIOS RELATED TO A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENT AND $183.1 MILLION CASH PAID OUT UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ANNOUNCED IN APRIL 2009, PARTLY OFFSET BY $1.237 BILLION IN NET PROCEEDS FROM OUR DEBT ISSUANCE IN OCTOBER 2010 AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET INCREASED BY $267.8 MILLION TO $706.4 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SALES OF REVLIMID® AND VIDAZA® AMONG EXISTING CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS NEW CUSTOMERS IN COUNTRIES WE HAVE RECENTLY ENTERED AND THE INCLUSION OF $52.7 MILLION IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS IN OCTOBER 2010. DAYS OF SALES OUTSTANDING AT THE END OF 2010 INCREASED TO 59 DAYS COMPARED TO 56 DAYS IN 2009. THE INCREASE IN DAYS OF SALES OUTSTANDING WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED INTERNATIONAL SALES IN COUNTRIES WHERE PAYMENT TERMS ARE TYPICALLY GREATER THAN 60 DAYS, THEREBY EXTENDING COLLECTION PERIODS BEYOND THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE AS OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES CONTINUE TO EXPAND. INVENTORY: INVENTORY BALANCES INCREASED BY $159.4 MILLION TO $260.1 MILLION AT THE END OF 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF $136.7 MILLION IN ABRAXANE® INVENTORY, WHICH INCLUDED A $90.3 MILLION INVENTORY STEP-UP ADJUSTMENT TO FAIR VALUE RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS IN OCTOBER 2010. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS: OTHER CURRENT ASSETS INCREASED BY $16.1 MILLION TO $275.0 MILLION AT THE END OF 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN PREPAID VALUE ADDED TAXES, INCOME TAXES AND AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR 53 TABLE OF CONTENTS VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, PARTLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN PREPAID ROYALTIES RELATED TO VIDAZA® SALES AND INTEREST RECEIVABLE ON SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES: ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES INCREASED BY $550.0 MILLION TO $996.0 MILLION AT THE END OF 2010 COMPARED TO 2009. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $171.9 MILLION CURRENT PORTION OF THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF GLOUCESTER, INCREASES IN GOVERNMENTAL REBATES AND MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENTS, INCREASED VALUE ADDED TAXES, INCREASED ROYALTIES AND PAYROLL-RELATED AND OTHER ACCRUALS. INCOME TAXES PAYABLE (CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT): INCOME TAXES PAYABLE INCREASED BY $94.1 MILLION TO $563.3 MILLION AT THE END OF 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 PRIMARILY FROM THE CURRENT PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES OF $236.3 MILLION, MOSTLY OFFSET BY TAX PAYMENTS OF $122.0 MILLION AND A TAX BENEFIT OF STOCK OPTIONS OF $32.5 MILLION. WE EXPECT CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR EXPENDITURES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TRIALS, COMMERCIALIZATION OF NEW PRODUCTS, INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE COMBINED WITH CASH GENERATED FROM FUTURE NET PRODUCT SALES, WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL RESOURCES TO FUND OUR NORMAL OPERATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010: PAYMENT DUE BY PERIOD LESS THAN MORE THAN 1 YEAR 1 TO 3 YEARS 3 TO 5 YEARS 5 YEARS TOTAL IN THOUSANDS $ SENIOR NOTES $  $  $ 500,000 $ 750,000 $ 1,250,000 OPERATING LEASES 36,679 42,398 29,117 28,953 137,147 MANUFACTURING FACILITY NOTE PAYABLE 4,388 8,563 8,563 4,281 25,795 OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS 164,216 116,215 59,577 31,151 371,159 TOTAL $ 205,283 $ 167,176 $ 597,257 $ 814,385 $ 1,784,101 SENIOR NOTES: ON OCTOBER 7, 2010, WE ISSUED A TOTAL OF $1.25 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2.45% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2015 (THE 2015 NOTES), $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.95% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2020 (THE 2020 NOTES) AND $250.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 5.7% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2040 (THE 2040 NOTES AND, TOGETHER WITH THE 2015 NOTES AND THE 2020 NOTES, REFERRED TO HEREIN AS THE NOTES). THE NOTES WERE ISSUED AT 99.854%, 99.745% AND 99.813% OF PAR, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE DISCOUNT WILL BE AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. OFFERING COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $10.3 MILLION HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND ARE AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. OPERATING LEASES: WE LEASE OFFICE AND RESEARCH FACILITIES UNDER VARIOUS OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE NON-CANCELABLE LEASE TERMS FOR THE OPERATING LEASES EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES BETWEEN 2010 AND 2018 AND INCLUDE RENEWAL OPTIONS. IN GENERAL, WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE LESSORS FOR REAL ESTATE TAXES, INSURANCE, UTILITIES, MAINTENANCE AND OTHER OPERATING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEASES. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE MAJOR FACILITIES THAT WE OCCUPY UNDER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS REFER TO PART I, ITEM 2, PROPERTIES OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. MANUFACTURING FACILITY NOTE PAYABLE: IN DECEMBER 2006, WE PURCHASED AN API MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FROM SIEGFRIED LTD. AND SIEGFRIED DIENSTE AG (TOGETHER REFERRED TO HEREIN AS SIEGFRIED) LOCATED IN ZOFINGEN, SWITZERLAND. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NOTE PAYABLE TO SIEGFRIED APPROXIMATED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTE OF $25.0 MILLION. 54 TABLE OF CONTENTS OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS: OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS INCLUDE $362.5 MILLION IN CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPLY CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE COMMITTED TO INVEST $20.0 MILLION IN AN INVESTMENT FUND OVER A TEN-YEAR PERIOD, WHICH IS CALLABLE AT ANY TIME. ON DECEMBER 31, 2010, OUR REMAINING INVESTMENT COMMITMENT WAS $8.0 MILLION. FOR MORE INFORMATION REFER TO NOTE 19 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS: POTENTIAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $3.8 BILLION, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $2.3 BILLION CONTINGENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF VARIOUS RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES AND APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION IN SALES-BASED MILESTONES. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS, AS IDENTIFIED IN NOTE 18 OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT INCLUDE THE FUNDING OF CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE MILESTONE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED DEVELOPMENTAL, REGULATORY AND/OR COMMERCIAL TARGETS. OUR OBLIGATION TO FUND THESE EFFORTS IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROGRAMS AND/OR THE LACK OF ANY ADVERSE EVENTS WHICH COULD CAUSE THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE PROGRAMS. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND ACCORDINGLY NO AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. NEW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS: IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD, OR FASB, ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARD UPDATE, OR ASU, NO. 2009-13, MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS, OR ASU 2009-13, WHICH AMENDS EXISTING REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATIONTM, OR ASC, 605. THIS GUIDANCE ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENT TO ESTABLISH THE FAIR VALUE OF UNDELIVERED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND INSTEAD PROVIDES FOR SEPARATE REVENUE RECOGNITION BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF THE SELLING PRICE FOR AN UNDELIVERED ITEM WHEN THERE IS NO OTHER MEANS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THAT UNDELIVERED ITEM. ASU 2009-13 IS EFFECTIVE PROSPECTIVELY FOR REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO OR MATERIALLY MODIFIED IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER JUNE 15, 2010. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT, IF ANY, THAT THE ADOPTION OF THIS AMENDMENT WILL HAVE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN JANUARY 2010, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2010-06, IMPROVING DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, OR ASU 2010-06, WHICH AMENDS ASC 820 TO ADD NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURES ABOUT TRANSFERS INTO AND OUT OF LEVELS 1 AND 2 AND SEPARATE DISCLOSURES ABOUT PURCHASES, SALES, ISSUANCES, AND SETTLEMENTS RELATING TO LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENTS. ASU 2010-06 ALSO CLARIFIES EXISTING FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE LEVEL OF DISAGGREGATION AND ABOUT INPUTS AND VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE. FURTHER, ASU 2010-06 AMENDS GUIDANCE ON EMPLOYERS DISCLOSURES ABOUT POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS UNDER ASC 715 TO REQUIRE THAT DISCLOSURES BE PROVIDED BY CLASSES OF ASSETS INSTEAD OF BY MAJOR CATEGORIES OF ASSETS. ASU 2010-06 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRST REPORTING PERIOD (INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS) BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2009, EXCEPT FOR THE REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE THE LEVEL 3 ACTIVITY OF PURCHASES, SALES, ISSUANCES, AND SETTLEMENTS ON A GROSS BASIS, WHICH WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2010, AND FOR INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE SECTION OF THE AMENDMENT PERTAINING TO TRANSFERS INTO AND OUT OF LEVELS 1 AND 2 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2010. THE ADOPTION OF THIS SECTION OF THE AMENDMENT DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE SECTION OF THE AMENDMENT PERTAINING TO LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENTS WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2011. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT, IF ANY, THAT THE ADOPTION OF THIS AMENDMENT WILL HAVE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN APRIL 2010, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2010-17, MILESTONE METHOD OF REVENUE RECOGNITION, OR ASU 2010-17, TO (1) LIMIT THE SCOPE OF THIS ASU TO RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT ARRANGEMENTS AND (2) REQUIRE THAT GUIDANCE IN THIS ASU BE MET FOR AN ENTITY TO APPLY THE MILESTONE METHOD (RECORD THE MILESTONE PAYMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY IN THE PERIOD RECEIVED). HOWEVER, THE FASB CLARIFIED THAT, EVEN IF THE REQUIREMENTS IN ASU 2010-17 ARE MET, ENTITIES WOULD NOT BE PRECLUDED FROM MAKING AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION TO APPLY ANOTHER APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING POLICY THAT RESULTS IN THE DEFERRAL OF SOME PORTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION. THE GUIDANCE IN ASU 2010-17 WILL APPLY TO MILESTONES IN BOTH SINGLE-DELIVERABLE AND MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVING RESEARCH OR 55 TABLE OF CONTENTS DEVELOPMENT TRANSACTIONS. ASU 2010-17 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS (AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS) BEGINNING ON OR AFTER JUNE 15, 2010. EARLY APPLICATION IS PERMITTED. ENTITIES CAN APPLY THIS GUIDANCE PROSPECTIVELY TO MILESTONES ACHIEVED AFTER ADOPTION. HOWEVER, RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION TO ALL PRIOR PERIODS IS ALSO PERMITTED. THE ADOPTION OF THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD WILL NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN DECEMBER 2010, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2010-27, FEES PAID TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS, OR ASU 2010-27. ASU 2010-27 PROVIDES GUIDANCE CONCERNING THE RECOGNITION AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE NEW ANNUAL FEE PAYABLE BY BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUG MANUFACTURES AND IMPORTERS ON BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WHICH WAS MANDATED UNDER THE U.S. HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT ENACTED IN THE UNITED STATES IN MARCH 2010. UNDER THIS NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD, THE ANNUAL FEE WOULD BE PRESENTED AS A COMPONENT OF OPERATING EXPENSES AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE CALENDAR YEAR. SUCH FEES ARE PAYABLE USING A STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OF ALLOCATION UNLESS ANOTHER METHOD BETTER ALLOCATES THE FEE OVER THE CALENDAR YEAR. THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR CALENDAR YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2010. AS THIS STANDARD RELATES ONLY TO CLASSIFICATION, THE ADOPTION OF THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD WILL NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN DECEMBER 2010, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2010-29, DISCLOSURE OF SUPPLEMENTARY PRO FORMA INFORMATION, OR ASU 2010-29. ASU 2010-29 CLARIFIES DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS TO REQUIRE PUBLIC ENTITIES THAT ENTER INTO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS THAT ARE MATERIAL ON AN INDIVIDUAL OR AGGREGATE BASIS TO DISCLOSE PRO FORMA INFORMATION FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS THAT OCCURRED IN THE CURRENT REPORTING PERIOD, INCLUDING PRO FORMA REVENUE AND EARNINGS OF THE COMBINED ENTITY AS THOUGH THE ACQUISITION DATE HAD BEEN AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE COMPARABLE PRIOR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIOD ONLY. ASU 2010-29 IS EFFECTIVE FOR MATERIAL BUSINESS COMBINATIONS FOR WHICH THE ACQUISITION DATE IS ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2011 AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. WE HAVE CHOSEN EARLY ADOPTION OF ASU 2010-29 AND THE PRO FORMA INFORMATION RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITIONS OF ABRAXIS AND GLOUCESTER COMPLIES WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS STANDARD (SEE NOTE 2 OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K). CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IS ONE THAT IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENTS MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL: REVENUE RECOGNITION: REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS OF THE PRODUCT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER. PROVISIONS FOR DISCOUNTS, EARLY PAYMENTS, REBATES, SALES RETURNS AND DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS UNDER TERMS CUSTOMARY IN THE INDUSTRY ARE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SAME PERIOD THE RELATED SALES ARE RECORDED. WE RECORD ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SALE. THE ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR SUCH VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES ARE BASED ON THE SALES TERMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND TREND ANALYSIS. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM ROYALTIES BASED ON LICENSEES SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS USING OUR TECHNOLOGIES. ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACT TERMS WHEN ROYALTIES FROM LICENSEES CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED. IF ROYALTIES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR COLLECTIBILITY OF A ROYALTY AMOUNT IS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED, ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE CASH IS RECEIVED. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES, SALES DISCOUNTS, GOVERNMENT REBATES, AND CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES UNDER THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES SPECIFICATIONS TO HELP ENSURE THE PRODUCTS SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL 56 TABLE OF CONTENTS PHARMACIES. THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER OUR S.T.E.P.S.® PROGRAM WHICH WE DEVELOPED AND IS A PROPRIETARY COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION AND RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF PROVIDING FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES SPECIFICATIONS TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. VIDAZA® AND ABRAXANE® ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS THALOMID® AND REVLIMID®. WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY TO DATE. THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT. SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. FULL YEAR 2010 REVENUES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE U.S. HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT WHICH INCREASED THE MEDICAID REBATE FROM 15.1% TO 23.1% AND EXTENDED THAT REBATE TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE UTILIZED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA TO ESTIMATE THE INCREMENTAL COSTS RELATED TO THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES. REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GPOS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM DATE OF SALE. WE PROVIDE A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON THE CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. UPON RECEIPT OF CHARGEBACK, DUE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON THESE PROGRAMS, WE THEN ESTABLISH A SPECIFIC PROVISION FOR FEES OR REBATES BASED ON THE SPECIFIC TERMS OF EACH AGREEMENT. CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA. INCOME TAXES: WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. WE PROVIDE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. 57 TABLE OF CONTENTS WE ACCOUNT FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS PART OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THESE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATE PRIMARILY TO ISSUES COMMON AMONG MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE APPLY A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES WHICH INCLUDE STUDIES PERFORMED BY INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS, ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY AND SUBJECT EXPERTS, EVALUATION OF PUBLIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. WE PROVIDE ESTIMATES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. IF OUR ESTIMATES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ACTUAL OUTCOMES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE A PORTION WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR RECENT CUMULATIVE EARNINGS EXPERIENCE BY TAXING JURISDICTION, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, CARRYFORWARD PERIODS AVAILABLE TO US FOR TAX REPORTING PURPOSES, VARIOUS INCOME TAX STRATEGIES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT AND, TO THE EXTENT FUTURE EXPECTATIONS CHANGE, WE WOULD HAVE TO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THAT TIME. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION: THE COST OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IS RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL AWARDS GRANTED, USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES METHOD OF VALUATION. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH AWARD IS DETERMINED AND THE COMPENSATION COST IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD REQUIRED TO OBTAIN FULL VESTING. COMPENSATION COST TO BE RECOGNIZED REFLECTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF AWARDS EXPECTED TO VEST AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AN ESTIMATE OF AWARD FORFEITURES BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE. OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES: A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF ANY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY BELOW ITS COST THAT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN CARRYING AMOUNT TO FAIR VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT IS CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AND A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE SECURITY ESTABLISHED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INCLUDE: SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE ISSUERS EARNINGS PERFORMANCE, CREDIT RATING, ASSET QUALITY, BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE ISSUER OPERATES, LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW OUR COST, OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE SECURITY, OUR INTENT NOT TO SELL AND AN EVALUATION AS TO WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO SELL BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR COST BASIS. ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD DIFFER FROM OUR ASSESSMENT. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES: ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN CURRENT EARNINGS OR OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), DEPENDING ON WHETHER A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION AND, IF IT IS, THE TYPE OF HEDGING TRANSACTION. FOR A DERIVATIVE TO QUALIFY AS A HEDGE AT INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE HEDGED PERIOD, WE FORMALLY DOCUMENT THE NATURE AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEM. WE ASSESS, BOTH AT INCEPTION AND ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING TRANSACTIONS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING THE CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS. WE ASSESS HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND RECORD THE GAIN OR LOSS RELATED TO THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IF ANY, TO CURRENT EARNINGS. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER PROBABLE OF OCCURRING, WE DISCONTINUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING AND ANY RELATED UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE NOT DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION, TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES. THE USE OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE EXPOSURE OF THESE RISKS WITH THE INTENT TO REDUCE OUR RISK OR COST. WE DO NOT USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR SPECULATIVE TRADING PURPOSES AND ARE NOT A PARTY TO LEVERAGED DERIVATIVES. INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATED COMPANIES: WE APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING TO OUR INVESTMENT IN COMMON STOCK OF AN AFFILIATED COMPANY AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS, WHICH PRIMARILY INVEST IN COMPANIES CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN LIFE SCIENCES SUCH AS BIOTECHNOLOGY, PHARMACEUTICALS, MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY, MEDICAL DEVICES, DIAGNOSTICS AND HEALTH AND WELLNESS. 58 TABLE OF CONTENTS EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT. IF AN INVESTMENTS FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN ITS NET CARRYING VALUE AND THE DECLINE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE. SUCH AN EVALUATION IS JUDGMENTAL AND DEPENDENT ON SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE HAS OCCURRED INCLUDE: MARKET VALUE OR EXIT PRICE OF THE INVESTMENT BASED ON EITHER MARKET-QUOTED PRICES OR FUTURE ROUNDS OF FINANCING BY THE INVESTEE; LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE MARKET VALUE WAS BELOW ITS COST BASIS; FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE INVESTEE; OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT; ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INVESTEES ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN; AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE MAY BE AWARE OF RELATED TO THE INVESTMENT. ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, OR LTIP, DESIGNED TO PROVIDE KEY OFFICERS AND EXECUTIVES WITH PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES CONTINGENT UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED CORPORATE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES COVERING A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLES RUNNING CONCURRENTLY ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2012 AND 2013. PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR EACH LTIP ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE THREE-YEAR CYCLE: 25% ON NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE, 25% ON NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND 50% ON TOTAL NON-GAAP REVENUE, AS DEFINED. PAYOUTS MAY BE IN THE RANGE OF 0% TO 200% OF THE PARTICIPANTS SALARY FOR THE PLANS. AWARDS ARE PAYABLE IN CASH OR, AT OUR DISCRETION, IN OUR COMMON STOCK BASED UPON OUR STOCK PRICE AT THE PAYOUT DATE. WE ACCRUE THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE LIABILITY OVER EACH THREE-YEAR CYCLE. PRIOR TO THE END OF A THREE-YEAR CYCLE, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT DURING THE CYCLE. UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT EQUAL TO THEIR TARGET AWARD, OR AN AWARD BASED ON ACTUAL PERFORMANCE, IF HIGHER, THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL. ACCRUALS RECORDED FOR THE LTIP ENTAIL MAKING CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE, NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND NON-GAAP REVENUES, AS DEFINED; THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED. ACCRUALS FOR THE LTIP ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND REVISED ACCORDINGLY SO THAT THE LIABILITY RECORDED REFLECTS UPDATED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PAYOUTS. IN ESTIMATING THE ACCRUALS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DATE FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, EXPECTED RESULTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, OPERATING TRENDS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICING AND COMPETITION. VALUATION OF GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IPR&D: WE HAVE RECORDED GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IPR&D PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ACQUISITIONS OF PHARMION, GLOUCESTER AND ABRAXIS. WHEN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, ARE ACQUIRED, WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS ARE TYPICALLY USED IN THESE VALUATIONS IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, AND THE MODELS REQUIRE THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:  PROJECTING REGULATORY APPROVALS,  ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM PRODUCT SALES RESULTING FROM COMPLETED PRODUCTS AND IN-PROCESS PROJECTS AND  DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES AND PROBABILITY RATES GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. WE TEST OUR GOODWILL ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT EACH NOVEMBER 30. WE ARE ORGANIZED AS A SINGLE REPORTING UNIT AND THEREFORE THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS DONE USING OUR OVERALL MARKET VALUE, AS DETERMINED BY OUR TRADED SHARE PRICE, AS COMPARED TO OUR BOOK VALUE OF NET ASSETS. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE AMORTIZED TO THEIR ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR. INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO IPR&D PRODUCT RIGHTS ARE TREATED AS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND NOT AMORTIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS APPROVED FOR SALE BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN SPECIFIED MARKETS. AT THAT TIME, WE WILL DETERMINE THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET, RECLASSIFY THE ASSET OUT OF 59 TABLE OF CONTENTS IPR&D AND BEGIN AMORTIZATION. IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS ALSO PERFORMED AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. OUR IPR&D PRODUCT RIGHTS WERE OBTAINED IN THE GLOUCESTER AND ABRAXIS ACQUISITIONS. THE GLOUCESTER RELATED PRODUCT RIGHTS WILL BECOME DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES WHEN MARKETING APPROVAL IS RECEIVED FOR ISTODAX® FOR TREATMENT OF PTCL IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE ABRAXIS RELATED PRODUCT RIGHTS WILL BECOME DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES WHEN MARKETING APPROVAL IS RECEIVED FOR ABRAXANE® FOR TREATMENT OF EITHER NSCLC, PANCREATIC CANCER OR MELANOMA IN A MAJOR MARKET, TYPICALLY EITHER THE UNITED STATES OR THE EUROPEAN UNION, OR IN A SERIES OF OTHER COUNTRIES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN SPECIFIED CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. VALUATION OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION: WE RECORD CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION AT ITS FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE, AND FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT REPORTING PERIOD REVALUE THESE OBLIGATIONS AND RECORD INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPERATING EARNINGS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. CHANGES TO CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION OBLIGATIONS CAN RESULT FROM MOVEMENTS IN PUBLICLY TRADED SHARE PRICES OF CVRS, ADJUSTMENTS TO DISCOUNT RATES AND PERIODS, UPDATES IN THE ASSUMED ACHIEVEMENT OR TIMING OF ANY DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES OR CHANGES IN THE PROBABILITY OF CERTAIN CLINICAL EVENTS AND CHANGES IN THE ASSUMED PROBABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATORY APPROVAL. THE ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT AND ANY CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION EXPENSE RECORDED IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. OUR CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES WERE ACQUIRED IN THE ACQUISITIONS OF GLOUCESTER AND ABRAXIS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GLOUCESTER CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY IS BASED ON THE DISCOUNT RATES, PROBABILITIES AND ESTIMATED TIMING OF TWO CASH MILESTONE PAYMENTS TO THE FORMER GLOUCESTER SHAREHOLDERS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ABRAXIS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY IS BASED ON THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES FORWARD-LOOKING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RISK OF LOSS IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES, CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE EARNINGS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, OUR MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS CONSISTED OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, OUR LONG-TERM DEBT, OUR NOTE PAYABLE AND CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE CONSISTED OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT, AGENCY AND SUPRANATIONAL SECURITIES, GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES INCLUDE GENERAL UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS EITHER ISSUED DIRECTLY BY OR GUARANTEED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTERPRISES. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MBS INCLUDE MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION AND THE GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION. NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT, AGENCY AND SUPRANATIONAL SECURITIES, CONSIST OF DIRECT OBLIGATIONS OF HIGHLY RATED GOVERNMENTS OF NATIONS OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES, OBLIGATIONS OF SPONSORED AGENCIES AND OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE GUARANTEED OR SUPPORTED BY HIGHLY RATED GOVERNMENTS OF NATIONS OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES. CORPORATE DEBT  GLOBAL INCLUDES OBLIGATIONS ISSUED BY INVESTMENT-GRADE CORPORATIONS INCLUDING SOME ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN GUARANTEED BY GOVERNMENTS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, 60 TABLE OF CONTENTS NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, FAIR VALUES AND RELATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE WERE AS FOLLOWS: DURATION LESS THAN MORE THAN 1 YEAR 1 TO 3 YEARS 3 TO 5 YEARS 5 YEARS TOTAL IN THOUSANDS $ PRINCIPAL AMOUNT $ 435,227 $ 742,537 $ 38,994 $ 12,401 $ 1,229,159 FAIR VALUE $ 438,813 $ 755,827 $ 38,490 $ 12,774 $ 1,245,904 AVERAGE INTEREST RATE 0.5 % 1.0 % 3.7 % 2.6 % 0.9 % LONG-TERM DEBT: ON OCTOBER 7, 2010, WE ISSUED A TOTAL OF $1.25 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2.45% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2015, $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.95% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2020 AND $250.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 5.7% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2040. THE NOTES WERE ISSUED AT 99.854%, 99.745% AND 99.813% OF PAR, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE DISCOUNT AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. OFFERING COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $10.3 MILLION HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND ARE AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. INTEREST ON THE NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON APRIL 15 AND OCTOBER 15 EACH YEAR BEGINNING APRIL 15, 2011 AND THE PRINCIPAL ON EACH NOTE IS DUE IN FULL AT THEIR RESPECTIVE MATURITY DATES. THE NOTES MAY BE REDEEMED AT OUR OPTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT ANY TIME AT A REDEMPTION PRICE DEFINED IN A MAKE-WHOLE CLAUSE EQUALING ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST PLUS THE GREATER OF 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES TO BE REDEEMED OR THE SUM OF THE PRESENT VALUES OF THE REMAINING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL. IF WE EXPERIENCE A CHANGE OF CONTROL ACCOMPANIED BY A DOWNGRADE OF THE DEBT TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO OFFER TO REPURCHASE THE NOTES AT A PURCHASE PRICE EQUAL TO 101% OF THEIR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST. WE ARE SUBJECT TO COVENANTS WHICH LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PLEDGE PROPERTIES AS SECURITY UNDER BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING OUR PROPERTY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SENIOR NOTES OUTSTANDING WAS $1.197 BILLION. NOTE PAYABLE: IN DECEMBER 2006, WE PURCHASED AN ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENT, OR API, MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FROM SIEGFRIED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NOTE PAYABLE TO SIEGFRIED APPROXIMATED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTE OF $25.0 MILLION. ASSUMING OTHER FACTORS ARE HELD CONSTANT, AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES GENERALLY WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NOTE. THE NOTE IS DENOMINATED IN SWISS FRANCS AND ITS FAIR VALUE WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR/SWISS FRANC EXCHANGE RATE. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTE REFLECTS THE U.S. DOLLAR/SWISS FRANC EXCHANGE RATE AND SWISS INTEREST RATES. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS: WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PROTECT AGAINST CHANGES IN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 HAD SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 36 MONTHS. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES UNDER ASC 815 AND, ACCORDINGLY, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THEM ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), OR OCI, AND RECLASSIFIED TO OPERATIONS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT OPERATIONS. 61 TABLE OF CONTENTS ANY INEFFECTIVENESS ON THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IS REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME, NET. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES WERE AS FOLLOWS: NOTIONAL AMOUNT DECEMBER 31, FOREIGN CURRENCY 2010 2009 IN THOUSANDS $ BRITISH POUND $ 58,440 $  CANADIAN DOLLAR 133,128  EURO 675,438 1,107,340 JAPANESE YEN 632,962  SWISS FRANC 77,669  OTHERS 54,644  TOTAL $ 1,632,281 $ 1,107,340 WE CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF OUR OWN AND THE COUNTERPARTIES CREDIT RISK ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO EXECUTE ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONTRACT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, CREDIT RISK DID NOT MATERIALLY CHANGE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS. WE RECOGNIZED AN INCREASE IN NET PRODUCT SALES FOR CERTAIN EFFECTIVE CASH FLOW HEDGE INSTRUMENTS OF $47.7 MILLION FOR 2010 AND A REDUCTION IN NET PRODUCT SALES OF $36.4 MILLION FOR 2009. THESE SETTLEMENTS WERE RECORDED IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED FORECASTED SALES OCCURRED. WE RECOGNIZED A DECREASE IN OTHER INCOME, NET FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN EFFECTIVE CASH FLOW HEDGE INSTRUMENTS OF $0.1 MILLION FOR 2010 COMPARED TO AN INCREASE OF $6.5 MILLION FOR 2009. THESE SETTLEMENTS WERE RECORDED IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED FORECASTED EXPENSES OCCURRED. CHANGES IN TIME VALUE, WHICH WE EXCLUDED FROM THE HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT, WERE INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME, NET. WE ALSO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN RECOGNIZED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS HEDGES UNDER ASC 815 AND, ACCORDINGLY, ANY CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME, NET IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD NON-DESIGNATED HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 WERE $848.6 MILLION AND $483.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, WE BELIEVE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS A REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES. ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2010 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WOULD CHANGE BY APPROXIMATELY $259.0 MILLION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS EITHER HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES OR RELATE TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE ENTITIES FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE EITHER REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS OR REMEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR LIABILITY. ON FEBRUARY 23, 2011, WE ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACT TO CONVERT A PORTION OF OUR INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE FROM FIXED RATE TO FLOATING RATE TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN INTEREST EXPENSE WITH INTEREST INCOME RECEIVED ON ITS CASH EQUIVALENT AND INVESTMENT BALANCES. THE FLOATING RATE IS BENCHMARKED TO LIBOR. THE SWAP IS DESIGNATED AS A FAIR VALUE HEDGE ON THE FIXED-RATE DEBT ISSUE MATURING OCTOBER 2015. SINCE THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE SWAP MATCH THOSE OF THE DEBT BEING HEDGED, IT IS ASSUMED TO BE A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE HEDGE AND ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAPS WILL BE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WITH NO NET IMPACT RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. AS OF THIS FILING, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF DEBT HEDGED WITH AN INTEREST RATE SWAP IS $125.0 MILLION. 62
