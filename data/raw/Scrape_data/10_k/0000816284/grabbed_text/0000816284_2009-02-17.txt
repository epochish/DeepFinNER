DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY CELGENE CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY WE OR OUR) IS A GLOBAL BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN THE DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF INNOVATIVE THERAPIES DESIGNED TO TREAT CANCER AND IMMUNE-INFLAMMATORY RELATED DISEASES. IN MARCH 2008, WE ACQUIRED PHARMION CORPORATION TO ENHANCE OUR PORTFOLIO OF THERAPIES FOR PATIENTS WITH LIFE-THREATENING ILLNESSES WORLDWIDE WITH THE ADDITION OF PHARMIONS MARKETED PRODUCTS, AND SEVERAL PRODUCTS IN DEVELOPMENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF HEMATOLOGICAL AND SOLID TUMOR CANCERS. BY COMBINING THIS NEW PRODUCT PORTFOLIO WITH OUR EXISTING OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL CAPABILITIES, WE ENLARGED OUR GLOBAL MARKET SHARE THROUGH INCREASED PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND EXPANDED CLINICAL, REGULATORY AND COMMERCIAL CAPABILITIES. OUR PRIMARY COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS INCLUDE REVLIMID®, THALOMID® AND VIDAZA®. REVLIMID® IS AN ORAL IMMUNOMODULATORY DRUG MARKETED FOR MULTIPLE MYELOMA PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY AND FOR TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH TRANSFUSION-DEPENDENT ANEMIA DUE TO LOW- OR INTERMEDIATE-1-RISK MDS ASSOCIATED WITH A DELETION 5Q CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITY WITH OR WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITIES. THALOMID® IS MARKETED FOR PATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND FOR THE ACUTE TREATMENT OF THE CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF MODERATE TO SEVERE ENL, AN INFLAMMATORY COMPLICATION OF LEPROSY. VIDAZA® IS A PYRIMIDINE NUCLEOSIDE ANALOG THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF DNA HYPERMETHYLATION AND PROMOTE SUBSEQUENT GENE RE-EXPRESSION. VIDAZA® WAS LICENSED FROM PHARMACIA & UPJOHN, NOW PART OF PFIZER, AND IS MARKETED FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALL SUBTYPES OF MDS. VIDAZA® WAS GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION BY THE FDA FOR THE TREATMENT OF MDS IN THE UNITED STATES THROUGH MAY 2011. IN DECEMBER 2008, VIDAZA® WAS GRANTED FULL MARKETING AUTHORIZATION BY THE EC FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR HAEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION WITH INTERMEDIATE-2 AND HIGH-RISK MDS ACCORDING TO THE IPSS OR CMML WITH 10-29 PERCENT MARROW BLASTS WITHOUT MYELOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER, OR AML WITH 20-30 PERCENT BLASTS AND MULTI-LINEAGE DYSPLASIA, ACCORDING TO WHO CLASSIFICATION. WE CONTINUE TO INVEST SUBSTANTIALLY IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND THE DRUG CANDIDATES IN OUR PIPELINE ARE AT VARIOUS STAGES OF PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT. THESE CANDIDATES INCLUDE OUR IMIDS® COMPOUNDS, WHICH ARE A CLASS OF COMPOUNDS PROPRIETARY TO US AND HAVING CERTAIN IMMUNOMODULATORY AND OTHER BIOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT PROPERTIES IN ADDITION TO OUR LEADING ORAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS AND CELL PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PRIMARY COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS AND DEPTH OF OUR PRODUCT PIPELINE PROVIDE THE CATALYSTS FOR FUTURE GROWTH. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE REPORTED REVENUE OF $2.255 BILLION, A NET LOSS OF $1.534 BILLION AND A DILUTED LOSS PER SHARE OF $3.46. REVENUE INCREASED BY $849.0 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EXPANDED USE OF REVLIMID® AND THE ACQUISITION OF FORMER PHARMION PRODUCTS, INCLUDING VIDAZA® AND THALOMID® OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. THE NET LOSS AND LOSS PER SHARE AMOUNTS WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO IPR&D CHARGES AND AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO THE PHARMION ACQUISITION, IN ADDITION TO THE EXPENSING OF THE OCTOBER 3, 2008 ROYALTY OBLIGATION PAYMENT TO PFIZER THAT RELATED TO THE UNAPPROVED FORMS OF VIDAZA®. 37 TABLE OF CONTENTS FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING DEMAND FOR OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS, REGULATORY APPROVALS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES, THE TIMING AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS LAUNCHED BY US OR COMPETING COMPANIES, THE TIMING OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES, CHALLENGES TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL COSTS. SEE ALSO RISK FACTORS CONTAINED IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. SOME OF THE MORE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON INCLUDE: THE ABILITY OF OUR PRODUCTS TO SUCCESSFULLY PENETRATE AND EXPAND IN RELEVANT MARKETS: REVLIMID® WAS APPROVED BY THE FDA, THE EC, THE SWISSMEDIC, THE TGA, AND IN OCTOBER 2008 BY HEALTH CANADA FOR TREATMENT IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE FOR MULTIPLE MYELOMA PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY. IN ADDITION, REVLIMID® WAS APPROVED BY THE FDA AND THE CANADIAN THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS DIRECTORATE FOR TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH TRANSFUSION-DEPENDENT ANEMIA DUE TO LOW- OR INTERMEDIATE-1-RISK MDS, ASSOCIATED WITH A DELETION 5Q CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITY WITH OR WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITIES. WE DO NOT HAVE LONG-TERM DATA ON THE USE OF THE PRODUCT AND CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER REVLIMID® WILL CONTINUE TO GAIN THE ACCEPTANCE OF REGULATORS, PHYSICIANS, PATIENTS AND OTHER KEY OPINION LEADERS AS A RELATIVELY SAFE AND EFFECTIVE DRUG THAT HAS CERTAIN ADVANTAGES AS COMPARED TO EXISTING OR FUTURE THERAPIES. WE ARE ALSO SEEKING TO INTRODUCE REVLIMID® IN ADDITIONAL INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AS WELL AS OBTAINING APPROVALS FOR ADDITIONAL INDICATIONS BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY. A DELAY IN GAINING THE REQUISITE REGULATORY APPROVALS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR GROWTH PLANS. THALOMID® WAS APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR TREATMENT IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE FOR PATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND IS ALSO APPROVED FOR THE TREATMENT AND SUPPRESSION OF CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF ENL, AN INFLAMMATORY COMPLICATION OF LEPROSY. IN APRIL 2008, THE TGA APPROVED A SUPPLEMENTAL FILING GRANTING THALOMID® MARKETING APPROVAL FOR USE IN COMBINATION WITH MELPHALAN AND PREDNISONE FOR PATIENTS WITH UNTREATED MULTIPLE MYELOMA OR INELIGIBLE FOR HIGH DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY AND ALSO GRANTED THALOMID® MARKETING APPROVAL IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE FOR INDUCTION THERAPY PRIOR TO HIGH DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY WITH AUTOLOGOUS STEM CELL RESCUE, FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH UNTREATED MULTIPLE MYELOMA. IN ADDITION, IN APRIL 2008, THALOMID® WAS GRANTED FULL MARKETING AUTHORIZATION BY THE EC FOR USE IN COMBINATION WITH MELPHALAN AND PREDNISONE AS A TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED MULTIPLE MYELOMA. IF UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EXPERIENCES ARE REPORTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THALOMID® BY PATIENTS, PHYSICIAN AND PATIENT COMFORT WITH THE PRODUCT COULD BE UNDERMINED, THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF THALOMID® COULD BE AFFECTED AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR OTHER PRODUCTS, INCLUDING REVLIMID®, MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. VIDAZA® HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF DNA HYPERMETHYLATION AND PROMOTE SUBSEQUENT GENE RE-EXPRESSION. VIDAZA® WAS LICENSED FROM PHARMACIA & UPJOHN, NOW PART OF PFIZER, AND WAS APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALL SUBTYPES OF MDS. ADDITIONALLY, VIDAZA® WAS GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION BY THE FDA FOR THE TREATMENT OF AML. IN DECEMBER 2008, VIDAZA® WAS GRANTED FULL MARKETING AUTHORIZATION BY THE EC FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR HAEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION WITH INTERMEDIATE-2 AND HIGH-RISK MDS ACCORDING TO THE IPSS OR CMML WITH 10-29 PERCENT MARROW BLASTS WITHOUT MYELOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER, OR AML WITH 20-30 PERCENT BLASTS AND MULTI-LINEAGE DYSPLASIA, ACCORDING TO WHO CLASSIFICATION. OUR ABILITY TO ADVANCE REGULATORY AND CLINICAL PROGRAMS: MANY OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES ARE IN THE EARLY OR MID-STAGES OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND WILL REQUIRE THE COMMITMENT OF SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES, EXTENSIVE RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, PRECLINICAL TESTING, CLINICAL TRIALS, MANUFACTURING SCALE-UP AND REGULATORY APPROVAL PRIOR TO BEING READY FOR SALE. MOREOVER, OUR COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE PRODUCTS MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL STUDIES WITH RESPECT TO APPROVED INDICATIONS AS WELL AS NEW INDICATIONS PENDING APPROVAL. IF IT BECOMES TOO EXPENSIVE TO SUSTAIN OUR PRESENT COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES ON A LONG-TERM BASIS, WE WILL BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE CERTAIN NECESSARY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. FURTHERMORE, WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT OUR CLINICAL TESTING WILL RENDER SATISFACTORY RESULTS, OR THAT WE WILL RECEIVE REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS FOR OUR NEW PRODUCTS OR NEW INDICATIONS. A MAJOR OBJECTIVE OF OUR ONGOING CLINICAL PROGRAMS IS TO BROADEN OUR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE FULL POTENTIAL OF REVLIMID® AND OUR OTHER PROPRIETARY IMIDS® COMPOUNDS AND TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THEM IN A BROAD RANGE OF HEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES AND OTHER CANCERS. OUR NEAR-TERM FOCUS IS ON EVALUATING REVLIMID® AS A TREATMENT OF CLL AND NHL. 38 TABLE OF CONTENTS COMPETITIVE RISKS: WHILE COMPETITION COULD LIMIT OUR PRODUCTS SALES, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT COMPETING PRODUCTS WOULD ELIMINATE THEIR USE ENTIRELY. MOREOVER, WHILE GENERIC COMPETITORS HAVE AND COULD SEEK TO CHALLENGE OUR THALOMID® FRANCHISE, WE OWN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WHICH INCLUDES, FOR EXAMPLE, U.S. PATENTS COVERING OUR S.T.E.P.S.® DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM FOR THE SAFE DISTRIBUTION AND APPROPRIATE USE OF THALIDOMIDE, WHICH ALL PHYSICIANS, PATIENTS AND PHARMACIES PRESCRIBING, RECEIVING OR DISPENSING THALIDOMIDE IN THE UNITED STATES MUST FOLLOW. WE ALSO HAVE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO SEVERAL ISSUED PATENTS COVERING THALOMID® FORMULATIONS, AS WELL AS THE USE OF THALOMID® IN ONCOLOGY AND OTHER THERAPEUTIC AREAS. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006 TOTAL REVENUE: TOTAL REVENUE AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: TOTAL REVENUE INCREASED BY $849.0 MILLION, OR 60.4%, IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007. THIS INCREASE IS DUE TO INCREASED REVENUE IN THE UNITED STATES OF $379.8 MILLION, OR 31.6%, COMPARED TO 2007 AND INCREASED REVENUE IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS OF $469.2 MILLION, OR 230.2%. 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: TOTAL REVENUE INCREASED BY $506.9 MILLION, OR 56.4%, IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. THIS INCREASE IS DUE TO INCREASED REVENUE IN THE UNITED STATES OF $356.6 MILLION, OR 42.2%, COMPARED TO 2006 AND INCREASED REVENUE IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS OF $150.3 MILLION, OR 281.2%. NET PRODUCT SALES: 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: REVLIMID® NET SALES INCREASED BY $550.8 MILLION, OR 71.2%, IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CONTINUED EXPANSION IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. INCREASED MARKET PENETRATION AND THE INCREASE IN DURATION OF PATIENTS USING REVLIMID® IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE U.S. GROWTH. INTERNATIONAL SALES GROWTH PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF THE JUNE 2007 ECS APPROVAL FOR THE USE OF REVLIMID® FOR TREATMENT IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE OF PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE MYELOMA WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY AND CONTINUED EXPANSION IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND SUBSEQUENT PRICING, REIMBURSEMENT AND MARKETING APPROVALS IN EACH COUNTRY. REVLIMID® CONTINUED TO RECEIVE POSITIVE CLINICAL STUDY RESULTS WHICH WERE REPORTED AT MAJOR MEDICAL CONFERENCES AND IN PEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS. 39 TABLE OF CONTENTS THALOMID® NET SALES INCREASED BY $57.6 MILLION, OR 12.9%, IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 2008 INCLUSION OF INTERNATIONAL SALES, RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION OF PHARMION. IN ADDITION, U.S. PRICE INCREASES WERE OFFSET BY LOWER SALES VOLUMES. VIDAZA® REPRESENTS SALES RECORDED SUBSEQUENT TO THE MARCH 7, 2008 PHARMION ACQUISITION IN BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. ALKERAN® NET SALES INCREASED BY $8.2 MILLION, OR 11.1%, IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN UNIT SALES OF THE INJECTABLE FORM. THE AGREEMENT WITH GSK TO DISTRIBUTE, PROMOTE AND SELL ALKERAN® EXPIRES ON MARCH 31, 2009 AND WILL NOT BE RENEWED. NET PRODUCT SALES INCREASED BY $837.2 MILLION, OR 64.4% IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007. THE CHANGE WAS COMPRISED OF NET VOLUME INCREASES OF $742.8 MILLION, OR 57.1%, AS WELL AS PRICE INCREASES OF $93.0 MILLION, OR 7.2%, AND IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE OF $1.4 MILLION, OR 0.1%. 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: REVLIMID® NET SALES INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PRODUCTS EXPANDED USE IN THE UNITED STATES RESULTING FROM THE FDAS JUNE 2006 APPROVAL FOR TREATMENT IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE OF PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE MYELOMA WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND GROWTH IN EUROPE RESULTING FROM THE JUNE 2007 ECS APPROVAL FOR THE USE OF REVLIMID® IN THIS SAME INDICATION. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN SALES WERE PRICE INCREASES AND INCREASED SALES FROM OUR EUROPEAN NAMED PATIENT PROGRAM, OR NPP, WHICH OFFERS EUROPEAN PATIENTS IN NEED OF TREATMENT ACCESS TO REVLIMID® ON A COMPASSIONATE USE BASIS. NET SALES OF THALOMID® WERE HIGHER IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO PRICE INCREASES, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES VOLUMES AS WRITTEN PRESCRIPTIONS DECLINED, REFLECTING THE EXPANDED USE OF REVLIMID®. ALKERAN® NET SALES WERE HIGHER IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED PRICES AND A DECREASE IN PRODUCT RETURNS. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES; SALES DISCOUNTS; GOVERNMENT REBATES; AND CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES.  WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DOES NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. WE ANALYZE HISTORIC RETURNS EXPERIENCE ON CLOSED LOTS AND HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES ON OPEN LOTS. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED SPECIALTY PHARMACIES LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY TO DATE. VIDAZA® AND ALKERAN® ARE SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES TO PHARMACEUTICAL WHOLESALERS, WHO IN TURN DISTRIBUTE PRODUCT TO PHYSICIANS, RETAIL PHARMACIES, HOSPITALS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS.  SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. 40 TABLE OF CONTENTS  GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE AMOUNT FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. CERTAIN FOREIGN MARKETS HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID AND ACCORDINGLY THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES.  CHARGEBACKS ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICES ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. ON JANUARY 28, 2008, THE FISCAL YEAR 2008 NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT WAS ENACTED, WHICH EXPANDS TRICARE TO INCLUDE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS DISPENSED BY TRICARE RETAIL NETWORK PHARMACIES. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS REFLECT THIS PROGRAM EXPANSION AND ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA. SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS AND THE BALANCE IN THE RELATED ALLOWANCE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES DECREASED BY $19.2 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED THALOMID® INVENTORY IN THE SALES CHANNEL RESULTING FROM THE 2007 THALOMID® INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION AT SEVERAL MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, WHICH ALSO RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL RETURNS DURING 2007. IN ADDITION, 2007 INCLUDES AN INCREASE IN THALOMID® RETURNS RESULTING FROM THE ANTICIPATED INCREASE IN USE OF REVLIMID® IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA. WE ANTICIPATE ANOTHER INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVE TO BE CONDUCTED BY A MAJOR PHARMACY CHAIN IN EARLY 2009 AND BELIEVE THAT OUR ENDING RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES RESERVE REFLECTS THE ANTICIPATED EFFECTS THEREOF. DISCOUNTS INCREASED BY $8.0 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES OF REVLIMID® AS WELL AS THE INCLUSION OF FORMER PHARMION PRODUCTS, WHICH RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL DISCOUNTS TAKEN. 41 TABLE OF CONTENTS GOVERNMENT REBATES INCREASED BY $7.0 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASED INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT REBATES RESULTING FROM OUR GLOBAL EXPANSION, AS WELL AS THE INCLUSION OF FORMER PHARMION PRODUCTS. CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES INCREASED BY $30.1 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NEW TRICARE REBATE PROGRAM, AS WELL AS THE INCLUSION OF FORMER PHARMION PRODUCTS. 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: SALES RETURN ALLOWANCES DECREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER RETURNS OF ALKERAN® IV RESULTING FROM IMPROVED EXPIRATION DATING ON 2006 AND 2007 PRODUCT SALES. IN ADDITION, THALOMID® RETURNS WERE LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO A 2006 THALOMID® RETURNS INITIATIVE UNDERTAKEN BY ONE LARGE RETAIL PHARMACY CHAIN. IN RESPONSE TO THIS INITIATIVE, WE INTRODUCED SINGLE SLEEVES OF THALOMID® FOR SALE IN JUNE OF 2006. PREVIOUSLY, THALOMID® WAS SOLD ONLY IN MULTI-SLEEVE PACKAGE CONFIGURATIONS. THE ADDITIONAL TRADE PACKAGE CONFIGURATION ENABLED ALL RETAILERS TO MORE EFFICIENTLY MANAGE THEIR THALOMID® INVENTORIES RESULTING IN LOWER 2007 RETURNS. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY CURRENT YEAR THALOMID®RETURNS, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF A 2007 INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVE CONDUCTED BY SEVERAL MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS. UNDER THIS INITIATIVE, INVENTORY WAS REDISTRIBUTED AMONGST INDIVIDUAL CHAIN STORES IN A S.T.E.P.S.® COMPLIANT MANNER. THIS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THALOMID® RETURNS AS THESE MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS MORE EFFECTIVELY MANAGED THEIR INVENTORY LEVELS AT THE CHAIN STORES. DISCOUNTS INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED SALES OF REVLIMID®. GOVERNMENT REBATE ALLOWANCES INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 DUE TO INCREASED SALES OF REVLIMID® AS WELL AS PRICE INCREASES FOR BOTH THALOMID® AND REVLIMID®. OUR MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE AMOUNT FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES USING THE ESTIMATED MEDICAID DISPENSE QUANTITIES. REVLIMID® DISPENSES INCREASED RESULTING FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF THE 15MG AND 25MG STRENGTH TABLETS. DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO REVLIMID®, THALOMID® AND ALKERAN® IV PRICE INCREASES, WHICH INCREASED THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN ANNUAL CONTRACT PRICING AVAILABLE TO FEDERALLY FUNDED HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND OUR WHOLESALE ACQUISITION COST. COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER REVENUE: 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: REVENUES FROM COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER SOURCES TOTALED $14.9 MILLION AND $20.1 MILLION FOR 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE $5.2 MILLION DECREASE IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ELIMINATION OF LICENSE FEES AND AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED REVENUES RELATED TO PHARMION. 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: REVENUES FROM COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER SOURCES INCREASED BY $1.9 MILLION IN 2007 FROM THE $18.2 MILLION RECORDED IN 2006. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN LICENSE FEES GENERATED FROM OUR S.T.E.P.S.® PROGRAM AND AN INCREASE IN UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD ENROLLMENT, COLLECTION AND STORAGE FEES GENERATED THROUGH OUR LIFEBANK USASM BUSINESS. ROYALTY REVENUE: 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: REVENUES FROM ROYALTIES TOTALED $102.2 MILLION IN 2008, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $16.9 MILLION COMPARED TO 2007. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AMOUNTS RECEIVED FROM NOVARTIS ON SALES OF FOCALIN XR®, PARTLY DUE TO PATIENTS TRANSITIONING FROM FOCALIN® TO FOCALIN XR®. WE SELL FOCALIN® TO NOVARTIS AND RECEIVE ROYALTIES ON SALES OF NOVARTIS FOCALIN XR®. 42 TABLE OF CONTENTS 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: REVENUES FROM ROYALTIES TOTALED $85.3 MILLION IN 2007, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $16.2 MILLION COMPARED TO 2006. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AMOUNTS RECEIVED FROM NOVARTIS ON SALES OF THEIR ENTIRE FAMILY OF RITALIN® DRUGS AND FOCALIN XR®. ROYALTY REVENUE TOTALED $69.1 MILLION IN 2006. COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION EXPENSE): COST OF GOODS SOLD AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED BY $128.1 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF COSTS RELATED TO VIDAZA® AND THALOMID®, WHICH WERE OBTAINED IN THE PHARMION ACQUISITION. ALSO INCLUDED IN 2008 IS $24.6 MILLION OF THE $25.0 MILLION OF INVENTORY STEP-UP COST RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUE OF FORMER PHARMION INVENTORIES. COST OF SALES ALSO INCREASED DUE TO AN INCREASE IN MATERIAL COSTS FOR ALKERAN® FOR INJECTION AND AN INCREASE IN UNIT VOLUME FOR REVLIMID®, RESULTING IN HIGHER ROYALTIES. AS A PERCENT OF NET PRODUCT SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED TO 12.1% IN THE 2008 FROM 10.0% IN 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF HIGHER COSTS FOR VIDAZA® AND ALKERAN® AND THE $24.6 MILLION OF INVENTORY STEP-UP COST. 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN REVLIMID® MATERIAL COSTS AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS RELATED TO BOTH REVLIMID® AND THALOMID® AS SALES INCREASED FOR THESE TWO PRODUCTS. THE INCREASE WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER ALKERAN® MATERIAL COSTS RELATED TO ALKERAN® FOR INJECTION. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET PRODUCT SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD DECREASED FROM 15.5% IN 2006 TO 10.0% IN 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE GROWTH OF REVLIMID® AND THAT PRODUCTS LOWER COST RELATIVE TO OUR OTHER PRODUCTS AND SALES PRICE INCREASES. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED BY $530.8 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO A $303.1 MILLION CHARGE FOR THE OCTOBER 3, 2008 ROYALTY OBLIGATION PAYMENT TO PFIZER THAT RELATED TO THE UNAPPROVED FORMS OF VIDAZA®. IN ADDITION, SPENDING ON CLINICAL PROGRAMS INCREASED BY $147.4 MILLION IN SUPPORT OF ONGOING CLINICAL PROGRESS IN MULTIPLE PROPRIETARY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AS NOTED BELOW. REGULATORY SPENDING INCREASED BY $20.2 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF REVLIMID® IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND COSTS RELATED TO APREMILAST, AS DESCRIBED BELOW. ALSO INCLUDED IN 2008 WAS $45.0 MILLION IN UPFRONT PAYMENTS MADE TO ACCELERON RELATED TO A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENT. THE INCREASE WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY THE 2007 INCLUSION OF A COMBINED $41.1 MILLION IN UPFRONT PAYMENTS FOR COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR EARLY STAGE COMPOUNDS WITH ARRAY BIOPHARMA INC. AND PTC THERAPEUTICS. 43 TABLE OF CONTENTS THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL BREAKDOWN OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES SUPPORT ONGOING CLINICAL PROGRESS IN MULTIPLE PROPRIETARY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS FOR REVLIMID®, POMALIDOMIDE AND OTHER IMIDS® COMPOUNDS ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF DISEASES, INCLUDING NHL AND CLL; FOR VIDAZA®; AMRUBICIN, OUR LEAD COMPOUND FOR SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER; APREMILAST (CC-10004), OUR LEAD ANTI-INFLAMMATORY COMPOUND THAT INHIBITS PDE-4, WHICH RESULTS IN THE INHIBITION OF MULTIPLE PROINFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS SUCH AS TNF-A AND WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED IN PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS IN THE TREATMENT OF PSORIASIS AND PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS; POMALIDOMIDE AND CC-11050, WHICH ARE CURRENTLY EITHER BEING EVALUATED IN PHASE I AND PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS AND ADDITIONAL TRIALS ARE BEING PLANNED OR ONGOING FOR VARIOUS DISEASE INDICATIONS; AND OUR KINASE INHIBITOR PROGRAM, OUR ACTIVIN INHIBITOR PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE PLACENTAL STEM CELL PROGRAM. WE AND ACCELERON HAVE INITIATED PHASE II STUDIES OF ACE-011 IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM CANCER-RELATED BONE LOSS. 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED BY $140.5 MILLION IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO SPENDING RELATED TO CLINICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN SUPPORT OF MULTIPLE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING REVLIMID® AND OTHER IMIDS® ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF CANCERS, INCLUDING NHL AND CLL. EXPENSES ALSO INCREASED TO SUPPORT ONGOING RESEARCH OF OTHER COMPOUNDS, SUCH AS OUR KINASE AND LIGASE INHIBITOR PROGRAMS AND PLACENTAL STEM CELL PROGRAM. REGULATORY SPENDING INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF REVLIMID® IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE EXPENSE FOR 2007 ALSO INCLUDED A COMBINED $41.1 MILLION IN COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR EARLY STAGE COMPOUNDS WITH ARRAY AND PTC. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE MAY CONTINUE TO GROW AS EARLIER STAGE COMPOUNDS ARE MOVED THROUGH THE PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL STAGES. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN PRECLINICAL TESTS AND CLINICAL TRIALS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, THE COST TO COMPLETE SUCH PROJECTS CAN VARY. THE DATA OBTAINED FROM THESE TESTS AND TRIALS MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING INTERPRETATION THAT COULD DELAY, LIMIT OR PREVENT A PROJECTS ADVANCEMENT THROUGH THE VARIOUS STAGES OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE COSTS INCURRED TO BRING A PROJECT TO COMPLETION. FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMMERCIAL AND DEVELOPMENT STATUS AND TARGET DISEASES OF OUR DRUG COMPOUNDS, REFER TO THE PRODUCT OVERVIEW TABLE CONTAINED IN PART I, ITEM I, BUSINESS, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. 44 TABLE OF CONTENTS SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE: SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY $244.6 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007, PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN MARKETING EXPENSES OF $101.6 MILLION, SALES RELATED COSTS OF $65.9 MILLION, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF $63.8 MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN DONATIONS TO NON-PROFIT FOUNDATIONS THAT ASSIST PATIENTS WITH THEIR CO-PAYMENTS OF $13.3 MILLION. THE INCREASE REFLECTS MARKETING AND SALES EXPENSES RELATED TO PRODUCT LAUNCH ACTIVITIES FOR REVLIMID®AND THALOMID® IN EUROPE, CANADA AND AUSTRALIA. THE INCREASE ALSO REFLECTS THE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE RELAUNCH OF VIDAZA® IN THE UNITED STATES AFTER OBTAINING AN EXPANDED FDA APPROVAL TO REFLECT NEW OVERALL SURVIVAL ACHIEVED IN THE AZA-001 SURVIVAL STUDY OF PATIENTS WITH HIGHER-RISK MDS AND LAUNCH IN EUROPE. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASE ALSO REFLECTS THE CONTINUED EXPANSION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES IN OVER 65 COUNTRIES. 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY $111.2 MILLION IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN SALES FORCE COSTS RELATED TO REVLIMID® PRODUCT LAUNCH ACTIVITIES IN EUROPE AND AN INCREASE IN SPENDING RELATED TO OUR CONTINUED EXPANSION THROUGHOUT EUROPE, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA AND CANADA. DONATIONS TO NON-PROFIT FOUNDATIONS THAT ASSIST PATIENTS WITH THEIR CO-PAYMENTS ALSO INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS: THE $104.0 MILLION IN AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN 2008 INCLUDED $102.4 MILLION RELATED TO THE MARCH 2008 ACQUISITION OF PHARMION AND $1.6 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE OCTOBER 2004 ACQUISITION OF PENN T LIMITED. THE PHARMION INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PERIOD OF 6.5 YEARS. THE $9.1 MILLION IN AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION INTANGIBLES IN 2007 ALL RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF PENN T LIMITED. ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: IPR&D REPRESENTS COMPOUNDS UNDER DEVELOPMENT BY PHARMION AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION THAT HAD NOT YET ACHIEVED REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR MARKETING IN CERTAIN MARKETS OR HAD NOT YET BEEN COMPLETED AND HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE. THE $1.74 BILLION ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THESE INTANGIBLES WAS DERIVED USING THE MULTI-PERIOD EXCESS-EARNINGS METHOD, A FORM OF THE INCOME APPROACH. THE IPR&D PRIMARILY RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL INITIATIVES FOR VIDAZA® IV IN THE EU MARKET, THE ORAL FORM OF AZACITIDINE IN THE U.S. AND EU MARKETS AND THALOMID® IN THE EU MARKET. THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS FOR VALUATION PURPOSES WERE BASED ON KEY ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS ESTIMATES OF REVENUES AND OPERATING PROFITS RELATED TO THE PROGRAMS CONSIDERING THEIR STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT; THE TIME AND RESOURCES NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTS; AND THE LIFE OF THE POTENTIAL COMMERCIALIZED PRODUCTS AND ASSOCIATED RISKS, INCLUDING THE INHERENT DIFFICULTIES AND UNCERTAINTIES IN OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVALS. FOR VIDAZA® IV IN THE EU MARKET, THE RELATED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS WERE ESTIMATED USING A RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATE OF 10.0% AND AN ANTICIPATED REGULATORY APPROVAL DATE IN LATE 2008 WITH MARKET EXCLUSIVITY RIGHTS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH 2019. IN DECEMBER 2008, VIDAZA® WAS GRANTED FULL MARKETING AUTHORIZATION BY THE EC FOR THE TREATMENT OF CERTAIN ADULT PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR HAEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION. FOR THE ORAL FORM OF AZACITIDINE IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPEAN UNION, THE FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS WERE ESTIMATED USING A RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATE OF 11.0% FOR EACH MARKET.

IN APRIL 2008, THALOMID® WAS GRANTED FULL MARKETING AUTHORIZATION BY THE EC FOR USE IN COMBINATION WITH MELPHALAN AND PREDNISONE AS A TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED MULTIPLE MYELOMA. 45 TABLE OF CONTENTS INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET: INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WERE AS FOLLOWS: INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME WAS $84.8 MILLION IN 2008, REPRESENTING A $25.0 MILLION DECREASE FROM THE $109.8 MILLION RECORDED IN 2007. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES RESULTING FROM THE MARCH 2008 CASH PAYMENT OF $746.8 MILLION RELATED TO THE PHARMION ACQUISITION AND THE OCTOBER 3, 2008 PAYMENT OF $425.0 MILLION TO PFIZER WHERE WE PREPAID OUR ROYALTY OBLIGATION UNDER THE JUNE 7, 2001 5-AZACYTIDINE LICENSE IN FULL, IN ADDITION TO REDUCED YIELDS ON INVESTED BALANCES. INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET INCLUDED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE TOTALING $2.4 MILLION IN 2008 AND $5.5 MILLION 2007. INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET INCREASED BY $69.5 MILLION IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES RESULTING FROM THE NOVEMBER 2006 ISSUANCE OF AN ADDITIONAL 20,000,000 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WHICH GENERATED NET PROCEEDS OF $1.006 BILLION. EQUITY IN LOSSES OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES: UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, WE RECORDED LOSSES OF $3.7 MILLION, $4.5 MILLION AND $8.2 MILLION IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, IMPAIRMENT LOSSES OF $6.0 MILLION WERE RECORDED IN 2008. THE IMPAIRMENT LOSSES WERE BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING AN OTHER THAN TEMPORARY DECREASE IN FAIR VALUE OF AN EQUITY INVESTMENT BELOW OUR COST. THE $3.7 MILLION DECREASE IN LOSSES IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A CHARGE OF $3.1 MILLION FOR IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO AN ACQUISITION MADE BY ONE OF OUR INVESTMENT COMPANIES IN 2006. INTEREST EXPENSE: INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $4.4 MILLION, $11.1 MILLION AND $9.4 MILLION IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY, AND PRIMARILY REFLECTED INTEREST AND AMORTIZATION OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS RELATED TO THE $400 MILLION CONVERTIBLE NOTES ISSUED ON JUNE 3, 2003. THE $6.7 MILLION DECREASE IN 2008 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A SUBSTANTIAL CONVERSION OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT INTO OUR COMMON STOCK IN DECEMBER 2007 AND THE COMPLETION OF CONVERSIONS IN JUNE 2008. INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED $1.7 MILLION IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF A FULL YEARS INTEREST ON THE NOTE PAYABLE TO SIEGFRIED LTD. AND SIEGFRIED DIENSTE AG (TOGETHER REFERRED TO HEREIN AS SIEGFRIED), RESULTING FROM THE DECEMBER 2006 ACQUISITION OF THE API MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN ZOFINGEN, SWITZERLAND.

THE $27.1 MILLION INCREASE IN INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, WHICH WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT LOSS RECORDED ON AN EQUITY INVESTMENT. THE EXPENSE IN 2007 INCLUDED EXPENSES RELATED TO A TERMINATION BENEFIT RESULTING FROM THE MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS OF A TERMINATED EMPLOYEE AND WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS. THE $7.9 MILLION DECREASE IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 WAS PARTLY DUE TO THE MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS AND A $3.8 MILLION DECREASE IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS. INCOME TAX PROVISION: THE INCOME TAX PROVISION FOR 2008 WAS $164.8 MILLION WITH AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF NEGATIVE 12.0%. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY NON-DEDUCTIBLE IPR&D CHARGES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF PHARMION. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE IPR&D AND THE EXPENSE RELATED TO THE PREPAYMENT OF OUR ROYALTY OBLIGATION FOR UNAPPROVED PRODUCTS, WAS 24.8% WHICH REFLECTS THE BENEFIT OF OUR LOW TAX SWISS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS AND OUR OVERALL GLOBAL MIX OF INCOME. THE INCOME TAX PROVISIONS FOR 2007 AND 2006 WERE $290.5 MILLION AND $133.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WITH EFFECTIVE TAX RATES OF 56.2% AND 66.0%, RESPECTIVELY, AND REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN EXPENSES INCURRED IN TAXING JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES FOR WHICH WE DID NOT RECEIVE A TAX BENEFIT AND NONDEDUCTIBLE EXPENSES WHICH INCLUDED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS.

NO ADJUSTMENT TO THE NUMERATOR OR DENOMINATOR WAS MADE IN 2008 DUE TO THE ANTI-DILUTIVE EFFECT OF ANY POTENTIAL COMMON STOCK AS A RESULT OF OUR NET LOSS. 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: NET INCOME DECREASED BY $1.760 BILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO $1.740 BILLION IN IPR&D CHARGES AND $102.3 MILLION IN ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES AMORTIZATION RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF PHARMION IN MARCH 2008, IN ADDITION TO A $303.1 MILLION CHARGE FOR THE OCTOBER 3, 2008 ROYALTY OBLIGATION PAYMENT TO PFIZER THAT RELATED TO THE UNAPPROVED FORMS OF VIDAZA®. THESE COSTS WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NET REVENUES PROVIDED BY REVLIMID® AND VIDAZA®. 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: NET INCOME INCREASED BY $157.5 MILLION IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN TOTAL REVENUES, PRIMARILY FROM THE SALES OF REVLIMID®; INCREASE IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME RESULTING FROM THE ISSUANCE OF AN ADDITIONAL 20,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN NOVEMBER 2006; DECREASE IN THE OVERALL INCOME TAX RATE FROM 66% IN 2006 TO 56% IN 2007; PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES REQUIRED TO SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONAL GROWTH, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND THE LAUNCH OF REVLIMID® IN EUROPE. 47 TABLE OF CONTENTS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WERE AS FOLLOWS: OPERATING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2008 DECREASED BY $295.3 MILLION TO $182.2 MILLION AS COMPARED TO 2007. THE DECREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO:  THE OCTOBER 3, 2008 PREPAYMENT OF OUR ROYALTY OBLIGATION UNDER THE JUNE 7, 2001 5-AZACYTIDINE LICENSE IN FULL FOR $425.0 MILLION,  TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND  PARTLY OFFSET BY AN EXPANSION OF OUR OPERATIONS.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2008 DECREASED BY $467.9 MILLION TO $522.2 MILLION AS COMPARED TO 2007. THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO:  NET PROCEEDS FROM NET SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE OF $312.1 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO NET PURCHASES OF $893.3 MILLION IN 2007 AND  OFFSET BY THE $746.8 MILLION OF CASH PAID TO ACQUIRE PHARMION. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES MADE IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006 RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE EXPANSION OF OUR MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES, UPGRADES TO OUR FACILITIES, AS WELL AS SPENDING ON COMPUTER AND LABORATORY EQUIPMENT TO ACCOMMODATE OUR BUSINESS GROWTH. IN 2008, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ALSO INCLUDED THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING THE ORACLE ENTERPRISE BUSINESS SUITE, OR EBS. IN 2007, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ALSO INCLUDED THE COST OF BUILDING OUR INTERNATIONAL HEADQUARTERS IN BOUDRY, SWITZERLAND AND COMPUTER EQUIPMENT.

FOR 2009, WE ARE FORECASTING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE RANGE OF APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION TO $70 MILLION COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $77.4 MILLION IN 2008, AND WE EXPECT TO FUND THIS WITH OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS. FINANCING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR 2008 DECREASED BY $6.1 MILLION TO $281.6 MILLION AS COMPARED TO 2007. THE DECREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO:  A DECREASE IN THE PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF COMMON STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS  PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE TAX BENEFIT FROM SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. 48 TABLE OF CONTENTS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND WORKING CAPITAL: WORKING CAPITAL AND CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (1) INCLUDES CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET OF ALLOWANCES, INVENTORY AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, LESS ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES, INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES.

ALL LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND ALL INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE. WE DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. THE DECREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NET PAYMENT OF $746.8 MILLION RELATING TO THE PHARMION ACQUISITION AND THE OCTOBER 3, 2008 PREPAYMENT OF OUR ROYALTY OBLIGATION UNDER THE JUNE 7, 2001 5-AZACYTIDINE LICENSE IN FULL FOR $425.0 MILLION, WHICH WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY INCREASED CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET INCREASED BY $145.0 MILLION TO $312.2 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PARTLY DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF RECEIVABLES RELATED TO SALES OF VIDAZA® AND THALOMID®, WHICH WERE OBTAINED FROM THE PHARMION ACQUISITION AND AN INCREASE IN SALES OF REVLIMID®. DAYS OF SALES OUTSTANDING, OR DSO, IN 2008 AMOUNTED TO 42 DAYS COMPARED TO 41 DAYS IN 2007. THE INCREASE IN DSO REFLECTS INCREASED INTERNATIONAL SALES FOR WHICH COLLECTION PERIODS ARE LONGER THAN FOR U.S. SALES. INVENTORY: INVENTORY IN 2008 TOTALED $100.2 MILLION AND INCREASED BY $51.1 MILLION COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE ADDITION OF VIDAZA® INVENTORY AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF THALOMID® INVENTORY IN ANTICIPATION OF LAUNCHES IN EUROPEAN MARKETS. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS: OTHER CURRENT ASSETS IN 2008 TOTALED $190.4 MILLION AND INCREASED BY $81.8 MILLION COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN SALES, USE AND VALUE-ADDED TAXES AS A RESULT OF OUR CONTINUED INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION, IN ADDITION TO THE CURRENT PORTION OF THE PREPAID VIDAZA® ROYALTY OBLIGATION. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES: ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES TOTALED $474.7 MILLION IN 2008 AND INCREASED $250.9 MILLION COMPARED TO 2007. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $27.6 MILLION REMAINING BALANCE IN RESTRUCTURING RESERVES RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF PHARMION, THE INCLUSION OF A NET LIABILITY OF $59.1 MILLION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD HEDGING CONTRACTS, A $35.4 MILLION INCREASE IN CLINICAL RELATED SPENDING, A $34.5 MILLION INCREASE IN COMPENSATION RELATED LIABILITIES AND AN INCREASE IN SALES RETURN, REBATE AND CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS OF $17.2 MILLION.

MANUFACTURING FACILITY NOTE PAYABLE: IN DECEMBER 2006, WE PURCHASED AN ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENT, OR API, MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FROM SIEGFRIED LOCATED IN ZOFINGEN, SWITZERLAND. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NOTE PAYABLE TO SIEGFRIED APPROXIMATED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTE OF $26.0 MILLION. ASSUMING OTHER FACTORS ARE HELD CONSTANT, AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES GENERALLY WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NOTE. THE NOTE IS DENOMINATED IN SWISS FRANCS AND ITS FAIR VALUE WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR / SWISS FRANC EXCHANGE RATE. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTE REFLECTS THE U.S. DOLLAR / SWISS FRANC EXCHANGE RATE AND SWISS INTEREST RATES.

WE DO NOT EXPECT A SETTLEMENT OF THE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS CLASSIFIED AS NON-CURRENT WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS: WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT INCLUDE THE FUNDING OF CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE MILESTONE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED DEVELOPMENTAL, REGULATORY AND /OR COMMERCIAL TARGETS. OUR OBLIGATION TO FUND THESE EFFORTS IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROGRAMS AND/OR THE LACK OF ANY ADVERSE EVENTS WHICH COULD CAUSE THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE PROGRAMS. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND ACCORDINGLY NO AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED ON OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TABLE. 50 TABLE OF CONTENTS NEW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD, OR FASB, ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, OR SFAS, NO. 157, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, OR SFAS 157, WHICH ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE FASB PARTIALLY DEFERRED THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SFAS 157 FOR NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A NONRECURRING BASIS TO FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2008. THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED ON A RECURRING BASIS WAS JANUARY 1, 2008. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT OUR ADOPTION OF SFAS 157 ON JANUARY 1, 2008 FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SEE NOTE 5 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR EXPANDED DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY SFAS 157. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 157 RELATED TO NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 159, THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, OR SFAS 159, WHICH PROVIDES COMPANIES WITH AN OPTION TO REPORT SELECTED FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. SFAS 159 ESTABLISHES PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS DESIGNED TO FACILITATE COMPARISONS BETWEEN COMPANIES THAT CHOOSE DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTES FOR SIMILAR TYPES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND HIGHLIGHTS THE EFFECT OF A COMPANYS CHOICE TO USE FAIR VALUE ON ITS EARNINGS. IT ALSO REQUIRES A COMPANY TO DISPLAY THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR WHICH IT HAS CHOSEN TO USE FAIR VALUE ON THE FACE OF THE BALANCE SHEET. SFAS 159 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2008 AND DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS WE DID NOT CHOOSE TO USE THE FAIR VALUE OPTION. IN JUNE 2007, THE FASB RATIFIED EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE, OR EITF, ISSUE NO. 07-3, ACCOUNTING FOR NON-REFUNDABLE ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR GOODS OR SERVICES TO BE USED IN FUTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, OR EITF 07-3, WHICH PROVIDES THAT NON-REFUNDABLE ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE DEFERRED AND CAPITALIZED UNTIL THE RELATED GOODS ARE DELIVERED OR THE RELATED SERVICES ARE PERFORMED.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB RATIFIED EITF ISSUE NO. 07-1, ACCOUNTING FOR COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OR EITF 07-1, WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON HOW THE PARTIES TO A COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENT SHOULD ACCOUNT FOR COSTS INCURRED AND REVENUE GENERATED ON SALES TO THIRD PARTIES, HOW SHARING PAYMENTS PURSUANT TO A COLLABORATION AGREEMENT SHOULD BE PRESENTED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT AND CERTAIN RELATED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. EITF 07-1 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 ON A RETROSPECTIVE BASIS. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION OF EITF 07-1 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 141R, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, OR SFAS 141R, WHICH REPLACES FASB STATEMENT NO. 141, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, AND REQUIRES AN ACQUIRER TO RECOGNIZE THE ASSETS ACQUIRED, THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND ANY NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE ACQUIREE AT THE ACQUISITION DATE, MEASURED AT THEIR FAIR VALUES AS OF THAT DATE, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS SPECIFIED IN SFAS 141R.

SFAS 141R DOES NOT PERMIT THIS ACCOUNTING AND GENERALLY WILL REQUIRE ANY SUCH CHANGES TO BE RECORDED IN CURRENT PERIOD INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THUS, AFTER SFAS 141R IS ADOPTED, ALL CHANGES TO VALUATION ALLOWANCES AND LIABILITIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS FROM AN ACQUISITION (WHETHER THE COMBINATION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SFAS 141 OR SFAS 141R) MUST BE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT PERIOD INCOME TAX EXPENSE. SFAS 141R IS EFFECTIVE PROSPECTIVELY TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS FOR WHICH THE ACQUISITION DATE IS ON OR AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORTING PERIOD BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008. SFAS 141R IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 AND WE WILL ACCOUNT FOR FUTURE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS PROVISIONS, IN ADDITION TO ADOPTING ITS PROVISIONS RELATED TO POST-ACQUISITION ADJUSTMENTS TO TAXES. IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 160, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AN AMENDMENT OF ARB NO. 51, OR SFAS 160, WHICH CHANGES THE ACCOUNTING FOR AND REPORTING OF NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS (FORMERLY KNOWN AS MINORITY INTERESTS) IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IT IS EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR FISCAL YEARS AND INTERIM PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PROHIBITED.

IN MARCH 2008, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 161, DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, OR SFAS 161, WHICH IS INTENDED TO IMPROVE FINANCIAL REPORTING ABOUT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES BY REQUIRING ENHANCED DISCLOSURES TO ENABLE INVESTORS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR EFFECTS ON AN ENTITYS FINANCIAL POSITION, FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND CASH FLOWS. IT IS EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR FISCAL YEARS AND INTERIM PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2008, WITH EARLY ADOPTION ENCOURAGED. SFAS 161 IS EFFECTIVE FOR US DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 AND WE WILL ADOPT THE DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF MARCH 31, 2009. IN APRIL 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION, OR FSP, NO. FAS 142-3, DETERMINATION OF THE USEFUL LIFE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, OR FSP FAS 142-3.

APB 14-1, ACCOUNTING FOR CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT MAY BE SETTLED IN CASH UPON CONVERSION (INCLUDING PARTIAL CASH SETTLEMENT), OR FSP APB 14-1, WHICH REQUIRES SEPARATE ACCOUNTING FOR THE DEBT AND EQUITY COMPONENTS OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT ISSUANCES THAT HAVE A CASH SETTLEMENT FEATURE PERMITTING SETTLEMENT PARTIALLY OR FULLY IN CASH UPON CONVERSION. A COMPONENT OF SUCH DEBT ISSUANCES REPRESENTATIVE OF THE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONVERSION FEATURE AT INCEPTION SHOULD BE BIFURCATED AND RECORDED TO EQUITY, WITH THE RESULTING DEBT DISCOUNT AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE IN A MANNER THAT REFLECTS THE ISSUERS NONCONVERTIBLE, UNSECURED DEBT BORROWING RATE. THE REQUIREMENTS FOR SEPARATE ACCOUNTING MUST BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY TO PREVIOUSLY ISSUED CONVERTIBLE DEBT ISSUANCES AS WELL AS PROSPECTIVELY TO NEWLY ISSUED CONVERTIBLE DEBT ISSUANCES, NEGATIVELY AFFECTING BOTH NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE, IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008. SINCE OUR PAST CONVERTIBLE DEBT ISSUANCE DID NOT INCLUDE A CASH SETTLEMENT FEATURE, THE ADOPTION OF FSP APB 14-1 WILL NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN JUNE 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FSP EITF NO. 03-6-1, DETERMINING WHETHER INSTRUMENTS GRANTED IN SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS ARE PARTICIPATING SECURITIES, OR FSP EITF 03-6-1. THE FSP ADDRESSES WHETHER INSTRUMENTS GRANTED IN SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS ARE PARTICIPATING SECURITIES PRIOR TO VESTING AND THEREFORE NEED TO BE INCLUDED IN THE EARNINGS ALLOCATION IN CALCULATING EARNINGS PER SHARE UNDER THE TWO-CLASS METHOD DESCRIBED IN SFAS NO. 128, EARNINGS PER SHARE. THE FSP REQUIRES COMPANIES TO TREAT UNVESTED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS THAT HAVE NON-FORFEITABLE RIGHTS TO DIVIDENDS OR DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS AS A SEPARATE CLASS OF SECURITIES IN CALCULATING EARNINGS PER SHARE. THE FSP IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PROHIBITED. SINCE OUR PAST SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS DID NOT INCLUDE NON-FORFEITABLE RIGHTS TO DIVIDENDS OR DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS, THE ADOPTION OF FSP EITF 03-6-1 WILL NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. 52 TABLE OF CONTENTS IN OCTOBER 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FSP NO. FAS 157-3, DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL ASSET WHEN THE MARKET FOR THAT ASSET IS NOT ACTIVE, OR FSP FAS 157-3. THE FSP CLARIFIES THE APPLICATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 157 IN A MARKET THAT IS NOT ACTIVE AND PROVIDES AN EXAMPLE TO ILLUSTRATE KEY CONSIDERATIONS IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL ASSET WHEN THE MARKET FOR THAT FINANCIAL ASSET IS NOT ACTIVE. THE FSP WAS EFFECTIVE UPON ISSUANCE, INCLUDING PRIOR PERIODS FOR WHICH FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN ISSUED AND DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FASB RATIFIED EITF ISSUE NO. 08-6, EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS, OR EITF 08-6, WHICH CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS AND IMPAIRMENT CONSIDERATIONS INVOLVING EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS. EITF 08-6 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PROHIBITED. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION OF EITF 08-6 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FASB RATIFIED EITF ISSUE NO. 08-7, ACCOUNTING FOR DEFENSIVE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, OR EITF 08-7, WHICH CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS WHICH AN ACQUIRER DOES NOT INTEND TO ACTIVELY USE BUT INTENDS TO HOLD TO PREVENT ITS COMPETITORS FROM OBTAINING ACCESS TO THEM. EITF 08-7 REQUIRES AN ACQUIRER IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION TO ACCOUNT FOR A DEFENSIVE INTANGIBLE ASSET AS A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING WHICH SHOULD BE AMORTIZED TO EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD THE ASSET DIMINISHES IN VALUE. EITF 08-7 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PROHIBITED. IT IS EFFECTIVE PROSPECTIVELY FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED ON OR AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORTING PERIOD BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008. EITF 08-7 IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 AND WE WILL ACCOUNT FOR DEFENSIVE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN FUTURE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS PROVISIONS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IS ONE THAT IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENTS MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL: REVENUE RECOGNITION ON COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS: WE HAVE FORMED COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS AND ALLIANCES WITH SEVERAL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE IN THE FORM OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS. THE AGREEMENTS CALL FOR NON-REFUNDABLE UPFRONT PAYMENTS, MILESTONE PAYMENTS ON ACHIEVING SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE EVENTS AND IN SOME CASES ONGOING RESEARCH FUNDING. THE AGREEMENTS ALSO CONTEMPLATE ROYALTY PAYMENTS ON SALES IF AND WHEN THE COMPOUNDS RECEIVE REGULATORY MARKETING APPROVAL. OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES FOR ALL NON-REFUNDABLE UPFRONT LICENSE FEES AND MILESTONE ARRANGEMENTS ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE PROVIDED IN THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONS STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN, OR SAB, NO. 101, REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS AMENDED BY SAB NO. 104, REVENUE RECOGNITION, OR SAB 104. IN ADDITION, WE FOLLOW THE PROVISIONS OF EITF ISSUE NO. 00-21, REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES, OR EITF 00-21, FOR MULTIPLE ELEMENT REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO OR MATERIALLY AMENDED AFTER JUNE 30, 2003. EITF 00-21 PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON HOW TO DETERMINE WHEN AN ARRANGEMENT THAT INVOLVES MULTIPLE REVENUE-GENERATING ACTIVITIES OR DELIVERABLES SHOULD BE DIVIDED INTO SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION PURPOSES AND, IF THIS DIVISION IS REQUIRED, HOW THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE ALLOCATED AMONG THE SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING. IF THE DELIVERABLES IN A REVENUE ARRANGEMENT CONSTITUTE SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING ACCORDING TO THE EITFS SEPARATION CRITERIA, THE REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY MUST BE DETERMINED FOR EACH IDENTIFIED UNIT. IF THE ARRANGEMENT IS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, THE REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY MUST BE DETERMINED FOR THE ENTIRE ARRANGEMENT. 53 TABLE OF CONTENTS UNDER ARRANGEMENTS WHERE THE LICENSE FEES AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, NON-REFUNDABLE UPFRONT LICENSE FEES ARE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE EXPECTED TERM OF OUR CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. REVENUES FROM THE ACHIEVEMENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES, IF DEEMED SUBSTANTIVE, ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE MILESTONES ARE ACHIEVED, AND THE MILESTONE PAYMENTS ARE DUE AND COLLECTIBLE. MILESTONES ARE CONSIDERED SUBSTANTIVE IF ALL OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS ARE MET: (1) THE MILESTONE IS NON-REFUNDABLE; (2) ACHIEVEMENT OF THE MILESTONE WAS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED AT THE INCEPTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT; (3) SUBSTANTIVE EFFORT IS INVOLVED TO ACHIEVE THE MILESTONE; AND (4) THE AMOUNT OF THE MILESTONE APPEARS REASONABLE IN RELATION TO THE EFFORT EXPENDED, THE OTHER MILESTONES IN THE ARRANGEMENT AND THE RELATED RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ACHIEVEMENT OF THE MILESTONE. IF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET, WE WOULD RECOGNIZE A PROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF THE MILESTONE PAYMENT UPON RECEIPT AS REVENUE THAT CORRELATES TO WORK ALREADY PERFORMED AND THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE MILESTONE PAYMENT WILL BE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE AS WE COMPLETE OUR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS, GOVERNMENT REBATES AND CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES: OUR GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS, GOVERNMENT REBATES AND CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES ARE BASED ON OUR SALES AND/OR ESTIMATES OF THIRD-PARTY INVENTORIES. OUR DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS IN CERTAIN MARKETS AND OUR ACCRUAL METHODOLOGIES ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW. THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER OUR S.T.E.P.S.® DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM. AMONG OTHER THINGS, S.T.E.P.S.®, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION AND RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM, REQUIRES PRESCRIBERS, PATIENTS AND DISPENSING PHARMACIES TO PARTICIPATE IN A REGISTRY AND PROHIBITS THE FILLING OF A THALOMID® ORDER UNLESS THE PHYSICIAN, PATIENT AND PHARMACY HAVE ALL OBTAINED AN APPROPRIATE AUTHORIZATION NUMBER. AUTOMATIC REFILLS ARE NOT PERMITTED UNDER THE PROGRAM. EACH PRESCRIPTION MAY NOT EXCEED A 28-DAY SUPPLY AND A NEW PRESCRIPTION IS REQUIRED WITH EACH ORDER. ALTHOUGH WE INVOICE THROUGH TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL WHOLESALERS, ALL THALOMID® ORDERS ARE DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY OVERNIGHT. WHOLESALER STOCKING OF THIS PRODUCT IS PROHIBITED. IN ADDITION, WE DO NOT OFFER COMMERCIAL DISCOUNTS ON OUR PRODUCTS TO PHARMACIES OR HOSPITALS AND, THEREFORE, HAVE NO COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE USE OF REVLIMID®, AND IS SOLD PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL. THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM INCLUDES MOST OF THE SAME ATTRIBUTES OF THE S.T.E.P.S.® PROGRAM MENTIONED ABOVE. VIDAZA® IS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN. VIDAZA® IS NOT SUBJECTED TO S.T.E.P.S.® OR REVASSIST® DISTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS. IT MAY BE STOCKED BY MULTIPLE WHOLESALERS AND PRESCRIBED BY PHYSICIANS WITHOUT OUR PREAUTHORIZATION. 54 TABLE OF CONTENTS ALKERAN® IS DISTRIBUTED IN A SIMILAR FASHION AS VIDAZA®. SALES RETURNS: WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DOES NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. WE ANALYZE HISTORIC RETURNS EXPERIENCE ON CLOSED LOTS AND HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES ON OPEN LOTS. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT, ALTHOUGH THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY/HOSPITAL MAY STOCK THALOMID®. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED SPECIALTY PHARMACIES LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY TO DATE. VIDAZA® AND ALKERAN® ARE SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES TO PHARMACEUTICAL WHOLESALERS, WHO IN TURN DISTRIBUTE PRODUCT TO PHYSICIANS, RETAIL PHARMACIES, HOSPITALS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS. EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS PRICE CHANGES FROM COMPETITORS AND INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW AND GENERIC COMPETING PRODUCTS COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR SALES RETURNS. OUR SALES RETURNS HAVE NOT BEEN IMPACTED THUS FAR BY SUCH EXTERNAL FACTORS; HOWEVER, WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR SUCH FACTORS. GOVERNMENT REBATES: GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE AMOUNT FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. CERTAIN FOREIGN MARKETS HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID AND ACCORDINGLY THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES. CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES: CHARGEBACKS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. ON JANUARY 28, 2008, THE FISCAL YEAR 2008 NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT WAS ENACTED, WHICH EXPANDS TRICARE TO INCLUDE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS DISPENSED BY TRICARE RETAIL NETWORK PHARMACIES. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS REFLECT THIS PROGRAM EXPANSION AND ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA. OTHER GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD SALES DISCOUNTS ACCRUALS BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. INCOME TAXES: WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. WE PROVIDE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 48 AND FSP FIN 48-1, DEFINITION OF SETTLEMENT IN FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48, OR FSP FIN 48-1, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007. FIN 48 CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTERPRISES FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 109 AND PRESCRIBES A RECOGNITION THRESHOLD AND MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF A TAX POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. FIN 48 ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION, CLASSIFICATION, INTEREST AND PENALTIES, ACCOUNTING IN INTERIM PERIODS, DISCLOSURE AND TRANSITION. WE HAD NO CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO THE ADOPTION. WE ACCOUNT FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS PART OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THESE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATE PRIMARILY TO ISSUES COMMON AMONG MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE APPLY A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES WHICH INCLUDE STUDIES PERFORMED BY INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS, ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY AND SUBJECT EXPERTS, EVALUATION OF PUBLIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. WE PROVIDE ESTIMATES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. IF OUR ESTIMATES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ACTUAL OUTCOMES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED. 55 TABLE OF CONTENTS WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE A PORTION WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR RECENT CUMULATIVE EARNINGS EXPERIENCE BY TAXING JURISDICTION, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, CARRYFORWARD PERIODS AVAILABLE TO US FOR TAX REPORTING PURPOSES, VARIOUS INCOME TAX STRATEGIES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT AND, TO THE EXTENT FUTURE EXPECTATIONS CHANGE, WE WOULD HAVE TO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THAT TIME. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION: WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS, NO. 123R, SHARE-BASED PAYMENT, OR SFAS 123R, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, WHICH REQUIRES THAT ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT THEIR FAIR VALUES. WE ADOPTED SFAS 123R USING THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION METHOD UNDER WHICH THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS 123R APPLY TO NEW AWARDS AND TO AWARDS MODIFIED, REPURCHASED OR CANCELLED AFTER THE ADOPTION DATE. WE USE THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS ON THE DATE OF GRANT WHICH REQUIRES CERTAIN ESTIMATES TO BE MADE BY MANAGEMENT INCLUDING THE EXPECTED FORFEITURE RATE AND EXPECTED TERM OF THE OPTIONS. MANAGEMENT ALSO MAKES DECISIONS REGARDING THE METHOD OF CALCULATING THE EXPECTED VOLATILITIES AND THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE USED IN THE MODEL. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET THAT AFFECT THESE ESTIMATES COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE RESULTING COMPENSATION COST. ADDITIONALLY, COMPENSATION COST FOR THE PORTION OF AWARDS FOR WHICH THE REQUISITE SERVICE HAS NOT BEEN RENDERED THAT ARE OUTSTANDING AS OF THE ADOPTION DATE IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE REMAINING SERVICE PERIOD AFTER THE ADOPTION DATE (FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REFER TO NOTE 15 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K). OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES: A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF ANY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY BELOW ITS COST THAT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN CARRYING AMOUNT TO FAIR VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT IS CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AND A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE SECURITY ESTABLISHED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INCLUDE: SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE ISSUERS EARNINGS PERFORMANCE, CREDIT RATING, ASSET QUALITY, BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE ISSUER OPERATES, LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW OUR COST, OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE SECURITY AND OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD DIFFER FROM OUR ASSESSMENT. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES: SFAS NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, OR SFAS 133, AS AMENDED, REQUIRES THAT ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS BE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN CURRENT EARNINGS OR OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), DEPENDING ON WHETHER A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION AND, IF IT IS, THE TYPE OF HEDGING TRANSACTION. FOR A DERIVATIVE TO QUALIFY AS A HEDGE AT INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE HEDGED PERIOD, WE FORMALLY DOCUMENT THE NATURE AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEM. WE ASSESS, BOTH AT INCEPTION AND ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING TRANSACTIONS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING THE CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS. WE ASSESS HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND RECORD THE GAIN OR LOSS RELATED TO THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IF ANY, TO CURRENT EARNINGS. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER PROBABLE OF OCCURRING, WE DISCONTINUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING AND ANY RELATED UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE NOT DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION, TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. THE USE OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE EXPOSURE OF THESE RISKS WITH THE INTENT TO REDUCE OUR RISK OR COST. WE DO NOT USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR SPECULATIVE TRADING PURPOSES AND ARE NOT A PARTY TO LEVERAGED DERIVATIVES. 56 TABLE OF CONTENTS INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATED COMPANIES: OUR INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATED COMPANIES IS COMPRISED OF INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND INVESTMENT FUNDS WHICH PRIMARILY INVEST IN COMPANIES CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN LIFE SCIENCES SUCH AS BIOTECHNOLOGY, PHARMACEUTICALS, MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY, DEVICES, DIAGNOSTICS AND HEALTH AND WELLNESS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET WERE TO EXCEED ITS FAIR VALUE, WE WOULD REVIEW IT TO DETERMINE IF AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT HAS BEEN SUSTAINED. IF THE INVESTMENT IS DETERMINED TO HAVE SUSTAINED AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE, THE INVESTMENT WOULD BE WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE. SUCH AN EVALUATION IS JUDGMENTAL AND DEPENDENT ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. FACTORS THAT WE CONSIDER IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE HAS OCCURRED INCLUDE: THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITY IN RELATION TO ITS COST BASIS, THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT THE MARKET VALUE IS BELOW COST, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE INVESTEE AND OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. WE EVALUATE INFORMATION THAT WE ARE AWARE OF IN ADDITION TO QUOTED MARKET PRICES, IF ANY, IN DETERMINING IF AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE EXISTS. ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, OR LTIP, DESIGNED TO PROVIDE KEY OFFICERS AND EXECUTIVES WITH PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES CONTINGENT UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED CORPORATE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES COVERING A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWO THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLES RUNNING CONCURRENTLY ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2010. WE ALSO ANTICIPATE THE APPROVAL OF A NEW 3-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLE ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2011 TO BE ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AT THE END OF FEBRUARY 2009. PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR EACH LTIP ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE THREE-YEAR CYCLE: 25% ON EARNINGS PER SHARE, 25% ON NET INCOME AND 50% ON TOTAL REVENUE, AS DEFINED. PAYOUTS MAY BE IN THE RANGE OF 0% TO 200% OF THE PARTICIPANTS SALARY FOR THE PLANS. AWARDS ARE PAYABLE IN CASH OR, AT OUR DISCRETION, IN OUR COMMON STOCK BASED UPON OUR STOCK PRICE AT THE PAYOUT DATE. WE ACCRUE THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE LIABILITY OVER EACH THREE-YEAR CYCLE. PRIOR TO THE END OF A THREE-YEAR CYCLE, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT DURING THE CYCLE. UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT EQUAL TO THEIR TARGET AWARD, OR, IF HIGHER, AN AWARD BASED ON ACTUAL PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL. ACCRUALS RECORDED FOR THE LTIP ENTAIL MAKING CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE EARNINGS PER SHARE, NET INCOME AND REVENUES, AS DEFINED; THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED. ACCRUALS FOR THE LTIP ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND REVISED ACCORDINGLY SO THAT THE LIABILITY RECORDED REFLECTS UPDATED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PAYOUTS. IN ESTIMATING THE ACCRUALS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DATE FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, EXPECTED RESULTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, OPERATING TRENDS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICING AND COMPETITION. VALUATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: WE HAVE ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY THROUGH BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. WHEN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, ARE ACQUIRED WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS ARE TYPICALLY USED IN THESE VALUATIONS, AND THE MODELS REQUIRE THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:  PROJECTING REGULATORY APPROVALS,  ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM PRODUCT SALES RESULTING FROM COMPLETED PRODUCTS AND IN-PROCESS PROJECTS AND  DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES AND PROBABILITY RATES. 57 TABLE OF CONTENTS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS: WE ACCOUNT FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 141, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, OR SFAS 141, (REPLACED BY SFAS 141R FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS CONSUMMATED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2009) AND SFAS 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, OR SFAS 142. SFAS 141 REQUIRES THAT THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING BE USED FOR ALL BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. IT SPECIFIES THE CRITERIA WHICH INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION MUST MEET IN ORDER TO BE RECOGNIZED AND REPORTED APART FROM GOODWILL. SFAS 142 REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS DETERMINED TO HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY AND WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR THAT INDICATE IMPAIRMENT MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED. OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. SFAS 142 REQUIRES THAT INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH FINITE USEFUL LIVES BE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR RESPECTIVE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 144. SFAS 144 REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT LONG-LIVED ASSETS BE MEASURED AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING AMOUNT OR FAIR VALUE, LESS COST TO SELL. WE REVIEW OUR INTANGIBLES WITH DETERMINABLE LIVES AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. OUR JUDGMENT REGARDING THE EXISTENCE OF IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS IS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS, CHANGES IN THE MANNER OF OUR USE OF THE ACQUIRED ASSETS OR OUR OVERALL BUSINESS STRATEGY, AND MARKET AND ECONOMIC TRENDS. IN THE FUTURE, EVENTS COULD CAUSE US TO CONCLUDE THAT IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS EXIST AND THAT CERTAIN OTHER INTANGIBLES WITH DETERMINABLE LIVES AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE IMPAIRED WHICH MAY RESULT IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES FORWARD-LOOKING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RISK OF LOSS IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES, CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE EARNINGS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, OUR MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS CONSISTED OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, OUR NOTE PAYABLE AND CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE CONSISTED OF U.S. TREASURY FIXED RATE SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY FIXED RATE SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED FIXED RATE SECURITIES, FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION, OR FDIC, GUARANTEED FIXED RATE CORPORATE DEBT, PRIVATE CASH FUND SHARES AND A MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITY. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES INCLUDE GENERAL UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS OF THE ISSUING AGENCY, INCLUDING ISSUES FROM THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK, OR FHLB, FANNIE MAE, AND FREDDIE MAC. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES INCLUDE FIXED RATE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC AND THE GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, OR GNMA. FDIC GUARANTEED CORPORATE DEBT INCLUDES OBLIGATIONS OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA SET FORTH UNDER THE TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY GUARANTY PROGRAM, OR TLGP, AND IS UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY THE FDIC. 58 TABLE OF CONTENTS FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC, FHLB AND GNMA ARE REGULATED BY THE RECENTLY ESTABLISHED FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY, OR FHFA. ON SEPTEMBER 7, 2008, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE FHFA AND THE U.S. TREASURY, ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS PLACING BOTH FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC INTO CONSERVATORSHIP, WITH THE FHFA ASSUMING THEIR DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS. ON THAT SAME DAY, THE U.S. TREASURY ESTABLISHED A NEW SECURED LENDING CREDIT FACILITY AVAILABLE TO FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC, WHICH IS INTENDED TO SERVE AS AN ULTIMATE LIQUIDITY BACKSTOP. THIS ACTION, IN ESSENCE, IMPLEMENTED THE TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY BACKSTOP AUTHORITY GRANTED TO THE U.S. TREASURY BY CONGRESS IN JULY 2008, AND WILL BE AVAILABLE UNTIL DECEMBER 2009. THESE MEASURES WERE TAKEN WITH THE GOAL OF PRESERVING THE VALUE OF THE DEBT AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THESE U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCIES AS WELL AS TO ENSURE THAT THESE AGENCIES HAVE FUTURE ACCESS TO CAPITAL. THE U.S. TREASURY AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK, OR FED, CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCIES. WORKING WITH THE CONGRESS AND THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT, THE U.S. TREASURY AND THE FED HAVE PLEDGED TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCIES. WE HAVE NOT RECORDED ANY IMPAIRMENTS AGAINST OUR HOLDINGS IN THESE SECURITIES. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, FAIR VALUES AND RELATED WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE WERE AS FOLLOWS: NOTE PAYABLE: IN DECEMBER 2006, WE PURCHASED AN ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENT, OR API, MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FROM SIEGFRIED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NOTE PAYABLE TO SIEGFRIED APPROXIMATED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTE OF $26.0 MILLION (SEE NOTE 10 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT). ASSUMING OTHER FACTORS ARE HELD CONSTANT, AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES GENERALLY WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NOTE. THE NOTE IS DENOMINATED IN SWISS FRANCS AND ITS FAIR VALUE WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR / SWISS FRANC EXCHANGE RATE. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTE REFLECTS THE U.S. DOLLAR / SWISS FRANC EXCHANGE RATE AND SWISS INTEREST RATES. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS: WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. 59 TABLE OF CONTENTS WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PROTECT AGAINST CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED EXPENSES INCURRED BY SUBSIDIARIES IN EUROPE. WE ALSO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PROTECT AGAINST CHANGES IN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT SALES IN EUROPE. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AND ACCORDINGLY, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THEM ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS. ANY INEFFECTIVENESS ON THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IS REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 HAD AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $704.2 MILLION AND HAD SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 24 MONTHS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE CONTRACTS WAS A NET LIABILITY OF $48.4 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND IS REFLECTED IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OF $1.6 MILLION AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES OF $50.0 MILLION. WE ALSO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN RECOGNIZED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE HAD FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING DENOMINATED IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES, INCLUDING EUROS, SWISS FRANCS, BRITISH POUNDS, JAPANESE YEN AND U.S. DOLLARS, WITH AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $56.6 MILLION AND EXPIRING WITHIN 12 MONTHS. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE ECONOMIC HEDGES OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE REMEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEM. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WAS A NET LIABILITY OF $9.1 MILLION AND IS INCLUDED IN OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES. ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, WE BELIEVE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS A REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES. ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2008 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WOULD CHANGE BY APPROXIMATELY $75.8 MILLION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS EITHER HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES OR HEDGE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE ENTITIES FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE EITHER REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS OR REMEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEM. 60 TABLE OF CONTENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY CELGENE CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY WE OR OUR) IS A GLOBAL BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN THE DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF INNOVATIVE THERAPIES DESIGNED TO TREAT CANCER AND IMMUNE-INFLAMMATORY RELATED DISEASES. IN MARCH 2008, WE ACQUIRED PHARMION CORPORATION TO ENHANCE OUR PORTFOLIO OF THERAPIES FOR PATIENTS WITH LIFE-THREATENING ILLNESSES WORLDWIDE WITH THE ADDITION OF PHARMIONS MARKETED PRODUCTS, AND SEVERAL PRODUCTS IN DEVELOPMENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF HEMATOLOGICAL AND SOLID TUMOR CANCERS. BY COMBINING THIS NEW PRODUCT PORTFOLIO WITH OUR EXISTING OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL CAPABILITIES, WE ENLARGED OUR GLOBAL MARKET SHARE THROUGH INCREASED PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND EXPANDED CLINICAL, REGULATORY AND COMMERCIAL CAPABILITIES. OUR PRIMARY COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS INCLUDE REVLIMID®, THALOMID® AND VIDAZA®. REVLIMID® IS AN ORAL IMMUNOMODULATORY DRUG MARKETED FOR MULTIPLE MYELOMA PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY AND FOR TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH TRANSFUSION-DEPENDENT ANEMIA DUE TO LOW- OR INTERMEDIATE-1-RISK MDS ASSOCIATED WITH A DELETION 5Q CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITY WITH OR WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITIES. THALOMID® IS MARKETED FOR PATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND FOR THE ACUTE TREATMENT OF THE CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF MODERATE TO SEVERE ENL, AN INFLAMMATORY COMPLICATION OF LEPROSY. VIDAZA® IS A PYRIMIDINE NUCLEOSIDE ANALOG THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF DNA HYPERMETHYLATION AND PROMOTE SUBSEQUENT GENE RE-EXPRESSION. VIDAZA® WAS LICENSED FROM PHARMACIA & UPJOHN, NOW PART OF PFIZER, AND IS MARKETED FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALL SUBTYPES OF MDS. VIDAZA® WAS GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION BY THE FDA FOR THE TREATMENT OF MDS IN THE UNITED STATES THROUGH MAY 2011. IN DECEMBER 2008, VIDAZA® WAS GRANTED FULL MARKETING AUTHORIZATION BY THE EC FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR HAEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION WITH INTERMEDIATE-2 AND HIGH-RISK MDS ACCORDING TO THE IPSS OR CMML WITH 10-29 PERCENT MARROW BLASTS WITHOUT MYELOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER, OR AML WITH 20-30 PERCENT BLASTS AND MULTI-LINEAGE DYSPLASIA, ACCORDING TO WHO CLASSIFICATION. WE CONTINUE TO INVEST SUBSTANTIALLY IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND THE DRUG CANDIDATES IN OUR PIPELINE ARE AT VARIOUS STAGES OF PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT. THESE CANDIDATES INCLUDE OUR IMIDS® COMPOUNDS, WHICH ARE A CLASS OF COMPOUNDS PROPRIETARY TO US AND HAVING CERTAIN IMMUNOMODULATORY AND OTHER BIOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT PROPERTIES IN ADDITION TO OUR LEADING ORAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS AND CELL PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PRIMARY COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS AND DEPTH OF OUR PRODUCT PIPELINE PROVIDE THE CATALYSTS FOR FUTURE GROWTH. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE REPORTED REVENUE OF $2.255 BILLION, A NET LOSS OF $1.534 BILLION AND A DILUTED LOSS PER SHARE OF $3.46. REVENUE INCREASED BY $849.0 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EXPANDED USE OF REVLIMID® AND THE ACQUISITION OF FORMER PHARMION PRODUCTS, INCLUDING VIDAZA® AND THALOMID® OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. THE NET LOSS AND LOSS PER SHARE AMOUNTS WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO IPR&D CHARGES AND AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO THE PHARMION ACQUISITION, IN ADDITION TO THE EXPENSING OF THE OCTOBER 3, 2008 ROYALTY OBLIGATION PAYMENT TO PFIZER THAT RELATED TO THE UNAPPROVED FORMS OF VIDAZA®. 37 TABLE OF CONTENTS FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING DEMAND FOR OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS, REGULATORY APPROVALS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES, THE TIMING AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS LAUNCHED BY US OR COMPETING COMPANIES, THE TIMING OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES, CHALLENGES TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL COSTS. SEE ALSO RISK FACTORS CONTAINED IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. SOME OF THE MORE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON INCLUDE: THE ABILITY OF OUR PRODUCTS TO SUCCESSFULLY PENETRATE AND EXPAND IN RELEVANT MARKETS: REVLIMID® WAS APPROVED BY THE FDA, THE EC, THE SWISSMEDIC, THE TGA, AND IN OCTOBER 2008 BY HEALTH CANADA FOR TREATMENT IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE FOR MULTIPLE MYELOMA PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY. IN ADDITION, REVLIMID® WAS APPROVED BY THE FDA AND THE CANADIAN THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS DIRECTORATE FOR TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH TRANSFUSION-DEPENDENT ANEMIA DUE TO LOW- OR INTERMEDIATE-1-RISK MDS, ASSOCIATED WITH A DELETION 5Q CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITY WITH OR WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITIES. WE DO NOT HAVE LONG-TERM DATA ON THE USE OF THE PRODUCT AND CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER REVLIMID® WILL CONTINUE TO GAIN THE ACCEPTANCE OF REGULATORS, PHYSICIANS, PATIENTS AND OTHER KEY OPINION LEADERS AS A RELATIVELY SAFE AND EFFECTIVE DRUG THAT HAS CERTAIN ADVANTAGES AS COMPARED TO EXISTING OR FUTURE THERAPIES. WE ARE ALSO SEEKING TO INTRODUCE REVLIMID® IN ADDITIONAL INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AS WELL AS OBTAINING APPROVALS FOR ADDITIONAL INDICATIONS BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY. A DELAY IN GAINING THE REQUISITE REGULATORY APPROVALS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR GROWTH PLANS. THALOMID® WAS APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR TREATMENT IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE FOR PATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND IS ALSO APPROVED FOR THE TREATMENT AND SUPPRESSION OF CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF ENL, AN INFLAMMATORY COMPLICATION OF LEPROSY. IN APRIL 2008, THE TGA APPROVED A SUPPLEMENTAL FILING GRANTING THALOMID® MARKETING APPROVAL FOR USE IN COMBINATION WITH MELPHALAN AND PREDNISONE FOR PATIENTS WITH UNTREATED MULTIPLE MYELOMA OR INELIGIBLE FOR HIGH DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY AND ALSO GRANTED THALOMID® MARKETING APPROVAL IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE FOR INDUCTION THERAPY PRIOR TO HIGH DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY WITH AUTOLOGOUS STEM CELL RESCUE, FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH UNTREATED MULTIPLE MYELOMA. IN ADDITION, IN APRIL 2008, THALOMID® WAS GRANTED FULL MARKETING AUTHORIZATION BY THE EC FOR USE IN COMBINATION WITH MELPHALAN AND PREDNISONE AS A TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED MULTIPLE MYELOMA. IF UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EXPERIENCES ARE REPORTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THALOMID® BY PATIENTS, PHYSICIAN AND PATIENT COMFORT WITH THE PRODUCT COULD BE UNDERMINED, THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF THALOMID® COULD BE AFFECTED AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR OTHER PRODUCTS, INCLUDING REVLIMID®, MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. VIDAZA® HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF DNA HYPERMETHYLATION AND PROMOTE SUBSEQUENT GENE RE-EXPRESSION. VIDAZA® WAS LICENSED FROM PHARMACIA & UPJOHN, NOW PART OF PFIZER, AND WAS APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALL SUBTYPES OF MDS. ADDITIONALLY, VIDAZA® WAS GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION BY THE FDA FOR THE TREATMENT OF AML. IN DECEMBER 2008, VIDAZA® WAS GRANTED FULL MARKETING AUTHORIZATION BY THE EC FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR HAEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION WITH INTERMEDIATE-2 AND HIGH-RISK MDS ACCORDING TO THE IPSS OR CMML WITH 10-29 PERCENT MARROW BLASTS WITHOUT MYELOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER, OR AML WITH 20-30 PERCENT BLASTS AND MULTI-LINEAGE DYSPLASIA, ACCORDING TO WHO CLASSIFICATION. OUR ABILITY TO ADVANCE REGULATORY AND CLINICAL PROGRAMS: MANY OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES ARE IN THE EARLY OR MID-STAGES OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND WILL REQUIRE THE COMMITMENT OF SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES, EXTENSIVE RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, PRECLINICAL TESTING, CLINICAL TRIALS, MANUFACTURING SCALE-UP AND REGULATORY APPROVAL PRIOR TO BEING READY FOR SALE. MOREOVER, OUR COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE PRODUCTS MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL STUDIES WITH RESPECT TO APPROVED INDICATIONS AS WELL AS NEW INDICATIONS PENDING APPROVAL. IF IT BECOMES TOO EXPENSIVE TO SUSTAIN OUR PRESENT COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES ON A LONG-TERM BASIS, WE WILL BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE CERTAIN NECESSARY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. FURTHERMORE, WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT OUR CLINICAL TESTING WILL RENDER SATISFACTORY RESULTS, OR THAT WE WILL RECEIVE REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS FOR OUR NEW PRODUCTS OR NEW INDICATIONS. A MAJOR OBJECTIVE OF OUR ONGOING CLINICAL PROGRAMS IS TO BROADEN OUR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE FULL POTENTIAL OF REVLIMID® AND OUR OTHER PROPRIETARY IMIDS® COMPOUNDS AND TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THEM IN A BROAD RANGE OF HEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES AND OTHER CANCERS. OUR NEAR-TERM FOCUS IS ON EVALUATING REVLIMID® AS A TREATMENT OF CLL AND NHL. 38 TABLE OF CONTENTS COMPETITIVE RISKS: WHILE COMPETITION COULD LIMIT OUR PRODUCTS SALES, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT COMPETING PRODUCTS WOULD ELIMINATE THEIR USE ENTIRELY. MOREOVER, WHILE GENERIC COMPETITORS HAVE AND COULD SEEK TO CHALLENGE OUR THALOMID® FRANCHISE, WE OWN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WHICH INCLUDES, FOR EXAMPLE, U.S. PATENTS COVERING OUR S.T.E.P.S.® DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM FOR THE SAFE DISTRIBUTION AND APPROPRIATE USE OF THALIDOMIDE, WHICH ALL PHYSICIANS, PATIENTS AND PHARMACIES PRESCRIBING, RECEIVING OR DISPENSING THALIDOMIDE IN THE UNITED STATES MUST FOLLOW. WE ALSO HAVE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO SEVERAL ISSUED PATENTS COVERING THALOMID® FORMULATIONS, AS WELL AS THE USE OF THALOMID® IN ONCOLOGY AND OTHER THERAPEUTIC AREAS. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006 TOTAL REVENUE: TOTAL REVENUE AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: TOTAL REVENUE INCREASED BY $849.0 MILLION, OR 60.4%, IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007. THIS INCREASE IS DUE TO INCREASED REVENUE IN THE UNITED STATES OF $379.8 MILLION, OR 31.6%, COMPARED TO 2007 AND INCREASED REVENUE IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS OF $469.2 MILLION, OR 230.2%. 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: TOTAL REVENUE INCREASED BY $506.9 MILLION, OR 56.4%, IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. THIS INCREASE IS DUE TO INCREASED REVENUE IN THE UNITED STATES OF $356.6 MILLION, OR 42.2%, COMPARED TO 2006 AND INCREASED REVENUE IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS OF $150.3 MILLION, OR 281.2%. NET PRODUCT SALES: 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: REVLIMID® NET SALES INCREASED BY $550.8 MILLION, OR 71.2%, IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CONTINUED EXPANSION IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. INCREASED MARKET PENETRATION AND THE INCREASE IN DURATION OF PATIENTS USING REVLIMID® IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE U.S. GROWTH. INTERNATIONAL SALES GROWTH PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF THE JUNE 2007 ECS APPROVAL FOR THE USE OF REVLIMID® FOR TREATMENT IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE OF PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE MYELOMA WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY AND CONTINUED EXPANSION IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND SUBSEQUENT PRICING, REIMBURSEMENT AND MARKETING APPROVALS IN EACH COUNTRY. REVLIMID® CONTINUED TO RECEIVE POSITIVE CLINICAL STUDY RESULTS WHICH WERE REPORTED AT MAJOR MEDICAL CONFERENCES AND IN PEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS. 39 TABLE OF CONTENTS THALOMID® NET SALES INCREASED BY $57.6 MILLION, OR 12.9%, IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 2008 INCLUSION OF INTERNATIONAL SALES, RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION OF PHARMION. IN ADDITION, U.S. PRICE INCREASES WERE OFFSET BY LOWER SALES VOLUMES. VIDAZA® REPRESENTS SALES RECORDED SUBSEQUENT TO THE MARCH 7, 2008 PHARMION ACQUISITION IN BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. ALKERAN® NET SALES INCREASED BY $8.2 MILLION, OR 11.1%, IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN UNIT SALES OF THE INJECTABLE FORM. THE AGREEMENT WITH GSK TO DISTRIBUTE, PROMOTE AND SELL ALKERAN® EXPIRES ON MARCH 31, 2009 AND WILL NOT BE RENEWED. NET PRODUCT SALES INCREASED BY $837.2 MILLION, OR 64.4% IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007. THE CHANGE WAS COMPRISED OF NET VOLUME INCREASES OF $742.8 MILLION, OR 57.1%, AS WELL AS PRICE INCREASES OF $93.0 MILLION, OR 7.2%, AND IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE OF $1.4 MILLION, OR 0.1%. 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: REVLIMID® NET SALES INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PRODUCTS EXPANDED USE IN THE UNITED STATES RESULTING FROM THE FDAS JUNE 2006 APPROVAL FOR TREATMENT IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE OF PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE MYELOMA WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND GROWTH IN EUROPE RESULTING FROM THE JUNE 2007 ECS APPROVAL FOR THE USE OF REVLIMID® IN THIS SAME INDICATION. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN SALES WERE PRICE INCREASES AND INCREASED SALES FROM OUR EUROPEAN NAMED PATIENT PROGRAM, OR NPP, WHICH OFFERS EUROPEAN PATIENTS IN NEED OF TREATMENT ACCESS TO REVLIMID® ON A COMPASSIONATE USE BASIS. NET SALES OF THALOMID® WERE HIGHER IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO PRICE INCREASES, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES VOLUMES AS WRITTEN PRESCRIPTIONS DECLINED, REFLECTING THE EXPANDED USE OF REVLIMID®. ALKERAN® NET SALES WERE HIGHER IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED PRICES AND A DECREASE IN PRODUCT RETURNS. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES; SALES DISCOUNTS; GOVERNMENT REBATES; AND CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES.  WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DOES NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. WE ANALYZE HISTORIC RETURNS EXPERIENCE ON CLOSED LOTS AND HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES ON OPEN LOTS. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED SPECIALTY PHARMACIES LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY TO DATE. VIDAZA® AND ALKERAN® ARE SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES TO PHARMACEUTICAL WHOLESALERS, WHO IN TURN DISTRIBUTE PRODUCT TO PHYSICIANS, RETAIL PHARMACIES, HOSPITALS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS.  SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. 40 TABLE OF CONTENTS  GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE AMOUNT FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. CERTAIN FOREIGN MARKETS HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID AND ACCORDINGLY THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES.  CHARGEBACKS ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICES ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. ON JANUARY 28, 2008, THE FISCAL YEAR 2008 NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT WAS ENACTED, WHICH EXPANDS TRICARE TO INCLUDE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS DISPENSED BY TRICARE RETAIL NETWORK PHARMACIES. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS REFLECT THIS PROGRAM EXPANSION AND ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA. SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS AND THE BALANCE IN THE RELATED ALLOWANCE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES DECREASED BY $19.2 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED THALOMID® INVENTORY IN THE SALES CHANNEL RESULTING FROM THE 2007 THALOMID® INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION AT SEVERAL MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, WHICH ALSO RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL RETURNS DURING 2007. IN ADDITION, 2007 INCLUDES AN INCREASE IN THALOMID® RETURNS RESULTING FROM THE ANTICIPATED INCREASE IN USE OF REVLIMID® IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA. WE ANTICIPATE ANOTHER INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVE TO BE CONDUCTED BY A MAJOR PHARMACY CHAIN IN EARLY 2009 AND BELIEVE THAT OUR ENDING RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES RESERVE REFLECTS THE ANTICIPATED EFFECTS THEREOF. DISCOUNTS INCREASED BY $8.0 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES OF REVLIMID® AS WELL AS THE INCLUSION OF FORMER PHARMION PRODUCTS, WHICH RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL DISCOUNTS TAKEN. 41 TABLE OF CONTENTS GOVERNMENT REBATES INCREASED BY $7.0 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASED INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT REBATES RESULTING FROM OUR GLOBAL EXPANSION, AS WELL AS THE INCLUSION OF FORMER PHARMION PRODUCTS. CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES INCREASED BY $30.1 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NEW TRICARE REBATE PROGRAM, AS WELL AS THE INCLUSION OF FORMER PHARMION PRODUCTS. 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: SALES RETURN ALLOWANCES DECREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER RETURNS OF ALKERAN® IV RESULTING FROM IMPROVED EXPIRATION DATING ON 2006 AND 2007 PRODUCT SALES. IN ADDITION, THALOMID® RETURNS WERE LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO A 2006 THALOMID® RETURNS INITIATIVE UNDERTAKEN BY ONE LARGE RETAIL PHARMACY CHAIN. IN RESPONSE TO THIS INITIATIVE, WE INTRODUCED SINGLE SLEEVES OF THALOMID® FOR SALE IN JUNE OF 2006. PREVIOUSLY, THALOMID® WAS SOLD ONLY IN MULTI-SLEEVE PACKAGE CONFIGURATIONS. THE ADDITIONAL TRADE PACKAGE CONFIGURATION ENABLED ALL RETAILERS TO MORE EFFICIENTLY MANAGE THEIR THALOMID® INVENTORIES RESULTING IN LOWER 2007 RETURNS. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY CURRENT YEAR THALOMID®RETURNS, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF A 2007 INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVE CONDUCTED BY SEVERAL MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS. UNDER THIS INITIATIVE, INVENTORY WAS REDISTRIBUTED AMONGST INDIVIDUAL CHAIN STORES IN A S.T.E.P.S.® COMPLIANT MANNER. THIS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THALOMID® RETURNS AS THESE MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS MORE EFFECTIVELY MANAGED THEIR INVENTORY LEVELS AT THE CHAIN STORES. DISCOUNTS INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED SALES OF REVLIMID®. GOVERNMENT REBATE ALLOWANCES INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 DUE TO INCREASED SALES OF REVLIMID® AS WELL AS PRICE INCREASES FOR BOTH THALOMID® AND REVLIMID®. OUR MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE AMOUNT FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES USING THE ESTIMATED MEDICAID DISPENSE QUANTITIES. REVLIMID® DISPENSES INCREASED RESULTING FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF THE 15MG AND 25MG STRENGTH TABLETS. DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO REVLIMID®, THALOMID® AND ALKERAN® IV PRICE INCREASES, WHICH INCREASED THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN ANNUAL CONTRACT PRICING AVAILABLE TO FEDERALLY FUNDED HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND OUR WHOLESALE ACQUISITION COST. COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER REVENUE: 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: REVENUES FROM COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER SOURCES TOTALED $14.9 MILLION AND $20.1 MILLION FOR 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE $5.2 MILLION DECREASE IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ELIMINATION OF LICENSE FEES AND AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED REVENUES RELATED TO PHARMION. 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: REVENUES FROM COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER SOURCES INCREASED BY $1.9 MILLION IN 2007 FROM THE $18.2 MILLION RECORDED IN 2006. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN LICENSE FEES GENERATED FROM OUR S.T.E.P.S.® PROGRAM AND AN INCREASE IN UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD ENROLLMENT, COLLECTION AND STORAGE FEES GENERATED THROUGH OUR LIFEBANK USASM BUSINESS. ROYALTY REVENUE: 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: REVENUES FROM ROYALTIES TOTALED $102.2 MILLION IN 2008, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $16.9 MILLION COMPARED TO 2007. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AMOUNTS RECEIVED FROM NOVARTIS ON SALES OF FOCALIN XR®, PARTLY DUE TO PATIENTS TRANSITIONING FROM FOCALIN® TO FOCALIN XR®. WE SELL FOCALIN® TO NOVARTIS AND RECEIVE ROYALTIES ON SALES OF NOVARTIS FOCALIN XR®. 42 TABLE OF CONTENTS 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: REVENUES FROM ROYALTIES TOTALED $85.3 MILLION IN 2007, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $16.2 MILLION COMPARED TO 2006. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AMOUNTS RECEIVED FROM NOVARTIS ON SALES OF THEIR ENTIRE FAMILY OF RITALIN® DRUGS AND FOCALIN XR®. ROYALTY REVENUE TOTALED $69.1 MILLION IN 2006. COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION EXPENSE): COST OF GOODS SOLD AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED BY $128.1 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF COSTS RELATED TO VIDAZA® AND THALOMID®, WHICH WERE OBTAINED IN THE PHARMION ACQUISITION. ALSO INCLUDED IN 2008 IS $24.6 MILLION OF THE $25.0 MILLION OF INVENTORY STEP-UP COST RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUE OF FORMER PHARMION INVENTORIES. COST OF SALES ALSO INCREASED DUE TO AN INCREASE IN MATERIAL COSTS FOR ALKERAN® FOR INJECTION AND AN INCREASE IN UNIT VOLUME FOR REVLIMID®, RESULTING IN HIGHER ROYALTIES. AS A PERCENT OF NET PRODUCT SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED TO 12.1% IN THE 2008 FROM 10.0% IN 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF HIGHER COSTS FOR VIDAZA® AND ALKERAN® AND THE $24.6 MILLION OF INVENTORY STEP-UP COST. 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN REVLIMID® MATERIAL COSTS AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS RELATED TO BOTH REVLIMID® AND THALOMID® AS SALES INCREASED FOR THESE TWO PRODUCTS. THE INCREASE WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER ALKERAN® MATERIAL COSTS RELATED TO ALKERAN® FOR INJECTION. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET PRODUCT SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD DECREASED FROM 15.5% IN 2006 TO 10.0% IN 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE GROWTH OF REVLIMID® AND THAT PRODUCTS LOWER COST RELATIVE TO OUR OTHER PRODUCTS AND SALES PRICE INCREASES. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED BY $530.8 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO A $303.1 MILLION CHARGE FOR THE OCTOBER 3, 2008 ROYALTY OBLIGATION PAYMENT TO PFIZER THAT RELATED TO THE UNAPPROVED FORMS OF VIDAZA®. IN ADDITION, SPENDING ON CLINICAL PROGRAMS INCREASED BY $147.4 MILLION IN SUPPORT OF ONGOING CLINICAL PROGRESS IN MULTIPLE PROPRIETARY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AS NOTED BELOW. REGULATORY SPENDING INCREASED BY $20.2 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF REVLIMID® IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND COSTS RELATED TO APREMILAST, AS DESCRIBED BELOW. ALSO INCLUDED IN 2008 WAS $45.0 MILLION IN UPFRONT PAYMENTS MADE TO ACCELERON RELATED TO A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENT. THE INCREASE WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY THE 2007 INCLUSION OF A COMBINED $41.1 MILLION IN UPFRONT PAYMENTS FOR COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR EARLY STAGE COMPOUNDS WITH ARRAY BIOPHARMA INC. AND PTC THERAPEUTICS. 43 TABLE OF CONTENTS THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL BREAKDOWN OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES SUPPORT ONGOING CLINICAL PROGRESS IN MULTIPLE PROPRIETARY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS FOR REVLIMID®, POMALIDOMIDE AND OTHER IMIDS® COMPOUNDS ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF DISEASES, INCLUDING NHL AND CLL; FOR VIDAZA®; AMRUBICIN, OUR LEAD COMPOUND FOR SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER; APREMILAST (CC-10004), OUR LEAD ANTI-INFLAMMATORY COMPOUND THAT INHIBITS PDE-4, WHICH RESULTS IN THE INHIBITION OF MULTIPLE PROINFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS SUCH AS TNF-A AND WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED IN PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS IN THE TREATMENT OF PSORIASIS AND PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS; POMALIDOMIDE AND CC-11050, WHICH ARE CURRENTLY EITHER BEING EVALUATED IN PHASE I AND PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS AND ADDITIONAL TRIALS ARE BEING PLANNED OR ONGOING FOR VARIOUS DISEASE INDICATIONS; AND OUR KINASE INHIBITOR PROGRAM, OUR ACTIVIN INHIBITOR PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE PLACENTAL STEM CELL PROGRAM. WE AND ACCELERON HAVE INITIATED PHASE II STUDIES OF ACE-011 IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM CANCER-RELATED BONE LOSS. 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED BY $140.5 MILLION IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO SPENDING RELATED TO CLINICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN SUPPORT OF MULTIPLE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING REVLIMID® AND OTHER IMIDS® ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF CANCERS, INCLUDING NHL AND CLL. EXPENSES ALSO INCREASED TO SUPPORT ONGOING RESEARCH OF OTHER COMPOUNDS, SUCH AS OUR KINASE AND LIGASE INHIBITOR PROGRAMS AND PLACENTAL STEM CELL PROGRAM. REGULATORY SPENDING INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF REVLIMID® IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE EXPENSE FOR 2007 ALSO INCLUDED A COMBINED $41.1 MILLION IN COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR EARLY STAGE COMPOUNDS WITH ARRAY AND PTC. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE MAY CONTINUE TO GROW AS EARLIER STAGE COMPOUNDS ARE MOVED THROUGH THE PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL STAGES. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN PRECLINICAL TESTS AND CLINICAL TRIALS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, THE COST TO COMPLETE SUCH PROJECTS CAN VARY. THE DATA OBTAINED FROM THESE TESTS AND TRIALS MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING INTERPRETATION THAT COULD DELAY, LIMIT OR PREVENT A PROJECTS ADVANCEMENT THROUGH THE VARIOUS STAGES OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE COSTS INCURRED TO BRING A PROJECT TO COMPLETION. FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMMERCIAL AND DEVELOPMENT STATUS AND TARGET DISEASES OF OUR DRUG COMPOUNDS, REFER TO THE PRODUCT OVERVIEW TABLE CONTAINED IN PART I, ITEM I, BUSINESS, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. 44 TABLE OF CONTENTS SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE: SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY $244.6 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007, PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN MARKETING EXPENSES OF $101.6 MILLION, SALES RELATED COSTS OF $65.9 MILLION, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF $63.8 MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN DONATIONS TO NON-PROFIT FOUNDATIONS THAT ASSIST PATIENTS WITH THEIR CO-PAYMENTS OF $13.3 MILLION. THE INCREASE REFLECTS MARKETING AND SALES EXPENSES RELATED TO PRODUCT LAUNCH ACTIVITIES FOR REVLIMID®AND THALOMID® IN EUROPE, CANADA AND AUSTRALIA. THE INCREASE ALSO REFLECTS THE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE RELAUNCH OF VIDAZA® IN THE UNITED STATES AFTER OBTAINING AN EXPANDED FDA APPROVAL TO REFLECT NEW OVERALL SURVIVAL ACHIEVED IN THE AZA-001 SURVIVAL STUDY OF PATIENTS WITH HIGHER-RISK MDS AND LAUNCH IN EUROPE. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASE ALSO REFLECTS THE CONTINUED EXPANSION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES IN OVER 65 COUNTRIES. 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY $111.2 MILLION IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN SALES FORCE COSTS RELATED TO REVLIMID® PRODUCT LAUNCH ACTIVITIES IN EUROPE AND AN INCREASE IN SPENDING RELATED TO OUR CONTINUED EXPANSION THROUGHOUT EUROPE, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA AND CANADA. DONATIONS TO NON-PROFIT FOUNDATIONS THAT ASSIST PATIENTS WITH THEIR CO-PAYMENTS ALSO INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS: THE $104.0 MILLION IN AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN 2008 INCLUDED $102.4 MILLION RELATED TO THE MARCH 2008 ACQUISITION OF PHARMION AND $1.6 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE OCTOBER 2004 ACQUISITION OF PENN T LIMITED. THE PHARMION INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PERIOD OF 6.5 YEARS. THE $9.1 MILLION IN AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION INTANGIBLES IN 2007 ALL RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF PENN T LIMITED. ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: IPR&D REPRESENTS COMPOUNDS UNDER DEVELOPMENT BY PHARMION AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION THAT HAD NOT YET ACHIEVED REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR MARKETING IN CERTAIN MARKETS OR HAD NOT YET BEEN COMPLETED AND HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE. THE $1.74 BILLION ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THESE INTANGIBLES WAS DERIVED USING THE MULTI-PERIOD EXCESS-EARNINGS METHOD, A FORM OF THE INCOME APPROACH. THE IPR&D PRIMARILY RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL INITIATIVES FOR VIDAZA® IV IN THE EU MARKET, THE ORAL FORM OF AZACITIDINE IN THE U.S. AND EU MARKETS AND THALOMID® IN THE EU MARKET. THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS FOR VALUATION PURPOSES WERE BASED ON KEY ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS ESTIMATES OF REVENUES AND OPERATING PROFITS RELATED TO THE PROGRAMS CONSIDERING THEIR STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT; THE TIME AND RESOURCES NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTS; AND THE LIFE OF THE POTENTIAL COMMERCIALIZED PRODUCTS AND ASSOCIATED RISKS, INCLUDING THE INHERENT DIFFICULTIES AND UNCERTAINTIES IN OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVALS.

THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES RESULTING FROM THE MARCH 2008 CASH PAYMENT OF $746.8 MILLION RELATED TO THE PHARMION ACQUISITION AND THE OCTOBER 3, 2008 PAYMENT OF $425.0 MILLION TO PFIZER WHERE WE PREPAID OUR ROYALTY OBLIGATION UNDER THE JUNE 7, 2001 5-AZACYTIDINE LICENSE IN FULL, IN ADDITION TO REDUCED YIELDS ON INVESTED BALANCES. INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET INCLUDED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE TOTALING $2.4 MILLION IN 2008 AND $5.5 MILLION 2007. INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET INCREASED BY $69.5 MILLION IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES RESULTING FROM THE NOVEMBER 2006 ISSUANCE OF AN ADDITIONAL 20,000,000 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WHICH GENERATED NET PROCEEDS OF $1.006 BILLION. EQUITY IN LOSSES OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES: UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, WE RECORDED LOSSES OF $3.7 MILLION, $4.5 MILLION AND $8.2 MILLION IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, IMPAIRMENT LOSSES OF $6.0 MILLION WERE RECORDED IN 2008. THE IMPAIRMENT LOSSES WERE BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING AN OTHER THAN TEMPORARY DECREASE IN FAIR VALUE OF AN EQUITY INVESTMENT BELOW OUR COST. THE $3.7 MILLION DECREASE IN LOSSES IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A CHARGE OF $3.1 MILLION FOR IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO AN ACQUISITION MADE BY ONE OF OUR INVESTMENT COMPANIES IN 2006. INTEREST EXPENSE: INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $4.4 MILLION, $11.1 MILLION AND $9.4 MILLION IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY, AND PRIMARILY REFLECTED INTEREST AND AMORTIZATION OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS RELATED TO THE $400 MILLION CONVERTIBLE NOTES ISSUED ON JUNE 3, 2003. THE $6.7 MILLION DECREASE IN 2008 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A SUBSTANTIAL CONVERSION OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT INTO OUR COMMON STOCK IN DECEMBER 2007 AND THE COMPLETION OF CONVERSIONS IN JUNE 2008. INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED $1.7 MILLION IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF A FULL YEARS INTEREST ON THE NOTE PAYABLE TO SIEGFRIED LTD. AND SIEGFRIED DIENSTE AG (TOGETHER REFERRED TO HEREIN AS SIEGFRIED), RESULTING FROM THE DECEMBER 2006 ACQUISITION OF THE API MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN ZOFINGEN, SWITZERLAND.

THE $27.1 MILLION INCREASE IN INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, WHICH WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT LOSS RECORDED ON AN EQUITY INVESTMENT. THE EXPENSE IN 2007 INCLUDED EXPENSES RELATED TO A TERMINATION BENEFIT RESULTING FROM THE MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS OF A TERMINATED EMPLOYEE AND WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS. THE $7.9 MILLION DECREASE IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 WAS PARTLY DUE TO THE MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS AND A $3.8 MILLION DECREASE IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS. INCOME TAX PROVISION: THE INCOME TAX PROVISION FOR 2008 WAS $164.8 MILLION WITH AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF NEGATIVE 12.0%. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY NON-DEDUCTIBLE IPR&D CHARGES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF PHARMION. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE IPR&D AND THE EXPENSE RELATED TO THE PREPAYMENT OF OUR ROYALTY OBLIGATION FOR UNAPPROVED PRODUCTS, WAS 24.8% WHICH REFLECTS THE BENEFIT OF OUR LOW TAX SWISS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS AND OUR OVERALL GLOBAL MIX OF INCOME. THE INCOME TAX PROVISIONS FOR 2007 AND 2006 WERE $290.5 MILLION AND $133.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WITH EFFECTIVE TAX RATES OF 56.2% AND 66.0%, RESPECTIVELY, AND REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN EXPENSES INCURRED IN TAXING JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES FOR WHICH WE DID NOT RECEIVE A TAX BENEFIT AND NONDEDUCTIBLE EXPENSES WHICH INCLUDED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS.

NO ADJUSTMENT TO THE NUMERATOR OR DENOMINATOR WAS MADE IN 2008 DUE TO THE ANTI-DILUTIVE EFFECT OF ANY POTENTIAL COMMON STOCK AS A RESULT OF OUR NET LOSS. 2008 COMPARED TO 2007: NET INCOME DECREASED BY $1.760 BILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO $1.740 BILLION IN IPR&D CHARGES AND $102.3 MILLION IN ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES AMORTIZATION RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF PHARMION IN MARCH 2008, IN ADDITION TO A $303.1 MILLION CHARGE FOR THE OCTOBER 3, 2008 ROYALTY OBLIGATION PAYMENT TO PFIZER THAT RELATED TO THE UNAPPROVED FORMS OF VIDAZA®. THESE COSTS WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NET REVENUES PROVIDED BY REVLIMID® AND VIDAZA®. 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: NET INCOME INCREASED BY $157.5 MILLION IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN TOTAL REVENUES, PRIMARILY FROM THE SALES OF REVLIMID®; INCREASE IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME RESULTING FROM THE ISSUANCE OF AN ADDITIONAL 20,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN NOVEMBER 2006; DECREASE IN THE OVERALL INCOME TAX RATE FROM 66% IN 2006 TO 56% IN 2007; PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES REQUIRED TO SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONAL GROWTH, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND THE LAUNCH OF REVLIMID® IN EUROPE. 47 TABLE OF CONTENTS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WERE AS FOLLOWS: OPERATING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2008 DECREASED BY $295.3 MILLION TO $182.2 MILLION AS COMPARED TO 2007.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR 2008 DECREASED BY $6.1 MILLION TO $281.6 MILLION AS COMPARED TO 2007. THE DECREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO:  A DECREASE IN THE PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF COMMON STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS  PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE TAX BENEFIT FROM SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. 48 TABLE OF CONTENTS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND WORKING CAPITAL: WORKING CAPITAL AND CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (1) INCLUDES CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET OF ALLOWANCES, INVENTORY AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, LESS ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES, INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES.

ALL LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND ALL INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE. WE DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. THE DECREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NET PAYMENT OF $746.8 MILLION RELATING TO THE PHARMION ACQUISITION AND THE OCTOBER 3, 2008 PREPAYMENT OF OUR ROYALTY OBLIGATION UNDER THE JUNE 7, 2001 5-AZACYTIDINE LICENSE IN FULL FOR $425.0 MILLION, WHICH WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY INCREASED CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET INCREASED BY $145.0 MILLION TO $312.2 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 PARTLY DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF RECEIVABLES RELATED TO SALES OF VIDAZA® AND THALOMID®, WHICH WERE OBTAINED FROM THE PHARMION ACQUISITION AND AN INCREASE IN SALES OF REVLIMID®. DAYS OF SALES OUTSTANDING, OR DSO, IN 2008 AMOUNTED TO 42 DAYS COMPARED TO 41 DAYS IN 2007. THE INCREASE IN DSO REFLECTS INCREASED INTERNATIONAL SALES FOR WHICH COLLECTION PERIODS ARE LONGER THAN FOR U.S. SALES. INVENTORY: INVENTORY IN 2008 TOTALED $100.2 MILLION AND INCREASED BY $51.1 MILLION COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE ADDITION OF VIDAZA® INVENTORY AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF THALOMID® INVENTORY IN ANTICIPATION OF LAUNCHES IN EUROPEAN MARKETS. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS: OTHER CURRENT ASSETS IN 2008 TOTALED $190.4 MILLION AND INCREASED BY $81.8 MILLION COMPARED TO 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN SALES, USE AND VALUE-ADDED TAXES AS A RESULT OF OUR CONTINUED INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION, IN ADDITION TO THE CURRENT PORTION OF THE PREPAID VIDAZA® ROYALTY OBLIGATION.

MANUFACTURING FACILITY NOTE PAYABLE: IN DECEMBER 2006, WE PURCHASED AN ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENT, OR API, MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FROM SIEGFRIED LOCATED IN ZOFINGEN, SWITZERLAND. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NOTE PAYABLE TO SIEGFRIED APPROXIMATED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTE OF $26.0 MILLION. ASSUMING OTHER FACTORS ARE HELD CONSTANT, AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES GENERALLY WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NOTE. THE NOTE IS DENOMINATED IN SWISS FRANCS AND ITS FAIR VALUE WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR / SWISS FRANC EXCHANGE RATE. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTE REFLECTS THE U.S. DOLLAR / SWISS FRANC EXCHANGE RATE AND SWISS INTEREST RATES.

WE DO NOT EXPECT A SETTLEMENT OF THE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS CLASSIFIED AS NON-CURRENT WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS: WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT INCLUDE THE FUNDING OF CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE MILESTONE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED DEVELOPMENTAL, REGULATORY AND /OR COMMERCIAL TARGETS. OUR OBLIGATION TO FUND THESE EFFORTS IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROGRAMS AND/OR THE LACK OF ANY ADVERSE EVENTS WHICH COULD CAUSE THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE PROGRAMS. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND ACCORDINGLY NO AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED ON OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TABLE. 50 TABLE OF CONTENTS NEW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD, OR FASB, ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, OR SFAS, NO. 157, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, OR SFAS 157, WHICH ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE FASB PARTIALLY DEFERRED THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SFAS 157 FOR NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A NONRECURRING BASIS TO FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2008. THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED ON A RECURRING BASIS WAS JANUARY 1, 2008. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT OUR ADOPTION OF SFAS 157 ON JANUARY 1, 2008 FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SEE NOTE 5 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR EXPANDED DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY SFAS 157. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 157 RELATED TO NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 159, THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, OR SFAS 159, WHICH PROVIDES COMPANIES WITH AN OPTION TO REPORT SELECTED FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. SFAS 159 ESTABLISHES PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS DESIGNED TO FACILITATE COMPARISONS BETWEEN COMPANIES THAT CHOOSE DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTES FOR SIMILAR TYPES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND HIGHLIGHTS THE EFFECT OF A COMPANYS CHOICE TO USE FAIR VALUE ON ITS EARNINGS. IT ALSO REQUIRES A COMPANY TO DISPLAY THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR WHICH IT HAS CHOSEN TO USE FAIR VALUE ON THE FACE OF THE BALANCE SHEET. SFAS 159 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2008 AND DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS WE DID NOT CHOOSE TO USE THE FAIR VALUE OPTION. IN JUNE 2007, THE FASB RATIFIED EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE, OR EITF, ISSUE NO. 07-3, ACCOUNTING FOR NON-REFUNDABLE ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR GOODS OR SERVICES TO BE USED IN FUTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, OR EITF 07-3, WHICH PROVIDES THAT NON-REFUNDABLE ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE DEFERRED AND CAPITALIZED UNTIL THE RELATED GOODS ARE DELIVERED OR THE RELATED SERVICES ARE PERFORMED.

EITF 07-1 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 ON A RETROSPECTIVE BASIS. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION OF EITF 07-1 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 141R, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, OR SFAS 141R, WHICH REPLACES FASB STATEMENT NO. 141, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, AND REQUIRES AN ACQUIRER TO RECOGNIZE THE ASSETS ACQUIRED, THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND ANY NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE ACQUIREE AT THE ACQUISITION DATE, MEASURED AT THEIR FAIR VALUES AS OF THAT DATE, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS SPECIFIED IN SFAS 141R.

SFAS 141R DOES NOT PERMIT THIS ACCOUNTING AND GENERALLY WILL REQUIRE ANY SUCH CHANGES TO BE RECORDED IN CURRENT PERIOD INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THUS, AFTER SFAS 141R IS ADOPTED, ALL CHANGES TO VALUATION ALLOWANCES AND LIABILITIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS FROM AN ACQUISITION (WHETHER THE COMBINATION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SFAS 141 OR SFAS 141R) MUST BE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT PERIOD INCOME TAX EXPENSE. SFAS 141R IS EFFECTIVE PROSPECTIVELY TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS FOR WHICH THE ACQUISITION DATE IS ON OR AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORTING PERIOD BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008. SFAS 141R IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 AND WE WILL ACCOUNT FOR FUTURE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS PROVISIONS, IN ADDITION TO ADOPTING ITS PROVISIONS RELATED TO POST-ACQUISITION ADJUSTMENTS TO TAXES. IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 160, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AN AMENDMENT OF ARB NO. 51, OR SFAS 160, WHICH CHANGES THE ACCOUNTING FOR AND REPORTING OF NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS (FORMERLY KNOWN AS MINORITY INTERESTS) IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SFAS 161 IS EFFECTIVE FOR US DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 AND WE WILL ADOPT THE DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF MARCH 31, 2009. IN APRIL 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION, OR FSP, NO. FAS 142-3, DETERMINATION OF THE USEFUL LIFE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, OR FSP FAS 142-3.

APB 14-1, ACCOUNTING FOR CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT MAY BE SETTLED IN CASH UPON CONVERSION (INCLUDING PARTIAL CASH SETTLEMENT), OR FSP APB 14-1, WHICH REQUIRES SEPARATE ACCOUNTING FOR THE DEBT AND EQUITY COMPONENTS OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT ISSUANCES THAT HAVE A CASH SETTLEMENT FEATURE PERMITTING SETTLEMENT PARTIALLY OR FULLY IN CASH UPON CONVERSION. A COMPONENT OF SUCH DEBT ISSUANCES REPRESENTATIVE OF THE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONVERSION FEATURE AT INCEPTION SHOULD BE BIFURCATED AND RECORDED TO EQUITY, WITH THE RESULTING DEBT DISCOUNT AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE IN A MANNER THAT REFLECTS THE ISSUERS NONCONVERTIBLE, UNSECURED DEBT BORROWING RATE. THE REQUIREMENTS FOR SEPARATE ACCOUNTING MUST BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY TO PREVIOUSLY ISSUED CONVERTIBLE DEBT ISSUANCES AS WELL AS PROSPECTIVELY TO NEWLY ISSUED CONVERTIBLE DEBT ISSUANCES, NEGATIVELY AFFECTING BOTH NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE, IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008. SINCE OUR PAST CONVERTIBLE DEBT ISSUANCE DID NOT INCLUDE A CASH SETTLEMENT FEATURE, THE ADOPTION OF FSP APB 14-1 WILL NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN JUNE 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FSP EITF NO. 03-6-1, DETERMINING WHETHER INSTRUMENTS GRANTED IN SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS ARE PARTICIPATING SECURITIES, OR FSP EITF 03-6-1. THE FSP ADDRESSES WHETHER INSTRUMENTS GRANTED IN SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS ARE PARTICIPATING SECURITIES PRIOR TO VESTING AND THEREFORE NEED TO BE INCLUDED IN THE EARNINGS ALLOCATION IN CALCULATING EARNINGS PER SHARE UNDER THE TWO-CLASS METHOD DESCRIBED IN SFAS NO. 128, EARNINGS PER SHARE. THE FSP REQUIRES COMPANIES TO TREAT UNVESTED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS THAT HAVE NON-FORFEITABLE RIGHTS TO DIVIDENDS OR DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS AS A SEPARATE CLASS OF SECURITIES IN CALCULATING EARNINGS PER SHARE. THE FSP IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PROHIBITED. SINCE OUR PAST SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS DID NOT INCLUDE NON-FORFEITABLE RIGHTS TO DIVIDENDS OR DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS, THE ADOPTION OF FSP EITF 03-6-1 WILL NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. 52 TABLE OF CONTENTS IN OCTOBER 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FSP NO. FAS 157-3, DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL ASSET WHEN THE MARKET FOR THAT ASSET IS NOT ACTIVE, OR FSP FAS 157-3.

THE FSP WAS EFFECTIVE UPON ISSUANCE, INCLUDING PRIOR PERIODS FOR WHICH FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN ISSUED AND DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FASB RATIFIED EITF ISSUE NO. 08-6, EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS, OR EITF 08-6, WHICH CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS AND IMPAIRMENT CONSIDERATIONS INVOLVING EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS.

EITF 08-7 REQUIRES AN ACQUIRER IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION TO ACCOUNT FOR A DEFENSIVE INTANGIBLE ASSET AS A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING WHICH SHOULD BE AMORTIZED TO EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD THE ASSET DIMINISHES IN VALUE. EITF 08-7 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PROHIBITED. IT IS EFFECTIVE PROSPECTIVELY FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED ON OR AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORTING PERIOD BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008. EITF 08-7 IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 AND WE WILL ACCOUNT FOR DEFENSIVE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN FUTURE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS PROVISIONS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IS ONE THAT IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENTS MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL: REVENUE RECOGNITION ON COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS: WE HAVE FORMED COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS AND ALLIANCES WITH SEVERAL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE IN THE FORM OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS. THE AGREEMENTS CALL FOR NON-REFUNDABLE UPFRONT PAYMENTS, MILESTONE PAYMENTS ON ACHIEVING SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE EVENTS AND IN SOME CASES ONGOING RESEARCH FUNDING. THE AGREEMENTS ALSO CONTEMPLATE ROYALTY PAYMENTS ON SALES IF AND WHEN THE COMPOUNDS RECEIVE REGULATORY MARKETING APPROVAL. OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES FOR ALL NON-REFUNDABLE UPFRONT LICENSE FEES AND MILESTONE ARRANGEMENTS ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE PROVIDED IN THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONS STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN, OR SAB, NO. 101, REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS AMENDED BY SAB NO. 104, REVENUE RECOGNITION, OR SAB 104. IN ADDITION, WE FOLLOW THE PROVISIONS OF EITF ISSUE NO. 00-21, REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES, OR EITF 00-21, FOR MULTIPLE ELEMENT REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO OR MATERIALLY AMENDED AFTER JUNE 30, 2003. EITF 00-21 PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON HOW TO DETERMINE WHEN AN ARRANGEMENT THAT INVOLVES MULTIPLE REVENUE-GENERATING ACTIVITIES OR DELIVERABLES SHOULD BE DIVIDED INTO SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION PURPOSES AND, IF THIS DIVISION IS REQUIRED, HOW THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE ALLOCATED AMONG THE SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING. IF THE DELIVERABLES IN A REVENUE ARRANGEMENT CONSTITUTE SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING ACCORDING TO THE EITFS SEPARATION CRITERIA, THE REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY MUST BE DETERMINED FOR EACH IDENTIFIED UNIT. IF THE ARRANGEMENT IS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, THE REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY MUST BE DETERMINED FOR THE ENTIRE ARRANGEMENT. 53 TABLE OF CONTENTS UNDER ARRANGEMENTS WHERE THE LICENSE FEES AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, NON-REFUNDABLE UPFRONT LICENSE FEES ARE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE EXPECTED TERM OF OUR CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. REVENUES FROM THE ACHIEVEMENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES, IF DEEMED SUBSTANTIVE, ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE MILESTONES ARE ACHIEVED, AND THE MILESTONE PAYMENTS ARE DUE AND COLLECTIBLE. MILESTONES ARE CONSIDERED SUBSTANTIVE IF ALL OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS ARE MET: (1) THE MILESTONE IS NON-REFUNDABLE; (2) ACHIEVEMENT OF THE MILESTONE WAS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED AT THE INCEPTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT; (3) SUBSTANTIVE EFFORT IS INVOLVED TO ACHIEVE THE MILESTONE; AND (4) THE AMOUNT OF THE MILESTONE APPEARS REASONABLE IN RELATION TO THE EFFORT EXPENDED, THE OTHER MILESTONES IN THE ARRANGEMENT AND THE RELATED RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ACHIEVEMENT OF THE MILESTONE. IF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET, WE WOULD RECOGNIZE A PROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF THE MILESTONE PAYMENT UPON RECEIPT AS REVENUE THAT CORRELATES TO WORK ALREADY PERFORMED AND THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE MILESTONE PAYMENT WILL BE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE AS WE COMPLETE OUR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS, GOVERNMENT REBATES AND CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES: OUR GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS, GOVERNMENT REBATES AND CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES ARE BASED ON OUR SALES AND/OR ESTIMATES OF THIRD-PARTY INVENTORIES. OUR DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS IN CERTAIN MARKETS AND OUR ACCRUAL METHODOLOGIES ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW. THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER OUR S.T.E.P.S.® DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM. AMONG OTHER THINGS, S.T.E.P.S.®, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION AND RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM, REQUIRES PRESCRIBERS, PATIENTS AND DISPENSING PHARMACIES TO PARTICIPATE IN A REGISTRY AND PROHIBITS THE FILLING OF A THALOMID® ORDER UNLESS THE PHYSICIAN, PATIENT AND PHARMACY HAVE ALL OBTAINED AN APPROPRIATE AUTHORIZATION NUMBER. AUTOMATIC REFILLS ARE NOT PERMITTED UNDER THE PROGRAM. EACH PRESCRIPTION MAY NOT EXCEED A 28-DAY SUPPLY AND A NEW PRESCRIPTION IS REQUIRED WITH EACH ORDER. ALTHOUGH WE INVOICE THROUGH TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL WHOLESALERS, ALL THALOMID® ORDERS ARE DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY OVERNIGHT. WHOLESALER STOCKING OF THIS PRODUCT IS PROHIBITED. IN ADDITION, WE DO NOT OFFER COMMERCIAL DISCOUNTS ON OUR PRODUCTS TO PHARMACIES OR HOSPITALS AND, THEREFORE, HAVE NO COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE USE OF REVLIMID®, AND IS SOLD PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL. THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM INCLUDES MOST OF THE SAME ATTRIBUTES OF THE S.T.E.P.S.® PROGRAM MENTIONED ABOVE. VIDAZA® IS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN. VIDAZA® IS NOT SUBJECTED TO S.T.E.P.S.® OR REVASSIST® DISTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS. IT MAY BE STOCKED BY MULTIPLE WHOLESALERS AND PRESCRIBED BY PHYSICIANS WITHOUT OUR PREAUTHORIZATION. 54 TABLE OF CONTENTS ALKERAN® IS DISTRIBUTED IN A SIMILAR FASHION AS VIDAZA®. SALES RETURNS: WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DOES NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. WE ANALYZE HISTORIC RETURNS EXPERIENCE ON CLOSED LOTS AND HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES ON OPEN LOTS. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT, ALTHOUGH THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY/HOSPITAL MAY STOCK THALOMID®. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED SPECIALTY PHARMACIES LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY TO DATE. VIDAZA® AND ALKERAN® ARE SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES TO PHARMACEUTICAL WHOLESALERS, WHO IN TURN DISTRIBUTE PRODUCT TO PHYSICIANS, RETAIL PHARMACIES, HOSPITALS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS. EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS PRICE CHANGES FROM COMPETITORS AND INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW AND GENERIC COMPETING PRODUCTS COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR SALES RETURNS. OUR SALES RETURNS HAVE NOT BEEN IMPACTED THUS FAR BY SUCH EXTERNAL FACTORS; HOWEVER, WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR SUCH FACTORS. GOVERNMENT REBATES: GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE AMOUNT FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. CERTAIN FOREIGN MARKETS HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID AND ACCORDINGLY THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES. CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES: CHARGEBACKS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. ON JANUARY 28, 2008, THE FISCAL YEAR 2008 NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT WAS ENACTED, WHICH EXPANDS TRICARE TO INCLUDE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS DISPENSED BY TRICARE RETAIL NETWORK PHARMACIES. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS REFLECT THIS PROGRAM EXPANSION AND ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA. OTHER GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD SALES DISCOUNTS ACCRUALS BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. INCOME TAXES: WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. WE PROVIDE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 48 AND FSP FIN 48-1, DEFINITION OF SETTLEMENT IN FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48, OR FSP FIN 48-1, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007. FIN 48 CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTERPRISES FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 109 AND PRESCRIBES A RECOGNITION THRESHOLD AND MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF A TAX POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. FIN 48 ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION, CLASSIFICATION, INTEREST AND PENALTIES, ACCOUNTING IN INTERIM PERIODS, DISCLOSURE AND TRANSITION. WE HAD NO CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO THE ADOPTION. WE ACCOUNT FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS PART OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THESE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATE PRIMARILY TO ISSUES COMMON AMONG MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE APPLY A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES WHICH INCLUDE STUDIES PERFORMED BY INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS, ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY AND SUBJECT EXPERTS, EVALUATION OF PUBLIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. WE PROVIDE ESTIMATES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. IF OUR ESTIMATES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ACTUAL OUTCOMES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED. 55 TABLE OF CONTENTS WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE A PORTION WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR RECENT CUMULATIVE EARNINGS EXPERIENCE BY TAXING JURISDICTION, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, CARRYFORWARD PERIODS AVAILABLE TO US FOR TAX REPORTING PURPOSES, VARIOUS INCOME TAX STRATEGIES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT AND, TO THE EXTENT FUTURE EXPECTATIONS CHANGE, WE WOULD HAVE TO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THAT TIME. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION: WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS, NO. 123R, SHARE-BASED PAYMENT, OR SFAS 123R, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, WHICH REQUIRES THAT ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT THEIR FAIR VALUES. WE ADOPTED SFAS 123R USING THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION METHOD UNDER WHICH THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS 123R APPLY TO NEW AWARDS AND TO AWARDS MODIFIED, REPURCHASED OR CANCELLED AFTER THE ADOPTION DATE. WE USE THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS ON THE DATE OF GRANT WHICH REQUIRES CERTAIN ESTIMATES TO BE MADE BY MANAGEMENT INCLUDING THE EXPECTED FORFEITURE RATE AND EXPECTED TERM OF THE OPTIONS. MANAGEMENT ALSO MAKES DECISIONS REGARDING THE METHOD OF CALCULATING THE EXPECTED VOLATILITIES AND THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE USED IN THE MODEL. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET THAT AFFECT THESE ESTIMATES COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE RESULTING COMPENSATION COST. ADDITIONALLY, COMPENSATION COST FOR THE PORTION OF AWARDS FOR WHICH THE REQUISITE SERVICE HAS NOT BEEN RENDERED THAT ARE OUTSTANDING AS OF THE ADOPTION DATE IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE REMAINING SERVICE PERIOD AFTER THE ADOPTION DATE (FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REFER TO NOTE 15 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K). OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES: A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF ANY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY BELOW ITS COST THAT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN CARRYING AMOUNT TO FAIR VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT IS CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AND A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE SECURITY ESTABLISHED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INCLUDE: SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE ISSUERS EARNINGS PERFORMANCE, CREDIT RATING, ASSET QUALITY, BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE ISSUER OPERATES, LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW OUR COST, OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE SECURITY AND OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD DIFFER FROM OUR ASSESSMENT. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES: SFAS NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, OR SFAS 133, AS AMENDED, REQUIRES THAT ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS BE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN CURRENT EARNINGS OR OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), DEPENDING ON WHETHER A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION AND, IF IT IS, THE TYPE OF HEDGING TRANSACTION. FOR A DERIVATIVE TO QUALIFY AS A HEDGE AT INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE HEDGED PERIOD, WE FORMALLY DOCUMENT THE NATURE AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEM. WE ASSESS, BOTH AT INCEPTION AND ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING TRANSACTIONS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING THE CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS. WE ASSESS HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND RECORD THE GAIN OR LOSS RELATED TO THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IF ANY, TO CURRENT EARNINGS. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER PROBABLE OF OCCURRING, WE DISCONTINUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING AND ANY RELATED UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE NOT DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION, TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. THE USE OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE EXPOSURE OF THESE RISKS WITH THE INTENT TO REDUCE OUR RISK OR COST. WE DO NOT USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR SPECULATIVE TRADING PURPOSES AND ARE NOT A PARTY TO LEVERAGED DERIVATIVES. 56 TABLE OF CONTENTS INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATED COMPANIES: OUR INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATED COMPANIES IS COMPRISED OF INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND INVESTMENT FUNDS WHICH PRIMARILY INVEST IN COMPANIES CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN LIFE SCIENCES SUCH AS BIOTECHNOLOGY, PHARMACEUTICALS, MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY, DEVICES, DIAGNOSTICS AND HEALTH AND WELLNESS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET WERE TO EXCEED ITS FAIR VALUE, WE WOULD REVIEW IT TO DETERMINE IF AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT HAS BEEN SUSTAINED. IF THE INVESTMENT IS DETERMINED TO HAVE SUSTAINED AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE, THE INVESTMENT WOULD BE WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE. SUCH AN EVALUATION IS JUDGMENTAL AND DEPENDENT ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. FACTORS THAT WE CONSIDER IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE HAS OCCURRED INCLUDE: THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITY IN RELATION TO ITS COST BASIS, THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT THE MARKET VALUE IS BELOW COST, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE INVESTEE AND OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. WE EVALUATE INFORMATION THAT WE ARE AWARE OF IN ADDITION TO QUOTED MARKET PRICES, IF ANY, IN DETERMINING IF AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE EXISTS. ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, OR LTIP, DESIGNED TO PROVIDE KEY OFFICERS AND EXECUTIVES WITH PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES CONTINGENT UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED CORPORATE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES COVERING A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWO THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLES RUNNING CONCURRENTLY ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2010. WE ALSO ANTICIPATE THE APPROVAL OF A NEW 3-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLE ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2011 TO BE ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AT THE END OF FEBRUARY 2009. PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR EACH LTIP ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE THREE-YEAR CYCLE: 25% ON EARNINGS PER SHARE, 25% ON NET INCOME AND 50% ON TOTAL REVENUE, AS DEFINED. PAYOUTS MAY BE IN THE RANGE OF 0% TO 200% OF THE PARTICIPANTS SALARY FOR THE PLANS. AWARDS ARE PAYABLE IN CASH OR, AT OUR DISCRETION, IN OUR COMMON STOCK BASED UPON OUR STOCK PRICE AT THE PAYOUT DATE. WE ACCRUE THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE LIABILITY OVER EACH THREE-YEAR CYCLE. PRIOR TO THE END OF A THREE-YEAR CYCLE, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT DURING THE CYCLE. UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT EQUAL TO THEIR TARGET AWARD, OR, IF HIGHER, AN AWARD BASED ON ACTUAL PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL. ACCRUALS RECORDED FOR THE LTIP ENTAIL MAKING CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE EARNINGS PER SHARE, NET INCOME AND REVENUES, AS DEFINED; THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED. ACCRUALS FOR THE LTIP ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND REVISED ACCORDINGLY SO THAT THE LIABILITY RECORDED REFLECTS UPDATED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PAYOUTS. IN ESTIMATING THE ACCRUALS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DATE FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, EXPECTED RESULTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, OPERATING TRENDS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICING AND COMPETITION. VALUATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: WE HAVE ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY THROUGH BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. WHEN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, ARE ACQUIRED WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS ARE TYPICALLY USED IN THESE VALUATIONS, AND THE MODELS REQUIRE THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:  PROJECTING REGULATORY APPROVALS,  ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM PRODUCT SALES RESULTING FROM COMPLETED PRODUCTS AND IN-PROCESS PROJECTS AND  DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES AND PROBABILITY RATES. 57 TABLE OF CONTENTS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS: WE ACCOUNT FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 141, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, OR SFAS 141, (REPLACED BY SFAS 141R FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS CONSUMMATED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2009) AND SFAS 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, OR SFAS 142. SFAS 141 REQUIRES THAT THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING BE USED FOR ALL BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. IT SPECIFIES THE CRITERIA WHICH INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION MUST MEET IN ORDER TO BE RECOGNIZED AND REPORTED APART FROM GOODWILL. SFAS 142 REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS DETERMINED TO HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY AND WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR THAT INDICATE IMPAIRMENT MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED. OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. SFAS 142 REQUIRES THAT INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH FINITE USEFUL LIVES BE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR RESPECTIVE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 144. SFAS 144 REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT LONG-LIVED ASSETS BE MEASURED AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING AMOUNT OR FAIR VALUE, LESS COST TO SELL. WE REVIEW OUR INTANGIBLES WITH DETERMINABLE LIVES AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. OUR JUDGMENT REGARDING THE EXISTENCE OF IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS IS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS, CHANGES IN THE MANNER OF OUR USE OF THE ACQUIRED ASSETS OR OUR OVERALL BUSINESS STRATEGY, AND MARKET AND ECONOMIC TRENDS. IN THE FUTURE, EVENTS COULD CAUSE US TO CONCLUDE THAT IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS EXIST AND THAT CERTAIN OTHER INTANGIBLES WITH DETERMINABLE LIVES AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE IMPAIRED WHICH MAY RESULT IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES FORWARD-LOOKING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RISK OF LOSS IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES, CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE EARNINGS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, OUR MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS CONSISTED OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, OUR NOTE PAYABLE AND CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE CONSISTED OF U.S. TREASURY FIXED RATE SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY FIXED RATE SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED FIXED RATE SECURITIES, FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION, OR FDIC, GUARANTEED FIXED RATE CORPORATE DEBT, PRIVATE CASH FUND SHARES AND A MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITY. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES INCLUDE GENERAL UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS OF THE ISSUING AGENCY, INCLUDING ISSUES FROM THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK, OR FHLB, FANNIE MAE, AND FREDDIE MAC. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES INCLUDE FIXED RATE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC AND THE GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, OR GNMA. FDIC GUARANTEED CORPORATE DEBT INCLUDES OBLIGATIONS OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA SET FORTH UNDER THE TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY GUARANTY PROGRAM, OR TLGP, AND IS UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY THE FDIC. 58 TABLE OF CONTENTS FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC, FHLB AND GNMA ARE REGULATED BY THE RECENTLY ESTABLISHED FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY, OR FHFA. ON SEPTEMBER 7, 2008, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE FHFA AND THE U.S. TREASURY, ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS PLACING BOTH FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC INTO CONSERVATORSHIP, WITH THE FHFA ASSUMING THEIR DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS. ON THAT SAME DAY, THE U.S. TREASURY ESTABLISHED A NEW SECURED LENDING CREDIT FACILITY AVAILABLE TO FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC, WHICH IS INTENDED TO SERVE AS AN ULTIMATE LIQUIDITY BACKSTOP. THIS ACTION, IN ESSENCE, IMPLEMENTED THE TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY BACKSTOP AUTHORITY GRANTED TO THE U.S. TREASURY BY CONGRESS IN JULY 2008, AND WILL BE AVAILABLE UNTIL DECEMBER 2009. THESE MEASURES WERE TAKEN WITH THE GOAL OF PRESERVING THE VALUE OF THE DEBT AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THESE U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCIES AS WELL AS TO ENSURE THAT THESE AGENCIES HAVE FUTURE ACCESS TO CAPITAL. THE U.S. TREASURY AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK, OR FED, CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCIES. WORKING WITH THE CONGRESS AND THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT, THE U.S. TREASURY AND THE FED HAVE PLEDGED TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCIES. WE HAVE NOT RECORDED ANY IMPAIRMENTS AGAINST OUR HOLDINGS IN THESE SECURITIES. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, FAIR VALUES AND RELATED WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE WERE AS FOLLOWS: NOTE PAYABLE: IN DECEMBER 2006, WE PURCHASED AN ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENT, OR API, MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FROM SIEGFRIED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NOTE PAYABLE TO SIEGFRIED APPROXIMATED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTE OF $26.0 MILLION (SEE NOTE 10 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT). ASSUMING OTHER FACTORS ARE HELD CONSTANT, AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES GENERALLY WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NOTE. THE NOTE IS DENOMINATED IN SWISS FRANCS AND ITS FAIR VALUE WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR / SWISS FRANC EXCHANGE RATE. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTE REFLECTS THE U.S. DOLLAR / SWISS FRANC EXCHANGE RATE AND SWISS INTEREST RATES. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS: WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. 59 TABLE OF CONTENTS WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PROTECT AGAINST CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED EXPENSES INCURRED BY SUBSIDIARIES IN EUROPE. WE ALSO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PROTECT AGAINST CHANGES IN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT SALES IN EUROPE. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AND ACCORDINGLY, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THEM ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS. ANY INEFFECTIVENESS ON THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IS REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 HAD AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $704.2 MILLION AND HAD SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 24 MONTHS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE CONTRACTS WAS A NET LIABILITY OF $48.4 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND IS REFLECTED IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OF $1.6 MILLION AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES OF $50.0 MILLION. WE ALSO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN RECOGNIZED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE HAD FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING DENOMINATED IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES, INCLUDING EUROS, SWISS FRANCS, BRITISH POUNDS, JAPANESE YEN AND U.S. DOLLARS, WITH AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $56.6 MILLION AND EXPIRING WITHIN 12 MONTHS. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE ECONOMIC HEDGES OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE REMEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEM. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WAS A NET LIABILITY OF $9.1 MILLION AND IS INCLUDED IN OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES. ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, WE BELIEVE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS A REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES. ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2008 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WOULD CHANGE BY APPROXIMATELY $75.8 MILLION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS EITHER HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES OR HEDGE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE ENTITIES FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE EITHER REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS OR REMEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEM. 60 TABLE OF CONTENTS
