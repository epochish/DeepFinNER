GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES, SALES DISCOUNTS, GOVERNMENT REBATES, AND CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES UNDER THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES' SPECIFICATIONS TO HELP ENSURE THE PRODUCT'S SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER OUR PROPRIETARY "SYSTEM FOR THALIDOMIDE EDUCATION AND PRESCRIBING SAFETY," OR S.T.E.P.S.®, PROGRAM, WHICH IS A COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION AND RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF PROVIDING FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES' SPECIFICATIONS TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. VIDAZA®, ISTODAX® AND ABRAXANE® ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS THALOMID® AND REVLIMID®. 54 TABLE OF CONTENTS WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. AS NOTED ABOVE, REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY. THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT. SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. NET REVENUES FOR THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY A COMPONENT OF THE HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2011 AND REQUIRED MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT'S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS ACTUAL INVOICE DATA THROUGHOUT 2011. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS INCURRED. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES. THE HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT MANDATED AN ANNUAL FEE IN 2011 PAYABLE BY BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUG MANUFACTURERS AND IMPORTERS ON BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THE FEE, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL, IS INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ON THE 2011 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE PROVIDE A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER 55 TABLE OF CONTENTS INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY. CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA. SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BELOW FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS AND THE BALANCE IN THE RELATED ALLOWANCE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS): 56 TABLE OF CONTENTS A COMPARISON OF ALLOWANCES FOR SALES WITHIN EACH OF THE FOUR CATEGORIES NOTED ABOVE FOR 2011 AND 2010 FOLLOWS: 2011 COMPARED TO 2010: RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES INCREASED BY $10.3 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO APPROXIMATELY $7.7 MILLION RELATED TO PROVISIONS FOR PRODUCTS WITH QUALITY ISSUES FROM CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS.

CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES INCREASED BY $34.8 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, PRIMARILY DUE TO A $17.7 MILLION INCREASE IN CHARGEBACKS RESULTING FROM BOTH AN INCREASE IN SALES, INCLUDING THE ADDITION OF ABRAXANE®, AND AN INCREASE IN CERTAIN CHARGEBACK RATES, WHICH ARE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH MEDICAID REBATE RATES. OTHER INCREASES INCLUDED $5.6 MILLION FROM TRICARE DUE TO INCREASED UTILIZATION IN THE CURRENT YEAR, DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES OF $6.5 MILLION AND $2.3 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT. 57 TABLE OF CONTENTS COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS): COST OF GOODS SOLD AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS): COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS) INCREASED BY $119.3 MILLION TO $425.9 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCLUSION IN 2011 OF A $90.3 MILLION INVENTORY STEP-UP AMORTIZATION ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO SALES OF ABRAXANE® SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS COMPARED TO A $34.7 MILLION STEP-UP AMORTIZATION ADJUSTMENT INCLUDED IN 2010.

AS A PERCENT OF NET PRODUCT SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS) INCREASED TO 9.1% IN 2011 COMPARED TO 8.7% IN 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INVENTORY STEP-UP AMORTIZATION ADJUSTMENT FOR ABRAXANE®. EXCLUDING THE STEP-UP AMORTIZATION ADJUSTMENTS IN BOTH YEARS, THE COST OF GOODS SOLD RATIOS WERE 7.1% AND 7.7% IN 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS) INCREASED BY $90.2 MILLION TO $306.5 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009.

THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RESULTED FROM A CHANGE IN THE PROBABILITY OF OBTAINING PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL LABELING FOR THE TREATMENT OF NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER FOR ABRAXANE® IN THE UNITED STATES. THE REMAINDER OF THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT SPENDING IN SUPPORT OF MULTIPLE PROGRAMS ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF DISEASES, WITH LATE STAGE CLINICAL TRIALS COMPLETING ENROLLMENT DURING 2011.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS): SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY $275.7 MILLION TO $1.226 BILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, PARTLY DUE TO HIGHER MARKETING AND SALES-RELATED EXPENSES RESULTING FROM ONGOING PRODUCT LAUNCH ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING REVLIMID® IN JAPAN, PREPARATION FOR THE FILING AND LAUNCH OF REVLIMID® IN CHINA, ISTODAX® IN PTCL IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABRAXANE® IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE. IN ADDITION, 2011 INCLUDED AN INCREASE OF $72.1 MILLION IN EXPENSES RELATED TO THE ABRAXIS BUSINESS, RESULTING FROM A FULL YEAR'S EXPENSE BEING INCLUDED IN 2011. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY $196.8 MILLION TO $950.6 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, PARTLY DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF $50.0 MILLION IN EXPENSES RELATED TO ABRAXIS AND GLOUCESTER SUBSEQUENT TO THEIR ACQUISITION DATES, A $19.1 MILLION INCREASE IN FACILITIES COSTS AND AN $11.7 MILLION INCREASE IN DONATIONS TO NON-PROFIT FOUNDATIONS. THE REMAINING INCREASE INCLUDES HIGHER MARKETING AND SALES RELATED EXPENSES, RESULTING FROM ONGOING PRODUCT LAUNCH ACTIVITIES OF VIDAZA® IN EUROPE AND ISTODAX® IN THE UNITED STATES, IN ADDITION TO THE CONTINUED EXPANSION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES. AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS: AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS SUMMARIZED BELOW FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 (IN THOUSANDS): AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCREASED BY $86.0 MILLION TO $289.2 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A FULL YEAR'S AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS OBTAINED IN THE OCTOBER 2010 ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS BEING INCLUDED IN 2011. IN ADDITION, IN JUNE 2011, THE FDA APPROVED ISTODAX®, WHICH WAS OBTAINED IN THE JANUARY 2010 ACQUISITION OF GLOUCESTER, FOR TREATMENT OF PTCL IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE 61 TABLE OF CONTENTS RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY. AS A RESULT OF THE FDA APPROVAL, AMORTIZATION OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET COMMENCED WITH AN 8.8 YEAR EXPECTED USEFUL LIFE, INCREASING AMORTIZATION EXPENSE BY $17.8 MILLION. AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCREASED BY $119.8 MILLION TO $203.2 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, PRIMARILY DUE TO $95.8 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH AN ACCELERATION OF AMORTIZATION BEGINNING IN 2010 RELATED TO THE VIDAZA® INTANGIBLE RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION OF PHARMION. THE REVISED MONTHLY AMORTIZATION REFLECTS AN UPDATED SALES FORECAST RELATED TO VIDAZA®. AN INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION EXPENSE DUE TO THE INITIATION OF AMORTIZATION RELATED TO THE ABRAXIS AND GLOUCESTER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN DEVELOPED PRODUCT RIGHTS OBTAINED IN THE PHARMION ACQUISITION BECOMING FULLY AMORTIZED DURING 2009. ACQUISITION RELATED (GAINS) CHARGES AND RESTRUCTURING, NET: ACQUISITION RELATED (GAINS) CHARGES AND RESTRUCTURING, NET WAS A NET GAIN OF $142.3 MILLION IN 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO A $151.5 MILLION FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT TO THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LIABILITY RELATED TO PUBLICLY TRADED CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS, OR CVRS, THAT WERE ISSUED AS PART OF THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS. THE FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY $4.0 MILLION IN ACCRETION OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO U.S. AND EU APPROVAL OF ISTODAX® FOR TREATMENT OF PTCL AND $5.2 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ACQUISITION RELATED CHARGES. ACQUISITION RELATED (GAINS) CHARGES AND RESTRUCTURING, NET WAS A CHARGE OF $47.2 MILLION IN 2010 AND INCLUDED $22.7 MILLION IN ACCRETION OF THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF GLOUCESTER IN JANUARY 2010 AND $24.5 MILLION IN NET COSTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS IN OCTOBER 2010. IN ADDITION TO ACQUISITION RELATED FEES OF $21.4 MILLION, THE COSTS RELATED TO ABRAXIS INCLUDED RESTRUCTURING COSTS OF $16.1 MILLION, PARTLY OFFSET BY A $13.0 FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT TO THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LIABILITY RELATED TO CVRS THAT WERE ISSUED AS PART OF THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS. THE RESTRUCTURING COSTS ARE PRIMARILY SEVERANCE RELATED. INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET: INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET IS SUMMARIZED BELOW FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS): INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET DECREASED BY $18.9 MILLION TO $25.9 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $14.2 MILLION REDUCTION IN INTEREST INCOME DUE TO LOWER OVERALL YIELDS, A $7.4 MILLION NET REDUCTION IN GAINS ON SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND A $0.3 MILLION DECREASE IN DIVIDEND INCOME, PARTLY OFFSET BY A $3.0 MILLION NET DECREASE IN THE AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND DISCOUNTS RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES. INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET DECREASED BY $32.0 MILLION TO $44.8 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $19.6 MILLION NET REDUCTION IN GAINS ON SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 AND A $13.6 MILLION REDUCTION IN INTEREST 62 TABLE OF CONTENTS INCOME DUE TO LOWER OVERALL YIELDS AND THE LIQUIDATION OF SECURITIES TO FUND THE ABRAXIS ACQUISITION. EQUITY IN LOSSES OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES: UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, WE RECORDED LOSSES OF $2.8 MILLION, $1.9 MILLION AND $1.1 MILLION IN 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE LOSSES IN 2011 AND 2010 INCLUDED LOSSES FROM NON-CORE ABRAXIS EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS WHICH WERE DIVESTED IN APRIL 2011. INTEREST EXPENSE: INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $42.7 MILLION, $12.6 MILLION AND $2.0 MILLION IN 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE $30.1 MILLION INCREASE IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $29.6 MILLION INCREASE IN INTEREST ACCRUED ON THE $1.25 BILLION IN SENIOR NOTES ISSUED IN OCTOBER 2010 AND TO THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER BEGINNING IN SEPTEMBER 2011. WE ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH 2011 TO CONVERT A PORTION OF OUR INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO THE SENIOR NOTES FROM FIXED RATE TO FLOATING RATE TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN INTEREST EXPENSE WITH INTEREST INCOME RECEIVED ON OUR CASH EQUIVALENT AND INVESTMENT BALANCES. IN AUGUST 2011, WE SETTLED THE SWAP CONTRACTS RESULTING IN THE RECEIPT OF $34.3 MILLION. THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SWAP SETTLEMENT ARE BEING ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR $500.0 MILLION, 2.45% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE IN 2015. THERE WERE NO INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2011. OTHER INCOME, NET: OTHER INCOME, NET IS SUMMARIZED BELOW FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 (IN THOUSANDS): OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET WAS A NET EXPENSE OF $3.6 MILLION IN 2011 AND $7.2 MILLION IN 2010. THE $3.7 MILLION DECREASE IN EXPENSE IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $3.6 MILLION ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GRANT RECEIVED FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY IN 2011. OTHER INCOME, NET DECREASED BY $67.7 MILLION IN 2010 TO A NET EXPENSE OF $7.2 MILLION COMPARED TO AN INCOME OF $60.5 MILLION IN 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN NET GAINS ON FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT HAD NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO OFFSET NET FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES. INCOME TAX PROVISION: THE INCOME TAX PROVISION DECREASED BY $30.4 MILLION TO $102.1 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE FULL YEAR 2011 UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 11.5% REFLECTS THE IMPACT FROM OUR LOW TAX SWISS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF A SHIFT IN EARNINGS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND LOWER TAX FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, AND TAX DEDUCTIONS RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITIONS. THE DECREASE IN THE UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ALSO REFLECTS BENEFITS FROM AN INCREASE IN ACQUISITION-RELATED CHARGES, INCLUDING AN IPR&D ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $118.0 MILLION AND A NON-TAXABLE GAIN FROM A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LIABILITY UNDER THE CVR AGREEMENT RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS OF $151.5 MILLION. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS REDUCED BY 4.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2011 AS A RESULT OF DISCRETE ITEMS WHICH INCLUDED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO A FOREIGN TAX CREDIT, A DECREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN ONGOING INCOME TAX AUDITS AND EXPIRATIONS OF STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS, AND A NET TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO CHANGES IN STATE TAX LAWS. 63 TABLE OF CONTENTS THE INCOME TAX PROVISION DECREASED BY $66.5 MILLION TO $132.4 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009. THE FULL YEAR 2010 UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 15.9% REFLECTS THE IMPACT FROM OUR LOW TAX SWISS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF A SHIFT IN EARNINGS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND LOWER TAX FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, AND TAX DEDUCTIONS RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITIONS. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS REDUCED BY 2.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2010 AS A RESULT OF DISCRETE ITEMS WHICH INCLUDED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO A SETTLEMENT OF A TAX EXAMINATION AND THE REDUCTION IN A VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATED TO CERTAIN TAX CARRYFORWARDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN ONGOING INCOME TAX AUDITS. THE INCOME TAX PROVISION FOR 2009 INCLUDED A FULL YEAR UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 21.8%. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS REDUCED BY 1.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2009 AS A RESULT OF DISCRETE ITEMS WHICH INCLUDED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO FILING OUR 2008 INCOME TAX RETURNS WITH CERTAIN ITEMS BEING MORE FAVORABLE THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED AND SETTLEMENT OF TAX EXAMINATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN ONGOING INCOME TAX AUDITS. NET INCOME: NET INCOME AND PER COMMON SHARE AMOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA): NET INCOME FOR 2011 REFLECTS THE EARNINGS IMPACT FROM HIGHER SALES OF REVLIMID®, VIDAZA® AND A FULL YEAR'S SALES OF ABRAXANE®. THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF HIGHER REVENUES WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SPENDING FOR NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, EXPANSION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS AND AN INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF SENIOR NOTES IN OCTOBER 2010. EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE WERE ALSO FAVORABLY IMPACTED IN 2011 BY THE REPURCHASE OF 38.3 MILLION COMMON SHARES UNDER OUR COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, REDUCING OUR OUTSTANDING SHARE BASE. NET INCOME FOR 2010 REFLECTS THE EARNINGS IMPACT FROM HIGHER SALES OF REVLIMID® AND VIDAZA®. THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF HIGHER REVENUES WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SPENDING FOR NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, EXPANSION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND THE ADDITIONAL COSTS AND INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS. 64 TABLE OF CONTENTS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE COMPONENTS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 (IN THOUSANDS): (1)INCLUDES CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET OF ALLOWANCES, INVENTORY AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, LESS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES, INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES. WE RELY PRIMARILY ON POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AND BORROWINGS IN THE FORM OF LONG-TERM NOTES PAYABLE AND, BEGINNING IN SEPTEMBER 2011, SHORT-TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER TO PROVIDE FOR OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. WE EXPECT CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR EXPENDITURES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TRIALS, COMMERCIALIZATION OF NEW PRODUCTS, INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND EXISTING SOURCES OF AND ACCESS TO FINANCING ARE ADEQUATE TO FUND OUR OPERATING NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AND OUR PLANS TO REPURCHASE STOCK OR PURSUE OTHER STRATEGIC BUSINESS INITIATIVES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IN JANUARY 2012, WE ANNOUNCED ONE SUCH STRATEGIC BUSINESS INITIATIVE WHEN WE AND AVILA THERAPEUTICS, INC., OR AVILA, A PRIVATELY-HELD BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY, ANNOUNCED A DEFINITIVE MERGER AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH WE WILL ACQUIRE AVILA, SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF THE APPLICABLE WAITING PERIOD UNDER THE HART-SCOTT-RODINO ANTITRUST IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 1976, FOR $350 MILLION IN CASH PLUS UP TO $575 MILLION IN CONTINGENT DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL MILESTONES. WE CONSIDER THE CUMULATIVE UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES TO BE INDEFINITELY INVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. OF THE TOTAL CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, APPROXIMATELY $2.3 BILLION WAS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS AND IS INTENDED FOR USE IN OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS. WE DO NOT RELY ON THESE UNREMITTED EARNINGS AS A SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR OUR DOMESTIC BUSINESS AS WE EXPECT TO HAVE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW IN THE UNITED STATES TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC NEEDS. CONSEQUENTLY, 65 TABLE OF CONTENTS WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED FOR U.S. FEDERAL OR STATE INCOME TAXES ON THESE UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS. WHILE WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE CHANGING OUR INTENTION REGARDING PERMANENTLY REINVESTED EARNINGS, IF CERTAIN FOREIGN EARNINGS PREVIOUSLY TREATED AS PERMANENTLY REINVESTED ARE REPATRIATED, THE RELATED U.S. TAX LIABILITY MAY BE REDUCED BY ANY FOREIGN INCOME TAXES PAID ON THESE EARNINGS. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM: OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED AN AGGREGATE $4.0 BILLION COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF WHICH WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $1.387 BILLION REMAINING FOR FUTURE SHARE REPURCHASES. DURING 2011 WE USED $2.221 BILLION FOR SHARE REPURCHASES. COMPONENTS OF WORKING CAPITAL CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: WE INVEST OUR EXCESS CASH PRIMARILY IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS, U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT, AGENCY AND SUPRANATIONAL SECURITIES AND GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES. ALL LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND ALL INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE. WE DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. THE $46.9 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, PARTLY OFFSET BY THE $2.221 BILLION CASH PAID OUT UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. FOR MORE INFORMATION RELATED TO THE FAIR VALUE AND VALUATION OF OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES, SEE NOTE 5 TO THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET INCREASED BY $239.1 MILLION TO $945.5 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SALES, INCLUDING SALES OF REVLIMID®, VIDAZA® AND ABRAXANE®. AMOUNTS DUE FROM CUSTOMERS INCREASED PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES AND CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. SALES MADE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES TYPICALLY HAVE PAYMENT TERMS THAT ARE GREATER THAN 60 DAYS, THEREBY EXTENDING COLLECTION PERIODS BEYOND THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE EXPECT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE TO CONTINUE TO GROW AS OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES CONTINUE TO EXPAND. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES, THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS IN CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND ASSOCIATED IMPACTS ON THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OUR BUSINESS. OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL IN THESE MARKETS IS TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO PRINCIPALLY GOVERNMENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED HOSPITALS, WHO IN TURN DIRECTLY DELIVER CRITICAL CARE TO PATIENTS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE USED TO TREAT LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES AND WE BELIEVE THIS BUSINESS MODEL ENABLES TIMELY DELIVERY AND ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF 66 TABLE OF CONTENTS PRODUCTS. MANY OF THE OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE RELATED TO GOVERNMENT-FUNDED HOSPITALS AND WE BELIEVE THE RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE ULTIMATELY COLLECTIBLE. SIMILARLY, WE BELIEVE THAT FUTURE SALES TO THESE CUSTOMERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE COLLECTIBLE. THE CREDIT AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WITHIN GREECE, SPAIN, ITALY, AND PORTUGAL, AS WELL AS INCREASING SALES LEVELS IN THOSE COUNTRIES HAVE RESULTED IN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN, AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES TO COLLECT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. OUR TOTAL NET RECEIVABLES IN SPAIN, ITALY AND PORTUGAL ARE COMPOSED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM GOVERNMENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED HOSPITALS AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND AMOUNTED TO $396.1 MILLION AT THE END OF 2011 COMPARED TO $231.6 MILLION AT THE END OF 2010. APPROXIMATELY $81.2 MILLION OF THE $396.1 MILLION RECEIVABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 WAS GREATER THAN ONE YEAR PAST DUE. OUR EXPOSURE TO THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS IN GREECE IS LIMITED, AS WE DO NOT HAVE A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF RECEIVABLES IN GREECE. WE MAINTAIN TIMELY AND DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH HOSPITAL CUSTOMERS IN ITALY, PORTUGAL, AND SPAIN REGARDING BOTH THE CURRENT AND PAST DUE RECEIVABLE BALANCES. WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS FROM THESE COUNTRIES, AND CLOSELY MONITOR THE PLANS FOR PAYMENT AT THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL. WE ALSO REGULARLY REQUEST AND RECEIVE POSITIVE CONFIRMATION OF THE VALIDITY OF OUR RECEIVABLES FROM MOST OF THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES. WE HAVE THE OPTION TO PURSUE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST CERTAIN OF OUR CUSTOMERS. IN VIEW OF THE PROTRACTED TIMELINE ASSOCIATED WITH COLLECTING THE OUTSTANDING BALANCES THROUGH LEGAL ACTION AND THE CURRENT DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, IN MANY INSTANCES, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS TO BE THE BEST APPROACH FOR ANY OF THE PARTIES INVOLVED. IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR ITALY, PORTUGAL, AND SPAIN, WE CONSIDERED THAT THE BALANCE OF PAST DUE RECEIVABLES IS RELATED TO SALES MADE TO GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR SUPPORTED CUSTOMERS. WE REGULARLY MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS IN EUROPE TO ASSESS WHETHER THE LEVEL OF RISK OF DEFAULT FOR ANY CUSTOMERS HAS INCREASED AND NOTE THE ONGOING EFFORTS BY THE EUROPEAN UNION, EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION AND INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND TO SUPPORT COUNTRIES WITH LARGE PUBLIC DEFICITS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT BALANCES. WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR WRITE-OFFS WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLECTION OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN THESE COUNTRIES AS A RESULT OF THEIR ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES AND WE DO NOT EXPECT TO HAVE WRITE-OFFS OR ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. INVENTORY: INVENTORY BALANCES DECREASED BY $70.6 MILLION TO $189.6 MILLION AT THE END OF 2011 COMPARED TO THE END OF 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO A $90.3 MILLION REDUCTION IN ABRAXANE® INVENTORY RELATED TO THE INVENTORY STEP-UP ADJUSTMENT TO FAIR VALUE RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS, WHICH FLOWED THROUGH COST OF GOODS SOLD DURING 2011. THE FAVORABLE IMPACT FROM THE REDUCTION IN THE STEP-UP ADJUSTMENT WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN REVLIMID®, VIDAZA® AND ABRAXANE® INVENTORIES, ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER SALES LEVELS. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS: OTHER CURRENT ASSETS INCREASED BY $120.1 MILLION TO $395.1 MILLION AT THE END OF 2011 COMPARED TO THE END OF 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO A $64.2 MILLION INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, IN ADDITION TO INCREASES IN ROYALTIES RECEIVABLE AND OTHER PREPAID EXPENSES, INCLUDING TAXES AND INSURANCE. COMMERCIAL PAPER: IN SEPTEMBER 2011, WE ENTERED INTO A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, OR THE PROGRAM, UNDER WHICH WE ISSUED UNSECURED COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES, OR COMMERCIAL PAPER, ON A PRIVATE PLACEMENT BASIS UP TO A MAXIMUM AGGREGATE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING AT ANY TIME OF 67 TABLE OF CONTENTS $1.0 BILLION, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH WILL BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE MATURITIES OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MAY VARY, BUT MAY NOT EXCEED 270 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ISSUE. THE COMMERCIAL PAPER IS SOLD UNDER CUSTOMARY TERMS TO A DEALER OR IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET AND IS ISSUED AT A DISCOUNT FROM PAR OR, ALTERNATIVELY, IS SOLD AT PAR AND BEARS VARYING INTEREST RATES ON A FIXED OR FLOATING BASIS. BORROWINGS UNDER THE PROGRAM ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. AS OF THE END OF 2011, $401.4 MILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER WAS OUTSTANDING BEARING AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OF 0.5%. SENIOR UNSECURED CREDIT FACILITY: IN SEPTEMBER 2011, WE ENTERED INTO A SENIOR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, OR THE CREDIT FACILITY, PROVIDING FOR REVOLVING CREDIT IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $1.0 BILLION. SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT FACILITY (BUT IN NO EVENT MORE THAN ONE TIME PER ANNUM), UP TO A MAXIMUM AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $1.250 BILLION. THE CREDIT FACILITY HAS A FIVE-YEAR TERM AND AMOUNTS MAY BE BORROWED FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE CREDIT FACILITY SERVES AS BACKUP LIQUIDITY FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS. AS OF THE END OF 2011, THERE WAS NO OUTSTANDING BORROWING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY. THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS INCLUDING CERTAIN CUSTOMARY FINANCIAL COVENANTS. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL DEBT COVENANTS AS OF THE END OF 2011. CREDIT FACILITY: IN NOVEMBER 2011, WE ENTERED INTO AN UNCOMMITTED FACILITY, OR FACILITY, NOT EXCEEDING AN AGGREGATE OF $125.0 MILLION. ADVANCES ARE TO BE IN CURRENCIES AGREED UPON AND WILL BE FOR PERIODS OF ONE OR THREE MONTHS. INTEREST WILL ACCRUE AND BE CALCULATED IN RESPECT TO EACH ADVANCE ON THE BASIS OF THE NUMBER OF DAYS ELAPSED AND A 360 DAY YEAR IN THE CASE OF ADVANCES IN U.S. DOLLARS AT A RATE PER ANNUM OF 1.0% ABOVE LIBOR. INTEREST ACCRUED ON EACH ADVANCE WILL BE PAID AT ITS MATURITY. THE FACILITY MAY BE TERMINATED AT ANY TIME BY THE LENDING PARTY WITH OR WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE. AS OF THE END OF 2011, $125.0 MILLION WAS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE FACILITY AND ACCOUNTED FOR AS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE WAS REPAID IN JANUARY 2012. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES: ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES DECREASED BY $34.4 MILLION TO $961.7 MILLION AS OF THE END OF 2011 COMPARED TO THE END OF 2010. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PAYMENT OF $180.0 MILLION OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF GLOUCESTER, WHICH HAD A FAIR VALUE OF $171.9 MILLION ON DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND PAYMENT OF A LITIGATION SETTLEMENT, WHICH WAS RESERVED FOR AT $80.0 MILLION IN 2010, MOSTLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN GOVERNMENTAL REBATES AND MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENTS, IN ADDITION TO CLINICAL TRIAL AND COMPENSATION-RELATED ACCRUALS. INCOME TAXES PAYABLE (CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT): INCOME TAXES PAYABLE INCREASED BY $83.2 MILLION TO $646.5 MILLION AS OF THE END OF 2011 COMPARED TO THE END OF 2010, PRIMARILY FROM THE CURRENT PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES OF $187.9 MILLION, MOSTLY OFFSET BY TAX PAYMENTS OF $50.8 MILLION AND A TAX BENEFIT OF STOCK OPTIONS OF $35.0 MILLION. 68 TABLE OF CONTENTS ANALYSIS OF CASH FLOWS CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS): OPERATING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2011 INCREASED BY $627.1 MILLION TO $1.809 BILLION AS COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN EXPANSION OF OUR OPERATIONS AND RELATED INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ASSOCIATED WITH EXPANDING INTERNATIONAL SALES, WHICH TAKE LONGER TO COLLECT, AND THE TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. INVESTING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2011 CHANGED TO A POSITIVE $377.7 MILLION COMPARED TO A NET CASH USE OF $2.107 BILLION IN 2010. THE 2010 INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCLUDED NET CASH USED IN THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS OF $2.315 BILLION AND THE ACQUISITION OF GLOUCESTER OF $337.6 MILLION. INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCLUDED NET SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE IN THE AMOUNT OF $481.8 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO $659.7 MILLION IN 2010. IN APRIL 2011, WE SOLD NON-CORE ASSETS ACQUIRED WITH ABRAXIS TO VARIOUS ENTITIES THAT ARE OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY DR. PATRICK SOON-SHIONG, THE FORMER MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER AND EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF ABRAXIS. WE RECEIVED CASH CONSIDERATION OF $110.0 MILLION, 10% EQUITY OWNERSHIP IN AN ENTITY, ACTIVE BIOMATERIALS, LLC, FORMED WITH CERTAIN OF THE NON-CORE ASSETS WITH REVENUE-PRODUCING POTENTIAL AND A FUTURE ROYALTY STREAM BASED ON NET SALES OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS OF ACTIVE BIOMATERIALS, LLC. THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THIS SALE AMOUNTED TO $93.2 MILLION. FINANCING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2011 WAS $1.655 BILLION COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED OF $1.177 BILLION IN 2010. THE $2.832 BILLION DECREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2011 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN 2010 THAT PROVIDED NET CASH OF $1.237 BILLION AND THE $2.221 BILLION IN COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES IN 2011 UNDER THE COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. IN JULY 2011, WE MADE A PAYMENT OF $180.0 MILLION TO THE FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OF GLOUCESTER IN SATISFACTION OF AN ACQUISITION-RELATED MILESTONE PAYMENT REQUIREMENT BASED ON THE FDA APPROVAL OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL NEW DRUG APPLICATION FOR ISTODAX® FOR TREATMENT IN THE UNITED STATES OF PTCL IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY. THE ACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION FOR THIS MILESTONE WAS $156.7 MILLION, THE SETTLEMENT OF WHICH IS REFLECTED AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS FOR 2011. 69 TABLE OF CONTENTS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 (IN THOUSANDS): (1)THE SENIOR NOTE OBLIGATION AMOUNTS INCLUDE FUTURE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS.

IN GENERAL, WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE LESSORS FOR REAL ESTATE TAXES, INSURANCE, UTILITIES, MAINTENANCE AND OTHER OPERATING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEASES. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE MAJOR FACILITIES THAT WE OCCUPY UNDER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS REFER TO PART I, ITEM 2, "PROPERTIES" OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS: OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS INCLUDE $107.5 MILLION IN CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPLY CONTRACTS. IN DECEMBER 2006, WE PURCHASED AN API MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES LOCATED IN ZOFINGEN, SWITZERLAND. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, OUR REMAINING COMMITMENT RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION WAS $21.4 MILLION. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE COMMITTED TO INVEST AN AGGREGATE $25.0 MILLION IN TWO INVESTMENT FUNDS OVER A TEN-YEAR PERIOD, WHICH IS CALLABLE AT ANY TIME. ON DECEMBER 31, 2011, OUR REMAINING INVESTMENT COMMITMENT WAS $8.9 MILLION. COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS: WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT INCLUDE THE FUNDING OF CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE MILESTONE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED DEVELOPMENTAL, REGULATORY AND/OR COMMERCIAL 70 TABLE OF CONTENTS TARGETS. OUR OBLIGATION TO FUND THESE EFFORTS IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROGRAMS AND/OR THE LACK OF ANY ADVERSE EVENTS WHICH COULD CAUSE THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE PROGRAMS. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE ATTAINMENT OF SPECIFIED DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND ACCORDINGLY, NO AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010 CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. POTENTIAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $4.5 BILLION, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $2.7 BILLION CONTINGENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF VARIOUS RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES AND APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION IN SALES-BASED MILESTONES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS ARE IDENTIFIED IN NOTE 19 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. NEW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD, OR FASB, ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE, OR ASU, NO. 2011-11, "BALANCE SHEET (TOPIC 210): DISCLOSURES ABOUT OFFSETTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES," OR ASU 2011-11. UNDER ASU 2011-11, AN ENTITY IS REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE BOTH GROSS AND NET INFORMATION ABOUT INSTRUMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS ELIGIBLE FOR OFFSET IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS WELL AS INSTRUMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS EXECUTED UNDER A MASTER NETTING OR SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT AND WAS ISSUED TO ENABLE USERS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OR POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF THOSE ARRANGEMENTS ON ITS FINANCIAL POSITION. ASU 2011-11 IS REQUIRED TO BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY AND IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE YEARS, BEGINNING ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2013. THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2011-12 IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN SEPTEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2011-08, "INTANGIBLES  GOODWILL AND OTHER (TOPIC 350): TESTING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT," OR ASU 2011-08. THE UPDATE SIMPLIFIES HOW A COMPANY TESTS GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT. ASU 2011-08 ALLOWS A COMPANY THE OPTION TO FIRST ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE TWO-STEP QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST. UNDER THAT OPTION, AN ENTITY WOULD NO LONGER BE REQUIRED TO CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT UNLESS THE ENTITY DETERMINES, BASED ON THAT QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT ITS FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. ASU 2011-08 IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL AND INTERIM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS PERFORMED FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2011. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2011-08 IN 2012 IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN JUNE 2011, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2011-05, "COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220)," OR ASU 2011-05. ASU 2011-05 WAS ISSUED TO IMPROVE THE COMPARABILITY, CONSISTENCY AND TRANSPARENCY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TO INCREASE THE PROMINENCE OF ITEMS REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE GUIDANCE IN ASU 2011-05 ELIMINATES THE OPTION TO PRESENT COMPONENTS OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AS PART OF THE STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND REQUIRES THAT ALL NON-OWNER CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY BE PRESENTED EITHER IN A SINGLE CONTINUOUS STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR IN TWO SEPARATE BUT CONSECUTIVE STATEMENTS. ASU 2011-05 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2011. THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2011-05 WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE, OR ASU, NO. 2011-12, "COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220): DEFERRAL OF THE EFFECTIVE 71 TABLE OF CONTENTS DATE FOR AMENDMENTS TO THE PRESENTATION OF RECLASSIFICATION OF ITEMS OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE NO. 2011-05," OR ASU 2011-12. UNDER ASU 2011-12, THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PRESENTATION OF RECLASSIFICATIONS OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME THAT WERE IN PLACE BEFORE THE ISSUANCE OF UPDATE 2011-05 ARE REINSTATED, EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2011. THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2011-12 IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN MAY 2011, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2011-04, "FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (TOPIC 820)," OR ASU 2011-04. ASU 2011-04 WAS ISSUED TO IMPROVE THE COMPARABILITY OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS PRESENTED AND DISCLOSED IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, OR U.S. GAAP, AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS, OR IFRS. THE GUIDANCE IN ASU 2011-04 EXPLAINS HOW TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE, BUT DOES NOT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND IS NOT INTENDED TO ESTABLISH VALUATION STANDARDS OR AFFECT VALUATION PRACTICES OUTSIDE OF FINANCIAL REPORTING. ASU 2011-04 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2011. THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2011-04 WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IS ONE THAT IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENT'S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL: REVENUE RECOGNITION: REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS OF THE PRODUCT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER. PROVISIONS FOR DISCOUNTS, EARLY PAYMENTS, REBATES, SALES RETURNS AND DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS UNDER TERMS CUSTOMARY IN THE INDUSTRY ARE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SAME PERIOD THE RELATED SALES ARE RECORDED. WE RECORD ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SALE. THE ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR SUCH VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES ARE BASED ON THE SALES TERMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND TREND ANALYSIS. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM ROYALTIES BASED ON LICENSEES' SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS USING OUR TECHNOLOGIES. ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACT TERMS WHEN ROYALTIES FROM LICENSEES CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED. IF ROYALTIES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR COLLECTABILITY OF A ROYALTY AMOUNT IS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED, ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE CASH IS RECEIVED. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES; SALES DISCOUNTS, GOVERNMENT REBATES, AND CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES UNDER THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®. 72 TABLE OF CONTENTS INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES' SPECIFICATIONS TO HELP ENSURE THE PRODUCT'S SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER OUR PROPRIETARY "SYSTEM FOR THALIDOMIDE EDUCATION AND PRESCRIBING SAFETY," OR S.T.E.P.S.®, PROGRAM, WHICH IS A COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION AND RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF PROVIDING FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES' SPECIFICATIONS TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. VIDAZA®, ISTODAX® AND ABRAXANE® ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS THALOMID® AND REVLIMID®. WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. AS NOTED ABOVE, REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY. THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT. SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. NET REVENUES FOR THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY A COMPONENT OF THE U.S. HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT OF 2010, OR HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2011 AND REQUIRED MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT'S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE 73 TABLE OF CONTENTS THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS ACTUAL INVOICE DATA THROUGHOUT 2011. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS INCURRED. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES. THE HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT MANDATED IN 2011 AN ANNUAL FEE PAYABLE BY BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUG MANUFACTURERS AND IMPORTERS ON BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THE FEE, WHICH IS NOT MATERIAL, IS INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ON THE 2011 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE PROVIDE A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY. CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: WE ESTIMATE AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, HISTORICAL PAYMENT PATTERNS, AGING OF RECEIVABLE BALANCES AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF COUNTRIES THEMSELVES AND PROVINCES OR AREAS WITHIN SUCH COUNTRIES WHERE THEY ARE THE ULTIMATE CUSTOMERS. INCOME TAXES: WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. WE PROVIDE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE ACCOUNT FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS PART OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THESE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATE PRIMARILY TO ISSUES COMMON AMONG MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE APPLY A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES WHICH INCLUDE STUDIES PERFORMED BY INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS, ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY AND SUBJECT EXPERTS, EVALUATION OF PUBLIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. WE PROVIDE ESTIMATES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. IF OUR ESTIMATES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ACTUAL OUTCOMES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED. 74 TABLE OF CONTENTS WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE A PORTION WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR RECENT CUMULATIVE EARNINGS EXPERIENCE BY TAXING JURISDICTION, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, CARRYFORWARD PERIODS AVAILABLE TO US FOR TAX REPORTING PURPOSES, VARIOUS INCOME TAX STRATEGIES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT AND, TO THE EXTENT FUTURE EXPECTATIONS CHANGE, WE WOULD HAVE TO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THAT TIME. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION: THE COST OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IS RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL AWARDS GRANTED, USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES METHOD OF VALUATION FOR STOCK OPTIONS. THE FAIR VALUES OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND PERFORMANCE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ARE BASED ON THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH AWARD IS DETERMINED AND THE COMPENSATION COST IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD REQUIRED TO OBTAIN FULL VESTING. COMPENSATION COST TO BE RECOGNIZED REFLECTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF AWARDS EXPECTED TO VEST AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AN ESTIMATE OF AWARD FORFEITURES BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE. OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES: A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF ANY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY BELOW ITS COST THAT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN CARRYING AMOUNT TO FAIR VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT IS CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AND A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE SECURITY ESTABLISHED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INCLUDE: SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE ISSUER'S EARNINGS PERFORMANCE, CREDIT RATING, ASSET QUALITY, BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE ISSUER OPERATES, LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW OUR COST, OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE SECURITY, OUR INTENT NOT TO SELL AND AN EVALUATION AS TO WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO SELL BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR COST BASIS. ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD DIFFER FROM OUR ASSESSMENT. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES: ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN CURRENT EARNINGS OR OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), DEPENDING ON WHETHER A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION AND, IF IT IS, THE TYPE OF HEDGING TRANSACTION. FOR A DERIVATIVE TO QUALIFY AS A HEDGE AT INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE HEDGED PERIOD, WE FORMALLY DOCUMENT THE NATURE AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEM. WE ASSESS, BOTH AT INCEPTION AND ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING TRANSACTIONS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING THE CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS. WE ASSESS HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND RECORD THE GAIN OR LOSS RELATED TO THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IF ANY, TO CURRENT EARNINGS. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER PROBABLE OF OCCURRING, WE DISCONTINUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING AND ANY RELATED UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING 75 TABLE OF CONTENTS THOSE NOT DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION, TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES. THE USE OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE EXPOSURE OF THESE RISKS WITH THE INTENT TO REDUCE OUR RISK OR COST. WE DO NOT USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR SPECULATIVE TRADING PURPOSES AND ARE NOT A PARTY TO LEVERAGED DERIVATIVES. INVESTMENTS: WE APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING TO OUR INVESTMENT IN COMMON STOCK OF AN AFFILIATED COMPANY AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS, WHICH PRIMARILY INVEST IN COMPANIES CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN LIFE SCIENCES SUCH AS BIOTECHNOLOGY, PHARMACEUTICALS, MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY, MEDICAL DEVICES, DIAGNOSTICS AND HEALTH AND WELLNESS. WE ALSO MAINTAIN A PORTFOLIO OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES ON A COST METHOD BASIS WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT. IF AN INVESTMENT'S FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN ITS NET CARRYING VALUE AND THE DECLINE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE. SUCH AN EVALUATION IS JUDGMENTAL AND DEPENDENT ON SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE HAS OCCURRED INCLUDE: MARKET VALUE OR EXIT PRICE OF THE INVESTMENT BASED ON EITHER MARKET-QUOTED PRICES OR FUTURE ROUNDS OF FINANCING BY THE INVESTEE; LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE MARKET VALUE WAS BELOW ITS COST BASIS; FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE INVESTEE; OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT; ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INVESTEE'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN; AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE MAY BE AWARE OF RELATED TO THE INVESTMENT. ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, OR LTIP, DESIGNED TO PROVIDE KEY OFFICERS AND EXECUTIVES WITH PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES CONTINGENT UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED CORPORATE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES COVERING A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLES RUNNING CONCURRENTLY ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2013 AND 2014. PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THE PERFORMANCE CYCLES ENDING IN 2012 AND 2013 ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE THREE-YEAR CYCLE: 25% ON NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE; 25% ON NON-GAAP NET INCOME; AND 50% ON TOTAL NON-GAAP REVENUE, AS DEFINED. THE PERFORMANCE CYCLE ENDING IN 2014 IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS IN 2014: 37.5% ON NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE; 37.5% ON TOTAL NON-GAAP REVENUE, AS DEFINED; AND 25% ON RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, WHICH IS A MEASUREMENT OF OUR STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR COMPARED WITH A GROUP OF OTHER COMPANIES IN THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. PAYOUTS MAY BE IN THE RANGE OF 0% TO 200% OF THE PARTICIPANT'S SALARY FOR THE PLANS. AWARDS ARE PAYABLE IN CASH OR, AT OUR DISCRETION, IN OUR COMMON STOCK OR A MIXTURE OF CASH AND OUR COMMON STOCK. FOR SELECTED PARTICIPANTS AT OUR DISCRETION, AWARDS ARE PAYABLE IN OUR COMMON STOCK, WITH THE NUMBER OF SHARES DETERMINED USING THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE FOR THE 30 TRADING DAYS PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CYCLE, OR A MIXTURE OF CASH AND OUR COMMON STOCK. PAYMENTS MADE IN OUR COMMON STOCK ARE RESTRICTED FROM TRADING FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS. WE ACCRUE THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE LIABILITY OVER EACH THREE-YEAR CYCLE. PRIOR TO THE END OF A THREE-YEAR CYCLE, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT DURING THE CYCLE. UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT EQUAL TO THEIR TARGET AWARD, OR AN AWARD BASED ON ACTUAL PERFORMANCE, IF HIGHER, THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL. 76 TABLE OF CONTENTS ACCRUALS RECORDED FOR THE LTIP ENTAIL MAKING CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE, NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND NON-GAAP REVENUES, AS DEFINED; THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED. ACCRUALS FOR THE LTIP ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND REVISED ACCORDINGLY SO THAT THE LIABILITY RECORDED REFLECTS UPDATED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PAYOUTS. IN ESTIMATING THE ACCRUALS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DATE FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, EXPECTED RESULTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, OPERATING TRENDS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICING AND COMPETITION. VALUATION OF GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IPR&D: WE HAVE RECORDED GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IPR&D PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ACQUISITIONS OF PHARMION, GLOUCESTER AND ABRAXIS. WHEN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, ARE ACQUIRED, WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS ARE TYPICALLY USED IN THESE VALUATIONS IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, AND THE MODELS REQUIRE THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: PROJECTING REGULATORY APPROVALS, ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM PRODUCT SALES RESULTING FROM COMPLETED PRODUCTS AND IN-PROCESS PROJECTS AND DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES AND PROBABILITY RATES GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. WE TEST OUR GOODWILL ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT EACH NOVEMBER 30. WE ARE ORGANIZED AS A SINGLE REPORTING UNIT AND THEREFORE THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS DONE USING OUR OVERALL MARKET VALUE, AS DETERMINED BY OUR TRADED SHARE PRICE, AS COMPARED TO OUR BOOK VALUE OF NET ASSETS. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE AMORTIZED TO THEIR ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR. INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO IPR&D PRODUCT RIGHTS ARE TREATED AS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND NOT AMORTIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS APPROVED FOR SALE BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN SPECIFIED MARKETS. AT THAT TIME, WE WILL DETERMINE THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET, RECLASSIFY THE ASSET OUT OF IPR&D AND BEGIN AMORTIZATION. IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS ALSO PERFORMED AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. SUCH TEST ENTAILS COMPLETING AN UPDATED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET. OUR IPR&D PRODUCT RIGHTS WERE OBTAINED IN THE GLOUCESTER AND ABRAXIS ACQUISITIONS. THE GLOUCESTER RELATED PRODUCT RIGHTS WILL BECOME DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES WHEN MARKETING APPROVAL IS RECEIVED FOR ISTODAX® FOR TREATMENT OF PTCL IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE ABRAXIS RELATED PRODUCT RIGHTS WILL BECOME DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES WHEN MARKETING APPROVAL IS RECEIVED FOR ABRAXANE® FOR TREATMENT OF EITHER NSCLC, PANCREATIC CANCER OR MELANOMA IN A MAJOR MARKET, TYPICALLY EITHER THE UNITED STATES OR THE EUROPEAN UNION, OR IN A SERIES OF OTHER COUNTRIES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN SPECIFIED CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. VALUATION OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION: WE RECORD CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION AT ITS FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION 77 TABLE OF CONTENTS DATE, AND FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT REPORTING PERIOD REVALUE THESE OBLIGATIONS AND RECORD INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPERATING EARNINGS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. CHANGES TO CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION OBLIGATIONS CAN RESULT FROM MOVEMENTS IN PUBLICLY TRADED SHARE PRICES OF CVRS, ADJUSTMENTS TO DISCOUNT RATES AND PERIODS, UPDATES IN THE ASSUMED ACHIEVEMENT OR TIMING OF ANY DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES OR CHANGES IN THE PROBABILITY OF CERTAIN CLINICAL EVENTS AND CHANGES IN THE ASSUMED PROBABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATORY APPROVAL. THE ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT AND ANY CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION EXPENSE RECORDED IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. OUR CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES WERE ACQUIRED IN THE ACQUISITIONS OF GLOUCESTER AND ABRAXIS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GLOUCESTER CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY IS BASED ON THE DISCOUNT RATE, PROBABILITY AND ESTIMATED TIMING OF A CASH MILESTONE PAYMENT TO THE FORMER GLOUCESTER SHAREHOLDERS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ABRAXIS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY IS BASED ON THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES FORWARD-LOOKING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RISK OF LOSS IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES, CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE EARNINGS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, OUR MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS CONSISTED OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, LONG-TERM DEBT AND CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE CONSISTED OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT, AGENCY AND SUPRANATIONAL SECURITIES, GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES AND A MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITY. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES INCLUDE GENERAL UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS EITHER ISSUED DIRECTLY BY OR GUARANTEED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTERPRISES. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MBS INCLUDE MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION AND THE GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION. NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT, AGENCY AND SUPRANATIONAL SECURITIES CONSIST OF DIRECT OBLIGATIONS OF HIGHLY RATED GOVERNMENTS OF NATIONS OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES, OBLIGATIONS OF SPONSORED AGENCIES AND OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE GUARANTEED OR SUPPORTED BY HIGHLY RATED GOVERNMENTS OF NATIONS OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES. CORPORATE DEBT-GLOBAL INCLUDES OBLIGATIONS ISSUED BY INVESTMENT-GRADE CORPORATIONS INCLUDING SOME ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN GUARANTEED BY GOVERNMENTS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A 78 TABLE OF CONTENTS SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, FAIR VALUES AND RELATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS): LONG-TERM DEBT: IN OCTOBER 2010, WE ISSUED A TOTAL OF $1.25 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2.45% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2015, $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.95% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2020 AND $250.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 5.7% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2040. THE NOTES WERE ISSUED AT 99.854%, 99.745% AND 99.813% OF PAR, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE DISCOUNT AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. INTEREST ON THE NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON APRIL 15 AND OCTOBER 15 EACH YEAR BEGINNING APRIL 15, 2011 AND THE PRINCIPAL ON EACH NOTE IS DUE IN FULL AT THEIR RESPECTIVE MATURITY DATES. THE NOTES MAY BE REDEEMED AT OUR OPTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT ANY TIME AT A REDEMPTION PRICE DEFINED IN A MAKE-WHOLE CLAUSE EQUALING ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST PLUS THE GREATER OF 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES TO BE REDEEMED OR THE SUM OF THE PRESENT VALUES OF THE REMAINING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL. IF WE EXPERIENCE A CHANGE OF CONTROL ACCOMPANIED BY A DOWNGRADE OF THE DEBT TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO OFFER TO REPURCHASE THE NOTES AT A PURCHASE PRICE EQUAL TO 101% OF THEIR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST. WE ARE SUBJECT TO COVENANTS WHICH LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PLEDGE PROPERTIES AS SECURITY UNDER BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING OUR PROPERTY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SENIOR NOTES OUTSTANDING WAS $1.294 BILLION. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS: WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PROTECT AGAINST CHANGES IN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010 HAD SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 36 MONTHS. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES UNDER ASC 815 AND, ACCORDINGLY, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THEM ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), OR OCI, AND RECLASSIFIED TO OPERATIONS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT OPERATIONS. ANY INEFFECTIVENESS ON THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IS REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. FOREIGN 79 TABLE OF CONTENTS CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS): WE CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF OUR OWN AND THE COUNTERPARTIES' CREDIT RISK ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO EXECUTE ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONTRACT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, CREDIT RISK DID NOT MATERIALLY CHANGE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS. WE RECOGNIZED DECREASES IN NET PRODUCT SALES FOR CERTAIN EFFECTIVE CASH FLOW HEDGE INSTRUMENTS OF $33 THOUSAND IN 2011 AND INCREASES OF $47.7 MILLION IN 2010. THESE SETTLEMENTS WERE RECORDED IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED FORECASTED SALES OCCURRED. CHANGES IN TIME VALUE, WHICH WE EXCLUDED FROM THE HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT, WERE INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. WE ALSO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN RECOGNIZED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS HEDGES UNDER ASC 815 AND, ACCORDINGLY, ANY CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS HEDGES RESULTED IN GAINS OF $31.9 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO LOSSES OF $70 THOUSAND IN 2010. THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD NON-DESIGNATED HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010 WERE $916.9 MILLION AND $848.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, WE BELIEVE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS A REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES. ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2011 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WOULD CHANGE BY APPROXIMATELY $225.6 MILLION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS EITHER HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES OR RELATE TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE ENTITIES' FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE EITHER REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS OR RE-MEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR LIABILITY. FROM TIME TO TIME WE ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS TO CONVERT A PORTION OF OUR INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE FROM FIXED RATE TO FLOATING RATE TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN INTEREST EXPENSE WITH INTEREST INCOME RECEIVED ON OUR CASH EQUIVALENT AND INVESTMENT BALANCES. THERE WERE NO INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2011. 80 TABLE OF CONTENTS ITEM 7.

THE INCREASE WAS COMPRISED OF NET VOLUME INCREASES OF $1.157 BILLION, PRICE DECREASES OF $4.9 MILLION AND A FAVORABLE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN EXCHANGE OF $38.7 MILLION. THE DECREASE IN PRICES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP REBATES RESULTING FROM THE HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT AND AN INCREASE IN REBATES TO U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTS RESULTING FROM THEIR ATTEMPTS TO REDUCE HEALTH CARE COSTS, PARTLY OFFSET BY PRODUCT PRICE INCREASES. TOTAL NET PRODUCT SALES FOR 2010 INCREASED BY $941.1 MILLION, OR 36.7%, TO $3.508 BILLION COMPARED TO 2009. THE INCREASE WAS COMPRISED OF NET VOLUME INCREASES OF $892.5 MILLION, PRICE DECREASES OF $2.1 MILLION AND THE FAVORABLE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN EXCHANGE OF $50.7 MILLION.

REVLIMID® NET SALES INCREASED BY $739.0 MILLION, OR 29.9%, TO $3.208 BILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED UNIT SALES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. INCREASED TREATMENT DURATION OF PATIENTS USING REVLIMID® IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND AN INCREASE IN MARKET PENETRATION CONTRIBUTED TO U.S. GROWTH. THE GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS REFLECTS THE EXPANSION OF OUR COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES IN ADDITION TO PRODUCT REIMBURSEMENT APPROVALS AND THE LAUNCH OF REVLIMID® IN JAPAN IN THE LATTER PART OF 2010. NET SALES OF REVLIMID® INCREASED BY $762.7 MILLION, OR 44.7%, TO $2.469 BILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED UNIT SALES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

NET SALES OF VIDAZA® INCREASED BY $147.1 MILLION, OR 38.0%, TO $534.3 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS RESULTING FROM THE COMPLETION OF PRODUCT LAUNCHES IN KEY EUROPEAN REGIONS DURING THE LATTER PART OF 2009 AND THE INCREASE IN TREATMENT DURATION OF PATIENTS USING VIDAZA®. THALOMID® NET SALES DECREASED BY $50.5 MILLION, OR 13.0%, TO $339.1 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER UNIT VOLUMES IN THE UNITED STATES. NET SALES OF THALOMID® DECREASED BY $47.3 MILLION, OR 10.8%, TO $389.6 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER UNIT VOLUMES IN THE UNITED STATES RESULTING FROM THE INCREASED USE OF REVLIMID®. NET SALES OF ABRAXANE® INCREASED BY $314.5 MILLION TO $385.9 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF A FULL YEAR OF SALES IN 2011 COMPARED TO THE 2.5 MONTH PERIOD IN 2010 AFTER THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS.

COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER REVENUE: REVENUE FROM COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER SOURCES INCREASED BY $9.0 MILLION TO $19.5 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO RECEIPT OF A $6.3 MILLION MILESTONE PAYMENT IN FEBRUARY 2011 RELATED TO THE APPROVAL OF VIDAZA® IN JAPAN AND AN INCREASE IN CERTAIN MANUFACTURING AND MANAGEMENT FEES IN 2011. REVENUE FROM COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND FROM OTHER SOURCES DECREASED BY $3.2 MILLION TO $10.5 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO RECEIPT OF A $5.0 MILLION MILESTONE PAYMENT IN 2009 WHICH WAS NOT DUPLICATED IN 2010, PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN LICENSING FEES AND THE INCLUSION OF ABRAXIS OTHER REVENUES SUBSEQUENT TO THE OCTOBER 2010 ACQUISITION DATE. ROYALTY REVENUE: ROYALTY REVENUE INCREASED BY $16.1 MILLION TO $122.9 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN ROYALTIES EARNED FROM NOVARTIS ON ITS SALES OF FOCALIN XR® AND THE ENTIRE RITALIN® FAMILY OF DRUGS, WHICH WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN RESIDUAL PAYMENTS EARNED BY US FROM GLAXOSMITHKLINE PLC, OR GSK'S, ALKERAN® REVENUES.

GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES, SALES DISCOUNTS, GOVERNMENT REBATES, AND CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES UNDER THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES' SPECIFICATIONS TO HELP ENSURE THE PRODUCT'S SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER OUR PROPRIETARY "SYSTEM FOR THALIDOMIDE EDUCATION AND PRESCRIBING SAFETY," OR S.T.E.P.S.®, PROGRAM, WHICH IS A COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION AND RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF PROVIDING FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES' SPECIFICATIONS TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. VIDAZA®, ISTODAX® AND ABRAXANE® ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS THALOMID® AND REVLIMID®. 54 TABLE OF CONTENTS WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. AS NOTED ABOVE, REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY. THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT. SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. NET REVENUES FOR THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY A COMPONENT OF THE HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2011 AND REQUIRED MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT'S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS ACTUAL INVOICE DATA THROUGHOUT 2011. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS INCURRED. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES. THE HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT MANDATED AN ANNUAL FEE IN 2011 PAYABLE BY BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUG MANUFACTURERS AND IMPORTERS ON BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THE FEE, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL, IS INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ON THE 2011 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE PROVIDE A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER 55 TABLE OF CONTENTS INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY. CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA. SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BELOW FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS AND THE BALANCE IN THE RELATED ALLOWANCE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS): 56 TABLE OF CONTENTS A COMPARISON OF ALLOWANCES FOR SALES WITHIN EACH OF THE FOUR CATEGORIES NOTED ABOVE FOR 2011 AND 2010 FOLLOWS: 2011 COMPARED TO 2010: RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES INCREASED BY $10.3 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO APPROXIMATELY $7.7 MILLION RELATED TO PROVISIONS FOR PRODUCTS WITH QUALITY ISSUES FROM CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS. DISCOUNTS INCREASED BY $3.1 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUE INCREASES IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, BOTH OF WHICH OFFER DISCOUNT PROGRAMS, AND EXPANSION INTO NEW INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. GOVERNMENT REBATES INCREASED BY $69.0 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $52.5 MILLION IN REBATE RATES IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND $23.9 MILLION IN INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP, PARTLY OFFSET BY A $5.4 MILLION BENEFIT RELATED TO A REFINEMENT OF PRIOR YEAR ESTIMATES FOR MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES INCREASED BY $70.2 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. CHARGEBACKS INCREASED BY $33.3 MILLION, INCLUDING $23.2 MILLION RELATED TO THE INCLUSION OF ABRAXANE® SALES IN 2011 AND $8.8 MILLION RELATED TO SALES OF VIDAZA®, WHICH INCLUDED $2.1 MILLION RELATED TO DISPUTED CLAIMS FROM 2010. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES INCREASED BY $36.9 MILLION, INCLUDING $22.8 MILLION IN SERVICE FEES PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SALES OF ABRAXANE®, $7.8 MILLION IN REBATES RELATED TO THE LAUNCH OF VIDAZA® IN JAPAN AND A $3.6 MILLION INCREASE IN TRICARE REBATES. 2010 COMPARED TO 2009: RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES DECREASED BY $8.3 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED U.S. PROVISIONS RESULTING FROM DECREASED REVENUE FROM PRODUCTS WITH HIGHER RETURN RATES. DISCOUNTS INCREASED BY $15.7 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUE INCREASES IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, BOTH OF WHICH OFFER DIFFERENT DISCOUNT PROGRAMS, AND EXPANSION INTO NEW INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. GOVERNMENT REBATES INCREASED BY $69.7 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN APPROXIMATE $28.4 MILLION INCREASE IN MEDICAID REBATES RESULTING FROM THE HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT, $40.6 MILLION FROM REIMBURSEMENT RATE INCREASES IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND APPROVALS IN NEW MARKETS AND THE INCLUSION OF ABRAXANE® SALES SUBSEQUENT TO THE OCTOBER 2010 ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS. CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES INCREASED BY $34.8 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, PRIMARILY DUE TO A $17.7 MILLION INCREASE IN CHARGEBACKS RESULTING FROM BOTH AN INCREASE IN SALES, INCLUDING THE ADDITION OF ABRAXANE®, AND AN INCREASE IN CERTAIN CHARGEBACK RATES, WHICH ARE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH MEDICAID REBATE RATES. OTHER INCREASES INCLUDED $5.6 MILLION FROM TRICARE DUE TO INCREASED UTILIZATION IN THE CURRENT YEAR, DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES OF $6.5 MILLION AND $2.3 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT. 57 TABLE OF CONTENTS COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS): COST OF GOODS SOLD AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS): COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS) INCREASED BY $119.3 MILLION TO $425.9 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCLUSION IN 2011 OF A $90.3 MILLION INVENTORY STEP-UP AMORTIZATION ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO SALES OF ABRAXANE® SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS COMPARED TO A $34.7 MILLION STEP-UP AMORTIZATION ADJUSTMENT INCLUDED IN 2010. THE REMAINDER OF THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN MATERIAL COSTS RESULTING FROM A HIGHER LEVEL OF SALES ACTIVITY. AS A PERCENT OF NET PRODUCT SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS) INCREASED TO 9.1% IN 2011 COMPARED TO 8.7% IN 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INVENTORY STEP-UP AMORTIZATION ADJUSTMENT FOR ABRAXANE®. EXCLUDING THE STEP-UP AMORTIZATION ADJUSTMENTS IN BOTH YEARS, THE COST OF GOODS SOLD RATIOS WERE 7.1% AND 7.7% IN 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS) INCREASED BY $90.2 MILLION TO $306.5 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF A $34.7 MILLION INVENTORY STEP-UP AMORTIZATION ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO SALES OF ABRAXANE® SUBSEQUENT TO THE OCTOBER 2010 ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS, IN ADDITION TO INCREASED SALES OF REVLIMID® AND VIDAZA®, PARTLY OFFSET BY THE ELIMINATION OF HIGHER COST ALKERAN® SALES, RESULTING FROM THE MARCH 31, 2009 CONCLUSION OF THE GSK LICENSE AGREEMENT. AS A PERCENT OF NET PRODUCT SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS) INCREASED TO 8.7% IN 2010 COMPARED TO 8.4% IN 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INVENTORY STEP-UP AMORTIZATION FOR ABRAXANE®. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND PRIMARILY INCLUDE SALARY AND BENEFIT COSTS, THIRD-PARTY GRANTS AND FEES PAID TO CLINICAL RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS, SUPPLIES AND UPFRONT AND MILESTONE PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS. 58 TABLE OF CONTENTS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS): RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED BY $471.8 MILLION TO $1.600 BILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE IN 2011 WAS PARTLY DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $230.1 MILLION RELATED TO THE ABRAXIS BUSINESS, INCLUDING A $118.0 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO THE IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, OR IPR&D, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSET. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RESULTED FROM A CHANGE IN THE PROBABILITY OF OBTAINING PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL LABELING FOR THE TREATMENT OF NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER FOR ABRAXANE® IN THE UNITED STATES. THE REMAINDER OF THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT SPENDING IN SUPPORT OF MULTIPLE PROGRAMS ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF DISEASES, WITH LATE STAGE CLINICAL TRIALS COMPLETING ENROLLMENT DURING 2011. EXPENSES FOR 2011 ALSO INCLUDED $128.5 MILLION IN UPFRONT PAYMENTS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS, A $20.0 MILLION PAYMENT TO AGIOS FOR A ONE YEAR EXTENSION OF OUR COLLABORATION AGREEMENT AND $14.5 MILLION IN MILESTONE PAYMENTS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED BY $333.6 MILLION TO $1.128 BILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, PARTLY DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $86.7 MILLION IN UPFRONT PAYMENTS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS. A $121.2 MILLION UPFRONT PAYMENT WAS MADE TO AGIOS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., OR AGIOS, IN 2010, COMPARED TO A COMBINED $34.5 MILLION IN PAYMENTS MADE TO GLOBEIMMUNE, INC., OR GLOBEIMMUNE, AND ARRAY BIOPHARMA, INC., OR ARRAY, IN 2009.

WE DO NOT COLLECT COSTS ON A PROJECT BASIS OR FOR ANY CATEGORY OF PROJECTS FOR THE MAJORITY OF COSTS INVOLVED IN CARRYING OUT RESEARCH PROJECTS. WHILE WE DO PERFORM COST CALCULATIONS TO FACILITATE OUR INTERNAL EVALUATION OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS, THESE CALCULATIONS INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATIONS AND ALLOCATIONS THAT ARE NOT RELEVANT TO, OR INCLUDED IN, OUR EXTERNAL FINANCIAL REPORTING MECHANISMS. AS A CONSEQUENCE, WE DO NOT REPORT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS AT THE PROJECT LEVEL.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS): SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY $275.7 MILLION TO $1.226 BILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, PARTLY DUE TO HIGHER MARKETING AND SALES-RELATED EXPENSES RESULTING FROM ONGOING PRODUCT LAUNCH ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING REVLIMID® IN JAPAN, PREPARATION FOR THE FILING AND LAUNCH OF REVLIMID® IN CHINA, ISTODAX® IN PTCL IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABRAXANE® IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE. IN ADDITION, 2011 INCLUDED AN INCREASE OF $72.1 MILLION IN EXPENSES RELATED TO THE ABRAXIS BUSINESS, RESULTING FROM A FULL YEAR'S EXPENSE BEING INCLUDED IN 2011. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY $196.8 MILLION TO $950.6 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, PARTLY DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF $50.0 MILLION IN EXPENSES RELATED TO ABRAXIS AND GLOUCESTER SUBSEQUENT TO THEIR ACQUISITION DATES, A $19.1 MILLION INCREASE IN FACILITIES COSTS AND AN $11.7 MILLION INCREASE IN DONATIONS TO NON-PROFIT FOUNDATIONS. THE REMAINING INCREASE INCLUDES HIGHER MARKETING AND SALES RELATED EXPENSES, RESULTING FROM ONGOING PRODUCT LAUNCH ACTIVITIES OF VIDAZA® IN EUROPE AND ISTODAX® IN THE UNITED STATES, IN ADDITION TO THE CONTINUED EXPANSION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES. AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS: AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS SUMMARIZED BELOW FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 (IN THOUSANDS): AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCREASED BY $86.0 MILLION TO $289.2 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A FULL YEAR'S AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS OBTAINED IN THE OCTOBER 2010 ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS BEING INCLUDED IN 2011. IN ADDITION, IN JUNE 2011, THE FDA APPROVED ISTODAX®, WHICH WAS OBTAINED IN THE JANUARY 2010 ACQUISITION OF GLOUCESTER, FOR TREATMENT OF PTCL IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE 61 TABLE OF CONTENTS RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY. AS A RESULT OF THE FDA APPROVAL, AMORTIZATION OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET COMMENCED WITH AN 8.8 YEAR EXPECTED USEFUL LIFE, INCREASING AMORTIZATION EXPENSE BY $17.8 MILLION. AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCREASED BY $119.8 MILLION TO $203.2 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, PRIMARILY DUE TO $95.8 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH AN ACCELERATION OF AMORTIZATION BEGINNING IN 2010 RELATED TO THE VIDAZA® INTANGIBLE RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION OF PHARMION. THE REVISED MONTHLY AMORTIZATION REFLECTS AN UPDATED SALES FORECAST RELATED TO VIDAZA®. AN INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION EXPENSE DUE TO THE INITIATION OF AMORTIZATION RELATED TO THE ABRAXIS AND GLOUCESTER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN DEVELOPED PRODUCT RIGHTS OBTAINED IN THE PHARMION ACQUISITION BECOMING FULLY AMORTIZED DURING 2009. ACQUISITION RELATED (GAINS) CHARGES AND RESTRUCTURING, NET: ACQUISITION RELATED (GAINS) CHARGES AND RESTRUCTURING, NET WAS A NET GAIN OF $142.3 MILLION IN 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO A $151.5 MILLION FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT TO THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LIABILITY RELATED TO PUBLICLY TRADED CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS, OR CVRS, THAT WERE ISSUED AS PART OF THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS. THE FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY $4.0 MILLION IN ACCRETION OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO U.S. AND EU APPROVAL OF ISTODAX® FOR TREATMENT OF PTCL AND $5.2 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ACQUISITION RELATED CHARGES. ACQUISITION RELATED (GAINS) CHARGES AND RESTRUCTURING, NET WAS A CHARGE OF $47.2 MILLION IN 2010 AND INCLUDED $22.7 MILLION IN ACCRETION OF THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF GLOUCESTER IN JANUARY 2010 AND $24.5 MILLION IN NET COSTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS IN OCTOBER 2010. IN ADDITION TO ACQUISITION RELATED FEES OF $21.4 MILLION, THE COSTS RELATED TO ABRAXIS INCLUDED RESTRUCTURING COSTS OF $16.1 MILLION, PARTLY OFFSET BY A $13.0 FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT TO THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LIABILITY RELATED TO CVRS THAT WERE ISSUED AS PART OF THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS. THE RESTRUCTURING COSTS ARE PRIMARILY SEVERANCE RELATED. INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET: INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET IS SUMMARIZED BELOW FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS): INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET DECREASED BY $18.9 MILLION TO $25.9 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $14.2 MILLION REDUCTION IN INTEREST INCOME DUE TO LOWER OVERALL YIELDS, A $7.4 MILLION NET REDUCTION IN GAINS ON SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND A $0.3 MILLION DECREASE IN DIVIDEND INCOME, PARTLY OFFSET BY A $3.0 MILLION NET DECREASE IN THE AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND DISCOUNTS RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES. INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET DECREASED BY $32.0 MILLION TO $44.8 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $19.6 MILLION NET REDUCTION IN GAINS ON SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 AND A $13.6 MILLION REDUCTION IN INTEREST 62 TABLE OF CONTENTS INCOME DUE TO LOWER OVERALL YIELDS AND THE LIQUIDATION OF SECURITIES TO FUND THE ABRAXIS ACQUISITION. EQUITY IN LOSSES OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES: UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, WE RECORDED LOSSES OF $2.8 MILLION, $1.9 MILLION AND $1.1 MILLION IN 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE LOSSES IN 2011 AND 2010 INCLUDED LOSSES FROM NON-CORE ABRAXIS EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS WHICH WERE DIVESTED IN APRIL 2011. INTEREST EXPENSE: INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $42.7 MILLION, $12.6 MILLION AND $2.0 MILLION IN 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE $30.1 MILLION INCREASE IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $29.6 MILLION INCREASE IN INTEREST ACCRUED ON THE $1.25 BILLION IN SENIOR NOTES ISSUED IN OCTOBER 2010 AND TO THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER BEGINNING IN SEPTEMBER 2011. WE ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH 2011 TO CONVERT A PORTION OF OUR INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO THE SENIOR NOTES FROM FIXED RATE TO FLOATING RATE TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN INTEREST EXPENSE WITH INTEREST INCOME RECEIVED ON OUR CASH EQUIVALENT AND INVESTMENT BALANCES. IN AUGUST 2011, WE SETTLED THE SWAP CONTRACTS RESULTING IN THE RECEIPT OF $34.3 MILLION. THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SWAP SETTLEMENT ARE BEING ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR $500.0 MILLION, 2.45% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE IN 2015. THERE WERE NO INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2011. OTHER INCOME, NET: OTHER INCOME, NET IS SUMMARIZED BELOW FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 (IN THOUSANDS): OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET WAS A NET EXPENSE OF $3.6 MILLION IN 2011 AND $7.2 MILLION IN 2010. THE $3.7 MILLION DECREASE IN EXPENSE IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $3.6 MILLION ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GRANT RECEIVED FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY IN 2011. OTHER INCOME, NET DECREASED BY $67.7 MILLION IN 2010 TO A NET EXPENSE OF $7.2 MILLION COMPARED TO AN INCOME OF $60.5 MILLION IN 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN NET GAINS ON FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT HAD NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO OFFSET NET FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES. INCOME TAX PROVISION: THE INCOME TAX PROVISION DECREASED BY $30.4 MILLION TO $102.1 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE FULL YEAR 2011 UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 11.5% REFLECTS THE IMPACT FROM OUR LOW TAX SWISS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF A SHIFT IN EARNINGS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND LOWER TAX FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, AND TAX DEDUCTIONS RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITIONS. THE DECREASE IN THE UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ALSO REFLECTS BENEFITS FROM AN INCREASE IN ACQUISITION-RELATED CHARGES, INCLUDING AN IPR&D ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $118.0 MILLION AND A NON-TAXABLE GAIN FROM A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LIABILITY UNDER THE CVR AGREEMENT RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS OF $151.5 MILLION. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS REDUCED BY 4.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2011 AS A RESULT OF DISCRETE ITEMS WHICH INCLUDED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO A FOREIGN TAX CREDIT, A DECREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN ONGOING INCOME TAX AUDITS AND EXPIRATIONS OF STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS, AND A NET TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO CHANGES IN STATE TAX LAWS. 63 TABLE OF CONTENTS THE INCOME TAX PROVISION DECREASED BY $66.5 MILLION TO $132.4 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009. THE FULL YEAR 2010 UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 15.9% REFLECTS THE IMPACT FROM OUR LOW TAX SWISS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF A SHIFT IN EARNINGS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND LOWER TAX FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, AND TAX DEDUCTIONS RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITIONS. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS REDUCED BY 2.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2010 AS A RESULT OF DISCRETE ITEMS WHICH INCLUDED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO A SETTLEMENT OF A TAX EXAMINATION AND THE REDUCTION IN A VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATED TO CERTAIN TAX CARRYFORWARDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN ONGOING INCOME TAX AUDITS. THE INCOME TAX PROVISION FOR 2009 INCLUDED A FULL YEAR UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 21.8%. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS REDUCED BY 1.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2009 AS A RESULT OF DISCRETE ITEMS WHICH INCLUDED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO FILING OUR 2008 INCOME TAX RETURNS WITH CERTAIN ITEMS BEING MORE FAVORABLE THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED AND SETTLEMENT OF TAX EXAMINATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN ONGOING INCOME TAX AUDITS. NET INCOME: NET INCOME AND PER COMMON SHARE AMOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA): NET INCOME FOR 2011 REFLECTS THE EARNINGS IMPACT FROM HIGHER SALES OF REVLIMID®, VIDAZA® AND A FULL YEAR'S SALES OF ABRAXANE®. THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF HIGHER REVENUES WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SPENDING FOR NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, EXPANSION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS AND AN INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF SENIOR NOTES IN OCTOBER 2010. EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE WERE ALSO FAVORABLY IMPACTED IN 2011 BY THE REPURCHASE OF 38.3 MILLION COMMON SHARES UNDER OUR COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, REDUCING OUR OUTSTANDING SHARE BASE. NET INCOME FOR 2010 REFLECTS THE EARNINGS IMPACT FROM HIGHER SALES OF REVLIMID® AND VIDAZA®. THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF HIGHER REVENUES WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SPENDING FOR NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, EXPANSION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND THE ADDITIONAL COSTS AND INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS. 64 TABLE OF CONTENTS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE COMPONENTS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 (IN THOUSANDS): (1)INCLUDES CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET OF ALLOWANCES, INVENTORY AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, LESS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES, INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES. WE RELY PRIMARILY ON POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AND BORROWINGS IN THE FORM OF LONG-TERM NOTES PAYABLE AND, BEGINNING IN SEPTEMBER 2011, SHORT-TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER TO PROVIDE FOR OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. WE EXPECT CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR EXPENDITURES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TRIALS, COMMERCIALIZATION OF NEW PRODUCTS, INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND EXISTING SOURCES OF AND ACCESS TO FINANCING ARE ADEQUATE TO FUND OUR OPERATING NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AND OUR PLANS TO REPURCHASE STOCK OR PURSUE OTHER STRATEGIC BUSINESS INITIATIVES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IN JANUARY 2012, WE ANNOUNCED ONE SUCH STRATEGIC BUSINESS INITIATIVE WHEN WE AND AVILA THERAPEUTICS, INC., OR AVILA, A PRIVATELY-HELD BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY, ANNOUNCED A DEFINITIVE MERGER AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH WE WILL ACQUIRE AVILA, SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF THE APPLICABLE WAITING PERIOD UNDER THE HART-SCOTT-RODINO ANTITRUST IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 1976, FOR $350 MILLION IN CASH PLUS UP TO $575 MILLION IN CONTINGENT DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL MILESTONES. WE CONSIDER THE CUMULATIVE UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES TO BE INDEFINITELY INVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. OF THE TOTAL CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, APPROXIMATELY $2.3 BILLION WAS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS AND IS INTENDED FOR USE IN OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS. WE DO NOT RELY ON THESE UNREMITTED EARNINGS AS A SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR OUR DOMESTIC BUSINESS AS WE EXPECT TO HAVE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW IN THE UNITED STATES TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC NEEDS. CONSEQUENTLY, 65 TABLE OF CONTENTS WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED FOR U.S. FEDERAL OR STATE INCOME TAXES ON THESE UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS. WHILE WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE CHANGING OUR INTENTION REGARDING PERMANENTLY REINVESTED EARNINGS, IF CERTAIN FOREIGN EARNINGS PREVIOUSLY TREATED AS PERMANENTLY REINVESTED ARE REPATRIATED, THE RELATED U.S. TAX LIABILITY MAY BE REDUCED BY ANY FOREIGN INCOME TAXES PAID ON THESE EARNINGS. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM: OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED AN AGGREGATE $4.0 BILLION COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF WHICH WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $1.387 BILLION REMAINING FOR FUTURE SHARE REPURCHASES. DURING 2011 WE USED $2.221 BILLION FOR SHARE REPURCHASES. COMPONENTS OF WORKING CAPITAL CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: WE INVEST OUR EXCESS CASH PRIMARILY IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS, U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT, AGENCY AND SUPRANATIONAL SECURITIES AND GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES. ALL LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND ALL INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE. WE DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. THE $46.9 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, PARTLY OFFSET BY THE $2.221 BILLION CASH PAID OUT UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. FOR MORE INFORMATION RELATED TO THE FAIR VALUE AND VALUATION OF OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES, SEE NOTE 5 TO THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET INCREASED BY $239.1 MILLION TO $945.5 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SALES, INCLUDING SALES OF REVLIMID®, VIDAZA® AND ABRAXANE®. AMOUNTS DUE FROM CUSTOMERS INCREASED PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES AND CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. SALES MADE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES TYPICALLY HAVE PAYMENT TERMS THAT ARE GREATER THAN 60 DAYS, THEREBY EXTENDING COLLECTION PERIODS BEYOND THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE EXPECT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE TO CONTINUE TO GROW AS OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES CONTINUE TO EXPAND. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES, THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS IN CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND ASSOCIATED IMPACTS ON THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OUR BUSINESS. OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL IN THESE MARKETS IS TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO PRINCIPALLY GOVERNMENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED HOSPITALS, WHO IN TURN DIRECTLY DELIVER CRITICAL CARE TO PATIENTS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE USED TO TREAT LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES AND WE BELIEVE THIS BUSINESS MODEL ENABLES TIMELY DELIVERY AND ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF 66 TABLE OF CONTENTS PRODUCTS. MANY OF THE OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE RELATED TO GOVERNMENT-FUNDED HOSPITALS AND WE BELIEVE THE RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE ULTIMATELY COLLECTIBLE. SIMILARLY, WE BELIEVE THAT FUTURE SALES TO THESE CUSTOMERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE COLLECTIBLE. THE CREDIT AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WITHIN GREECE, SPAIN, ITALY, AND PORTUGAL, AS WELL AS INCREASING SALES LEVELS IN THOSE COUNTRIES HAVE RESULTED IN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN, AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES TO COLLECT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. OUR TOTAL NET RECEIVABLES IN SPAIN, ITALY AND PORTUGAL ARE COMPOSED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM GOVERNMENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED HOSPITALS AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND AMOUNTED TO $396.1 MILLION AT THE END OF 2011 COMPARED TO $231.6 MILLION AT THE END OF 2010. APPROXIMATELY $81.2 MILLION OF THE $396.1 MILLION RECEIVABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 WAS GREATER THAN ONE YEAR PAST DUE. OUR EXPOSURE TO THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS IN GREECE IS LIMITED, AS WE DO NOT HAVE A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF RECEIVABLES IN GREECE. WE MAINTAIN TIMELY AND DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH HOSPITAL CUSTOMERS IN ITALY, PORTUGAL, AND SPAIN REGARDING BOTH THE CURRENT AND PAST DUE RECEIVABLE BALANCES. WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS FROM THESE COUNTRIES, AND CLOSELY MONITOR THE PLANS FOR PAYMENT AT THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL. WE ALSO REGULARLY REQUEST AND RECEIVE POSITIVE CONFIRMATION OF THE VALIDITY OF OUR RECEIVABLES FROM MOST OF THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES. WE HAVE THE OPTION TO PURSUE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST CERTAIN OF OUR CUSTOMERS. IN VIEW OF THE PROTRACTED TIMELINE ASSOCIATED WITH COLLECTING THE OUTSTANDING BALANCES THROUGH LEGAL ACTION AND THE CURRENT DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, IN MANY INSTANCES, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS TO BE THE BEST APPROACH FOR ANY OF THE PARTIES INVOLVED. IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR ITALY, PORTUGAL, AND SPAIN, WE CONSIDERED THAT THE BALANCE OF PAST DUE RECEIVABLES IS RELATED TO SALES MADE TO GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR SUPPORTED CUSTOMERS. WE REGULARLY MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS IN EUROPE TO ASSESS WHETHER THE LEVEL OF RISK OF DEFAULT FOR ANY CUSTOMERS HAS INCREASED AND NOTE THE ONGOING EFFORTS BY THE EUROPEAN UNION, EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION AND INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND TO SUPPORT COUNTRIES WITH LARGE PUBLIC DEFICITS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT BALANCES. WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR WRITE-OFFS WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLECTION OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN THESE COUNTRIES AS A RESULT OF THEIR ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES AND WE DO NOT EXPECT TO HAVE WRITE-OFFS OR ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. INVENTORY: INVENTORY BALANCES DECREASED BY $70.6 MILLION TO $189.6 MILLION AT THE END OF 2011 COMPARED TO THE END OF 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO A $90.3 MILLION REDUCTION IN ABRAXANE® INVENTORY RELATED TO THE INVENTORY STEP-UP ADJUSTMENT TO FAIR VALUE RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS, WHICH FLOWED THROUGH COST OF GOODS SOLD DURING 2011. THE FAVORABLE IMPACT FROM THE REDUCTION IN THE STEP-UP ADJUSTMENT WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN REVLIMID®, VIDAZA® AND ABRAXANE® INVENTORIES, ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER SALES LEVELS. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS: OTHER CURRENT ASSETS INCREASED BY $120.1 MILLION TO $395.1 MILLION AT THE END OF 2011 COMPARED TO THE END OF 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO A $64.2 MILLION INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, IN ADDITION TO INCREASES IN ROYALTIES RECEIVABLE AND OTHER PREPAID EXPENSES, INCLUDING TAXES AND INSURANCE. COMMERCIAL PAPER: IN SEPTEMBER 2011, WE ENTERED INTO A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, OR THE PROGRAM, UNDER WHICH WE ISSUED UNSECURED COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES, OR COMMERCIAL PAPER, ON A PRIVATE PLACEMENT BASIS UP TO A MAXIMUM AGGREGATE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING AT ANY TIME OF 67 TABLE OF CONTENTS $1.0 BILLION, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH WILL BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE MATURITIES OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MAY VARY, BUT MAY NOT EXCEED 270 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ISSUE. THE COMMERCIAL PAPER IS SOLD UNDER CUSTOMARY TERMS TO A DEALER OR IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET AND IS ISSUED AT A DISCOUNT FROM PAR OR, ALTERNATIVELY, IS SOLD AT PAR AND BEARS VARYING INTEREST RATES ON A FIXED OR FLOATING BASIS. BORROWINGS UNDER THE PROGRAM ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. AS OF THE END OF 2011, $401.4 MILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER WAS OUTSTANDING BEARING AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OF 0.5%. SENIOR UNSECURED CREDIT FACILITY: IN SEPTEMBER 2011, WE ENTERED INTO A SENIOR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, OR THE CREDIT FACILITY, PROVIDING FOR REVOLVING CREDIT IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $1.0 BILLION. SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT FACILITY (BUT IN NO EVENT MORE THAN ONE TIME PER ANNUM), UP TO A MAXIMUM AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $1.250 BILLION. THE CREDIT FACILITY HAS A FIVE-YEAR TERM AND AMOUNTS MAY BE BORROWED FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE CREDIT FACILITY SERVES AS BACKUP LIQUIDITY FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS. AS OF THE END OF 2011, THERE WAS NO OUTSTANDING BORROWING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY. THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS INCLUDING CERTAIN CUSTOMARY FINANCIAL COVENANTS. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL DEBT COVENANTS AS OF THE END OF 2011. CREDIT FACILITY: IN NOVEMBER 2011, WE ENTERED INTO AN UNCOMMITTED FACILITY, OR FACILITY, NOT EXCEEDING AN AGGREGATE OF $125.0 MILLION. ADVANCES ARE TO BE IN CURRENCIES AGREED UPON AND WILL BE FOR PERIODS OF ONE OR THREE MONTHS. INTEREST WILL ACCRUE AND BE CALCULATED IN RESPECT TO EACH ADVANCE ON THE BASIS OF THE NUMBER OF DAYS ELAPSED AND A 360 DAY YEAR IN THE CASE OF ADVANCES IN U.S. DOLLARS AT A RATE PER ANNUM OF 1.0% ABOVE LIBOR. INTEREST ACCRUED ON EACH ADVANCE WILL BE PAID AT ITS MATURITY. THE FACILITY MAY BE TERMINATED AT ANY TIME BY THE LENDING PARTY WITH OR WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE. AS OF THE END OF 2011, $125.0 MILLION WAS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE FACILITY AND ACCOUNTED FOR AS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE WAS REPAID IN JANUARY 2012. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES: ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES DECREASED BY $34.4 MILLION TO $961.7 MILLION AS OF THE END OF 2011 COMPARED TO THE END OF 2010. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PAYMENT OF $180.0 MILLION OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF GLOUCESTER, WHICH HAD A FAIR VALUE OF $171.9 MILLION ON DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND PAYMENT OF A LITIGATION SETTLEMENT, WHICH WAS RESERVED FOR AT $80.0 MILLION IN 2010, MOSTLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN GOVERNMENTAL REBATES AND MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENTS, IN ADDITION TO CLINICAL TRIAL AND COMPENSATION-RELATED ACCRUALS. INCOME TAXES PAYABLE (CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT): INCOME TAXES PAYABLE INCREASED BY $83.2 MILLION TO $646.5 MILLION AS OF THE END OF 2011 COMPARED TO THE END OF 2010, PRIMARILY FROM THE CURRENT PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES OF $187.9 MILLION, MOSTLY OFFSET BY TAX PAYMENTS OF $50.8 MILLION AND A TAX BENEFIT OF STOCK OPTIONS OF $35.0 MILLION. 68 TABLE OF CONTENTS ANALYSIS OF CASH FLOWS CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS): OPERATING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2011 INCREASED BY $627.1 MILLION TO $1.809 BILLION AS COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN EXPANSION OF OUR OPERATIONS AND RELATED INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ASSOCIATED WITH EXPANDING INTERNATIONAL SALES, WHICH TAKE LONGER TO COLLECT, AND THE TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. INVESTING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2011 CHANGED TO A POSITIVE $377.7 MILLION COMPARED TO A NET CASH USE OF $2.107 BILLION IN 2010. THE 2010 INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCLUDED NET CASH USED IN THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS OF $2.315 BILLION AND THE ACQUISITION OF GLOUCESTER OF $337.6 MILLION. INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCLUDED NET SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE IN THE AMOUNT OF $481.8 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO $659.7 MILLION IN 2010. IN APRIL 2011, WE SOLD NON-CORE ASSETS ACQUIRED WITH ABRAXIS TO VARIOUS ENTITIES THAT ARE OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY DR. PATRICK SOON-SHIONG, THE FORMER MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER AND EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF ABRAXIS. WE RECEIVED CASH CONSIDERATION OF $110.0 MILLION, 10% EQUITY OWNERSHIP IN AN ENTITY, ACTIVE BIOMATERIALS, LLC, FORMED WITH CERTAIN OF THE NON-CORE ASSETS WITH REVENUE-PRODUCING POTENTIAL AND A FUTURE ROYALTY STREAM BASED ON NET SALES OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS OF ACTIVE BIOMATERIALS, LLC. THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THIS SALE AMOUNTED TO $93.2 MILLION. FINANCING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2011 WAS $1.655 BILLION COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED OF $1.177 BILLION IN 2010. THE $2.832 BILLION DECREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2011 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN 2010 THAT PROVIDED NET CASH OF $1.237 BILLION AND THE $2.221 BILLION IN COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES IN 2011 UNDER THE COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. IN JULY 2011, WE MADE A PAYMENT OF $180.0 MILLION TO THE FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OF GLOUCESTER IN SATISFACTION OF AN ACQUISITION-RELATED MILESTONE PAYMENT REQUIREMENT BASED ON THE FDA APPROVAL OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL NEW DRUG APPLICATION FOR ISTODAX® FOR TREATMENT IN THE UNITED STATES OF PTCL IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY. THE ACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION FOR THIS MILESTONE WAS $156.7 MILLION, THE SETTLEMENT OF WHICH IS REFLECTED AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS FOR 2011. 69 TABLE OF CONTENTS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 (IN THOUSANDS): (1)THE SENIOR NOTE OBLIGATION AMOUNTS INCLUDE FUTURE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS. SENIOR NOTES: IN OCTOBER 2010, WE ISSUED A TOTAL OF $1.25 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2.45% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2015 (THE "2015 NOTES"), $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.95% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2020 (THE "2020 NOTES") AND $250.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 5.7% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2040 (THE "2040 NOTES" AND, TOGETHER WITH THE 2015 NOTES AND THE 2020 NOTES, REFERRED TO HEREIN AS THE "NOTES"). SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS: CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS INCLUDES PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND FEES OF $401.4 MILLION RELATED TO COMMERCIAL PAPER AND $125.3 MILLION RELATED TO BORROWINGS FROM OUR CREDIT FACILITY THAT WERE OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2011. OPERATING LEASES: WE LEASE OFFICE AND RESEARCH FACILITIES UNDER VARIOUS OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE NON-CANCELABLE LEASE TERMS FOR OPERATING LEASES EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES BETWEEN 2012 AND 2023 AND INCLUDE RENEWAL OPTIONS. IN GENERAL, WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE LESSORS FOR REAL ESTATE TAXES, INSURANCE, UTILITIES, MAINTENANCE AND OTHER OPERATING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEASES. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE MAJOR FACILITIES THAT WE OCCUPY UNDER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS REFER TO PART I, ITEM 2, "PROPERTIES" OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS: OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS INCLUDE $107.5 MILLION IN CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPLY CONTRACTS. IN DECEMBER 2006, WE PURCHASED AN API MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES LOCATED IN ZOFINGEN, SWITZERLAND. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, OUR REMAINING COMMITMENT RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION WAS $21.4 MILLION. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE COMMITTED TO INVEST AN AGGREGATE $25.0 MILLION IN TWO INVESTMENT FUNDS OVER A TEN-YEAR PERIOD, WHICH IS CALLABLE AT ANY TIME. ON DECEMBER 31, 2011, OUR REMAINING INVESTMENT COMMITMENT WAS $8.9 MILLION. COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS: WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT INCLUDE THE FUNDING OF CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE MILESTONE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED DEVELOPMENTAL, REGULATORY AND/OR COMMERCIAL 70 TABLE OF CONTENTS TARGETS. OUR OBLIGATION TO FUND THESE EFFORTS IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROGRAMS AND/OR THE LACK OF ANY ADVERSE EVENTS WHICH COULD CAUSE THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE PROGRAMS. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE ATTAINMENT OF SPECIFIED DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND ACCORDINGLY, NO AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010 CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. POTENTIAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $4.5 BILLION, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $2.7 BILLION CONTINGENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF VARIOUS RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES AND APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION IN SALES-BASED MILESTONES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS ARE IDENTIFIED IN NOTE 19 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. NEW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD, OR FASB, ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE, OR ASU, NO. 2011-11, "BALANCE SHEET (TOPIC 210): DISCLOSURES ABOUT OFFSETTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES," OR ASU 2011-11. UNDER ASU 2011-11, AN ENTITY IS REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE BOTH GROSS AND NET INFORMATION ABOUT INSTRUMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS ELIGIBLE FOR OFFSET IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS WELL AS INSTRUMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS EXECUTED UNDER A MASTER NETTING OR SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT AND WAS ISSUED TO ENABLE USERS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OR POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF THOSE ARRANGEMENTS ON ITS FINANCIAL POSITION. ASU 2011-11 IS REQUIRED TO BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY AND IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE YEARS, BEGINNING ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2013. THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2011-12 IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN SEPTEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2011-08, "INTANGIBLES  GOODWILL AND OTHER (TOPIC 350): TESTING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT," OR ASU 2011-08. THE UPDATE SIMPLIFIES HOW A COMPANY TESTS GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT. ASU 2011-08 ALLOWS A COMPANY THE OPTION TO FIRST ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE TWO-STEP QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST. UNDER THAT OPTION, AN ENTITY WOULD NO LONGER BE REQUIRED TO CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT UNLESS THE ENTITY DETERMINES, BASED ON THAT QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT ITS FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. ASU 2011-08 IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL AND INTERIM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS PERFORMED FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2011. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2011-08 IN 2012 IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN JUNE 2011, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2011-05, "COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220)," OR ASU 2011-05. ASU 2011-05 WAS ISSUED TO IMPROVE THE COMPARABILITY, CONSISTENCY AND TRANSPARENCY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TO INCREASE THE PROMINENCE OF ITEMS REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE GUIDANCE IN ASU 2011-05 ELIMINATES THE OPTION TO PRESENT COMPONENTS OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AS PART OF THE STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND REQUIRES THAT ALL NON-OWNER CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY BE PRESENTED EITHER IN A SINGLE CONTINUOUS STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR IN TWO SEPARATE BUT CONSECUTIVE STATEMENTS. ASU 2011-05 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2011. THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2011-05 WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE, OR ASU, NO. 2011-12, "COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220): DEFERRAL OF THE EFFECTIVE 71 TABLE OF CONTENTS DATE FOR AMENDMENTS TO THE PRESENTATION OF RECLASSIFICATION OF ITEMS OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE NO. 2011-05," OR ASU 2011-12. UNDER ASU 2011-12, THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PRESENTATION OF RECLASSIFICATIONS OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME THAT WERE IN PLACE BEFORE THE ISSUANCE OF UPDATE 2011-05 ARE REINSTATED, EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2011. THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2011-12 IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN MAY 2011, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2011-04, "FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (TOPIC 820)," OR ASU 2011-04. ASU 2011-04 WAS ISSUED TO IMPROVE THE COMPARABILITY OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS PRESENTED AND DISCLOSED IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, OR U.S. GAAP, AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS, OR IFRS. THE GUIDANCE IN ASU 2011-04 EXPLAINS HOW TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE, BUT DOES NOT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND IS NOT INTENDED TO ESTABLISH VALUATION STANDARDS OR AFFECT VALUATION PRACTICES OUTSIDE OF FINANCIAL REPORTING. ASU 2011-04 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2011. THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2011-04 WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IS ONE THAT IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENT'S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL: REVENUE RECOGNITION: REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS OF THE PRODUCT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER. PROVISIONS FOR DISCOUNTS, EARLY PAYMENTS, REBATES, SALES RETURNS AND DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS UNDER TERMS CUSTOMARY IN THE INDUSTRY ARE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SAME PERIOD THE RELATED SALES ARE RECORDED. WE RECORD ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SALE. THE ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR SUCH VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES ARE BASED ON THE SALES TERMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND TREND ANALYSIS. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM ROYALTIES BASED ON LICENSEES' SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS USING OUR TECHNOLOGIES. ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACT TERMS WHEN ROYALTIES FROM LICENSEES CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED. IF ROYALTIES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR COLLECTABILITY OF A ROYALTY AMOUNT IS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED, ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE CASH IS RECEIVED. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES; SALES DISCOUNTS, GOVERNMENT REBATES, AND CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES UNDER THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®. 72 TABLE OF CONTENTS INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES' SPECIFICATIONS TO HELP ENSURE THE PRODUCT'S SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER OUR PROPRIETARY "SYSTEM FOR THALIDOMIDE EDUCATION AND PRESCRIBING SAFETY," OR S.T.E.P.S.®, PROGRAM, WHICH IS A COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION AND RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF PROVIDING FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES' SPECIFICATIONS TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. VIDAZA®, ISTODAX® AND ABRAXANE® ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS THALOMID® AND REVLIMID®. WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. AS NOTED ABOVE, REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY. THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT. SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. NET REVENUES FOR THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY A COMPONENT OF THE U.S. HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT OF 2010, OR HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2011 AND REQUIRED MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT'S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE 73 TABLE OF CONTENTS THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS ACTUAL INVOICE DATA THROUGHOUT 2011. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS INCURRED. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES. THE HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT MANDATED IN 2011 AN ANNUAL FEE PAYABLE BY BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUG MANUFACTURERS AND IMPORTERS ON BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THE FEE, WHICH IS NOT MATERIAL, IS INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ON THE 2011 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE PROVIDE A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY. CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: WE ESTIMATE AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, HISTORICAL PAYMENT PATTERNS, AGING OF RECEIVABLE BALANCES AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF COUNTRIES THEMSELVES AND PROVINCES OR AREAS WITHIN SUCH COUNTRIES WHERE THEY ARE THE ULTIMATE CUSTOMERS. INCOME TAXES: WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. WE PROVIDE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE ACCOUNT FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS PART OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THESE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATE PRIMARILY TO ISSUES COMMON AMONG MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE APPLY A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES WHICH INCLUDE STUDIES PERFORMED BY INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS, ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY AND SUBJECT EXPERTS, EVALUATION OF PUBLIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. WE PROVIDE ESTIMATES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. IF OUR ESTIMATES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ACTUAL OUTCOMES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED. 74 TABLE OF CONTENTS WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE A PORTION WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR RECENT CUMULATIVE EARNINGS EXPERIENCE BY TAXING JURISDICTION, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, CARRYFORWARD PERIODS AVAILABLE TO US FOR TAX REPORTING PURPOSES, VARIOUS INCOME TAX STRATEGIES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT AND, TO THE EXTENT FUTURE EXPECTATIONS CHANGE, WE WOULD HAVE TO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THAT TIME. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION: THE COST OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IS RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL AWARDS GRANTED, USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES METHOD OF VALUATION FOR STOCK OPTIONS. THE FAIR VALUES OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND PERFORMANCE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ARE BASED ON THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH AWARD IS DETERMINED AND THE COMPENSATION COST IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD REQUIRED TO OBTAIN FULL VESTING. COMPENSATION COST TO BE RECOGNIZED REFLECTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF AWARDS EXPECTED TO VEST AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AN ESTIMATE OF AWARD FORFEITURES BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE. OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES: A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF ANY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY BELOW ITS COST THAT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN CARRYING AMOUNT TO FAIR VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT IS CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AND A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE SECURITY ESTABLISHED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INCLUDE: SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE ISSUER'S EARNINGS PERFORMANCE, CREDIT RATING, ASSET QUALITY, BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE ISSUER OPERATES, LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW OUR COST, OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE SECURITY, OUR INTENT NOT TO SELL AND AN EVALUATION AS TO WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO SELL BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR COST BASIS. ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD DIFFER FROM OUR ASSESSMENT. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES: ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN CURRENT EARNINGS OR OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), DEPENDING ON WHETHER A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION AND, IF IT IS, THE TYPE OF HEDGING TRANSACTION. FOR A DERIVATIVE TO QUALIFY AS A HEDGE AT INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE HEDGED PERIOD, WE FORMALLY DOCUMENT THE NATURE AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEM. WE ASSESS, BOTH AT INCEPTION AND ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING TRANSACTIONS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING THE CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS. WE ASSESS HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND RECORD THE GAIN OR LOSS RELATED TO THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IF ANY, TO CURRENT EARNINGS. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER PROBABLE OF OCCURRING, WE DISCONTINUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING AND ANY RELATED UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING 75 TABLE OF CONTENTS THOSE NOT DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION, TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES. THE USE OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE EXPOSURE OF THESE RISKS WITH THE INTENT TO REDUCE OUR RISK OR COST. WE DO NOT USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR SPECULATIVE TRADING PURPOSES AND ARE NOT A PARTY TO LEVERAGED DERIVATIVES. INVESTMENTS: WE APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING TO OUR INVESTMENT IN COMMON STOCK OF AN AFFILIATED COMPANY AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS, WHICH PRIMARILY INVEST IN COMPANIES CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN LIFE SCIENCES SUCH AS BIOTECHNOLOGY, PHARMACEUTICALS, MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY, MEDICAL DEVICES, DIAGNOSTICS AND HEALTH AND WELLNESS. WE ALSO MAINTAIN A PORTFOLIO OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES ON A COST METHOD BASIS WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT. IF AN INVESTMENT'S FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN ITS NET CARRYING VALUE AND THE DECLINE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE. SUCH AN EVALUATION IS JUDGMENTAL AND DEPENDENT ON SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE HAS OCCURRED INCLUDE: MARKET VALUE OR EXIT PRICE OF THE INVESTMENT BASED ON EITHER MARKET-QUOTED PRICES OR FUTURE ROUNDS OF FINANCING BY THE INVESTEE; LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE MARKET VALUE WAS BELOW ITS COST BASIS; FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE INVESTEE; OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT; ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INVESTEE'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN; AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE MAY BE AWARE OF RELATED TO THE INVESTMENT. ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, OR LTIP, DESIGNED TO PROVIDE KEY OFFICERS AND EXECUTIVES WITH PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES CONTINGENT UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED CORPORATE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES COVERING A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLES RUNNING CONCURRENTLY ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2013 AND 2014. PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THE PERFORMANCE CYCLES ENDING IN 2012 AND 2013 ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE THREE-YEAR CYCLE: 25% ON NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE; 25% ON NON-GAAP NET INCOME; AND 50% ON TOTAL NON-GAAP REVENUE, AS DEFINED. THE PERFORMANCE CYCLE ENDING IN 2014 IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS IN 2014: 37.5% ON NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE; 37.5% ON TOTAL NON-GAAP REVENUE, AS DEFINED; AND 25% ON RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, WHICH IS A MEASUREMENT OF OUR STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR COMPARED WITH A GROUP OF OTHER COMPANIES IN THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. PAYOUTS MAY BE IN THE RANGE OF 0% TO 200% OF THE PARTICIPANT'S SALARY FOR THE PLANS. AWARDS ARE PAYABLE IN CASH OR, AT OUR DISCRETION, IN OUR COMMON STOCK OR A MIXTURE OF CASH AND OUR COMMON STOCK. FOR SELECTED PARTICIPANTS AT OUR DISCRETION, AWARDS ARE PAYABLE IN OUR COMMON STOCK, WITH THE NUMBER OF SHARES DETERMINED USING THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE FOR THE 30 TRADING DAYS PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CYCLE, OR A MIXTURE OF CASH AND OUR COMMON STOCK. PAYMENTS MADE IN OUR COMMON STOCK ARE RESTRICTED FROM TRADING FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS. WE ACCRUE THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE LIABILITY OVER EACH THREE-YEAR CYCLE. PRIOR TO THE END OF A THREE-YEAR CYCLE, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT DURING THE CYCLE. UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT EQUAL TO THEIR TARGET AWARD, OR AN AWARD BASED ON ACTUAL PERFORMANCE, IF HIGHER, THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL. 76 TABLE OF CONTENTS ACCRUALS RECORDED FOR THE LTIP ENTAIL MAKING CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE, NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND NON-GAAP REVENUES, AS DEFINED; THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED. ACCRUALS FOR THE LTIP ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND REVISED ACCORDINGLY SO THAT THE LIABILITY RECORDED REFLECTS UPDATED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PAYOUTS. IN ESTIMATING THE ACCRUALS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DATE FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, EXPECTED RESULTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, OPERATING TRENDS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICING AND COMPETITION. VALUATION OF GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IPR&D: WE HAVE RECORDED GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IPR&D PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ACQUISITIONS OF PHARMION, GLOUCESTER AND ABRAXIS. WHEN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, ARE ACQUIRED, WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS ARE TYPICALLY USED IN THESE VALUATIONS IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, AND THE MODELS REQUIRE THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: PROJECTING REGULATORY APPROVALS, ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM PRODUCT SALES RESULTING FROM COMPLETED PRODUCTS AND IN-PROCESS PROJECTS AND DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES AND PROBABILITY RATES GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. WE TEST OUR GOODWILL ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT EACH NOVEMBER 30. WE ARE ORGANIZED AS A SINGLE REPORTING UNIT AND THEREFORE THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS DONE USING OUR OVERALL MARKET VALUE, AS DETERMINED BY OUR TRADED SHARE PRICE, AS COMPARED TO OUR BOOK VALUE OF NET ASSETS. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE AMORTIZED TO THEIR ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR. INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO IPR&D PRODUCT RIGHTS ARE TREATED AS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND NOT AMORTIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS APPROVED FOR SALE BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN SPECIFIED MARKETS. AT THAT TIME, WE WILL DETERMINE THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET, RECLASSIFY THE ASSET OUT OF IPR&D AND BEGIN AMORTIZATION. IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS ALSO PERFORMED AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. SUCH TEST ENTAILS COMPLETING AN UPDATED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET. OUR IPR&D PRODUCT RIGHTS WERE OBTAINED IN THE GLOUCESTER AND ABRAXIS ACQUISITIONS. THE GLOUCESTER RELATED PRODUCT RIGHTS WILL BECOME DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES WHEN MARKETING APPROVAL IS RECEIVED FOR ISTODAX® FOR TREATMENT OF PTCL IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE ABRAXIS RELATED PRODUCT RIGHTS WILL BECOME DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES WHEN MARKETING APPROVAL IS RECEIVED FOR ABRAXANE® FOR TREATMENT OF EITHER NSCLC, PANCREATIC CANCER OR MELANOMA IN A MAJOR MARKET, TYPICALLY EITHER THE UNITED STATES OR THE EUROPEAN UNION, OR IN A SERIES OF OTHER COUNTRIES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN SPECIFIED CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. VALUATION OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION: WE RECORD CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION AT ITS FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION 77 TABLE OF CONTENTS DATE, AND FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT REPORTING PERIOD REVALUE THESE OBLIGATIONS AND RECORD INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPERATING EARNINGS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. CHANGES TO CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION OBLIGATIONS CAN RESULT FROM MOVEMENTS IN PUBLICLY TRADED SHARE PRICES OF CVRS, ADJUSTMENTS TO DISCOUNT RATES AND PERIODS, UPDATES IN THE ASSUMED ACHIEVEMENT OR TIMING OF ANY DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES OR CHANGES IN THE PROBABILITY OF CERTAIN CLINICAL EVENTS AND CHANGES IN THE ASSUMED PROBABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATORY APPROVAL. THE ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT AND ANY CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION EXPENSE RECORDED IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. OUR CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES WERE ACQUIRED IN THE ACQUISITIONS OF GLOUCESTER AND ABRAXIS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GLOUCESTER CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY IS BASED ON THE DISCOUNT RATE, PROBABILITY AND ESTIMATED TIMING OF A CASH MILESTONE PAYMENT TO THE FORMER GLOUCESTER SHAREHOLDERS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ABRAXIS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY IS BASED ON THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES FORWARD-LOOKING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RISK OF LOSS IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES, CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE EARNINGS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, OUR MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS CONSISTED OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, LONG-TERM DEBT AND CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE CONSISTED OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT, AGENCY AND SUPRANATIONAL SECURITIES, GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES AND A MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITY. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES INCLUDE GENERAL UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS EITHER ISSUED DIRECTLY BY OR GUARANTEED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTERPRISES. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MBS INCLUDE MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION AND THE GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION. NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT, AGENCY AND SUPRANATIONAL SECURITIES CONSIST OF DIRECT OBLIGATIONS OF HIGHLY RATED GOVERNMENTS OF NATIONS OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES, OBLIGATIONS OF SPONSORED AGENCIES AND OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE GUARANTEED OR SUPPORTED BY HIGHLY RATED GOVERNMENTS OF NATIONS OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES. CORPORATE DEBT-GLOBAL INCLUDES OBLIGATIONS ISSUED BY INVESTMENT-GRADE CORPORATIONS INCLUDING SOME ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN GUARANTEED BY GOVERNMENTS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A 78 TABLE OF CONTENTS SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, FAIR VALUES AND RELATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS): LONG-TERM DEBT: IN OCTOBER 2010, WE ISSUED A TOTAL OF $1.25 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2.45% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2015, $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.95% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2020 AND $250.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 5.7% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2040. THE NOTES WERE ISSUED AT 99.854%, 99.745% AND 99.813% OF PAR, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE DISCOUNT AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. INTEREST ON THE NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON APRIL 15 AND OCTOBER 15 EACH YEAR BEGINNING APRIL 15, 2011 AND THE PRINCIPAL ON EACH NOTE IS DUE IN FULL AT THEIR RESPECTIVE MATURITY DATES. THE NOTES MAY BE REDEEMED AT OUR OPTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT ANY TIME AT A REDEMPTION PRICE DEFINED IN A MAKE-WHOLE CLAUSE EQUALING ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST PLUS THE GREATER OF 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES TO BE REDEEMED OR THE SUM OF THE PRESENT VALUES OF THE REMAINING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL. IF WE EXPERIENCE A CHANGE OF CONTROL ACCOMPANIED BY A DOWNGRADE OF THE DEBT TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO OFFER TO REPURCHASE THE NOTES AT A PURCHASE PRICE EQUAL TO 101% OF THEIR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST. WE ARE SUBJECT TO COVENANTS WHICH LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PLEDGE PROPERTIES AS SECURITY UNDER BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING OUR PROPERTY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SENIOR NOTES OUTSTANDING WAS $1.294 BILLION. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS: WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PROTECT AGAINST CHANGES IN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010 HAD SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 36 MONTHS. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES UNDER ASC 815 AND, ACCORDINGLY, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THEM ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), OR OCI, AND RECLASSIFIED TO OPERATIONS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT OPERATIONS. ANY INEFFECTIVENESS ON THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IS REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. FOREIGN 79 TABLE OF CONTENTS CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS): WE CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF OUR OWN AND THE COUNTERPARTIES' CREDIT RISK ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO EXECUTE ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONTRACT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, CREDIT RISK DID NOT MATERIALLY CHANGE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS. WE RECOGNIZED DECREASES IN NET PRODUCT SALES FOR CERTAIN EFFECTIVE CASH FLOW HEDGE INSTRUMENTS OF $33 THOUSAND IN 2011 AND INCREASES OF $47.7 MILLION IN 2010. THESE SETTLEMENTS WERE RECORDED IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED FORECASTED SALES OCCURRED. CHANGES IN TIME VALUE, WHICH WE EXCLUDED FROM THE HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT, WERE INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. WE ALSO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN RECOGNIZED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS HEDGES UNDER ASC 815 AND, ACCORDINGLY, ANY CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS HEDGES RESULTED IN GAINS OF $31.9 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO LOSSES OF $70 THOUSAND IN 2010. THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD NON-DESIGNATED HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010 WERE $916.9 MILLION AND $848.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, WE BELIEVE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS A REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES. ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2011 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WOULD CHANGE BY APPROXIMATELY $225.6 MILLION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS EITHER HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES OR RELATE TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE ENTITIES' FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE EITHER REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS OR RE-MEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR LIABILITY. FROM TIME TO TIME WE ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS TO CONVERT A PORTION OF OUR INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE FROM FIXED RATE TO FLOATING RATE TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN INTEREST EXPENSE WITH INTEREST INCOME RECEIVED ON OUR CASH EQUIVALENT AND INVESTMENT BALANCES. THERE WERE NO INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2011. 80 TABLE OF CONTENTS
