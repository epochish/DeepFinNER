THE $6.3 MILLION DECREASE IN NET INCOME TO $1.450 BILLION IN 2013 COMPARED TO 2012 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $446.3 MILLION INCREASE IN PAYMENTS MADE RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS, A $61.9 MILLION INCREASE IN ABRAXANE® AMORTIZATION EXPENSE DUE TO THE OCTOBER 2012 FDA APPROVAL OF ABRAXANE® FOR TREATMENT OF NSCLC, A $94.8 MILLION INCREASE IN SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND INCREASED SPENDING IN SUPPORT OF OUR CURRENTLY MARKETED PRODUCTS AND THOSE THAT WE PLAN TO LAUNCH. THE INCREASES IN EXPENSE WERE NEARLY OFFSET BY THE FAVORABLE IMPACT FROM A HIGHER LEVEL OF NET PRODUCT SALES. THE $0.07 INCREASE IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN 2013 COMPARED TO 2012 WAS FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY THE REPURCHASE OF 22.3 MILLION COMMON SHARES UNDER OUR COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, REDUCING OUR OUTSTANDING SHARE BASE.32TABLE OF CONTENTSRESULTS OF OPERATIONS:FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012 AND 2011TOTAL REVENUE: TOTAL REVENUE AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012 AND 2011 WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA):THE INCREASE IN TOTAL REVENUE OF $987.2 MILLION IN 2013 COMPARED TO 2012 REFLECTED INCREASES OF $693.0 MILLION, OR 21.9%, IN THE UNITED STATES, AND $294.2 MILLION, OR 12.6%, IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

THE INCREASE WAS COMPRISED OF NET VOLUME INCREASES OF $950.3 MILLION AND PRICE INCREASES OF $117.0 MILLION, PARTLY OFFSET BY AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN EXCHANGE OF $90.6 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN VOLUME WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED UNIT SALES OF REVLIMID®, THE FAVORABLE IMPACT FROM INCREASED U.S. SALES OF ABRAXANE® RESULTING FROM THE OCTOBER 2012 AND SEPTEMBER 2013 FDA APPROVALS FOR TREATMENT OF NSCLC AND PANCREATIC CANCER, RESPECTIVELY, AS WELL AS THE FEBRUARY 2013 FDA AND AUGUST 2013 EC APPROVALS OF POMALYST®/IMNOVID® FOR TREATMENT OF MULTIPLE MYELOMA.

THESE ARE PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®, POMALYST® AND THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID®, THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENETM AND IMNOVID® ARE DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL AUTHORITIES’ SPECIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE FOR THE PRODUCT’S SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. VIDAZA®, ABRAXANE® AND ISTODAX® ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID®, THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENETM.WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. AS NOTED ABOVE, REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID®, THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENETM ARE DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY SUBJECT TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY. SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF THE REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE HAVE ALSO ANALYZED ACTUAL BILLINGS RECEIVED FROM THE STATES TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE ACCRUAL RATES. SUBSEQUENT TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010 (COLLECTIVELY, THE 2010 U.S. HEALTH CARE REFORM LAW), CERTAIN STATES HAVE ONLY RECENTLY BEGUN SUBMITTING PARTIAL MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION BILLS. OUR ACCRUALS FOR THESE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION REBATES HAD BEEN AT ELEVATED LEVELS GIVEN THE DELAYS IN THE RECEIPT OF COMPLETE INVOICES FROM CERTAIN STATES. DUE TO THE RECEIPT OF MORE COMPLETE CLAIMS DATA AS 2013 PROGRESSED, THE ACCRUALS FOR CERTAIN STATES WERE REDUCED FROM THE ELEVATED LEVELS AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AS A RESULT OF BOTH THE PAYMENTS MADE BEING APPLIED TO THE ACCRUAL AND A $20.3 MILLION FAVORABLE CHANGE IN ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE OBLIGATION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ADJUST THE REBATE ACCRUALS AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND TO REFLECT ACTUAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011, MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT’S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL INVOICES. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES.REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE RECORD A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY. CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED 35TABLE OF CONTENTSON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED.

WE EXPECT CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR EXPENDITURES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TRIALS, COMMERCIALIZATION OF NEW PRODUCTS, INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND EXISTING SOURCES OF AND ACCESS TO FINANCING ARE ADEQUATE TO FUND OUR OPERATING NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AND OUR PLANS TO REPURCHASE STOCK OR PURSUE OTHER STRATEGIC BUSINESS INITIATIVES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE HELD INTERNATIONALLY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, WE HELD APPROXIMATELY $4.701 BILLION OF THESE SHORT-TERM FUNDS IN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS. THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS HELD IN U.S. TAX JURISDICTIONS CAN FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND DUE TO OTHER REASONS, SUCH AS REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND BUSINESS-DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. AS PART OF OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY ASSESSMENTS, WE REGULARLY MONITOR THE MIX OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CASH FLOWS (BOTH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS). REPATRIATION OF OVERSEAS FUNDS CAN RESULT IN ADDITIONAL U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAX PAYMENTS.

THE REMAINING FOREIGN EARNINGS ARE UNREMITTED AND EXPECTED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE DO NOT RELY ON THESE EARNINGS AS A SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR OUR DOMESTIC BUSINESS AS WE EXPECT TO HAVE SUFFICIENT CURRENT CASH RESOURCES COMBINED WITH FUTURE CASH FLOWS IN THE UNITED STATES TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC NEEDS.SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM: OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED AN AGGREGATE $9.500 BILLION STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF WHICH WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $2.068 BILLION REMAINING FOR FUTURE SHARE REPURCHASES.

THE $1.787 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 COMPARED TO 2012 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ISSUANCE OF $1.500 BILLION IN SENIOR NOTES IN AUGUST 2013, NET INCREASE OF $234.1 MILLION IN SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND BY CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, PARTLY OFFSET BY $2.765 BILLION PAID UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.

UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY.

SALES MADE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES TYPICALLY HAVE PAYMENT TERMS THAT ARE GREATER THAN 60 DAYS, THEREBY EXTENDING COLLECTION PERIODS BEYOND THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE EXPECT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE TO CONTINUE TO GROW AS OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES CONTINUE TO EXPAND.WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES, THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS IN CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND ASSOCIATED IMPACTS ON THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OUR BUSINESS. OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL IN THESE MARKETS IS TYPICALLY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO PRINCIPALLY GOVERNMENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED HOSPITALS, WHICH IN TURN DIRECTLY DELIVER CRITICAL CARE TO PATIENTS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE USED TO TREAT LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES AND WE BELIEVE THIS BUSINESS MODEL ENABLES TIMELY DELIVERY AND ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS. MANY OF THE OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE RELATED TO GOVERNMENT-FUNDED HOSPITALS AND WE BELIEVE THE RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE ULTIMATELY COLLECTIBLE. SIMILARLY, WE BELIEVE THAT FUTURE SALES TO THESE CUSTOMERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE COLLECTIBLE. THE CREDIT AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WITHIN SPAIN, ITALY, PORTUGAL AND GREECE, AS WELL AS INCREASING SALES LEVELS IN THOSE COUNTRIES HAVE RESULTED IN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN, AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES TO COLLECT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. OUR TOTAL NET RECEIVABLES IN SPAIN, ITALY AND PORTUGAL ARE COMPOSED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR CONTROLLED HOSPITALS AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND AMOUNTED TO $348.4 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 COMPARED TO $324.2 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2012. APPROXIMATELY $86.4 MILLION OF THE $348.4 MILLION RECEIVABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 WAS GREATER THAN ONE YEAR PAST DUE. OUR EXPOSURE TO THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS IN GREECE IS LIMITED, AS WE DO NOT HAVE A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF RECEIVABLES IN GREECE. WE MAINTAIN TIMELY AND DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH HOSPITAL CUSTOMERS IN SPAIN, ITALY AND PORTUGAL REGARDING BOTH THE CURRENT AND PAST DUE RECEIVABLE BALANCES. WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS FROM THESE COUNTRIES AND CLOSELY MONITOR THE PLANS FOR PAYMENT AT THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL. PAYMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS IN THESE COUNTRIES ARE NOT RECEIVED ON REGULAR INTERVALS AND SEVERAL MONTHS COULD ELAPSE BETWEEN SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS. IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR SPAIN, ITALY AND PORTUGAL, WE CONSIDERED THAT THE BALANCE OF PAST DUE RECEIVABLES IS RELATED TO SALES MADE TO GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR SUPPORTED CUSTOMERS. WE REGULARLY MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS IN EUROPE TO ASSESS WHETHER THE LEVEL OF RISK OF DEFAULT FOR ANY CUSTOMERS HAS INCREASED AND NOTE THE ONGOING EFFORTS BY THE EUROPEAN UNION, EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION AND INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND TO SUPPORT COUNTRIES WITH LARGE PUBLIC DEFICITS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT BALANCES. WE ALSO MONITOR THE EFFORTS OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES TO SUPPORT THEIR REGIONS WITH LARGE PUBLIC DEFICITS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT BALANCES. WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR WRITE-OFFS WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLECTION OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN THESE COUNTRIES AS A RESULT OF THEIR ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES AND WE DO NOT EXPECT TO HAVE WRITE-OFFS OR ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.INVENTORY: INVENTORY BALANCES INCREASED BY $80.9 MILLION TO $340.4 MILLION AT THE END OF 2013 COMPARED TO 2012. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN ABRAXANE® INVENTORIES, ATTRIBUTABLE TO A HIGHER SALES LEVEL RESULTING FROM THE FDA APPROVALS OF ABRAXANE® FOR TREATMENT OF NSCLC IN OCTOBER 2012 AND PANCREATIC CANCER IN SEPTEMBER 2013, AS WELL AS $33.4 MILLION OF OTEZLA® (APREMILAST) INVENTORY THAT HAS BEEN CAPITALIZED PRIOR TO REGULATORY APPROVAL, IN ANTICIPATION OF REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR THIS PRODUCT.OTHER CURRENT ASSETS: OTHER CURRENT ASSETS INCREASED BY $116.2 MILLION TO $436.4 MILLION AT THE END OF 2013 COMPARED TO 2012 PRIMARILY DUE TO A $48.8 MILLION INCREASE IN PREPAID TAXES, A $33.9 MILLION INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND A NET INCREASE IN OTHER PREPAID ACCOUNTS.COMMERCIAL PAPER: IN SEPTEMBER 2011, WE ENTERED INTO A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM (THE PROGRAM) UNDER WHICH WE ISSUE UNSECURED COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES (COMMERCIAL PAPER) ON A PRIVATE PLACEMENT BASIS, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH ARE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE MAXIMUM AGGREGATE AMOUNT AVAILABLE UNDER THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY $1.500 BILLION. THE MATURITIES OF 44TABLE OF CONTENTSTHE COMMERCIAL PAPER MAY VARY, BUT MAY NOT EXCEED 270 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ISSUE. THE COMMERCIAL PAPER IS SOLD UNDER CUSTOMARY TERMS TO A DEALER OR IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET AND IS ISSUED AT A DISCOUNT FROM PAR OR, ALTERNATIVELY, IS SOLD AT PAR AND BEARS VARYING INTEREST RATES ON A FIXED OR FLOATING BASIS. BORROWINGS UNDER THE PROGRAM ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, $544.8 MILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER WAS OUTSTANDING BEARING AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OF 0.4%.SENIOR UNSECURED CREDIT FACILITY: IN SEPTEMBER 2011, WE ENTERED INTO A SENIOR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (CREDIT FACILITY) PROVIDING FOR REVOLVING CREDIT IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $1.000 BILLION, WHICH WAS INCREASED TO $1.500 BILLION IN APRIL 2013. THE TERM OF THE CREDIT FACILITY WAS ALSO EXTENDED FROM SEPTEMBER 2, 2016 TO APRIL 18, 2018. SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT FACILITY (BUT IN NO EVENT MORE THAN ONE TIME PER ANNUM), UP TO A MAXIMUM AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $1.750 BILLION. AMOUNTS MAY BE BORROWED UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE CREDIT FACILITY SERVES AS BACKUP LIQUIDITY FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013 THERE WAS NO OUTSTANDING BORROWING AGAINST THE CREDIT FACILITY. THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS INCLUDING CERTAIN CUSTOMARY FINANCIAL COVENANTS. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE COVENANTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013.ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES: ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES INCREASED BY $4.4 MILLION TO $1.357 BILLION AT THE END OF 2013 COMPARED TO 2012. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES OF $93.1 MILLION IN COMPENSATION RELATED EXPENSES, $45.3 MILLION OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO THE JANUARY 2012 AVILA ACQUISITION, $45.0 MILLION RELATED TO COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS, $30.3 MILLION RELATED TO SALES ADJUSTMENTS, $22.7 MILLION RELATED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, $22.8 MILLION IN ACCRUED INTEREST AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS LIABILITIES. THE INCREASES WERE MOSTLY OFFSET BY THE 2013 PAYMENT OF A $300.0 MILLION LIABILITY, WHICH HAD A FAIR VALUE OF $277.4 MILLION AT THE END OF 2012, ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS. INCOME TAXES PAYABLE (CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT): INCOME TAXES PAYABLE INCREASED BY $51.0 MILLION TO $251.0 MILLION AT THE END OF 2013 COMPARED TO 2012, PRIMARILY FROM THE CURRENT PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES OF $462.1 MILLION, NET DEFERRED INTERCOMPANY CREDITS OF $32.6 MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN REFUNDABLE INCOME TAXES OF $23.9 MILLION, OFFSET BY INCOME TAX PAYMENTS OF $291.9 MILLION AND A TAX BENEFIT OF STOCK OPTIONS OF $171.7 MILLION.SENIOR NOTES: IN AUGUST 2013, WE ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL $1.500 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $400.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2.300% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2018 (THE 2018 NOTES), $700.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 4.000% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2023 (THE 2023 NOTES) AND $400.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 5.250% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2043 (THE 2043 NOTES) AND, TOGETHER WITH THE 2018 NOTES AND 2023 NOTES, REFERRED TO HEREIN AS THE “2013 ISSUED NOTES”. THE 2013 ISSUED NOTES WERE ISSUED AT 99.792%, 99.452% AND 99.147% OF PAR, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE DISCOUNT IS BEING AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. OFFERING COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $12.5 MILLION HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. INTEREST ON THE NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON FEBRUARY 15 AND AUGUST 15 EACH YEAR BEGINNING FEBRUARY 15, 2014 AND THE PRINCIPAL ON EACH NOTE IS DUE IN FULL AT THEIR RESPECTIVE MATURITY DATES. THE NOTES MAY BE REDEEMED AT OUR OPTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT ANY TIME AT A REDEMPTION PRICE DEFINED IN A MAKE-WHOLE CLAUSE EQUALING ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST PLUS THE GREATER OF 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES TO BE REDEEMED OR THE SUM OF THE PRESENT VALUES OF THE REMAINING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL DISCOUNTED TO THE DATE OF REDEMPTION ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS PLUS 15 BASIS POINTS IN THE CASE OF THE 2018 NOTES, 20 BASIS POINTS IN THE CASE OF THE 2023 NOTES AND 25 BASIS POINTS IN THE CASE OF THE 2043 NOTES. IF WE EXPERIENCE A CHANGE OF CONTROL ACCOMPANIED BY A DOWNGRADE OF THE DEBT TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO OFFER TO REPURCHASE THE NOTES AT A PURCHASE PRICE EQUAL TO 101% OF THEIR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST. WE ARE SUBJECT TO COVENANTS WHICH LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PLEDGE PROPERTIES AS SECURITY UNDER BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING OUR PROPERTY. THE CARRYING VALUE OF ALL OF OUR SENIOR NOTES ISSUED WAS $4.196 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013.45TABLE OF CONTENTSCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012 AND 2011 WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS):OPERATING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY $207.3 MILLION TO $2.226 BILLION IN 2013 COMPARED TO 2012 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF AN EXPANSION OF OUR OPERATIONS AND A RELATED INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS.NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2012 INCREASED BY $242.5 MILLION TO $2.019 BILLION COMPARED TO 2011 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF AN EXPANSION OF OUR OPERATIONS AND RELATED INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS.INVESTING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED BY $1.025 BILLION IN 2013 COMPARED TO 2012. THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO A CASH USE OF $341.3 MILLION FOR NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE DURING 2013 COMPARED TO A CASH USE OF $1.025 BILLION FOR NET PURCHASES IN 2012, PLUS THE USE OF $352.2 MILLION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF AVILA IN 2012.NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2012 CHANGED TO A NET USE OF $1.554 BILLION COMPARED TO $377.7 MILLION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2011. THE DECREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO A CASH USE OF $1.025 BILLION FOR NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE DURING 2012 COMPARED TO NET SALES OF $481.8 MILLION IN 2011, PLUS THE USE OF $352.2 MILLION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF AVILA AND $48.9 MILLION FOR THE PURCHASE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER ASSETS.FINANCING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2013 WAS $553.7 MILLION COMPARED TO A NET CASH USE OF $248.8 MILLION IN 2012. THE $304.9 MILLION INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A $721.0 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR THE PURCHASE OF TREASURY SHARES AND A CASH USE OF $225.0 MILLION RECORDED AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY TO REFLECT THE PORTION OF A $300.0 MILLION MILESTONE PAYMENT TO HOLDERS OF OUR CVRS THAT REPRESENTS THE ORIGINAL FAIR VALUE OF ABRAXIS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET PROCEEDS FROM BORROWING OF $234.1 MILLION DURING 2013 COMPARED TO NET REPAYMENTS OF $217.4 MILLION IN 2012. PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS PLUS THE EXCESS TAX BENEFIT FROM SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS PROVIDED AN AGGREGATE $721.0 MILLION DURING 2013, WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF $195.5 MILLION FROM 2012.NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2012 WAS $248.8 MILLION COMPARED TO A NET CASH USE OF $1.622 BILLION IN 2011. THE $1.372 BILLION DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2012 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO $1.487 BILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $217.4 MILLION OF NET REPAYMENTS OF SHORT-TERM BORROWING IN 2012, COMPARED TO $525.7 MILLION OF NET SHORT-TERM BORROWING IN 2011. DURING 2012 AND 2011, WE USED $2.044 BILLION AND $2.189 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, MEASURED ON A SETTLEMENT DATE BASIS.46TABLE OF CONTENTSCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSTHE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013 (IN MILLIONS):1 THE SENIOR NOTE OBLIGATION AMOUNTS INCLUDE FUTURE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS.SENIOR NOTES: IN AUGUST 2013, WE ISSUED $1.500 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $400.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2.300% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2018, $700.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 4.000% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2023 AND $400.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 5.250% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2043.IN AUGUST 2012, WE ISSUED A TOTAL OF $1.500 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 1.90% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2017, AND $1.000 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.25% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2022. IN OCTOBER 2010, WE ISSUED A TOTAL OF $1.250 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2.45% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2015, $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.95% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2020 AND $250.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 5.7% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2040.SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS: CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS INCLUDED PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND FEES OF $544.8 MILLION RELATED TO COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2013.OPERATING LEASES: WE LEASE OFFICE AND RESEARCH FACILITIES UNDER VARIOUS OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE NON-CANCELABLE LEASE TERMS FOR OPERATING LEASES EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES BETWEEN 2014 AND 2023 AND INCLUDE RENEWAL OPTIONS. IN GENERAL, WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE LESSORS FOR REAL ESTATE TAXES, INSURANCE, UTILITIES, MAINTENANCE AND OTHER OPERATING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEASES. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE MAJOR FACILITIES THAT WE OCCUPY UNDER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS REFER TO PART I, ITEM 2. "PROPERTIES" OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS: OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS OF $170.3 MILLION ON DECEMBER 31, 2013 PRIMARILY INCLUDED $153.7 MILLION IN CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPLY CONTRACTS AND A REMAINING $14.6 MILLION BALANCE DUE IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF A MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN SWITZERLAND.COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS: WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT INCLUDE THE FUNDING OF CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE MILESTONE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED DEVELOPMENTAL, REGULATORY AND/OR COMMERCIAL TARGETS. OUR OBLIGATION TO FUND THESE EFFORTS IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROGRAMS AND/OR THE LACK OF ANY ADVERSE EVENTS WHICH COULD CAUSE THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE PROGRAMS. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE ATTAINMENT OF SPECIFIED DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND ACCORDINGLY, NO AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED FOR THESE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012 CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. POTENTIAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS (NOT INCLUDING POTENTIAL ROYALTY PAYMENTS) TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $4.300 BILLION, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $3.503 BILLION CONTINGENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF VARIOUS RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES AND APPROXIMATELY $796.7 MILLION IN SALES-BASED MILESTONES. THE MORE NOTABLE COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS ARE IDENTIFIED IN NOTE 17 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSFOR A DISCUSSION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS PLEASE SEE NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.47TABLE OF CONTENTSCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IS ONE THAT IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENT'S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL:REVENUE RECOGNITION: REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS OF THE PRODUCT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER AND THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED AND DETERMINABLE. PROVISIONS FOR DISCOUNTS, EARLY PAYMENTS, REBATES, SALES RETURNS AND DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS UNDER TERMS CUSTOMARY IN THE INDUSTRY ARE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SAME PERIOD THE RELATED SALES ARE RECORDED. WE RECORD ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SALE. THE ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR SUCH VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES ARE BASED ON THE SALES TERMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND TREND ANALYSIS.WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM ROYALTIES BASED ON LICENSEES' SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS USING OUR TECHNOLOGIES. ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACT TERMS WHEN ROYALTIES FROM LICENSEES CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED. IF ROYALTIES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR COLLECTABILITY OF A ROYALTY AMOUNT IS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED, ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE CASH IS RECEIVED.GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. REVLIMID®, POMALYST® AND THALOMID® ARE DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY SUBJECT TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL, RESULTING IN GENERALLY LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY FOR THOSE PRODUCTS.SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS.GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF THE REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE HAVE ALSO ANALYZED ACTUAL BILLINGS RECEIVED FROM THE STATES TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE ACCRUAL RATES. SUBSEQUENT TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010 (COLLECTIVELY THE 2010 U.S. HEALTH CARE REFORM LAW), CERTAIN STATES HAVE ONLY RECENTLY BEGUN SUBMITTING PARTIAL MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION BILLS. OUR ACCRUALS FOR THESE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION REBATES HAD BEEN AT ELEVATED LEVELS GIVEN THE DELAYS IN THE RECEIPT OF COMPLETE INVOICES FROM CERTAIN STATES. DUE TO THE RECEIPT OF MORE COMPLETE CLAIMS DATA AS 2013 PROGRESSED, THE ACCRUALS FOR CERTAIN STATES WERE REDUCED FROM THE ELEVATED LEVELS AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AS A RESULT OF BOTH THE PAYMENTS MADE BEING APPLIED TO THE ACCRUAL AND A $20.3 MILLION FAVORABLE CHANGE IN ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE OBLIGATION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ADJUST THE REBATE ACCRUALS AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND TO REFLECT ACTUAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011, MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT’S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL INVOICES. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES.REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE PROVIDE A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY. 48TABLE OF CONTENTSCHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE INCLUDED IN CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS AND ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA.ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: WE ESTIMATE AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, HISTORICAL PAYMENT PATTERNS, AGING OF RECEIVABLE BALANCES AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF COUNTRIES THEMSELVES AND PROVINCES OR AREAS WITHIN SUCH COUNTRIES WHERE THEY ARE THE ULTIMATE CUSTOMERS.INCOME TAXES: WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. WE PROVIDE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED.WE ACCOUNT FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS PART OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THESE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATE PRIMARILY TO ISSUES COMMON AMONG MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE APPLY A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES WHICH INCLUDE STUDIES PERFORMED BY INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS, ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY AND SUBJECT EXPERTS, EVALUATION OF PUBLIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. WE PROVIDE ESTIMATES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. IF OUR ESTIMATES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ACTUAL OUTCOMES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED.WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE A PORTION WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR RECENT CUMULATIVE EARNINGS EXPERIENCE BY TAXING JURISDICTION, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, CARRYFORWARD PERIODS AVAILABLE TO US FOR TAX REPORTING PURPOSES, VARIOUS INCOME TAX STRATEGIES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT AND, TO THE EXTENT FUTURE EXPECTATIONS CHANGE, WE WOULD HAVE TO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THAT TIME. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES.SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION: WE UTILIZE SHARE BASED COMPENSATION IN THE FORM OF STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, OR RSUS, AND PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, OR PSUS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARDS AT GRANT DATE. COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED REFLECTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF AWARDS EXPECTED TO VEST AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AN ESTIMATE OF AWARD FORFEITURES BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE VESTING PERIOD REQUIRED TO OBTAIN FULL VESTING. MANAGEMENT EXPECTATIONS RELATED TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PERFORMANCE GOALS ASSOCIATED WITH PSU GRANTS IS ASSESSED REGULARLY AND THAT ASSESSMENT IS USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER PSU GRANTS ARE EXPECTED TO VEST. IF PERFORMANCE-BASED MILESTONES RELATED TO PSU GRANTS ARE NOT MET OR NOT EXPECTED TO BE MET, ANY COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED TO DATE ASSOCIATED WITH GRANTS THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO VEST WILL BE REVERSED.OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES: A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF ANY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY BELOW ITS COST THAT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN CARRYING AMOUNT TO FAIR VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT IS CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AND A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE SECURITY ESTABLISHED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INCLUDE: SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE ISSUER'S EARNINGS PERFORMANCE, CREDIT RATING, ASSET QUALITY, BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE ISSUER OPERATES, LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW OUR COST, OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE SECURITY, OUR INTENT NOT TO SELL, AN EVALUATION AS TO WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO SELL BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR COST BASIS, AND ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ISSUER'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD DIFFER FROM OUR ASSESSMENT.DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES: ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN CURRENT EARNINGS OR OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), DEPENDING ON WHETHER A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION AND, IF IT IS, THE TYPE OF HEDGING TRANSACTION. FOR A DERIVATIVE TO QUALIFY AS A HEDGE AT INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE HEDGED PERIOD, WE FORMALLY DOCUMENT THE NATURE AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEM. WE ASSESS, BOTH AT INCEPTION AND ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING TRANSACTIONS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING THE CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS. WE ASSESS HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND RECORD THE GAIN OR LOSS RELATED TO THE INEFFECTIVE 49TABLE OF CONTENTSPORTION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IF ANY, TO CURRENT EARNINGS. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER PROBABLE OF OCCURRING, WE DISCONTINUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING AND ANY RELATED UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE NOT DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION, TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES. THE USE OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE EXPOSURE OF THESE RISKS WITH THE INTENT TO REDUCE OUR RISK OR COST.INVESTMENTS IN OTHER ENTITIES: WE HOLD A PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER EITHER THE EQUITY METHOD OR COST METHOD. INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES OR CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS OVER WHICH WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD, WITH OUR SHARE OF EARNINGS OR LOSSES REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES OF COMPANIES THAT BECOME PUBLICLY TRADED ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES PROSPECTIVELY FROM THE DATE OF SUCH COMPANIES' INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING.OUR COST METHOD AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.ALL INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT. IF AN INVESTMENT'S FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN ITS NET CARRYING VALUE AND THE DECLINE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE. SUCH AN EVALUATION IS JUDGMENTAL AND DEPENDENT ON SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE HAS OCCURRED INCLUDE: MARKET VALUE OR EXIT PRICE OF THE INVESTMENT BASED ON EITHER MARKET-QUOTED PRICES OR FUTURE ROUNDS OF FINANCING BY THE INVESTEE; LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE MARKET VALUE WAS BELOW ITS COST BASIS; FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE INVESTEE; OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT; ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INVESTEE'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN; ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE MAY BE AWARE OF RELATED TO THE INVESTMENT.ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, OR LTIP, DESIGNED TO PROVIDE KEY OFFICERS AND EXECUTIVES WITH PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES CONTINGENT UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED CORPORATE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES COVERING A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE SEPARATE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLES RUNNING CONCURRENTLY ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014, 2015 AND 2016. PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR EACH OF THE PERFORMANCE CYCLES ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS: 37.5% ON NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE; 37.5% ON TOTAL NON-GAAP REVENUE, AS DEFINED; AND 25% ON RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, WHICH IS A MEASUREMENT OF OUR STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR COMPARED WITH A GROUP OF OTHER COMPANIES IN THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.PAYOUTS MAY BE IN THE RANGE OF 0% TO 200% OF THE PARTICIPANT'S SALARY FOR THE LTIPS. SUCH AWARDS ARE PAYABLE IN CASH OR COMMON STOCK OR A MIXTURE OF CASH AND COMMON STOCK, WHICH WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AT THE TIME OF AWARD DELIVERY. FOR AWARDS PAYABLE IN COMMON STOCK, THE NUMBER OF SHARES IS DETERMINED USING THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE FOR THE 30 TRADING DAYS PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CYCLE. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAY DETERMINE THAT PAYMENTS MADE IN COMMON STOCK WILL BE RESTRICTED FROM TRADING FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS. WE ACCRUE THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE LIABILITY OVER EACH THREE-YEAR CYCLE. PRIOR TO THE END OF A THREE-YEAR CYCLE, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT DURING THE CYCLE. UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT EQUAL TO THEIR TARGET AWARD OR, IF HIGHER, AN AWARD BASED ON ACTUAL PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL.ACCRUALS RECORDED FOR THE LTIP ENTAIL MAKING CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE, NON-GAAP REVENUES AND RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, AS DEFINED; THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED. ACCRUALS FOR THE LTIP ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND REVISED ACCORDINGLY SO THAT THE LIABILITY RECORDED REFLECTS UPDATED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PAYOUTS. IN ESTIMATING THE ACCRUALS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DATE FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, EXPECTED RESULTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, OPERATING TRENDS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICING AND COMPETITION.VALUATION OF GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, OTHER ASSETS AND IPR&D: WE HAVE RECORDED GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IPR&D PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ACQUISITIONS OF PHARMION, GLOUCESTER, ABRAXIS AND AVILA. WHEN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS, ARE ACQUIRED, WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS ARE TYPICALLY USED IN THESE VALUATIONS IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, AND THE MODELS REQUIRE THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:•PROJECTING REGULATORY APPROVALS;•ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM PRODUCT SALES RESULTING FROM COMPLETED PRODUCTS AND IN-PROCESS PROJECTS OR ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED; AND•DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES AND PROBABILITY RATES.GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. WE TEST OUR GOODWILL ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT EACH NOVEMBER 30. WE ARE 50TABLE OF CONTENTSORGANIZED AS A SINGLE REPORTING UNIT AND THEREFORE THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS DONE USING OUR OVERALL MARKET VALUE, AS DETERMINED BY OUR TRADED SHARE PRICE, AS COMPARED TO OUR BOOK VALUE OF NET ASSETS.INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE AMORTIZED TO THEIR ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR. INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO IPR&D PRODUCT RIGHTS ARE TREATED AS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND NOT AMORTIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS APPROVED FOR SALE BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN SPECIFIED MARKETS. AT THAT TIME, WE WILL DETERMINE THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET, RECLASSIFY THE ASSET OUT OF IPR&D AND BEGIN AMORTIZATION. IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS ALSO PERFORMED AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. SUCH TEST ENTAILS COMPLETING AN UPDATED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.OTHER ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. SUCH TEST ENTAILS COMPLETING AN UPDATED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.VALUATION OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION: WE RECORD CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION AT ITS FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE, AND FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT REPORTING PERIOD REVALUE THESE OBLIGATIONS AND RECORD INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPERATING EARNINGS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. CHANGES TO CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION OBLIGATIONS CAN RESULT FROM MOVEMENTS IN PUBLICLY TRADED SHARE PRICES OF CVRS, ADJUSTMENTS TO DISCOUNT RATES AND PERIODS, UPDATES IN THE ASSUMED ACHIEVEMENT OR TIMING OF ANY DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES OR CHANGES IN THE PROBABILITY OF CERTAIN CLINICAL EVENTS AND CHANGES IN THE ASSUMED PROBABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATORY APPROVAL. THE ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT AND ANY CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION EXPENSE RECORDED IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. OUR CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES WERE ACQUIRED IN THE ACQUISITIONS OF GLOUCESTER, ABRAXIS, AND AVILA. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE GLOUCESTER AND AVILA CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE DISCOUNT RATE, PROBABILITY AND ESTIMATED TIMING OF CASH MILESTONE PAYMENTS TO THE FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OR EACH COMPANY. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ABRAXIS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY IS BASED ON THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKTHE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES FORWARD-LOOKING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RISK OF LOSS IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES, CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE EARNINGS.WE HAVE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, OUR MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS CONSISTED OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, OUR LONG-TERM DEBT AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE CONSISTED OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED (MBS) SECURITIES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT, AGENCY AND SUPRANATIONAL SECURITIES, GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, ASSET BACKED SECURITIES AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES.

UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET.51TABLE OF CONTENTSAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, FAIR VALUES AND RELATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS):LONG-TERM DEBT: WE HAVE ISSUED AN AGGREGATE $4.250 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES AT VARYING MATURITY DATES AND INTEREST RATES. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS AND CARRYING VALUES OF THESE SENIOR NOTES AS OF THE END OF DECEMBER 31, 2013 ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW: AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SENIOR NOTES OUTSTANDING WAS $4.269 BILLION. CELGENE COMMON STOCK: AS PART OF THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTOR AUTHORIZED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, SELL PUT OPTIONS ON OUR COMMON STOCK WITH STRIKE PRICES THAT WE BELIEVE REPRESENT AN ATTRACTIVE PRICE TO REPURCHASE OUR SHARES. IF THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR SHARES EXCEEDS THE STRIKE PRICE OF THE PUT OPTION AT THE TIME THE OPTION EXPIRES, WE WILL HAVE ECONOMICALLY REDUCED THE COST OF OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM BY THE AMOUNT OF THE PREMIUM WE RECEIVED FROM THE SALE OF THE PUT OPTION. IF THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR STOCK IS BELOW THE STRIKE PRICE OF THE PUT OPTION AT THE TIME THE OPTION EXPIRES, WE WOULD REPURCHASE THE SHARES COVERED BY THE OPTION AT THE STRIKE PRICE OF THE PUT OPTION. WHILE SUCH A PURCHASE WOULD BE AT A PRICE ABOVE THE THEN FAIR MARKET VALUE OF OUR SHARES, IT WOULD BE AT A PRICE THAT WE FEEL IS FAVORABLE IN THE OVERALL CONTEXT OF OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. DURING 2013 WE SOLD A SINGLE PUT OPTION FOR A PREMIUM OF $1.2 MILLION THAT EXPIRED UNEXERCISED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING PUT OPTIONS. IN FEBRUARY 2014, WE SOLD A PUT OPTION ON $200.0 MILLION NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF SHARES OF STOCK WITH A STRIKE PRICE OF $142.81 AND MATURING IN MARCH 2014 FOR A PREMIUM OF $4.8 MILLION.MARKET RISK MANAGEMENTOUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN BE IMPACTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES. WE ACTIVELY MANAGE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE AND INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS THROUGH OPERATIONAL MEANS AND THROUGH THE USE OF VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS, FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS.FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENTWE MAINTAIN A FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS, TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.THROUGH OUR REVENUE HEDGING PROGRAM, WE ENDEAVOR TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF POSSIBLE UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON OUR FUTURE U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS THAT ARE DERIVED FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, TYPICALLY WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. WE MANAGE OUR ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION EXPOSURE PRINCIPALLY WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND OCCASIONALLY FOREIGN CURRENCY PUT AND CALL OPTIONS.52TABLE OF CONTENTSFOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS: WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, MANAGE EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY IN THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS AND TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.WE MANAGE A PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PROTECT AGAINST CHANGES IN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012 HAD SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 36 MONTHS. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AND, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THEM ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) (OCI) AND RECLASSIFIED TO OPERATIONS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT OPERATIONS. ANY INEFFECTIVENESS ON THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IS REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES WERE AS FOLLOWS AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012 (IN MILLIONS):WE CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF OUR OWN AND THE COUNTERPARTIES' CREDIT RISK ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO EXECUTE ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONTRACT ON AN ONGOING BASIS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, CREDIT RISK DID NOT MATERIALLY CHANGE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS.WE ALSO MANAGE A PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN RECOGNIZED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE RELATED TO TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND, ACCORDINGLY, ANY CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD NON-DESIGNATED HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012 WERE $878.5 MILLION AND $795.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, WE BELIEVE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS A REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES. ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2013 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WOULD CHANGE BY APPROXIMATELY $501.0 MILLION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS EITHER HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES OR RELATE TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE ENTITIES' FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE EITHER REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS OR RE-MEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR LIABILITY.53TABLE OF CONTENTSFOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS: FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE BY UTILIZING A STRATEGY THAT INVOLVES BOTH A PURCHASED LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTION AND A WRITTEN LOCAL CURRENCY CALL OPTION THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS HEDGES OF FUTURE SALES DENOMINATED IN EUROS. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS STRATEGY, WE MAY ALSO SELL LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTIONS THAT ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS HEDGES IN ORDER TO REDUCE OR FULLY OFFSET THE NET COST OF THE HEDGING CONTRACTS. FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES WERE AS FOLLOWS AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012: NOTIONAL AMOUNT 1 2013 2012FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION: DESIGNATED AS HEDGING ACTIVITY: PURCHASED PUT$— $228.8WRITTEN CALL$— $235.9NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING ACTIVITY: PURCHASED PUT$— $160.5WRITTEN PUT$— $(216.0)1 U.S. DOLLAR NOTIONAL AMOUNTS ARE CALCULATED AS THE HEDGED LOCAL CURRENCY AMOUNT MULTIPLIED TIMES THE STRIKE VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION. THE LOCAL CURRENCY NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF OUR PURCHASED PUT, AND WRITTEN CALL THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING ACTIVITY ARE EQUAL TO EACH OTHER.INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENTIN ANTICIPATION OF ISSUING FIXED-RATE DEBT, WE MAY USE FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS (FORWARD STARTING SWAPS) OR TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS (TREASURY RATE LOCKS) THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES TO HEDGE AGAINST CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES THAT COULD IMPACT EXPECTED FUTURE ISSUANCES OF DEBT. TO THE EXTENT THESE HEDGES OF CASH FLOWS RELATED TO ANTICIPATED DEBT ARE EFFECTIVE, ANY REALIZED OR UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE TREASURY RATE LOCKS OR FORWARD STARTING SWAPS ARE REPORTED IN OCI AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME OVER THE LIFE OF THE ANTICIPATED FIXED-RATE NOTES.FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS: DURING 2013, WE ENTERED INTO FORWARD STARTING SWAPS, THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, WITH AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL VALUE OF $300.0 MILLION AND EFFECTIVE DATES IN NOVEMBER 2014, WITH $100.0 MILLION MATURING IN FIVE YEARS AND $200 MILLION MATURING IN TEN YEARS TO HEDGE AGAINST CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES THAT COULD IMPACT AN ANTICIPATED ISSUANCE OF DEBT. DURING JANUARY AND FEBRUARY 2014, WE ENTERED INTO ADDITIONAL FORWARD STARTING SWAPS WITH EFFECTIVE DATES IN NOVEMBER 2014 AND AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL VALUE OF $350.0 MILLION AND MATURITIES OF FIVE AND TEN YEARS. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS. TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS: DURING 2012, WE ENTERED INTO TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS, OR TREASURY RATE LOCKS, IN ANTICIPATION OF ISSUING FIXED-RATE NOTES THAT WERE ISSUED IN AUGUST 2012. THE TREASURY RATE LOCKS WERE SETTLED DURING 2012 WHICH RESULTED IN LOSSES OF $35.3 MILLION THAT WERE RECORDED TO OCI. NO MATERIAL AMOUNTS WERE RECORDED IN INCOME DURING 2013 OR 2012 AS A RESULT OF HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS OR HEDGE COMPONENTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS. INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS: FROM TIME TO TIME WE HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN DEBT OBLIGATIONS THROUGH THE USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. THE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED HEDGES OF THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE NOTES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. SINCE THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE SWAP ARE INTENDED TO MATCH THOSE OF THE DEBT BEING HEDGED, IT IS ASSUMED TO BE A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE HEDGE AND ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP IS RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WITH NO NET IMPACT RECORDED IN INCOME. ANY NET INTEREST PAYMENTS MADE OR RECEIVED ON INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST EXPENSE. WE MAY TERMINATE THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP OF CERTAIN SWAP CONTRACTS BY SETTLING THE CONTRACTS OR BY ENTERING INTO OFFSETTING CONTRACTS. AT THE TIME A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, ACCUMULATED GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SWAP CONTRACT ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY HEDGED NOTES.54TABLE OF CONTENTSWE HAVE ENTERED INTO SWAP CONTRACTS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF OUR FIXED RATE NOTES DUE IN 2015, 2017, 2018, 2020, 2022 AND 2023 AND ALSO TERMINATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP BY SETTLING CERTAIN OF THOSE SWAP CONTRACTS DURING 2012 AND 2013. THE SETTLEMENT OF SWAP CONTRACTS RESULTED IN THE RECEIPT OF NET PROCEEDS OF $5.0 MILLION IN 2012 AND $22.9 MILLION IN 2013 WHICH IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE NOTES. SEE NOTE 11 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO REDUCTIONS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF OUR OUTSTANDING SWAP CONTRACTS AT THE END DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012:DURING 2014 WE CONTINUED TO ACTIVELY MANAGE OUR INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND HAVE TERMINATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS OF CERTAIN SWAP CONTRACTS AND ENTERED INTO NEW SWAPS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF OUR SENIOR NOTES. THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF OUR OUTSTANDING INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS AT FEBRUARY 12, 2014 WAS $1.850 BILLION.A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO MEASURE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR DEBT AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS FROM A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES INDICATED THAT A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET PAYABLE BY $157.2 MILLION. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET PAYABLE BY $181.9 MILLION.55TABLE OF CONTENTSITEM 7.

THESE ARE PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®, POMALYST® AND THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID®, THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENETM AND IMNOVID® ARE DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL AUTHORITIES’ SPECIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE FOR THE PRODUCT’S SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. VIDAZA®, ABRAXANE® AND ISTODAX® ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID®, THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENETM.WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. AS NOTED ABOVE, REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID®, THALOMID®/THALIDOMIDE CELGENETM ARE DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY SUBJECT TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY. SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF THE REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE HAVE ALSO ANALYZED ACTUAL BILLINGS RECEIVED FROM THE STATES TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE ACCRUAL RATES. SUBSEQUENT TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010 (COLLECTIVELY, THE 2010 U.S. HEALTH CARE REFORM LAW), CERTAIN STATES HAVE ONLY RECENTLY BEGUN SUBMITTING PARTIAL MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION BILLS. OUR ACCRUALS FOR THESE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION REBATES HAD BEEN AT ELEVATED LEVELS GIVEN THE DELAYS IN THE RECEIPT OF COMPLETE INVOICES FROM CERTAIN STATES. DUE TO THE RECEIPT OF MORE COMPLETE CLAIMS DATA AS 2013 PROGRESSED, THE ACCRUALS FOR CERTAIN STATES WERE REDUCED FROM THE ELEVATED LEVELS AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AS A RESULT OF BOTH THE PAYMENTS MADE BEING APPLIED TO THE ACCRUAL AND A $20.3 MILLION FAVORABLE CHANGE IN ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE OBLIGATION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ADJUST THE REBATE ACCRUALS AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND TO REFLECT ACTUAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011, MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT’S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL INVOICES. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES.REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE RECORD A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY. CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED 35TABLE OF CONTENTSON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED.

THE DECREASE WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY THE ADDITION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS OBTAINED IN THE MARCH 2012 ACQUISITION OF AVILA, WHICH INCREASED AMORTIZATION EXPENSE BY $39.4 MILLION. IN ADDITION, THE JUNE 2011 FDA APPROVAL OF ISTODAX® FOR TREATMENT OF PTCL IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY INCREASED AMORTIZATION EXPENSE BY $15.0 MILLION AND THE OCTOBER 2012 APPROVAL OF ABRAXANE® IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE TREATMENT OF NSCLC INCREASED AMORTIZATION EXPENSE BY $16.3 MILLION, BOTH OF WHICH RESULTED FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF AMORTIZATION OF THE RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

THE INCREASE WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY A $7.4 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES, NET GAINS OF $3.7 MILLION RELATED TO THE SHORT PERIOD IN JUNE 2012 WHEN CERTAIN TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS WERE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND A $2.1 MILLION DECREASE IN EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT LOSSES.INCOME TAX PROVISION: THE INCOME TAX PROVISION DECREASED BY $9.8 MILLION TO $215.5 MILLION IN 2013 COMPARED TO 2012. THE FULL YEAR 2013 UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 12.2% REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS FOOTPRINT. THE DECREASE IN THE UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FROM 2012 REFLECTS AN INCREASE IN TAX BENEFITS FROM CERTAIN COLLABORATION AND ACQUISITION-RELATED ITEMS, INCLUDING THE $80.0 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR THE ROYALTY RECEIVABLE REFERRED TO ABOVE, AND UPFRONT PAYMENTS TO COLLABORATION PARTNERS OF $227.0 MILLION THAT WERE INCURRED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2013 WAS INCREASED BY 0.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS AS A RESULT OF DISCRETE ITEMS, INCLUDING A NET INCREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RESULTING FROM ONGOING EXAMINATIONS AND SETTLEMENTS WITH TAXING AUTHORITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TAX BENEFITS FROM THE RETROACTIVE REINSTATEMENT OF THE 2012 U. S. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT. THE U.S. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND WAS RETROACTIVELY REINSTATED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013. THE INCOME TAX PROVISION INCREASED BY $123.2 MILLION TO $225.3 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. THE FULL YEAR 2012 UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 13.5% REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS FOOTPRINT. THE INCREASE IN THE UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FROM 2011 REFLECTS A DECREASE IN TAX BENEFITS FROM CERTAIN ACQUISITION-RELATED ITEMS. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2012 WAS REDUCED BY 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS AS A RESULT OF DISCRETE ITEMS, INCLUDING TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF TAX EXAMINATIONS AND EXPIRATIONS OF STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES RECORDED ON CERTAIN UNREMITTED FOREIGN EARNINGS PREVIOUSLY TREATED AS PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN SUCH FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS AND TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO THE FILING OF OUR 2011 INCOME TAX RETURNS WITH CERTAIN ITEMS BEING LESS FAVORABLE THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED. THE U.S. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND WAS RETROACTIVELY REINSTATED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013. THE TAX BENEFIT OF OUR 2012 RESEARCH CREDIT WAS RECORDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013. THIS CHANGE IN TAX LAW DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR INCOME TAX PROVISIONS.41TABLE OF CONTENTSTHE INCOME TAX PROVISION FOR 2011 INCLUDED A FULL YEAR UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 11.5%. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS REDUCED BY 4.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2011 AS A RESULT OF DISCRETE ITEMS WHICH INCLUDED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO A FOREIGN TAX CREDIT, A DECREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN ONGOING INCOME TAX AUDITS AND EXPIRATIONS OF STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS, AND A NET TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO CHANGES IN STATE TAX LAWS.NET INCOME: NET INCOME AND PER COMMON SHARE AMOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012 AND 2011 WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA):THE $6.3 MILLION DECREASE IN NET INCOME TO $1.450 BILLION IN 2013 COMPARED TO 2012 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $446.3 MILLION INCREASE IN PAYMENTS MADE RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS, A $61.9 MILLION INCREASE IN ABRAXANE® AMORTIZATION EXPENSE DUE TO THE OCTOBER 2012 FDA APPROVAL OF ABRAXANE® FOR TREATMENT OF NSCLC, A $94.8 MILLION INCREASE IN SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND INCREASED SPENDING IN SUPPORT OF OUR CURRENTLY MARKETED PRODUCTS AND THOSE THAT WE PLAN TO LAUNCH. THE INCREASES IN EXPENSE WERE NEARLY OFFSET BY THE FAVORABLE IMPACT FROM A HIGHER LEVEL OF NET PRODUCT SALES. THE $0.07 INCREASE IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN 2013 COMPARED TO 2012 WAS FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY THE REPURCHASE OF 22.3 MILLION COMMON SHARES UNDER OUR COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, REDUCING OUR OUTSTANDING SHARE BASE.NET INCOME INCREASED BY $138.1 MILLION TO $1.456 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASED BY $0.45 TO $3.30 IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 REFLECTING A HIGHER LEVEL OF NET PRODUCT SALES, REDUCTION IN AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY DUE TO CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOMING FULLY AMORTIZED AT THE END OF 2011 AND A DECREASE IN COST OF GOODS SOLD, RESULTING FROM THE 2011 INCLUSION OF INVENTORY STEP-UP AMORTIZATION FOR SALES OF ABRAXANE®. THESE FAVORABLE ITEMS WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LIABILITY RELATED TO PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS, AN INCREASE IN PAYMENTS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS AND INCREASE IN MARKETING ACTIVITY, PRIMARILY RELATED TO PRE-LAUNCH EXPENSES FOR POMALYST® AND ABRAXANE® FOR NEW INDICATIONS. EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE WERE ALSO FAVORABLY IMPACTED IN 2012 BY THE REPURCHASE OF 28.6 MILLION COMMON SHARES UNDER OUR COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, REDUCING OUR OUTSTANDING SHARE BASE.42TABLE OF CONTENTSLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESTHE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE COMPONENTS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012 AND 2011 (IN MILLIONS):1INCLUDES CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET OF ALLOWANCES, INVENTORY AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, LESS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES, INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES.WE RELY PRIMARILY ON POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AND BORROWINGS IN THE FORM OF LONG-TERM NOTES PAYABLE AND SHORT-TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER TO PROVIDE FOR OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. WE EXPECT CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR EXPENDITURES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TRIALS, COMMERCIALIZATION OF NEW PRODUCTS, INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND EXISTING SOURCES OF AND ACCESS TO FINANCING ARE ADEQUATE TO FUND OUR OPERATING NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AND OUR PLANS TO REPURCHASE STOCK OR PURSUE OTHER STRATEGIC BUSINESS INITIATIVES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE HELD INTERNATIONALLY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, WE HELD APPROXIMATELY $4.701 BILLION OF THESE SHORT-TERM FUNDS IN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS. THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS HELD IN U.S. TAX JURISDICTIONS CAN FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND DUE TO OTHER REASONS, SUCH AS REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND BUSINESS-DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. AS PART OF OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY ASSESSMENTS, WE REGULARLY MONITOR THE MIX OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CASH FLOWS (BOTH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS). REPATRIATION OF OVERSEAS FUNDS CAN RESULT IN ADDITIONAL U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAX PAYMENTS. WE RECORD U.S. DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES FOR CERTAIN UNREMITTED EARNINGS, BUT WHEN AMOUNTS EARNED OVERSEAS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, NO ACCRUAL FOR U.S. TAXES IS PROVIDED. APPROXIMATELY $900.0 MILLION OF OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS, INCLUDED IN THE $4.701 BILLION OF SHORT-TERM FUNDS IN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS, MAY NOT BE REQUIRED FOR USE IN OFFSHORE OPERATIONS AND MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR USE IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE EARNINGS ARE NOT TREATED AS PERMANENTLY REINVESTED AND ACCORDINGLY, OUR DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND DECEMBER 31, 2012 INCLUDED $316.5 MILLION FOR THE ESTIMATED U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAXES THAT MAY BE INCURRED SHOULD THESE EARNINGS BE REPATRIATED. THE REMAINING FOREIGN EARNINGS ARE UNREMITTED AND EXPECTED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE DO NOT RELY ON THESE EARNINGS AS A SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR OUR DOMESTIC BUSINESS AS WE EXPECT TO HAVE SUFFICIENT CURRENT CASH RESOURCES COMBINED WITH FUTURE CASH FLOWS IN THE UNITED STATES TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC NEEDS.SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM: OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED AN AGGREGATE $9.500 BILLION STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF WHICH WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $2.068 BILLION REMAINING FOR FUTURE SHARE REPURCHASES. DURING 2013, WE USED $2.765 BILLION FOR REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, MEASURED ON A SETTLEMENT DATE BASIS.COMPONENTS OF WORKING CAPITALCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: WE INVEST OUR EXCESS CASH PRIMARILY IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS, U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND SUPRANATIONAL SECURITIES, GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES AND ASSET BACKED SECURITIES. ALL LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND ALL INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES 43TABLE OF CONTENTSAVAILABLE FOR SALE. WE DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. THE $1.787 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 COMPARED TO 2012 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ISSUANCE OF $1.500 BILLION IN SENIOR NOTES IN AUGUST 2013, NET INCREASE OF $234.1 MILLION IN SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND BY CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, PARTLY OFFSET BY $2.765 BILLION PAID UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. FOR MORE INFORMATION RELATED TO THE FAIR VALUE AND VALUATION OF OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES, SEE NOTE 4 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET INCREASED BY $100.9 MILLION TO $1.061 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 2012 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SALES OF REVLIMID®, ABRAXANE® AND POMALYST®/IMNOVID®. SALES MADE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES TYPICALLY HAVE PAYMENT TERMS THAT ARE GREATER THAN 60 DAYS, THEREBY EXTENDING COLLECTION PERIODS BEYOND THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE EXPECT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE TO CONTINUE TO GROW AS OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES CONTINUE TO EXPAND.WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES, THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS IN CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND ASSOCIATED IMPACTS ON THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OUR BUSINESS. OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL IN THESE MARKETS IS TYPICALLY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO PRINCIPALLY GOVERNMENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED HOSPITALS, WHICH IN TURN DIRECTLY DELIVER CRITICAL CARE TO PATIENTS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE USED TO TREAT LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES AND WE BELIEVE THIS BUSINESS MODEL ENABLES TIMELY DELIVERY AND ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS. MANY OF THE OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE RELATED TO GOVERNMENT-FUNDED HOSPITALS AND WE BELIEVE THE RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE ULTIMATELY COLLECTIBLE. SIMILARLY, WE BELIEVE THAT FUTURE SALES TO THESE CUSTOMERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE COLLECTIBLE. THE CREDIT AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WITHIN SPAIN, ITALY, PORTUGAL AND GREECE, AS WELL AS INCREASING SALES LEVELS IN THOSE COUNTRIES HAVE RESULTED IN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN, AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES TO COLLECT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. OUR TOTAL NET RECEIVABLES IN SPAIN, ITALY AND PORTUGAL ARE COMPOSED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR CONTROLLED HOSPITALS AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND AMOUNTED TO $348.4 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 COMPARED TO $324.2 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2012. APPROXIMATELY $86.4 MILLION OF THE $348.4 MILLION RECEIVABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 WAS GREATER THAN ONE YEAR PAST DUE. OUR EXPOSURE TO THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS IN GREECE IS LIMITED, AS WE DO NOT HAVE A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF RECEIVABLES IN GREECE. WE MAINTAIN TIMELY AND DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH HOSPITAL CUSTOMERS IN SPAIN, ITALY AND PORTUGAL REGARDING BOTH THE CURRENT AND PAST DUE RECEIVABLE BALANCES. WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS FROM THESE COUNTRIES AND CLOSELY MONITOR THE PLANS FOR PAYMENT AT THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL. PAYMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS IN THESE COUNTRIES ARE NOT RECEIVED ON REGULAR INTERVALS AND SEVERAL MONTHS COULD ELAPSE BETWEEN SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS. IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR SPAIN, ITALY AND PORTUGAL, WE CONSIDERED THAT THE BALANCE OF PAST DUE RECEIVABLES IS RELATED TO SALES MADE TO GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR SUPPORTED CUSTOMERS. WE REGULARLY MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS IN EUROPE TO ASSESS WHETHER THE LEVEL OF RISK OF DEFAULT FOR ANY CUSTOMERS HAS INCREASED AND NOTE THE ONGOING EFFORTS BY THE EUROPEAN UNION, EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION AND INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND TO SUPPORT COUNTRIES WITH LARGE PUBLIC DEFICITS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT BALANCES. WE ALSO MONITOR THE EFFORTS OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES TO SUPPORT THEIR REGIONS WITH LARGE PUBLIC DEFICITS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT BALANCES. WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR WRITE-OFFS WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLECTION OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN THESE COUNTRIES AS A RESULT OF THEIR ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES AND WE DO NOT EXPECT TO HAVE WRITE-OFFS OR ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.INVENTORY: INVENTORY BALANCES INCREASED BY $80.9 MILLION TO $340.4 MILLION AT THE END OF 2013 COMPARED TO 2012. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN ABRAXANE® INVENTORIES, ATTRIBUTABLE TO A HIGHER SALES LEVEL RESULTING FROM THE FDA APPROVALS OF ABRAXANE® FOR TREATMENT OF NSCLC IN OCTOBER 2012 AND PANCREATIC CANCER IN SEPTEMBER 2013, AS WELL AS $33.4 MILLION OF OTEZLA® (APREMILAST) INVENTORY THAT HAS BEEN CAPITALIZED PRIOR TO REGULATORY APPROVAL, IN ANTICIPATION OF REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR THIS PRODUCT.OTHER CURRENT ASSETS: OTHER CURRENT ASSETS INCREASED BY $116.2 MILLION TO $436.4 MILLION AT THE END OF 2013 COMPARED TO 2012 PRIMARILY DUE TO A $48.8 MILLION INCREASE IN PREPAID TAXES, A $33.9 MILLION INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND A NET INCREASE IN OTHER PREPAID ACCOUNTS.COMMERCIAL PAPER: IN SEPTEMBER 2011, WE ENTERED INTO A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM (THE PROGRAM) UNDER WHICH WE ISSUE UNSECURED COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES (COMMERCIAL PAPER) ON A PRIVATE PLACEMENT BASIS, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH ARE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE MAXIMUM AGGREGATE AMOUNT AVAILABLE UNDER THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY $1.500 BILLION. THE MATURITIES OF 44TABLE OF CONTENTSTHE COMMERCIAL PAPER MAY VARY, BUT MAY NOT EXCEED 270 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ISSUE. THE COMMERCIAL PAPER IS SOLD UNDER CUSTOMARY TERMS TO A DEALER OR IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET AND IS ISSUED AT A DISCOUNT FROM PAR OR, ALTERNATIVELY, IS SOLD AT PAR AND BEARS VARYING INTEREST RATES ON A FIXED OR FLOATING BASIS. BORROWINGS UNDER THE PROGRAM ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, $544.8 MILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER WAS OUTSTANDING BEARING AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OF 0.4%.SENIOR UNSECURED CREDIT FACILITY: IN SEPTEMBER 2011, WE ENTERED INTO A SENIOR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (CREDIT FACILITY) PROVIDING FOR REVOLVING CREDIT IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $1.000 BILLION, WHICH WAS INCREASED TO $1.500 BILLION IN APRIL 2013. THE TERM OF THE CREDIT FACILITY WAS ALSO EXTENDED FROM SEPTEMBER 2, 2016 TO APRIL 18, 2018. SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT FACILITY (BUT IN NO EVENT MORE THAN ONE TIME PER ANNUM), UP TO A MAXIMUM AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $1.750 BILLION. AMOUNTS MAY BE BORROWED UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE CREDIT FACILITY SERVES AS BACKUP LIQUIDITY FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013 THERE WAS NO OUTSTANDING BORROWING AGAINST THE CREDIT FACILITY. THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS INCLUDING CERTAIN CUSTOMARY FINANCIAL COVENANTS. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE COVENANTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013.ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES: ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES INCREASED BY $4.4 MILLION TO $1.357 BILLION AT THE END OF 2013 COMPARED TO 2012. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES OF $93.1 MILLION IN COMPENSATION RELATED EXPENSES, $45.3 MILLION OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO THE JANUARY 2012 AVILA ACQUISITION, $45.0 MILLION RELATED TO COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS, $30.3 MILLION RELATED TO SALES ADJUSTMENTS, $22.7 MILLION RELATED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, $22.8 MILLION IN ACCRUED INTEREST AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS LIABILITIES. THE INCREASES WERE MOSTLY OFFSET BY THE 2013 PAYMENT OF A $300.0 MILLION LIABILITY, WHICH HAD A FAIR VALUE OF $277.4 MILLION AT THE END OF 2012, ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS. INCOME TAXES PAYABLE (CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT): INCOME TAXES PAYABLE INCREASED BY $51.0 MILLION TO $251.0 MILLION AT THE END OF 2013 COMPARED TO 2012, PRIMARILY FROM THE CURRENT PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES OF $462.1 MILLION, NET DEFERRED INTERCOMPANY CREDITS OF $32.6 MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN REFUNDABLE INCOME TAXES OF $23.9 MILLION, OFFSET BY INCOME TAX PAYMENTS OF $291.9 MILLION AND A TAX BENEFIT OF STOCK OPTIONS OF $171.7 MILLION.SENIOR NOTES: IN AUGUST 2013, WE ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL $1.500 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $400.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2.300% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2018 (THE 2018 NOTES), $700.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 4.000% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2023 (THE 2023 NOTES) AND $400.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 5.250% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2043 (THE 2043 NOTES) AND, TOGETHER WITH THE 2018 NOTES AND 2023 NOTES, REFERRED TO HEREIN AS THE “2013 ISSUED NOTES”. THE 2013 ISSUED NOTES WERE ISSUED AT 99.792%, 99.452% AND 99.147% OF PAR, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE DISCOUNT IS BEING AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. OFFERING COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $12.5 MILLION HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. INTEREST ON THE NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON FEBRUARY 15 AND AUGUST 15 EACH YEAR BEGINNING FEBRUARY 15, 2014 AND THE PRINCIPAL ON EACH NOTE IS DUE IN FULL AT THEIR RESPECTIVE MATURITY DATES. THE NOTES MAY BE REDEEMED AT OUR OPTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT ANY TIME AT A REDEMPTION PRICE DEFINED IN A MAKE-WHOLE CLAUSE EQUALING ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST PLUS THE GREATER OF 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES TO BE REDEEMED OR THE SUM OF THE PRESENT VALUES OF THE REMAINING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL DISCOUNTED TO THE DATE OF REDEMPTION ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS PLUS 15 BASIS POINTS IN THE CASE OF THE 2018 NOTES, 20 BASIS POINTS IN THE CASE OF THE 2023 NOTES AND 25 BASIS POINTS IN THE CASE OF THE 2043 NOTES.

THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO A CASH USE OF $341.3 MILLION FOR NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE DURING 2013 COMPARED TO A CASH USE OF $1.025 BILLION FOR NET PURCHASES IN 2012, PLUS THE USE OF $352.2 MILLION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF AVILA IN 2012.NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2012 CHANGED TO A NET USE OF $1.554 BILLION COMPARED TO $377.7 MILLION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2011. THE DECREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO A CASH USE OF $1.025 BILLION FOR NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE DURING 2012 COMPARED TO NET SALES OF $481.8 MILLION IN 2011, PLUS THE USE OF $352.2 MILLION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF AVILA AND $48.9 MILLION FOR THE PURCHASE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER ASSETS.FINANCING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2013 WAS $553.7 MILLION COMPARED TO A NET CASH USE OF $248.8 MILLION IN 2012. THE $304.9 MILLION INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A $721.0 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR THE PURCHASE OF TREASURY SHARES AND A CASH USE OF $225.0 MILLION RECORDED AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY TO REFLECT THE PORTION OF A $300.0 MILLION MILESTONE PAYMENT TO HOLDERS OF OUR CVRS THAT REPRESENTS THE ORIGINAL FAIR VALUE OF ABRAXIS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET PROCEEDS FROM BORROWING OF $234.1 MILLION DURING 2013 COMPARED TO NET REPAYMENTS OF $217.4 MILLION IN 2012. PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS PLUS THE EXCESS TAX BENEFIT FROM SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS PROVIDED AN AGGREGATE $721.0 MILLION DURING 2013, WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF $195.5 MILLION FROM 2012.NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2012 WAS $248.8 MILLION COMPARED TO A NET CASH USE OF $1.622 BILLION IN 2011. THE $1.372 BILLION DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2012 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO $1.487 BILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $217.4 MILLION OF NET REPAYMENTS OF SHORT-TERM BORROWING IN 2012, COMPARED TO $525.7 MILLION OF NET SHORT-TERM BORROWING IN 2011.

THE NON-CANCELABLE LEASE TERMS FOR OPERATING LEASES EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES BETWEEN 2014 AND 2023 AND INCLUDE RENEWAL OPTIONS. IN GENERAL, WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE LESSORS FOR REAL ESTATE TAXES, INSURANCE, UTILITIES, MAINTENANCE AND OTHER OPERATING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEASES. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE MAJOR FACILITIES THAT WE OCCUPY UNDER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS REFER TO PART I, ITEM 2. "PROPERTIES" OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS: OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS OF $170.3 MILLION ON DECEMBER 31, 2013 PRIMARILY INCLUDED $153.7 MILLION IN CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPLY CONTRACTS AND A REMAINING $14.6 MILLION BALANCE DUE IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF A MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN SWITZERLAND.COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS: WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT INCLUDE THE FUNDING OF CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE MILESTONE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED DEVELOPMENTAL, REGULATORY AND/OR COMMERCIAL TARGETS. OUR OBLIGATION TO FUND THESE EFFORTS IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROGRAMS AND/OR THE LACK OF ANY ADVERSE EVENTS WHICH COULD CAUSE THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE PROGRAMS. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE ATTAINMENT OF SPECIFIED DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND ACCORDINGLY, NO AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED FOR THESE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012 CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. POTENTIAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS (NOT INCLUDING POTENTIAL ROYALTY PAYMENTS) TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $4.300 BILLION, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $3.503 BILLION CONTINGENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF VARIOUS RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES AND APPROXIMATELY $796.7 MILLION IN SALES-BASED MILESTONES. THE MORE NOTABLE COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS ARE IDENTIFIED IN NOTE 17 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSFOR A DISCUSSION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS PLEASE SEE NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.47TABLE OF CONTENTSCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IS ONE THAT IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENT'S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL:REVENUE RECOGNITION: REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS OF THE PRODUCT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER AND THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED AND DETERMINABLE. PROVISIONS FOR DISCOUNTS, EARLY PAYMENTS, REBATES, SALES RETURNS AND DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS UNDER TERMS CUSTOMARY IN THE INDUSTRY ARE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SAME PERIOD THE RELATED SALES ARE RECORDED. WE RECORD ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SALE. THE ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR SUCH VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES ARE BASED ON THE SALES TERMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND TREND ANALYSIS.WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM ROYALTIES BASED ON LICENSEES' SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS USING OUR TECHNOLOGIES. ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACT TERMS WHEN ROYALTIES FROM LICENSEES CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED. IF ROYALTIES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR COLLECTABILITY OF A ROYALTY AMOUNT IS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED, ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE CASH IS RECEIVED.GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. REVLIMID®, POMALYST® AND THALOMID® ARE DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY SUBJECT TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL, RESULTING IN GENERALLY LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY FOR THOSE PRODUCTS.SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS.GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF THE REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE HAVE ALSO ANALYZED ACTUAL BILLINGS RECEIVED FROM THE STATES TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE ACCRUAL RATES. SUBSEQUENT TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010 (COLLECTIVELY THE 2010 U.S. HEALTH CARE REFORM LAW), CERTAIN STATES HAVE ONLY RECENTLY BEGUN SUBMITTING PARTIAL MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION BILLS. OUR ACCRUALS FOR THESE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION REBATES HAD BEEN AT ELEVATED LEVELS GIVEN THE DELAYS IN THE RECEIPT OF COMPLETE INVOICES FROM CERTAIN STATES. DUE TO THE RECEIPT OF MORE COMPLETE CLAIMS DATA AS 2013 PROGRESSED, THE ACCRUALS FOR CERTAIN STATES WERE REDUCED FROM THE ELEVATED LEVELS AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AS A RESULT OF BOTH THE PAYMENTS MADE BEING APPLIED TO THE ACCRUAL AND A $20.3 MILLION FAVORABLE CHANGE IN ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE OBLIGATION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ADJUST THE REBATE ACCRUALS AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND TO REFLECT ACTUAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011, MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT’S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL INVOICES. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES.REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE PROVIDE A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY. 48TABLE OF CONTENTSCHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE INCLUDED IN CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS AND ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA.ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: WE ESTIMATE AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, HISTORICAL PAYMENT PATTERNS, AGING OF RECEIVABLE BALANCES AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF COUNTRIES THEMSELVES AND PROVINCES OR AREAS WITHIN SUCH COUNTRIES WHERE THEY ARE THE ULTIMATE CUSTOMERS.INCOME TAXES: WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. WE PROVIDE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED.WE ACCOUNT FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS PART OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THESE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATE PRIMARILY TO ISSUES COMMON AMONG MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE APPLY A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES WHICH INCLUDE STUDIES PERFORMED BY INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS, ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY AND SUBJECT EXPERTS, EVALUATION OF PUBLIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. WE PROVIDE ESTIMATES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. IF OUR ESTIMATES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ACTUAL OUTCOMES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED.WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE A PORTION WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR RECENT CUMULATIVE EARNINGS EXPERIENCE BY TAXING JURISDICTION, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, CARRYFORWARD PERIODS AVAILABLE TO US FOR TAX REPORTING PURPOSES, VARIOUS INCOME TAX STRATEGIES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT AND, TO THE EXTENT FUTURE EXPECTATIONS CHANGE, WE WOULD HAVE TO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THAT TIME. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES.SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION: WE UTILIZE SHARE BASED COMPENSATION IN THE FORM OF STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, OR RSUS, AND PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, OR PSUS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARDS AT GRANT DATE. COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED REFLECTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF AWARDS EXPECTED TO VEST AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AN ESTIMATE OF AWARD FORFEITURES BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE VESTING PERIOD REQUIRED TO OBTAIN FULL VESTING. MANAGEMENT EXPECTATIONS RELATED TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PERFORMANCE GOALS ASSOCIATED WITH PSU GRANTS IS ASSESSED REGULARLY AND THAT ASSESSMENT IS USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER PSU GRANTS ARE EXPECTED TO VEST. IF PERFORMANCE-BASED MILESTONES RELATED TO PSU GRANTS ARE NOT MET OR NOT EXPECTED TO BE MET, ANY COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED TO DATE ASSOCIATED WITH GRANTS THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO VEST WILL BE REVERSED.OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES: A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF ANY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY BELOW ITS COST THAT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN CARRYING AMOUNT TO FAIR VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT IS CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AND A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE SECURITY ESTABLISHED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INCLUDE: SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE ISSUER'S EARNINGS PERFORMANCE, CREDIT RATING, ASSET QUALITY, BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE ISSUER OPERATES, LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW OUR COST, OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE SECURITY, OUR INTENT NOT TO SELL, AN EVALUATION AS TO WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO SELL BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR COST BASIS, AND ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ISSUER'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD DIFFER FROM OUR ASSESSMENT.DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES: ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN CURRENT EARNINGS OR OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), DEPENDING ON WHETHER A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION AND, IF IT IS, THE TYPE OF HEDGING TRANSACTION. FOR A DERIVATIVE TO QUALIFY AS A HEDGE AT INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE HEDGED PERIOD, WE FORMALLY DOCUMENT THE NATURE AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEM. WE ASSESS, BOTH AT INCEPTION AND ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING TRANSACTIONS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING THE CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS. WE ASSESS HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND RECORD THE GAIN OR LOSS RELATED TO THE INEFFECTIVE 49TABLE OF CONTENTSPORTION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IF ANY, TO CURRENT EARNINGS. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER PROBABLE OF OCCURRING, WE DISCONTINUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING AND ANY RELATED UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE NOT DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION, TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES. THE USE OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE EXPOSURE OF THESE RISKS WITH THE INTENT TO REDUCE OUR RISK OR COST.INVESTMENTS IN OTHER ENTITIES: WE HOLD A PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER EITHER THE EQUITY METHOD OR COST METHOD. INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES OR CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS OVER WHICH WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD, WITH OUR SHARE OF EARNINGS OR LOSSES REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES OF COMPANIES THAT BECOME PUBLICLY TRADED ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES PROSPECTIVELY FROM THE DATE OF SUCH COMPANIES' INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING.OUR COST METHOD AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.ALL INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT. IF AN INVESTMENT'S FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN ITS NET CARRYING VALUE AND THE DECLINE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE. SUCH AN EVALUATION IS JUDGMENTAL AND DEPENDENT ON SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE HAS OCCURRED INCLUDE: MARKET VALUE OR EXIT PRICE OF THE INVESTMENT BASED ON EITHER MARKET-QUOTED PRICES OR FUTURE ROUNDS OF FINANCING BY THE INVESTEE; LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE MARKET VALUE WAS BELOW ITS COST BASIS; FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE INVESTEE; OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT; ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INVESTEE'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN; ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE MAY BE AWARE OF RELATED TO THE INVESTMENT.ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, OR LTIP, DESIGNED TO PROVIDE KEY OFFICERS AND EXECUTIVES WITH PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES CONTINGENT UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED CORPORATE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES COVERING A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE SEPARATE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLES RUNNING CONCURRENTLY ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014, 2015 AND 2016. PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR EACH OF THE PERFORMANCE CYCLES ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS: 37.5% ON NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE; 37.5% ON TOTAL NON-GAAP REVENUE, AS DEFINED; AND 25% ON RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, WHICH IS A MEASUREMENT OF OUR STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR COMPARED WITH A GROUP OF OTHER COMPANIES IN THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.PAYOUTS MAY BE IN THE RANGE OF 0% TO 200% OF THE PARTICIPANT'S SALARY FOR THE LTIPS. SUCH AWARDS ARE PAYABLE IN CASH OR COMMON STOCK OR A MIXTURE OF CASH AND COMMON STOCK, WHICH WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AT THE TIME OF AWARD DELIVERY. FOR AWARDS PAYABLE IN COMMON STOCK, THE NUMBER OF SHARES IS DETERMINED USING THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE FOR THE 30 TRADING DAYS PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CYCLE. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAY DETERMINE THAT PAYMENTS MADE IN COMMON STOCK WILL BE RESTRICTED FROM TRADING FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS. WE ACCRUE THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE LIABILITY OVER EACH THREE-YEAR CYCLE. PRIOR TO THE END OF A THREE-YEAR CYCLE, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT DURING THE CYCLE. UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT EQUAL TO THEIR TARGET AWARD OR, IF HIGHER, AN AWARD BASED ON ACTUAL PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL.ACCRUALS RECORDED FOR THE LTIP ENTAIL MAKING CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE, NON-GAAP REVENUES AND RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, AS DEFINED; THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED. ACCRUALS FOR THE LTIP ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND REVISED ACCORDINGLY SO THAT THE LIABILITY RECORDED REFLECTS UPDATED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PAYOUTS. IN ESTIMATING THE ACCRUALS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DATE FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, EXPECTED RESULTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, OPERATING TRENDS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICING AND COMPETITION.VALUATION OF GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, OTHER ASSETS AND IPR&D: WE HAVE RECORDED GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IPR&D PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ACQUISITIONS OF PHARMION, GLOUCESTER, ABRAXIS AND AVILA. WHEN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS, ARE ACQUIRED, WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS ARE TYPICALLY USED IN THESE VALUATIONS IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, AND THE MODELS REQUIRE THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:•PROJECTING REGULATORY APPROVALS;•ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM PRODUCT SALES RESULTING FROM COMPLETED PRODUCTS AND IN-PROCESS PROJECTS OR ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED; AND•DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES AND PROBABILITY RATES.GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. WE TEST OUR GOODWILL ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT EACH NOVEMBER 30. WE ARE 50TABLE OF CONTENTSORGANIZED AS A SINGLE REPORTING UNIT AND THEREFORE THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS DONE USING OUR OVERALL MARKET VALUE, AS DETERMINED BY OUR TRADED SHARE PRICE, AS COMPARED TO OUR BOOK VALUE OF NET ASSETS.INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE AMORTIZED TO THEIR ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR. INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO IPR&D PRODUCT RIGHTS ARE TREATED AS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND NOT AMORTIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS APPROVED FOR SALE BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN SPECIFIED MARKETS. AT THAT TIME, WE WILL DETERMINE THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET, RECLASSIFY THE ASSET OUT OF IPR&D AND BEGIN AMORTIZATION. IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS ALSO PERFORMED AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. SUCH TEST ENTAILS COMPLETING AN UPDATED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.OTHER ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. SUCH TEST ENTAILS COMPLETING AN UPDATED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.VALUATION OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION: WE RECORD CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION AT ITS FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE, AND FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT REPORTING PERIOD REVALUE THESE OBLIGATIONS AND RECORD INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPERATING EARNINGS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. CHANGES TO CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION OBLIGATIONS CAN RESULT FROM MOVEMENTS IN PUBLICLY TRADED SHARE PRICES OF CVRS, ADJUSTMENTS TO DISCOUNT RATES AND PERIODS, UPDATES IN THE ASSUMED ACHIEVEMENT OR TIMING OF ANY DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES OR CHANGES IN THE PROBABILITY OF CERTAIN CLINICAL EVENTS AND CHANGES IN THE ASSUMED PROBABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATORY APPROVAL. THE ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT AND ANY CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION EXPENSE RECORDED IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. OUR CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES WERE ACQUIRED IN THE ACQUISITIONS OF GLOUCESTER, ABRAXIS, AND AVILA. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE GLOUCESTER AND AVILA CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE DISCOUNT RATE, PROBABILITY AND ESTIMATED TIMING OF CASH MILESTONE PAYMENTS TO THE FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OR EACH COMPANY. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ABRAXIS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY IS BASED ON THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKTHE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES FORWARD-LOOKING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RISK OF LOSS IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES, CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE EARNINGS.WE HAVE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, OUR MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS CONSISTED OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, OUR LONG-TERM DEBT AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE CONSISTED OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED (MBS) SECURITIES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT, AGENCY AND SUPRANATIONAL SECURITIES, GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, ASSET BACKED SECURITIES AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES.

UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET.51TABLE OF CONTENTSAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, FAIR VALUES AND RELATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS):LONG-TERM DEBT: WE HAVE ISSUED AN AGGREGATE $4.250 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES AT VARYING MATURITY DATES AND INTEREST RATES. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS AND CARRYING VALUES OF THESE SENIOR NOTES AS OF THE END OF DECEMBER 31, 2013 ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW: AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SENIOR NOTES OUTSTANDING WAS $4.269 BILLION. CELGENE COMMON STOCK: AS PART OF THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTOR AUTHORIZED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, SELL PUT OPTIONS ON OUR COMMON STOCK WITH STRIKE PRICES THAT WE BELIEVE REPRESENT AN ATTRACTIVE PRICE TO REPURCHASE OUR SHARES. IF THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR SHARES EXCEEDS THE STRIKE PRICE OF THE PUT OPTION AT THE TIME THE OPTION EXPIRES, WE WILL HAVE ECONOMICALLY REDUCED THE COST OF OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM BY THE AMOUNT OF THE PREMIUM WE RECEIVED FROM THE SALE OF THE PUT OPTION. IF THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR STOCK IS BELOW THE STRIKE PRICE OF THE PUT OPTION AT THE TIME THE OPTION EXPIRES, WE WOULD REPURCHASE THE SHARES COVERED BY THE OPTION AT THE STRIKE PRICE OF THE PUT OPTION. WHILE SUCH A PURCHASE WOULD BE AT A PRICE ABOVE THE THEN FAIR MARKET VALUE OF OUR SHARES, IT WOULD BE AT A PRICE THAT WE FEEL IS FAVORABLE IN THE OVERALL CONTEXT OF OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. DURING 2013 WE SOLD A SINGLE PUT OPTION FOR A PREMIUM OF $1.2 MILLION THAT EXPIRED UNEXERCISED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING PUT OPTIONS. IN FEBRUARY 2014, WE SOLD A PUT OPTION ON $200.0 MILLION NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF SHARES OF STOCK WITH A STRIKE PRICE OF $142.81 AND MATURING IN MARCH 2014 FOR A PREMIUM OF $4.8 MILLION.MARKET RISK MANAGEMENTOUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN BE IMPACTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES. WE ACTIVELY MANAGE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE AND INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS THROUGH OPERATIONAL MEANS AND THROUGH THE USE OF VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS, FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS.FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENTWE MAINTAIN A FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS, TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.THROUGH OUR REVENUE HEDGING PROGRAM, WE ENDEAVOR TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF POSSIBLE UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON OUR FUTURE U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS THAT ARE DERIVED FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, TYPICALLY WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. WE MANAGE OUR ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION EXPOSURE PRINCIPALLY WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND OCCASIONALLY FOREIGN CURRENCY PUT AND CALL OPTIONS.52TABLE OF CONTENTSFOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS: WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, MANAGE EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY IN THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS AND TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.WE MANAGE A PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PROTECT AGAINST CHANGES IN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012 HAD SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 36 MONTHS. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AND, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THEM ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) (OCI) AND RECLASSIFIED TO OPERATIONS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT OPERATIONS. ANY INEFFECTIVENESS ON THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IS REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES WERE AS FOLLOWS AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012 (IN MILLIONS):WE CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF OUR OWN AND THE COUNTERPARTIES' CREDIT RISK ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO EXECUTE ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONTRACT ON AN ONGOING BASIS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, CREDIT RISK DID NOT MATERIALLY CHANGE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS.WE ALSO MANAGE A PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN RECOGNIZED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE RELATED TO TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND, ACCORDINGLY, ANY CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD NON-DESIGNATED HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012 WERE $878.5 MILLION AND $795.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, WE BELIEVE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS A REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES. ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2013 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WOULD CHANGE BY APPROXIMATELY $501.0 MILLION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS EITHER HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES OR RELATE TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE ENTITIES' FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE EITHER REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS OR RE-MEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR LIABILITY.53TABLE OF CONTENTSFOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS: FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE BY UTILIZING A STRATEGY THAT INVOLVES BOTH A PURCHASED LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTION AND A WRITTEN LOCAL CURRENCY CALL OPTION THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS HEDGES OF FUTURE SALES DENOMINATED IN EUROS. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS STRATEGY, WE MAY ALSO SELL LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTIONS THAT ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS HEDGES IN ORDER TO REDUCE OR FULLY OFFSET THE NET COST OF THE HEDGING CONTRACTS. FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES WERE AS FOLLOWS AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012: NOTIONAL AMOUNT 1 2013 2012FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION: DESIGNATED AS HEDGING ACTIVITY: PURCHASED PUT$— $228.8WRITTEN CALL$— $235.9NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING ACTIVITY: PURCHASED PUT$— $160.5WRITTEN PUT$— $(216.0)1 U.S. DOLLAR NOTIONAL AMOUNTS ARE CALCULATED AS THE HEDGED LOCAL CURRENCY AMOUNT MULTIPLIED TIMES THE STRIKE VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION. THE LOCAL CURRENCY NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF OUR PURCHASED PUT, AND WRITTEN CALL THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING ACTIVITY ARE EQUAL TO EACH OTHER.INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENTIN ANTICIPATION OF ISSUING FIXED-RATE DEBT, WE MAY USE FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS (FORWARD STARTING SWAPS) OR TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS (TREASURY RATE LOCKS) THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES TO HEDGE AGAINST CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES THAT COULD IMPACT EXPECTED FUTURE ISSUANCES OF DEBT. TO THE EXTENT THESE HEDGES OF CASH FLOWS RELATED TO ANTICIPATED DEBT ARE EFFECTIVE, ANY REALIZED OR UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE TREASURY RATE LOCKS OR FORWARD STARTING SWAPS ARE REPORTED IN OCI AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME OVER THE LIFE OF THE ANTICIPATED FIXED-RATE NOTES.FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS: DURING 2013, WE ENTERED INTO FORWARD STARTING SWAPS, THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, WITH AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL VALUE OF $300.0 MILLION AND EFFECTIVE DATES IN NOVEMBER 2014, WITH $100.0 MILLION MATURING IN FIVE YEARS AND $200 MILLION MATURING IN TEN YEARS TO HEDGE AGAINST CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES THAT COULD IMPACT AN ANTICIPATED ISSUANCE OF DEBT. DURING JANUARY AND FEBRUARY 2014, WE ENTERED INTO ADDITIONAL FORWARD STARTING SWAPS WITH EFFECTIVE DATES IN NOVEMBER 2014 AND AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL VALUE OF $350.0 MILLION AND MATURITIES OF FIVE AND TEN YEARS. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS. TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS: DURING 2012, WE ENTERED INTO TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS, OR TREASURY RATE LOCKS, IN ANTICIPATION OF ISSUING FIXED-RATE NOTES THAT WERE ISSUED IN AUGUST 2012. THE TREASURY RATE LOCKS WERE SETTLED DURING 2012 WHICH RESULTED IN LOSSES OF $35.3 MILLION THAT WERE RECORDED TO OCI. NO MATERIAL AMOUNTS WERE RECORDED IN INCOME DURING 2013 OR 2012 AS A RESULT OF HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS OR HEDGE COMPONENTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS. INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS: FROM TIME TO TIME WE HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN DEBT OBLIGATIONS THROUGH THE USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. THE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED HEDGES OF THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE NOTES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. SINCE THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE SWAP ARE INTENDED TO MATCH THOSE OF THE DEBT BEING HEDGED, IT IS ASSUMED TO BE A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE HEDGE AND ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP IS RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WITH NO NET IMPACT RECORDED IN INCOME. ANY NET INTEREST PAYMENTS MADE OR RECEIVED ON INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST EXPENSE. WE MAY TERMINATE THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP OF CERTAIN SWAP CONTRACTS BY SETTLING THE CONTRACTS OR BY ENTERING INTO OFFSETTING CONTRACTS. AT THE TIME A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, ACCUMULATED GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SWAP CONTRACT ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY HEDGED NOTES.54TABLE OF CONTENTSWE HAVE ENTERED INTO SWAP CONTRACTS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF OUR FIXED RATE NOTES DUE IN 2015, 2017, 2018, 2020, 2022 AND 2023 AND ALSO TERMINATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP BY SETTLING CERTAIN OF THOSE SWAP CONTRACTS DURING 2012 AND 2013. THE SETTLEMENT OF SWAP CONTRACTS RESULTED IN THE RECEIPT OF NET PROCEEDS OF $5.0 MILLION IN 2012 AND $22.9 MILLION IN 2013 WHICH IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE NOTES. SEE NOTE 11 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO REDUCTIONS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF OUR OUTSTANDING SWAP CONTRACTS AT THE END DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012:DURING 2014 WE CONTINUED TO ACTIVELY MANAGE OUR INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND HAVE TERMINATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS OF CERTAIN SWAP CONTRACTS AND ENTERED INTO NEW SWAPS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF OUR SENIOR NOTES. THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF OUR OUTSTANDING INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS AT FEBRUARY 12, 2014 WAS $1.850 BILLION.A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO MEASURE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR DEBT AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS FROM A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES INDICATED THAT A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET PAYABLE BY $157.2 MILLION. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET PAYABLE BY $181.9 MILLION.55TABLE OF CONTENTS
