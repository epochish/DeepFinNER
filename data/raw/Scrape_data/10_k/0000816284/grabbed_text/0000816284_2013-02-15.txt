ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY CELGENE CORPORATION (COLLECTIVELY WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, "WE," "OUR," "US," "CELGENE" OR THE "COMPANY") IS A GLOBAL BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN THE DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF INNOVATIVE THERAPIES DESIGNED TO TREAT CANCER AND IMMUNE-INFLAMMATORY RELATED DISEASES. WE ARE DEDICATED TO INNOVATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, DESIGNED TO BRING NEW THERAPIES TO MARKET AND ARE INVOLVED IN RESEARCH IN SEVERAL SCIENTIFIC AREAS THAT MAY DELIVER PROPRIETARY NEXT-GENERATION THERAPIES, TARGETING AREAS SUCH AS INTRACELLULAR SIGNALING PATHWAYS IN CANCER AND IMMUNE CELLS, IMMUNOMODULATION IN CANCER AND AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES, AND THERAPEUTIC APPLICATION OF CELL THERAPIES. CELGENE WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE IN 1986. OUR PRIMARY COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS INCLUDE REVLIMID®, VIDAZA®, ABRAXANE®, THALOMID® (INCLUSIVE OF THALIDOMIDE CELGENE®), AND ISTODAX®. POMALYST® (POMALIDOMIDE) WAS APPROVED BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, OR FDA, IN FEBRUARY 2013 FOR PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE MYELOMA WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST TWO PRIOR THERAPIES, INCLUDING LENALIDOMIDE AND BORTEZOMIB, AND HAVE DEMONSTRATED DISEASE PROGRESSION ON OR WITHIN 60 DAYS OF COMPLETION OF THE LAST THERAPY. REVLIMID® IS AN ORAL IMMUNOMODULATORY DRUG MARKETED IN THE UNITED STATES AND MANY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE, FOR TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE MYELOMA WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY. IT IS ALSO MARKETED IN THE UNITED STATES AND CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS FOR THE TREATMENT OF TRANSFUSION-DEPENDENT ANEMIA DUE TO LOW- OR INTERMEDIATE-1-RISK MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES, OR MDS, ASSOCIATED WITH A DELETION 5Q CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITY WITH OR WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITIES. VIDAZA® IS A PYRIMIDINE NUCLEOSIDE ANALOG THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF DNA HYPERMETHYLATION AND PROMOTE SUBSEQUENT GENE RE-EXPRESSION. VIDAZA® IS A CATEGORY 1 RECOMMENDED TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH INTERMEDIATE-2 AND HIGH-RISK MDS, ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE CANCER NETWORK, AND IS MARKETED IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALL SUBTYPES OF MDS. THE U.S. REGULATORY EXCLUSIVITY FOR VIDAZA® EXPIRED IN MAY 2011. IF A GENERIC VERSION OF VIDAZA® IS SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED, WE MAY QUICKLY LOSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SALES FOR THIS PRODUCT IN THE UNITED STATES. IN EUROPE, VIDAZA® IS MARKETED FOR THE TREATMENT OF INTERMEDIATE-2 AND HIGH-RISK MDS, AS WELL AS ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA, OR AML, WITH 30% BLASTS AND HAS BEEN GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF MDS AND AML. EUROPEAN REGULATORY EXCLUSIVITY IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH 2018. ABRAXANE® IS A SOLVENT-FREE CHEMOTHERAPY TREATMENT OPTION FOR METASTATIC BREAST CANCER WHICH WAS DEVELOPED USING OUR PROPRIETARY NAB® TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. THIS PROTEIN-BOUND CHEMOTHERAPY AGENT COMBINES PACLITAXEL WITH ALBUMIN. IT IS APPROVED FOR THE TREATMENT OF METASTATIC BREAST CANCER IN THE UNITED STATES AND MANY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND FOR THE TREATMENT OF NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER IN THE UNITED STATES. IN JANUARY 2013, WE ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS FROM A PHASE III TRIAL FOR ABRAXANE® IN 51 TABLE OF CONTENTS COMBINATION WITH GEMCITABINE IN TREATMENT-NAÏVE PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC PANCREATIC CANCER. THE ABRAXANE® COMBINATION DEMONSTRATED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN OVERALL SURVIVAL COMPARED TO PATIENTS RECEIVING GEMCITABINE ALONE. BASED ON THESE RESULTS, WE PLAN TO SUBMIT DOSSIERS FOR REGISTRATION IN THE U.S. AND EUROPE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2013 FOLLOWED BY SUBMISSIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND REGIONS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2013. ABRAXANE® IS CURRENTLY IN VARIOUS STAGES OF INVESTIGATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF THE FOLLOWING CANCERS: EXPANDED APPLICATIONS FOR METASTATIC BREAST; MALIGNANT MELANOMA; AND BLADDER AND OVARIAN. IN OCTOBER 2012, THE FDA APPROVED ABRAXANE® FOR THE FIRST-LINE TREATMENT OF LOCALLY ADVANCED OR METASTATIC NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER, OR NSCLC, IN COMBINATION WITH CARBOPLATIN, IN PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT CANDIDATES FOR CURATIVE SURGERY OR RADIATION THERAPY. THE FDA APPROVAL WAS BASED ON TUMOR RESPONSE RATES AND DID NOT RESULT IN THE USE OF A MARKETING LABEL THAT INCLUDES A PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL CLAIM, AND ACCORDINGLY, THE CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS, OR CVR, MILESTONE PAYMENT, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 2 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, HAS NOT BEEN ACHIEVED. THALOMID®, IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE, IS MARKETED FOR PATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND FOR THE ACUTE TREATMENT OF THE CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF MODERATE TO SEVERE ERYTHEMA NODOSUM LEPROSUM, OR ENL, AN INFLAMMATORY COMPLICATION OF LEPROSY AND AS MAINTENANCE THERAPY FOR PREVENTION AND SUPPRESSION OF THE CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATION OF ENL RECURRENCE. ISTODAX® IS APPROVED IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE TREATMENT OF CUTANEOUS T-CELL LYMPHOMA, OR CTCL, IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR SYSTEMIC THERAPY AND FOR THE TREATMENT OF PERIPHERAL T-CELL LYMPHOMA, OR PTCL, IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY. ISTODAX® HAS RECEIVED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF NON-HODGKIN'S T-CELL LYMPHOMAS, WHICH INCLUDES CTCL AND PTCL. THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY, OR EMA, HAS GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION FOR ISTODAX® FOR THE TREATMENT OF BOTH CTCL AND PTCL. POMALYST® (POMALIDOMIDE) WAS APPROVED BY THE FDA IN FEBRUARY 2013 FOR PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE MYELOMA WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST TWO PRIOR THERAPIES, INCLUDING LENALIDOMIDE AND BORTEZOMIB, AND HAVE DEMONSTRATED DISEASE PROGRESSION ON OR WITHIN 60 DAYS OF COMPLETION OF THE LAST THERAPY, AND IS UNDER REVIEW BY THE EMA FOR USE IN EUROPE. POMALYST® IS A PROPRIETARY, DISTINCT, SMALL MOLECULE THAT IS ADMINISTERED ORALLY AND MODULATES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND OTHER BIOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT TARGETS. POMALYST® IS ALSO BEING EVALUATED IN A PHASE III CLINICAL TRIAL FOR THE TREATMENT OF MYELOFIBROSIS, IN MULTIPLE TRIALS IN VARIOUS PHASES FOR EXPANDED USAGE IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA, AND IN A PHASE II TRIAL FOR SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS. ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF REVENUE INCLUDE ROYALTIES FROM NOVARTIS ON THEIR SALES OF FOCALIN XR® AND THE ENTIRE RITALIN® FAMILY OF DRUGS, THE SALE OF SERVICES THROUGH OUR CELGENE CELLULAR THERAPEUTICS SUBSIDIARY, AND OTHER LICENSING AGREEMENTS. WE CONTINUE TO INVEST SUBSTANTIALLY IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN SUPPORT OF MULTIPLE ONGOING CLINICAL PROPRIETARY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WHICH SUPPORT OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND PIPELINE OF NEW DRUG CANDIDATES. REVLIMID IS IN SEVERAL PHASE III TRIALS ACROSS A RANGE OF HEMATOLOGICAL 52 TABLE OF CONTENTS MALIGNANCIES THAT INCLUDE NEWLY DIAGNOSED MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND MAINTENANCE, LYMPHOMAS, CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA, OR CLL, AND MDS. PHASE III TRIALS WITH POMALYST® IN RELAPSED REFRACTORY MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND MYELOFIBROSIS, IN ADDITION TO VIDAZA FOR AML, AND CC-486 FOR MDS AND AML ARE ALSO UNDERWAY. IN SOLID TUMORS, WE ARE EVALUATING ABRAXANE IN A PHASE III TRIAL FOR METASTATIC MELANOMA. OUR LEAD PRODUCT CANDIDATE IN INFLAMMATION & IMMUNOLOGY, APREMILAST, IS BEING EVALUATED IN A BROAD PHASE III PROGRAM FOR PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS, PSORIASIS, AND ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS. BEYOND OUR PHASE III PROGRAMS IS A GROWING EARLY-TO-MID-STAGE PIPELINE OF NOVEL THERAPIES ADDRESSING SIGNIFICANT UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS, INCLUDING CC-292 (BTK INHIBITOR), CC-223 (DUAL TORK INHIBITOR), CC-115 (DUAL TORK/DNA PK INHIBITOR), CC-122 (PLEIOTROPIC PATHWAY MODULATOR), CC-220 AND CC-11050 (ANTI-INFLAMMATORY), PDA-001 AND PDA-002 (CELLULAR THERAPIES), IN ADDITION TO PARTNERED MOLECULES ACE-011 (ACTR FUSION PROTEIN), ACE-536 (GDF TRAP), AND EPZ-5676 (DOT1L INHIBITOR). WE BELIEVE THAT CONTINUED ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRIMARY COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS, PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS, DEPTH OF OUR PRODUCT PIPELINE, REGULATORY APPROVALS OF NEW PRODUCTS, AND EXPANDED USE OF EXISTING PRODUCTS WILL PROVIDE THE CATALYSTS FOR FUTURE GROWTH. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES TOTAL REVENUE AND EARNINGS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA): REVENUE INCREASED BY $664.6 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CONTINUED GROWTH IN SALES OF REVLIMID®, VIDAZA® AND ABRAXANE® IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE $138.0 MILLION INCREASE IN NET INCOME AND $0.45 INCREASE IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 REFLECTED A HIGHER LEVEL OF NET PRODUCT SALES, REDUCTION IN AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PRIMARILY DUE TO CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOMING FULLY AMORTIZED AT THE END OF 2011, AND A DECREASE IN COST OF GOODS SOLD RESULTING FROM THE 2011 INCLUSION OF INVENTORY STEP-UP AMORTIZATION FOR SALES OF ABRAXANE®. THESE FAVORABLE ITEMS WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LIABILITY RELATED TO PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS THAT WERE ISSUED AS PART OF THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS, INCREASE IN PAYMENTS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS AND INCREASE IN MARKETING ACTIVITY, PRIMARILY RELATED TO PRELAUNCH EXPENSES FOR POMALYST® AND ABRAXANE® FOR NEW INDICATIONS. 53 TABLE OF CONTENTS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 TOTAL REVENUE: TOTAL REVENUE AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA): TOTAL REVENUE INCREASED BY $664.6 MILLION, OR 13.7%, TO $5.507 BILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011, REFLECTING INCREASES OF $309.1 MILLION, OR 10.8%, IN THE UNITED STATES, AND $355.5 MILLION, OR 17.9%, IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE $1.216 BILLION, OR 33.5%, INCREASE IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 INCLUDED INCREASES OF $672.4 MILLION, OR 30.7%, IN THE UNITED STATES AND $544.0 MILLION, OR 37.8%, IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. NET PRODUCT SALES: TOTAL NET PRODUCT SALES FOR 2012 INCREASED BY $685.9 MILLION, OR 14.6%, TO $5.386 BILLION COMPARED TO 2011. THE INCREASE WAS COMPRISED OF NET VOLUME INCREASES OF $559.1 MILLION AND PRICE INCREASES OF $162.2 MILLION, PARTLY OFFSET BY AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN EXCHANGE OF $35.4 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN PRICE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO PRICE INCREASES ON REVLIMID®, VIDAZA® AND THALOMID® IN THE U.S. MARKET. TOTAL NET PRODUCT SALES FOR 2011 INCREASED BY $1.191 BILLION, OR 34.0%, TO $4.7 BILLION COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE WAS COMPRISED OF NET VOLUME INCREASES OF $1.157 BILLION, PRICE DECREASES OF $4.9 MILLION AND A FAVORABLE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN EXCHANGE OF $38.7 MILLION. THE DECREASE IN PRICES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP REBATES RESULTING FROM THE HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT AND AN INCREASE IN REBATES TO U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTS RESULTING FROM THEIR ATTEMPTS TO REDUCE HEALTH CARE COSTS, PARTLY OFFSET BY PRODUCT PRICE INCREASES. REVLIMID® NET SALES INCREASED BY $558.5 MILLION, OR 17.4%, TO $3.767 BILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED UNIT SALES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. INCREASES IN MARKET PENETRATION, TREATMENT DURATION OF PATIENTS USING REVLIMID® IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND 54 TABLE OF CONTENTS PRICE CONTRIBUTED TO U.S. GROWTH. THE GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS RESULTED FROM VOLUME INCREASES, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED DURATION OF USE AND MARKET SHARE GAINS. NET SALES OF REVLIMID® INCREASED BY $739.0 MILLION, OR 29.9%, TO $3.208 BILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED UNIT SALES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. INCREASED TREATMENT DURATION OF PATIENTS USING REVLIMID® IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND AN INCREASE IN MARKET PENETRATION CONTRIBUTED TO U.S. GROWTH. THE GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS REFLECTS THE EXPANSION OF OUR COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES IN ADDITION TO PRODUCT REIMBURSEMENT APPROVALS AND THE LAUNCH OF REVLIMID® IN JAPAN IN THE LATTER PART OF 2010. VIDAZA® NET SALES INCREASED BY $117.9 MILLION, OR 16.7%, TO $823.2 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011, REFLECTING INCREASES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE U.S. GROWTH REFLECTS AN INCREASE IN VOLUME AND PRICE. THE GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS WAS PARTLY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN TREATMENT DURATION OF PATIENTS USING VIDAZA® AND LAUNCHES OF VIDAZA® IN NEW MARKETS, INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM AND JAPAN. VIDAZA® RETAINS ORPHAN DRUG EXCLUSIVITY IN EUROPE THROUGH THE END OF 2018 AND IN JAPAN UNTIL JANUARY 2021. NET SALES OF VIDAZA® INCREASED BY $171.0 MILLION, OR 32.0%, TO $705.3 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, WITH SALES INCREASES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE GROWTH IN THE U.S. WAS THE RESULT OF INCREASED VOLUME AND PRICE. THE GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN TREATMENT DURATION OF PATIENTS USING VIDAZA® AND PRODUCT LAUNCHES IN MULTIPLE MARKETS, INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM AND JAPAN. ABRAXANE® NET SALES INCREASED BY $40.8 MILLION, OR 10.6%, TO $426.7 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED UNIT VOLUMES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, REFLECTING INCREASED ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRODUCT IN THE TREATMENT OF METASTATIC BREAST CANCER AND THE OCTOBER 2012 APPROVAL FOR NSCLC. NET SALES OF ABRAXANE® INCREASED BY $314.5 MILLION TO $385.9 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF A FULL YEAR OF SALES IN 2011 COMPARED TO THE 2.5 MONTH PERIOD IN 2010 SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS. THALOMID® NET SALES DECREASED BY $36.9 MILLION, OR 10.9%, TO $302.1 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER UNIT VOLUMES IN THE UNITED STATES, PARTLY RESULTING FROM THE INCREASED USE OF REVLIMID®, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PRICE AND LOWER GROSS TO NET ADJUSTMENTS. NET SALES OF THALOMID® DECREASED BY $50.5 MILLION, OR 13.0%, TO $339.1 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER UNIT VOLUMES IN THE UNITED STATES. ISTODAX® NET SALES INCREASED BY $19.1 MILLION, OR 61.7%, TO $50.0 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED UNIT SALES IN THE TREATMENT OF CTCL AND THE JUNE 2011 FDA APPROVAL OF ISTODAX® FOR THE TREATMENT OF PTCL IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY. NET SALES OF ISTODAX® INCREASED BY $15.1 MILLION, OR 95.9%, TO $30.9 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. ISTODAX® WAS LAUNCHED FOR THE TREATMENT OF CTCL IN MARCH OF 2010 AND WAS 55 TABLE OF CONTENTS APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR THE TREATMENT OF PTCL IN JUNE 2011 IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY. THE "OTHER" NET PRODUCT SALES CATEGORY DECREASED BY $13.4 MILLION, OR 44.1%, TO $17.0 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE APRIL 2011 SALE OF ABRAXIS NON-CORE ASSETS, RESULTING IN THE ELIMINATION OF FUTURE ABRAXIS NON-CORE PRODUCT SALES. SALES OF ABRAXIS NON-CORE PRODUCTS TOTALED $21.3 MILLION IN 2011. "OTHER" NET PRODUCT SALES IN 2011 PRIMARILY INCLUDED $21.3 MILLION IN ABRAXIS NON-CORE PRODUCT SALES, $5.4 MILLION IN SALES OF NON-CORE PHARMION PRODUCTS TO BE EXITED AND $1.3 MILLION IN SALES OF FOCALIN®. COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER REVENUE: REVENUE FROM COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER SOURCES DECREASED BY $8.8 MILLION TO $10.7 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $6.3 MILLION MILESTONE PAYMENT RECEIVED IN 2011 RELATED TO VIDAZA® AND A $2.4 MILLION REDUCTION IN CERTAIN MANUFACTURING AND MANAGEMENT FEES RECEIVED IN 2012. REVENUE FROM COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER SOURCES INCREASED BY $9.0 MILLION TO $19.5 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $6.3 MILLION MILESTONE PAYMENT RECEIVED IN FEBRUARY 2011 RELATED TO THE APPROVAL OF VIDAZA® IN JAPAN AND A $2.2 MILLION INCREASE IN CERTAIN MANUFACTURING AND MANAGEMENT FEES RECEIVED IN 2011. ROYALTY REVENUE: ROYALTY REVENUE DECREASED BY $12.5 MILLION TO $110.4 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED ROYALTIES EARNED FROM NOVARTIS BASED UPON ITS SALES OF RITALIN®, WHICH WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY GENERIC COMPETITION IN CERTAIN MARKETS, PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ROYALTIES FROM SALES OF FOCALIN XR®. ROYALTY REVENUE INCREASED BY $16.1 MILLION TO $122.9 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN ROYALTIES EARNED FROM NOVARTIS BASED UPON ITS SALES OF FOCALIN XR® AND THE ENTIRE RITALIN® FAMILY OF DRUGS. THE INCREASE WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN RESIDUAL PAYMENTS EARNED BY US FROM THE ALKERAN® REVENUES OF GLAXOSMITHKLINE PLC, OR GSK. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES, SALES DISCOUNTS, GOVERNMENT REBATES, AND CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES UNDER THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES' SPECIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE FOR THE PRODUCT'S SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER OUR PROPRIETARY "SYSTEM FOR THALIDOMIDE EDUCATION AND PRESCRIBING SAFETY," OR S.T.E.P.S.®, PROGRAM WHICH IS A COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION AND RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF PROVIDING FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES' SPECIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, 56 TABLE OF CONTENTS DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. VIDAZA®, ABRAXANE® AND ISTODAX® ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS REVLIMID® AND THALOMID®. WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. AS NOTED ABOVE, REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY. THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT. SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF THE REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE HAVE ALSO ANALYZED ACTUAL BILLINGS RECEIVED FROM CERTAIN STATES TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE ACCRUAL RATES. SUBSEQUENT TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010, OR COLLECTIVELY THE 2010 U.S. HEALTH CARE REFORM LAW, CERTAIN STATES HAVE NOT YET SUBMITTED ACTUAL MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION BILLS, RESULTING IN AN INCREASING ACCRUAL BALANCE. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011, MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT'S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL INVOICES. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS INCURRED. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES. REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. 57 TABLE OF CONTENTS SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE PROVIDE A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY. CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA. SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BELOW FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS AND THE BALANCE IN THE RELATED ALLOWANCE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS): 58 TABLE OF CONTENTS A COMPARISON OF PROVISIONS FOR ALLOWANCES FOR SALES WITHIN EACH OF THE FOUR CATEGORIES NOTED ABOVE FOR 2012 AND 2011 FOLLOWS: 2012 COMPARED TO 2011: RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES DECREASED BY $9.3 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REVERSAL OF APPROXIMATELY $7.5 MILLION IN RESERVES ESTABLISHED FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS WITH QUALITY ISSUES WHICH WERE RESOLVED IN 2012 AND LOWER RETURNS EXPERIENCE ON ALL PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $7.6 MILLION INCREASE IN THE RETURNS ALLOWANCE RELATED TO INCREASED LEVELS OF VIDAZA® INVENTORY HELD BY DISTRIBUTORS AT THE END OF 2012. DISCOUNTS INCREASED BY $8.8 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUE INCREASES IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, BOTH OF WHICH OFFER DIFFERENT DISCOUNT PROGRAMS, AND EXPANSION INTO NEW INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THESE AMOUNTS WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY REBATES RELATED TO VIDAZA® SALES IN THE JAPANESE MARKET BEING INCLUDED IN THE CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES CATEGORY IN 2012. GOVERNMENT REBATES INCREASED BY $8.7 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $15.8 MILLION IN REBATES RELATED TO VARIOUS U.S. PROGRAMS, PARTLY OFFSET BY A $7.0 MILLION DECREASE IN REBATES IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE U.S. PROGRAMS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO VOLUME INCREASES AND THE REFINEMENT OF ACCRUAL RATES FOR MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS AND MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. THE DECREASE IN GOVERNMENT REBATES OF $7.0 MILLION IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE REFINEMENT OF SELECT GOVERNMENT REBATES DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2012. CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES INCREASED BY $16.3 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. CHARGEBACKS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $2.8 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES VOLUMES. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $13.5 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO $8.3 MILLION IN SERVICE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER SALES OF ABRAXANE® , AND $7.7 MILLION OF REBATES RELATED TO VIDAZA® SALES IN THE JAPANESE MARKET WHICH WERE INCLUDED WITHIN DISCOUNTS DURING THE 2011 PERIOD. THE INCREASES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY A $4.1 MILLION DECREASE IN TRICARE REBATES, REFLECTING LOWER UTILIZATION OF THALOMID®. 2011 COMPARED TO 2010: RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES INCREASED BY $10.3 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $7.7 MILLION RELATED TO PROVISIONS FOR PRODUCTS WITH QUALITY ISSUES FROM CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS. DISCOUNTS INCREASED BY $3.1 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUE INCREASES IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, BOTH OF WHICH OFFER DISCOUNT PROGRAMS, AND EXPANSION INTO NEW INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. GOVERNMENT REBATES INCREASED BY $69.0 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $52.5 MILLION IN REBATE RATES IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND $23.9 MILLION IN INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP, PARTLY OFFSET BY A $5.4 MILLION BENEFIT RELATED TO A REFINEMENT OF PRIOR YEAR ESTIMATES FOR MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES INCREASED BY $70.2 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. CHARGEBACKS INCREASED BY $33.3 MILLION, INCLUDING $23.2 MILLION RELATED TO THE INCLUSION OF ABRAXANE® SALES IN 2011 AND $8.8 MILLION RELATED TO SALES OF VIDAZA®, WHICH INCLUDED 59 TABLE OF CONTENTS $2.1 MILLION RELATED TO DISPUTED CLAIMS FROM 2010. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES INCREASED BY $36.9 MILLION, INCLUDING $22.8 MILLION IN SERVICE FEES PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SALES OF ABRAXANE®, $7.8 MILLION IN REBATES RELATED TO THE LAUNCH OF VIDAZA® IN JAPAN AND A $3.6 MILLION INCREASE IN TRICARE REBATES. COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS): COST OF GOODS SOLD AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS): COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS): COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS) DECREASED BY $126.7 MILLION TO $299.1 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 2011 INCLUSION OF THE FOLLOWING ITEMS: A $90.3 MILLION INVENTORY STEP-UP AMORTIZATION ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO SALES OF ABRAXANE®, AN AGGREGATE $13.2 MILLION IN COSTS RELATED TO THE SALE OF NON-CORE ABRAXIS PRODUCTS WHICH WERE DIVESTED IN APRIL 2011, $8.6 MILLION IN HIGHER COSTS RELATED TO FORMER PHARMION PRODUCTS TO BE EXITED AND A $15.3 MILLION HIGHER ALLOCATION OF PREPAID ROYALTIES RELATED TO SALES OF VIDAZA®. THESE ITEMS WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN 2012 PRODUCT MATERIAL COSTS RESULTING FROM A HIGHER LEVEL OF SALES ACTIVITY. AS A PERCENT OF NET PRODUCT SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS) DECREASED TO 5.6% IN 2012 COMPARED TO 9.1% IN 2011. EXCLUDING THE INVENTORY STEP-UP AMORTIZATION FOR ABRAXANE®, THE COST OF GOODS SOLD RATIO IN 2011 WAS 7.1%. THE COST OF GOODS SOLD RATIO IN 2012 WAS FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY 0.3% FROM A REDUCTION IN PREPAID ROYALTIES EXPENSED IN 2012 RELATED TO SALES OF VIDAZA® AND LOWER COST PRODUCTS, SUCH AS REVLIMID®, COMPRISING A LARGER PORTION OF TOTAL NET SALES. COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS) INCREASED BY $119.3 MILLION TO $425.9 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCLUSION IN 2011 OF A $90.3 MILLION INVENTORY STEP-UP AMORTIZATION ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO SALES OF ABRAXANE® SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS COMPARED TO A $34.7 MILLION STEP-UP AMORTIZATION ADJUSTMENT INCLUDED IN 2010. THE REMAINDER OF THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN MATERIAL COSTS RESULTING FROM A HIGHER LEVEL OF SALES ACTIVITY. AS A PERCENT OF NET PRODUCT SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS) INCREASED TO 9.1% IN 2011 COMPARED TO 8.7% IN 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INVENTORY STEP-UP AMORTIZATION ADJUSTMENT FOR ABRAXANE®. EXCLUDING THE STEP-UP AMORTIZATION ADJUSTMENTS IN BOTH YEARS, THE COST OF GOODS SOLD RATIOS WERE 7.1% AND 7.7% IN 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND PRIMARILY INCLUDE SALARY AND BENEFIT COSTS, THIRD-PARTY GRANTS AND FEES PAID TO CLINICAL RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS, SUPPLIES AND UPFRONT AND MILESTONE PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS. 60 TABLE OF CONTENTS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS): RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED BY $123.9 MILLION TO $1.724 BILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $31.9 MILLION INCREASE IN PAYMENTS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS, AN INCREASE IN 2012 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT SPENDING IN SUPPORT OF MULTIPLE PROGRAMS ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF DISEASES AND THE INCLUSION OF AVILA EXPENSES INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO THE MARCH 2012 ACQUISITION DATE. THE EXPENSE FOR 2012 ALSO INCLUDES A $53.4 MILLION IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, OR IPR&D, ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO ISTODAX® FOR PTCL IN EUROPE AND A $69.2 MILLION IMPAIRMENT RELATED TO AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE PROBABILITY WEIGHTED FORECASTED SALES OF CC-292 COMPARED TO PRIOR ESTIMATES. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED BY $471.8 MILLION TO $1.600 BILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE IN 2011 WAS PARTLY DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $230.1 MILLION RELATED TO THE ABRAXIS BUSINESS, INCLUDING A $118.0 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO THE IPR&D ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSET. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RESULTED FROM A CHANGE IN THE PROBABILITY OF OBTAINING PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL LABELING FOR THE TREATMENT OF NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER FOR ABRAXANE® IN THE UNITED STATES. THE REMAINDER OF THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT SPENDING IN SUPPORT OF MULTIPLE PROGRAMS ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF DISEASES, WITH LATE STAGE CLINICAL TRIALS COMPLETING ENROLLMENT DURING 2011. EXPENSES FOR 2011 ALSO INCLUDED $128.5 MILLION IN UPFRONT PAYMENTS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS, A $20.0 MILLION PAYMENT TO AGIOS FOR A ONE YEAR EXTENSION OF OUR COLLABORATION AGREEMENT AND $14.5 MILLION IN MILESTONE PAYMENTS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES A BREAKDOWN OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES (IN THOUSANDS): (1)OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL PROGRAMS INCLUDE SPENDING FOR TOXICOLOGY, ANALYTICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, 61 TABLE OF CONTENTS WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN SUPPORT OF MULTIPLE ONGOING PROPRIETARY CLINICAL PROPRIETARY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WHICH SUPPORT BOTH OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND PIPELINE OF NEW DRUG CANDIDATES. REVLIMID IS IN SEVERAL PHASE III TRIALS ACROSS A RANGE OF HEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES THAT INCLUDE NEWLY DIAGNOSED MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND MAINTENANCE, LYMPHOMAS, CLL, AND NON-DELETION 5Q MDS. PHASE III TRIALS FOR POMALYST® IN MYELOFIBROSIS, IN ADDITION TO VIDAZA IN AML, AND CC-486 FOR MDS AND AML ARE ALSO UNDERWAY. IN SOLID TUMORS, WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ABRAXANE IN A PHASE III TRIAL FOR METASTATIC MELANOMA AND HAVE RECENTLY COMPLETED A PHASE III TRIAL FOR ABRAXANE® IN PANCREATIC CANCER. OUR LEAD PRODUCT CANDIDATE IN INFLAMMATION & IMMUNOLOGY, APREMILAST, IS BEING EVALUATED IN BROAD PHASE III PROGRAMS FOR PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS, PSORIASIS, AND ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS. BEYOND OUR PHASE III PROGRAMS IS A GROWING EARLY-TO-MID-STAGE PIPELINE OF NOVEL THERAPIES ADDRESSING SIGNIFICANT UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS, INCLUDING CC-292 (BTK INHIBITOR), CC-223 (DUAL TORK INHIBITOR), CC-115 (DUAL TORK/DNA PK INHIBITOR), CC-122 (PLEIOTROPIC PATHWAY MODULATOR), CC-220 AND CC-11050 (ANTI-INFLAMMATORY), PDA-001 AND PDA-002 (CELLULAR THERAPIES), IN ADDITION TO PARTNERED MOLECULES ACE-011 (ACTR FUSION PROTEIN), ACE-536 (GDF TRAP), AND EPZ-5676 (DOT1L INHIBITOR). WE DO NOT COLLECT COSTS ON A PROJECT BASIS OR FOR ANY CATEGORY OF PROJECTS FOR THE MAJORITY OF COSTS INVOLVED IN CARRYING OUT RESEARCH PROJECTS. WHILE WE DO PERFORM COST CALCULATIONS TO FACILITATE OUR INTERNAL EVALUATION OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS, THESE CALCULATIONS INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATIONS AND ALLOCATIONS THAT ARE NOT RELEVANT TO, OR INCLUDED IN, OUR EXTERNAL FINANCIAL REPORTING MECHANISMS. AS A CONSEQUENCE, WE DO NOT REPORT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS AT THE PROJECT LEVEL. 62 TABLE OF CONTENTS THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS AND REGULATORY APPROVAL REQUESTS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR IF THE FUTURE OCCURRENCE IS MATERIAL AND REASONABLY CERTAIN: NEW PHASE III TRIALS PRODUCT DISEASE INDICATION CC-486 LOWER RISK MDS1 AML2 MAINTENANCE POMALYST® MULTIPLE MYELOMA REGULATORY APPROVAL REQUESTS IN MAJOR MARKETS PRODUCT DISEASE INDICATION MAJOR MARKET REGULATORY AGENCY DATE OF SUBMISSION REVLIMID® MCL3 U.S. FDA DEC-12 REGULATORY AGENCY ACTIONS PRODUCT DISEASE INDICATION MAJOR MARKET REGULATORY AGENCY ACTION REVLIMID® RRMM CHINA SFDA6 APPROVAL ABRAXANE® NSCLC4 U.S. FDA APPROVAL POMALYST® MULTIPLE MYELOMA U.S. FDA APPROVAL ISTODAX® PTCL5 E.U.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY $275.7 MILLION TO $1.226 BILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, PARTLY DUE TO HIGHER MARKETING AND SALES-RELATED EXPENSES RESULTING FROM ONGOING PRODUCT LAUNCH ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING REVLIMID® IN JAPAN, PREPARATION FOR THE FILING AND LAUNCH OF REVLIMID® IN CHINA, ISTODAX® IN PTCL IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABRAXANE® IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE. IN ADDITION, 2011 INCLUDED AN INCREASE OF $72.1 MILLION IN EXPENSES RELATED TO THE ABRAXIS BUSINESS, RESULTING FROM A FULL YEAR'S EXPENSE BEING INCLUDED IN 2011. AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS: AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED AS A RESULT OF BUSINESS COMBINATIONS IS SUMMARIZED BELOW FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 (IN THOUSANDS): AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS DECREASED BY $94.7 MILLION TO $194.5 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 PRIMARILY DUE TO CERTAIN PHARMION INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOMING FULLY AMORTIZED AT THE END OF 2011, WHICH REDUCED AMORTIZATION EXPENSE BY $155.8 MILLION. THE DECREASE WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY INTANGIBLE ASSETS OBTAINED IN THE MARCH 2012 ACQUISITION OF AVILA, WHICH INCREASED AMORTIZATION EXPENSE BY $39.4 MILLION. IN ADDITION, THE JUNE 2011 FDA APPROVAL OF ISTODAX® FOR TREATMENT OF PTCL IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY AND THE OCTOBER 2012 APPROVAL OF ABRAXANE® IN THE U.S. FOR THE TREATMENT OF NSCLC RESULTED IN THE COMMENCEMENT OF AMORTIZATION OF THE RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THE APPROVAL OF ABRAXANE® INCREASED AMORTIZATION EXPENSE BY $16.3 MILLION AND IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN ANNUAL AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $78.0 MILLION OVER THE 15 YEAR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSOCIATED INTANGIBLE ASSET. 64 TABLE OF CONTENTS AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCREASED BY $86.0 MILLION TO $289.2 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A FULL YEAR'S AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS OBTAINED IN THE OCTOBER 2010 ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS BEING INCLUDED IN 2011. IN ADDITION, IN JUNE 2011, THE FDA APPROVED ISTODAX®, WHICH WAS OBTAINED IN THE JANUARY 2010 ACQUISITION OF GLOUCESTER, FOR TREATMENT OF PTCL IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY. AS A RESULT OF THE FDA APPROVAL, AMORTIZATION OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET COMMENCED WITH AN 8.8 YEAR EXPECTED USEFUL LIFE, INCREASING AMORTIZATION EXPENSE BY $17.8 MILLION. ACQUISITION RELATED (GAINS) CHARGES AND RESTRUCTURING, NET: ACQUISITION RELATED (GAINS) CHARGES AND RESTRUCTURING, NET WAS A NET CHARGE OF $169.0 MILLION IN 2012 AND A NET GAIN OF $142.3 MILLION IN 2011. THE NET INCREASE OF $311.3 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $368.3 MILLION CHANGE IN THE INCOME STATEMENT IMPACT RELATED TO OUR PUBLICLY TRADED CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS, OR CVRS. WE RECORDED A $216.8 MILLION CHARGE IN 2012 AND A $151.5 MILLION FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT IN 2011. IN ADDITION, WE RECORDED A $9.2 MILLION ACCRETION OF THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF AVILA. THE INCREASES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY A $63.6 MILLION REDUCTION IN THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY RELATED TO THE APPROVAL OF ISTODAX® FOR PTCL IN EUROPE. ACQUISITION RELATED (GAINS) CHARGES AND RESTRUCTURING, NET WAS A NET GAIN OF $142.3 MILLION IN 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO A $151.5 MILLION FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT TO THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LIABILITY RELATED TO OUR PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS. THE FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY $4.0 MILLION IN ACCRETION OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO U.S. AND EU APPROVAL OF ISTODAX® FOR TREATMENT OF PTCL AND $5.2 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ACQUISITION RELATED CHARGES. INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET: INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET IS SUMMARIZED BELOW FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS): INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET: INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET DECREASED BY $10.6 MILLION TO $15.3 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $3.7 MILLION REDUCTION IN INTEREST INCOME DUE TO LOWER OVERALL INTEREST RATES, A $5.1 MILLION NET DECREASE IN GAINS ON SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND A $1.9 MILLION NET INCREASE IN THE COST OF AMORTIZATION OF DISCOUNTS AND PREMIUMS RELATED TO MARKETABLE SECURITIES. INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET DECREASED BY $18.9 MILLION TO $25.9 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $14.2 MILLION REDUCTION IN INTEREST INCOME DUE TO LOWER OVERALL YIELDS, A $7.4 MILLION NET REDUCTION IN GAINS ON SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND A $0.3 MILLION DECREASE IN DIVIDEND INCOME, PARTLY OFFSET BY A $3.0 MILLION NET DECREASE IN THE AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND DISCOUNTS RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES. 65 TABLE OF CONTENTS INTEREST (EXPENSE): INTEREST (EXPENSE) IS SUMMARIZED BELOW FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS): INTEREST (EXPENSE) INCREASED BY $20.5 MILLION TO $63.2 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEREST AND FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ISSUANCE OF AN ADDITIONAL $1.500 BILLION IN SENIOR NOTES IN AUGUST 2012 AND AN INCREASE IN INTEREST ON COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS, WHICH WAS IN EFFECT FOR FULL YEAR 2012. INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED BY $30.1 MILLION TO $42.7 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $29.6 MILLION INCREASE IN INTEREST ACCRUED ON THE $1.250 BILLION IN SENIOR NOTES ISSUED IN OCTOBER 2010 AND TO THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER BEGINNING IN SEPTEMBER 2011. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET: OTHER INCOME, NET IS SUMMARIZED BELOW FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 (IN THOUSANDS): OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET WAS A NET EXPENSE OF $17.0 MILLION IN 2012 AND PRIMARILY INCLUDED $25.5 MILLION IN IMPAIRMENT LOSSES RELATED TO COST METHOD INVESTMENTS AND NET FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSSES/FORWARD POINT AMORTIZATION OF $8.4 MILLION, PARTLY OFFSET BY A $7.4 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES, NET GAINS OF $3.7 MILLION RELATED TO THE SHORT PERIOD IN JUNE 2012 WHEN CERTAIN TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS WERE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND A $3.7 MILLION ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GRANT FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY. INCLUDED IN 2011 WERE NET FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSSES/FORWARD POINT AMORTIZATION OF $10.9 MILLION AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT LOSSES OF $2.8 MILLION, PARTLY OFFSET BY A $2.9 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF NON-CORE ASSETS AND $3.6 MILLION IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GRANT PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY. INCOME TAX PROVISION: THE INCOME TAX PROVISION INCREASED BY $123.2 MILLION TO $225.3 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. THE FULL YEAR 2012 UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 13.5% REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS FOOTPRINT. THE INCREASE IN THE UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FROM 2011 REFLECTS A DECREASE IN TAX BENEFITS FROM CERTAIN ACQUISITION-RELATED ITEMS. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2012 WAS REDUCED BY 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS AS A RESULT OF DISCRETE ITEMS, INCLUDING TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF TAX EXAMINATIONS AND EXPIRATIONS OF STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES RECORDED ON CERTAIN UNREMITTED FOREIGN EARNINGS PREVIOUSLY TREATED AS PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN SUCH FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS AND TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO THE FILING OF OUR 2011 INCOME TAX RETURNS WITH CERTAIN ITEMS BEING LESS FAVORABLE THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED. THE U.S. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND WAS RETROACTIVELY REINSTATED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013. THE TAX BENEFIT OF OUR 2012 RESEARCH CREDIT WILL BE RECORDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013. THIS CHANGE IN TAX LAW DOES NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR INCOME TAX PROVISIONS. 66 TABLE OF CONTENTS THE INCOME TAX PROVISION DECREASED BY $30.4 MILLION TO $102.1 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE FULL YEAR 2011 UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 11.5% REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS FOOTPRINT, THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF A SHIFT IN EARNINGS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND LOWER TAX FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, AND TAX DEDUCTIONS RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITIONS. THE DECREASE IN THE UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ALSO REFLECTS BENEFITS FROM AN INCREASE IN ACQUISITION-RELATED CHARGES, INCLUDING AN IPR&D ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $118.0 MILLION AND A NON-TAXABLE GAIN FROM A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LIABILITY UNDER THE CVR AGREEMENT RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS OF $151.5 MILLION. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS REDUCED BY 4.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2011 AS A RESULT OF DISCRETE ITEMS WHICH INCLUDED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO A FOREIGN TAX CREDIT, A DECREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN ONGOING INCOME TAX AUDITS AND EXPIRATIONS OF STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS, AND A NET TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO CHANGES IN STATE TAX LAWS. THE INCOME TAX PROVISION FOR 2010 INCLUDED A FULL YEAR UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 15.9%. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS REDUCED BY 2.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2010 AS A RESULT OF DISCRETE ITEMS WHICH INCLUDED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO A SETTLEMENT OF A TAX EXAMINATION AND A REDUCTION IN A VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATED TO CERTAIN TAX CARRYFORWARDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN ONGOING INCOME TAX AUDITS. NET INCOME: NET INCOME AND PER COMMON SHARE AMOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA): THE $138.0 MILLION INCREASE IN NET INCOME AND $0.45 INCREASE IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 REFLECTED A HIGHER LEVEL OF NET PRODUCT SALES, REDUCTION IN AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY DUE TO CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOMING FULLY AMORTIZED AT THE END OF 2011 AND A DECREASE IN COST OF GOODS SOLD, RESULTING FROM THE 2011 INCLUSION OF INVENTORY STEP-UP AMORTIZATION FOR SALES OF ABRAXANE®. THESE FAVORABLE ITEMS WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LIABILITY RELATED TO PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS, AN INCREASE IN PAYMENTS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS AND INCREASE IN MARKETING ACTIVITY, PRIMARILY RELATED TO PRELAUNCH EXPENSES FOR POMALYST® AND ABRAXANE® FOR NEW INDICATIONS. EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE WERE ALSO FAVORABLY IMPACTED IN 2012 BY THE REPURCHASE OF 28.6 MILLION COMMON SHARES UNDER OUR COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, REDUCING OUR OUTSTANDING SHARE BASE. NET INCOME FOR 2011 REFLECTS THE EARNINGS IMPACT FROM HIGHER SALES OF REVLIMID®, VIDAZA® AND A FULL YEAR'S SALES OF ABRAXANE®. THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF HIGHER REVENUES WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SPENDING FOR NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, EXPANSION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO 67 TABLE OF CONTENTS ACQUISITIONS AND AN INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF SENIOR NOTES IN OCTOBER 2010. EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE WERE ALSO FAVORABLY IMPACTED IN 2011 BY THE REPURCHASE OF 38.3 MILLION COMMON SHARES UNDER OUR COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, REDUCING OUR OUTSTANDING SHARE BASE. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE COMPONENTS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 (IN THOUSANDS): (1)INCLUDES CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET OF ALLOWANCES, INVENTORY AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, LESS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES, INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES. WE RELY PRIMARILY ON POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AND BORROWINGS IN THE FORM OF LONG-TERM NOTES PAYABLE AND SHORT-TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER TO PROVIDE FOR OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. WE EXPECT CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR EXPENDITURES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TRIALS, COMMERCIALIZATION OF NEW PRODUCTS, INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND EXISTING SOURCES OF AND ACCESS TO FINANCING ARE ADEQUATE TO FUND OUR OPERATING NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AND OUR PLANS TO REPURCHASE STOCK OR PURSUE OTHER STRATEGIC BUSINESS INITIATIVES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, AND SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE HELD INTERNATIONALLY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, WE HELD APPROXIMATELY $2.700 BILLION OF THESE SHORT-TERM FUNDS IN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS. THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS HELD IN U.S. TAX JURISDICTIONS CAN FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND DUE TO OTHER REASONS, SUCH AS REPURCHASES OF OUR 68 TABLE OF CONTENTS COMMON STOCK AND BUSINESS-DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. AS PART OF OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY ASSESSMENTS, WE REGULARLY MONITOR THE MIX OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CASH FLOWS (BOTH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS). REPATRIATION OF OVERSEAS FUNDS CAN RESULT IN ADDITIONAL U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAX PAYMENTS. WE RECORD U.S. DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES FOR CERTAIN UNREMITTED EARNINGS, BUT WHEN AMOUNTS EARNED OVERSEAS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., NO ACCRUAL FOR U.S. TAXES IS PROVIDED. DURING 2012, WE CONCLUDED THAT APPROXIMATELY $900.0 MILLION OF OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS MAY NOT BE REQUIRED FOR USE IN OFFSHORE OPERATIONS AND MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR USE IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE EARNINGS ARE NO LONGER TREATED AS PERMANENTLY REINVESTED, AND ACCORDINGLY, WE RECORDED A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OF $316.5 MILLION FOR THE ESTIMATED U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAXES THAT MAY BE INCURRED SHOULD THESE EARNINGS BE REPATRIATED. THE REMAINING FOREIGN EARNINGS ARE UNREMITTED AND EXPECTED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. WE DO NOT RELY ON THESE UNREMITTED EARNINGS AS A SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR OUR DOMESTIC BUSINESS AS WE EXPECT TO HAVE SUFFICIENT CURRENT CASH RESOURCES COMBINED WITH FUTURE CASH FLOWS IN THE UNITED STATES TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC NEEDS. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM: OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED AN AGGREGATE $6.500 BILLION STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF WHICH WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $1.837 BILLION REMAINING FOR FUTURE SHARE REPURCHASES. DURING 2012, WE USED $2.044 BILLION FOR REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, MEASURED ON A SETTLEMENT DATE BASIS. COMPONENTS OF WORKING CAPITAL CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: WE INVEST OUR EXCESS CASH PRIMARILY IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS, U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND SUPRANATIONAL SECURITIES AND GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES. ALL LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND ALL INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE. WE DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. THE $1.252 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ISSUANCE OF $1.500 BILLION IN SENIOR NOTES IN AUGUST 2012 AND BY CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, PARTLY OFFSET BY $2.044 BILLION PAID UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, $352.2 MILLION PAID FOR THE ACQUISITION OF AVILA, AND A NET REPAYMENT OF $217.4 MILLION IN SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. FOR MORE INFORMATION RELATED TO THE FAIR VALUE AND VALUATION OF OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES, SEE NOTE 4 TO THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET INCREASED BY $15.0 MILLION TO $960.5 MILLION AT THE END OF 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. THE IMPACT OF INCREASED U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SALES OF 69 TABLE OF CONTENTS REVLIMID®, VIDAZA® AND ABRAXANE® WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY INCREASED COLLECTIONS IN CERTAIN MARKETS. SALES MADE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES TYPICALLY HAVE PAYMENT TERMS THAT ARE GREATER THAN 60 DAYS, THEREBY EXTENDING COLLECTION PERIODS BEYOND THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE EXPECT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE TO CONTINUE TO GROW AS OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES CONTINUE TO EXPAND. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES, THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS IN CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND ASSOCIATED IMPACTS ON THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OUR BUSINESS. OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL IN THESE MARKETS IS TYPICALLY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO PRINCIPALLY GOVERNMENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED HOSPITALS, WHICH IN TURN DIRECTLY DELIVER CRITICAL CARE TO PATIENTS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE USED TO TREAT LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES AND WE BELIEVE THIS BUSINESS MODEL ENABLES TIMELY DELIVERY AND ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS. MANY OF THE OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE RELATED TO GOVERNMENT-FUNDED HOSPITALS AND WE BELIEVE THE RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE ULTIMATELY COLLECTIBLE. SIMILARLY, WE BELIEVE THAT FUTURE SALES TO THESE CUSTOMERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE COLLECTIBLE. THE CREDIT AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WITHIN SPAIN, ITALY, PORTUGAL AND GREECE, AS WELL AS INCREASING SALES LEVELS IN THOSE COUNTRIES HAVE RESULTED IN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN, AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES TO COLLECT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. OUR TOTAL NET RECEIVABLES IN SPAIN, ITALY AND PORTUGAL ARE COMPOSED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR CONTROLLED HOSPITALS AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND AMOUNTED TO $324.2 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO $396.1 MILLION IN 2011. APPROXIMATELY $51.9 MILLION OF THE $324.2 MILLION RECEIVABLE IN 2012 WAS GREATER THAN ONE YEAR PAST DUE. OUR EXPOSURE TO THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS IN GREECE IS LIMITED, AS WE DO NOT HAVE A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF RECEIVABLES IN GREECE. WE MAINTAIN TIMELY AND DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH HOSPITAL CUSTOMERS IN SPAIN, ITALY AND PORTUGAL REGARDING BOTH THE CURRENT AND PAST DUE RECEIVABLE BALANCES. WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS FROM THESE COUNTRIES, AND CLOSELY MONITOR THE PLANS FOR PAYMENT AT THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL. PAYMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS IN THESE COUNTRIES ARE NOT RECEIVED ON REGULAR INTERVALS AND SEVERAL MONTHS COULD ELAPSE BETWEEN SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS. THIS PAYMENT PATTERN WAS OBSERVED IN SPAIN EARLIER IN 2012, WHERE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF AGED RECEIVABLES WERE PAID IN LATE JUNE AND EARLY JULY 2012. WE ALSO REGULARLY REQUEST AND RECEIVE POSITIVE CONFIRMATION OF THE VALIDITY OF OUR RECEIVABLES FROM MOST OF THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES. WE HAVE THE OPTION TO PURSUE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST CERTAIN OF OUR CUSTOMERS. IN VIEW OF THE PROTRACTED TIMELINE ASSOCIATED WITH COLLECTING THE OUTSTANDING BALANCES THROUGH LEGAL ACTION AND THE CURRENT DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, IN MANY INSTANCES, WE DO NOT BELIEVE PURSUING LEGAL ACTION TO BE THE BEST APPROACH FOR ANY OF THE PARTIES INVOLVED. IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR SPAIN, ITALY, AND PORTUGAL, WE CONSIDERED THAT THE BALANCE OF PAST DUE RECEIVABLES IS RELATED TO SALES MADE TO GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR SUPPORTED CUSTOMERS. WE REGULARLY MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS IN EUROPE TO ASSESS WHETHER THE LEVEL OF RISK OF DEFAULT FOR ANY CUSTOMERS HAS INCREASED AND NOTE THE ONGOING EFFORTS BY THE EUROPEAN UNION, EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION AND INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND TO SUPPORT COUNTRIES WITH LARGE PUBLIC DEFICITS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT BALANCES. WE ALSO MONITOR THE EFFORTS OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES TO SUPPORT THEIR REGIONS WITH LARGE PUBLIC DEFICITS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT BALANCES. WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR WRITE-OFFS WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLECTION OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN THESE COUNTRIES AS A RESULT OF THEIR ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES AND WE DO NOT EXPECT TO HAVE WRITE-OFFS OR ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 70 TABLE OF CONTENTS INVENTORY: INVENTORY BALANCES INCREASED BY $69.9 MILLION TO $259.5 MILLION AT THE END OF 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN REVLIMID®, VIDAZA® AND ABRAXANE® INVENTORIES, ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER ANTICIPATED SALES LEVELS. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS: OTHER CURRENT ASSETS DECREASED BY $74.9 MILLION TO $320.2 MILLION AT THE END OF 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 PRIMARILY DUE TO A $64.1 MILLION DECREASE IN PREPAID TAXES AND A $60.0 MILLION DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN OTHER PREPAID ACCOUNTS. COMMERCIAL PAPER: IN SEPTEMBER 2011, WE ENTERED INTO A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, OR THE PROGRAM, UNDER WHICH WE ISSUE UNSECURED COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES, OR COMMERCIAL PAPER, ON A PRIVATE PLACEMENT BASIS UP TO A MAXIMUM AGGREGATE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING AT ANY TIME OF $1.000 BILLION, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH WILL BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE MATURITIES OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MAY VARY, BUT MAY NOT EXCEED 270 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ISSUE. THE COMMERCIAL PAPER IS SOLD UNDER CUSTOMARY TERMS TO A DEALER OR IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET AND IS ISSUED AT A DISCOUNT FROM PAR OR, ALTERNATIVELY, IS SOLD AT PAR AND BEARS VARYING INTEREST RATES ON A FIXED OR FLOATING BASIS. BORROWINGS UNDER THE PROGRAM ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, $308.5 MILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER WAS OUTSTANDING BEARING AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OF 0.5%. SENIOR UNSECURED CREDIT FACILITY: IN SEPTEMBER 2011, WE ENTERED INTO A SENIOR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, OR THE CREDIT FACILITY, PROVIDING FOR REVOLVING CREDIT IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $1.000 BILLION. SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT FACILITY (BUT IN NO EVENT MORE THAN ONE TIME PER ANNUM), UP TO A MAXIMUM AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $1.250 BILLION. THE CREDIT FACILITY HAS A FIVE-YEAR TERM AND AMOUNTS MAY BE BORROWED FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE CREDIT FACILITY SERVES AS BACKUP LIQUIDITY FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 THERE WAS NO OUTSTANDING BORROWING AGAINST THE CREDIT FACILITY. THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS INCLUDING CERTAIN CUSTOMARY FINANCIAL COVENANTS. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL DEBT COVENANTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES: ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES INCREASED BY $391.0 MILLION TO $1.353 BILLION AT THE END OF 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $277.4 MILLION RECLASSIFICATION OF THE LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS FROM NON-CURRENT TO CURRENT, A $51.5 MILLION INCREASE IN CLINICAL TRIAL ACCRUALS, A $17.4 MILLION INCREASE IN THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO THE JANUARY 2012 AVILA ACQUISITION AND A $16.6 MILLION INCREASE IN ACCRUED INTEREST. INCOME TAXES PAYABLE (CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT): INCOME TAXES PAYABLE DECREASED BY $446.5 MILLION TO $200.0 MILLION AT THE END OF 2012 COMPARED TO 2011, PRIMARILY FROM TAX PAYMENTS OF $469.6 MILLION, THE APPLICATION OF PREVIOUSLY REFUNDABLE PREPAID INCOME TAXES OF $11.4 MILLION, A TAX BENEFIT OF STOCK OPTIONS OF $43.4 MILLION, NET DEFERRED INTERCOMPANY CREDITS OF $50.3 MILLION OFFSET BY THE CURRENT PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES OF $125.1 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDES A BENEFIT RELATED TO TAX SETTLEMENTS OF $373.0 MILLION. 71 TABLE OF CONTENTS SENIOR NOTES: IN AUGUST 2012, WE ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL $1.500 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 1.90% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2017, OR THE 2017 NOTES, AND $1.000 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.25% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2022 (THE "2022 NOTES" AND, TOGETHER WITH THE 2017 NOTES, REFERRED TO HEREIN AS THE "2012 ISSUED NOTES"). THE 2012 ISSUED NOTES WERE ISSUED AT 99.786% AND 99.949% OF PAR, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE DISCOUNT IS BEING AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. OFFERING COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $11.7 MILLION HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. INTEREST ON THE NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON FEBRUARY 15 AND AUGUST 15 EACH YEAR BEGINNING FEBRUARY 15, 2013 AND THE PRINCIPAL ON EACH NOTE IS DUE IN FULL AT THEIR RESPECTIVE MATURITY DATES. THE NOTES MAY BE REDEEMED AT OUR OPTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT ANY TIME AT A REDEMPTION PRICE DEFINED IN A MAKE-WHOLE CLAUSE EQUALING ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST PLUS THE GREATER OF 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES TO BE REDEEMED OR THE SUM OF THE PRESENT VALUES OF THE REMAINING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL DISCOUNTED TO THE DATE OF REDEMPTION ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS PLUS 20 BASIS POINTS IN THE CASE OF THE 2017 NOTES AND 25 BASIS POINTS IN THE CASE OF THE 2022 NOTES. IF WE EXPERIENCE A CHANGE OF CONTROL ACCOMPANIED BY A DOWNGRADE OF THE DEBT TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO OFFER TO REPURCHASE THE NOTES AT A PURCHASE PRICE EQUAL TO 101% OF THEIR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST. WE ARE SUBJECT TO COVENANTS WHICH LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PLEDGE PROPERTIES AS SECURITY UNDER BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING OUR PROPERTY. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE SENIOR NOTES WAS $2.771 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2012. CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS): OPERATING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY $242.4 MILLION TO $2.019 BILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN EXPANSION OF OUR OPERATIONS AND RELATED INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS. NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2011 INCREASED BY $594.6 MILLION TO $1.776 BILLION AS COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN EXPANSION OF OUR OPERATIONS AND RELATED INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS, PARTIALLY 72 TABLE OF CONTENTS OFFSET BY THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ASSOCIATED WITH EXPANDING INTERNATIONAL SALES, WHICH TAKE LONGER TO COLLECT, AND THE TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. INVESTING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2012 CHANGED TO A NET USAGE OF $1.554 BILLION COMPARED TO $377.7 MILLION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2011. THE DECREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO A CASH USE OF $1.025 BILLION FOR NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE DURING 2012 COMPARED TO NET SALES OF $481.8 MILLION IN 2011, PLUS USAGES OF $352.2 MILLION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF AVILA AND $48.9 MILLION FOR THE PURCHASE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER ASSETS. NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2011 CHANGED TO A POSITIVE $377.7 MILLION COMPARED TO A NET CASH USE OF $2.107 BILLION IN 2010. THE 2010 INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCLUDED NET CASH USED IN THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS OF $2.315 BILLION AND THE ACQUISITION OF GLOUCESTER OF $337.6 MILLION. FINANCING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2012 WAS $248.7 MILLION COMPARED TO A NET CASH USE OF $1.622 BILLION IN 2011. THE $1.373 BILLION DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2012 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO $1.487 BILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $217.4 MILLION OF NET REPAYMENTS OF SHORT-TERM BORROWING IN 2012 COMPARED TO $525.7 MILLION OF NET SHORT-TERM BORROWING IN 2011. DURING 2012 AND 2011, WE USED $2.044 BILLION AND $2.189 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, MEASURED ON A SETTLEMENT DATE BASIS. NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2011 WAS $1.622 BILLION COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED OF $1.177 BILLION IN 2010. THE $2.799 BILLION DECREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2011 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN 2010 THAT PROVIDED NET CASH OF $1.237 BILLION AND THE $2.189 BILLION IN COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES IN 2011 UNDER THE COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 (IN THOUSANDS): (1)THE SENIOR NOTE OBLIGATION AMOUNTS INCLUDE FUTURE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS. SENIOR NOTES: IN AUGUST 2012, WE ISSUED $1.500 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 1.90% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2017, AND 73 TABLE OF CONTENTS $1.000 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.25% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2022. THE 2012 ISSUED NOTES WERE ISSUED AT 99.786% AND 99.949% OF PAR, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE DISCOUNT IS BEING AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. OFFERING COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $11.7 MILLION HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. INTEREST ON THE NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON FEBRUARY 15 AND AUGUST 15 EACH YEAR BEGINNING FEBRUARY 15, 2013 AND THE PRINCIPAL ON EACH NOTE IS DUE IN FULL AT THEIR RESPECTIVE MATURITY DATES. THE NOTES MAY BE REDEEMED AT THE OPTION OF THE COMPANY, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT ANY TIME AT A REDEMPTION PRICE DEFINED IN A MAKE-WHOLE CLAUSE EQUALING ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST PLUS THE GREATER OF 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES TO BE REDEEMED OR THE SUM OF THE PRESENT VALUES OF THE REMAINING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL DISCOUNTED TO THE DATE OF REDEMPTION ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS PLUS 20 BASIS POINTS IN THE CASE OF THE 2017 NOTES AND 25 BASIS POINTS IN THE CASE OF THE 2022 NOTES. IF WE EXPERIENCE A CHANGE OF CONTROL ACCOMPANIED BY A DOWNGRADE OF THE DEBT TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO OFFER TO REPURCHASE THE NOTES AT A PURCHASE PRICE EQUAL TO 101% OF THEIR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST. WE ARE SUBJECT TO COVENANTS WHICH LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PLEDGE PROPERTIES AS SECURITY UNDER BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING OUR PROPERTY. IN OCTOBER 2010, WE ISSUED A TOTAL OF $1.250 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2.45% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2015, $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.95% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2020 AND $250.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 5.7% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2040. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS: CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS INCLUDED PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND FEES OF $308.5 MILLION RELATED TO COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2012. OPERATING LEASES: WE LEASE OFFICE AND RESEARCH FACILITIES UNDER VARIOUS OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE NON-CANCELABLE LEASE TERMS FOR OPERATING LEASES EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES BETWEEN 2013 AND 2023 AND INCLUDE RENEWAL OPTIONS. IN GENERAL, WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE LESSORS FOR REAL ESTATE TAXES, INSURANCE, UTILITIES, MAINTENANCE AND OTHER OPERATING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEASES. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE MAJOR FACILITIES THAT WE OCCUPY UNDER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS REFER TO PART I, ITEM 2, "PROPERTIES" OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS: OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS OF $89.4 MILLION ON DECEMBER 31, 2012 INCLUDE $64.1 MILLION IN CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPLY CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE COMMITTED TO INVEST AN AGGREGATE $25.0 MILLION IN TWO INVESTMENT FUNDS OVER A TEN-YEAR PERIOD, WHICH IS CALLABLE AT ANY TIME. ON DECEMBER 31, 2012, OUR REMAINING INVESTMENT COMMITMENT WAS $5.4 MILLION. COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS: WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT INCLUDE THE FUNDING OF CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE MILESTONE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED DEVELOPMENTAL, REGULATORY AND/OR COMMERCIAL TARGETS. OUR OBLIGATION TO FUND THESE EFFORTS IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROGRAMS AND/OR THE LACK OF ANY ADVERSE EVENTS WHICH COULD CAUSE THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE 74 TABLE OF CONTENTS PROGRAMS. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE ATTAINMENT OF SPECIFIED DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND ACCORDINGLY, NO AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED FOR THESE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011 CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. POTENTIAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $6.202 BILLION, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $4.284 BILLION CONTINGENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF VARIOUS RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES AND APPROXIMATELY $1.918 BILLION IN SALES-BASED MILESTONES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS ARE IDENTIFIED IN NOTE 17 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. NEW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN JULY 2012, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD, OR FASB, ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE, OR ASU, NO. 2012-02, "INTANGIBLES  GOODWILL AND OTHER (TOPIC 350): TESTING INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT," OR ASU 2012-02. ASU 2012-02 ALLOWS A COMPANY THE OPTION TO FIRST ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS NECESSARY TO PERFORM A QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT TEST. UNDER THAT OPTION, A COMPANY WOULD NO LONGER BE REQUIRED TO CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET UNLESS THE COMPANY DETERMINES, BASED ON THAT QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. ASU 2012-02 IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL AND INTERIM INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT TESTS PERFORMED FOR PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER SEPTEMBER 15, 2012. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED AND WE ADOPTED THIS STANDARD IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012. THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2012-02 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IS ONE THAT IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENT'S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL: REVENUE RECOGNITION: REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS OF THE PRODUCT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER. PROVISIONS FOR DISCOUNTS, EARLY PAYMENTS, REBATES, SALES RETURNS AND DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS UNDER TERMS CUSTOMARY IN THE INDUSTRY ARE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SAME PERIOD THE RELATED SALES ARE RECORDED. WE RECORD ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SALE. THE ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR SUCH VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES ARE BASED ON THE SALES TERMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND TREND ANALYSIS. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM ROYALTIES BASED ON LICENSEES' SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS USING OUR TECHNOLOGIES. ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACT TERMS WHEN ROYALTIES FROM LICENSEES CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED. IF ROYALTIES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR COLLECTABILITY OF A ROYALTY AMOUNT IS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED, ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE CASH IS RECEIVED. 75 TABLE OF CONTENTS GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES, SALES DISCOUNTS, GOVERNMENT REBATES, AND CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES. WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY. THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT. SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF THE REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE HAVE ALSO ANALYZED ACTUAL BILLINGS RECEIVED FROM CERTAIN STATES TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE ACCRUAL RATES. SUBSEQUENT TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010, OR COLLECTIVELY THE 2010 U.S. HEALTH CARE REFORM LAW, CERTAIN STATES HAVE NOT YET SUBMITTED ACTUAL MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION BILLS, RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN THE ACCRUAL BALANCE. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011, MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT'S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL INVOICES. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS INCURRED. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES. REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE PROVIDE A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER 76 TABLE OF CONTENTS INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY. CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: WE ESTIMATE AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, HISTORICAL PAYMENT PATTERNS, AGING OF RECEIVABLE BALANCES AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF COUNTRIES THEMSELVES AND PROVINCES OR AREAS WITHIN SUCH COUNTRIES WHERE THEY ARE THE ULTIMATE CUSTOMERS. INCOME TAXES: WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. WE PROVIDE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE ACCOUNT FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS PART OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THESE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATE PRIMARILY TO ISSUES COMMON AMONG MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE APPLY A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES WHICH INCLUDE STUDIES PERFORMED BY INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS, ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY AND SUBJECT EXPERTS, EVALUATION OF PUBLIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. WE PROVIDE ESTIMATES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. IF OUR ESTIMATES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ACTUAL OUTCOMES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE A PORTION WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR RECENT CUMULATIVE EARNINGS EXPERIENCE BY TAXING JURISDICTION, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, CARRYFORWARD PERIODS AVAILABLE TO US FOR TAX REPORTING PURPOSES, VARIOUS INCOME TAX STRATEGIES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT AND, TO THE EXTENT FUTURE EXPECTATIONS CHANGE, WE WOULD HAVE TO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THAT TIME. AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION: THE COST OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IS RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL AWARDS GRANTED, USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES METHOD OF VALUATION FOR STOCK OPTIONS. THE FAIR VALUES OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND PERFORMANCE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ARE BASED ON THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH AWARD IS DETERMINED AND THE COMPENSATION COST IS 77 TABLE OF CONTENTS RECOGNIZED OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD REQUIRED TO OBTAIN FULL VESTING. COMPENSATION COST TO BE RECOGNIZED REFLECTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF AWARDS EXPECTED TO VEST AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AN ESTIMATE OF AWARD FORFEITURES BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE. OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES: A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF ANY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY BELOW ITS COST THAT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN CARRYING AMOUNT TO FAIR VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT IS CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AND A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE SECURITY ESTABLISHED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INCLUDE: SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE ISSUER'S EARNINGS PERFORMANCE, CREDIT RATING, ASSET QUALITY, BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE ISSUER OPERATES, LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW OUR COST, OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE SECURITY, OUR INTENT NOT TO SELL, AN EVALUATION AS TO WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO SELL BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR COST BASIS, AND ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ISSUER'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD DIFFER FROM OUR ASSESSMENT. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES: ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN CURRENT EARNINGS OR OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), DEPENDING ON WHETHER A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION AND, IF IT IS, THE TYPE OF HEDGING TRANSACTION. FOR A DERIVATIVE TO QUALIFY AS A HEDGE AT INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE HEDGED PERIOD, WE FORMALLY DOCUMENT THE NATURE AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEM. WE ASSESS, BOTH AT INCEPTION AND ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING TRANSACTIONS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING THE CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS. WE ASSESS HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND RECORD THE GAIN OR LOSS RELATED TO THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IF ANY, TO CURRENT EARNINGS. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER PROBABLE OF OCCURRING, WE DISCONTINUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING AND ANY RELATED UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE NOT DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION, TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES. THE USE OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE EXPOSURE OF THESE RISKS WITH THE INTENT TO REDUCE OUR RISK OR COST. WE DO NOT USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR SPECULATIVE TRADING PURPOSES AND ARE NOT A PARTY TO LEVERAGED DERIVATIVES. INVESTMENTS IN OTHER ENTITIES: WE HOLD A PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER EITHER THE EQUITY METHOD OR COST METHOD. INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES OR CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS OVER WHICH WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD, WITH OUR SHARE OF EARNINGS OR LOSSES REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. OUR COST METHOD AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT. IF AN INVESTMENT'S FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN ITS NET CARRYING VALUE AND THE DECLINE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE. SUCH AN EVALUATION IS 78 TABLE OF CONTENTS JUDGMENTAL AND DEPENDENT ON SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE HAS OCCURRED INCLUDE: MARKET VALUE OR EXIT PRICE OF THE INVESTMENT BASED ON EITHER MARKET-QUOTED PRICES OR FUTURE ROUNDS OF FINANCING BY THE INVESTEE; LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE MARKET VALUE WAS BELOW ITS COST BASIS; FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE INVESTEE; OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT; ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INVESTEE'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN; AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE MAY BE AWARE OF RELATED TO THE INVESTMENT. ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, OR LTIP, DESIGNED TO PROVIDE KEY OFFICERS AND EXECUTIVES WITH PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES CONTINGENT UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED CORPORATE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES COVERING A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE SEPARATE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLES RUNNING CONCURRENTLY ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2014 AND 2015. PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THE PERFORMANCE CYCLE ENDING IN 2013 ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE THREE-YEAR CYCLE: 25% ON NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE; 25% ON NON-GAAP NET INCOME; AND 50% ON TOTAL NON-GAAP REVENUE, AS DEFINED. THE PERFORMANCE CYCLES ENDING IN 2014 AND 2015 ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS: 37.5% ON NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE; 37.5% ON TOTAL NON-GAAP REVENUE, AS DEFINED; AND 25% ON RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, WHICH IS A MEASUREMENT OF OUR STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR COMPARED WITH A GROUP OF OTHER COMPANIES IN THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. PAYOUTS MAY BE IN THE RANGE OF 0% TO 200% OF THE PARTICIPANT'S SALARY FOR THE LTIPS. SUCH AWARDS ARE PAYABLE IN CASH OR COMMON STOCK OR A MIXTURE OF CASH AND COMMON STOCK, WHICH WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AT THE TIME OF AWARD DELIVERY. FOR AWARDS PAYABLE IN COMMON STOCK, THE NUMBER OF SHARES IS DETERMINED USING THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE FOR THE 30 TRADING DAYS PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CYCLE. PAYMENTS MADE IN COMMON STOCK ARE RESTRICTED FROM TRADING FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS. WE ACCRUE THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE LIABILITY OVER EACH THREE-YEAR CYCLE. PRIOR TO THE END OF A THREE-YEAR CYCLE, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT DURING THE CYCLE. UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT EQUAL TO THEIR TARGET AWARD OR, IF HIGHER, AN AWARD BASED ON ACTUAL PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL. ACCRUALS RECORDED FOR THE LTIP ENTAIL MAKING CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE, NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND NON-GAAP REVENUES, AS DEFINED; THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED. ACCRUALS FOR THE LTIP ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND REVISED ACCORDINGLY SO THAT THE LIABILITY RECORDED REFLECTS UPDATED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PAYOUTS. IN ESTIMATING THE ACCRUALS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DATE FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, EXPECTED RESULTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, OPERATING TRENDS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICING AND COMPETITION. VALUATION OF GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IPR&D: WE HAVE RECORDED GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IPR&D PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ACQUISITIONS OF PHARMION, GLOUCESTER, ABRAXIS AND AVILA. WHEN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, ARE ACQUIRED, WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS ARE TYPICALLY USED IN THESE VALUATIONS IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES 79 TABLE OF CONTENTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, AND THE MODELS REQUIRE THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: PROJECTING REGULATORY APPROVALS, ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM PRODUCT SALES RESULTING FROM COMPLETED PRODUCTS AND IN-PROCESS PROJECTS AND DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES AND PROBABILITY RATES GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. WE TEST OUR GOODWILL ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT EACH NOVEMBER 30. WE ARE ORGANIZED AS A SINGLE REPORTING UNIT AND THEREFORE THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS DONE USING OUR OVERALL MARKET VALUE, AS DETERMINED BY OUR TRADED SHARE PRICE, AS COMPARED TO OUR BOOK VALUE OF NET ASSETS. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE AMORTIZED TO THEIR ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR. INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO IPR&D PRODUCT RIGHTS ARE TREATED AS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND NOT AMORTIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS APPROVED FOR SALE BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN SPECIFIED MARKETS. AT THAT TIME, WE WILL DETERMINE THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET, RECLASSIFY THE ASSET OUT OF IPR&D AND BEGIN AMORTIZATION. IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS ALSO PERFORMED AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. SUCH TEST ENTAILS COMPLETING AN UPDATED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET. OUR EXISTING IPR&D PRODUCT RIGHTS WERE OBTAINED IN THE ACQUISITIONS OF GLOUCESTER AND AVILA. THE GLOUCESTER RELATED PRODUCT RIGHTS WILL BECOME DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES WHEN MARKETING APPROVAL IS RECEIVED FOR ISTODAX® FOR TREATMENT OF PTCL IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE AVILA RELATED PRODUCT RIGHTS WILL BECOME DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES WHEN MARKETING APPROVAL IS RECEIVED FOR CC-292 FOR ANY INDICATION IN ANY MAJOR MARKET. VALUATION OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION: WE RECORD CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION AT ITS FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE, AND FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT REPORTING PERIOD REVALUE THESE OBLIGATIONS AND RECORD INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPERATING EARNINGS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. CHANGES TO CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION OBLIGATIONS CAN RESULT FROM MOVEMENTS IN PUBLICLY TRADED SHARE PRICES OF CVRS, ADJUSTMENTS TO DISCOUNT RATES AND PERIODS, UPDATES IN THE ASSUMED ACHIEVEMENT OR TIMING OF ANY DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES OR CHANGES IN THE PROBABILITY OF CERTAIN CLINICAL EVENTS AND CHANGES IN THE ASSUMED PROBABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATORY APPROVAL. THE ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT AND ANY CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION EXPENSE RECORDED IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. OUR CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES WERE ACQUIRED IN THE ACQUISITIONS OF GLOUCESTER, ABRAXIS, AND AVILA. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE GLOUCESTER AND AVILA CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE DISCOUNT RATE, PROBABILITY AND ESTIMATED TIMING OF CASH MILESTONE PAYMENTS TO THE FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OR EACH COMPANY. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ABRAXIS 80 TABLE OF CONTENTS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY IS BASED ON THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES FORWARD-LOOKING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RISK OF LOSS IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES, CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE EARNINGS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, OUR MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS CONSISTED OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, OUR LONG-TERM DEBT AND CERTAIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS.

THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. 81 TABLE OF CONTENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, FAIR VALUES AND RELATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS): LONG-TERM DEBT: IN AUGUST 2012, WE ISSUED A TOTAL OF $1.500 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 1.90% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2017AND $1.000 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.25% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2022. THE 2012 ISSUED NOTES WERE ISSUED AT 99.786% AND 99.949% OF PAR, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE DISCOUNT IS BEING AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. OFFERING COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $11.7 MILLION HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY.

THE NOTES MAY BE REDEEMED AT OUR OPTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT ANY TIME AT A REDEMPTION PRICE DEFINED IN A MAKE-WHOLE CLAUSE EQUALING ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST PLUS THE GREATER OF 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES TO BE REDEEMED OR THE SUM OF THE PRESENT VALUES OF THE REMAINING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL DISCOUNTED TO THE DATE OF REDEMPTION ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS PLUS 20 BASIS POINTS IN THE CASE OF THE 2017 NOTES AND 25 BASIS POINTS IN THE CASE OF THE 2022 NOTES. IF A CHANGE OF CONTROL OCCURS ACCOMPANIED BY A DOWNGRADE OF THE DEBT TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO OFFER TO REPURCHASE THE NOTES AT A PURCHASE PRICE EQUAL TO 101% OF THEIR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST. WE ARE SUBJECT TO COVENANTS WHICH LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PLEDGE PROPERTIES AS SECURITY UNDER BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING OUR PROPERTY. ON OCTOBER 7, 2010, WE ISSUED A TOTAL OF $1.250 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2.45% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2015, $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.95% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2020 AND $250.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 5.7% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2040.

IF WE EXPERIENCE A CHANGE OF CONTROL ACCOMPANIED BY A DOWNGRADE OF THE DEBT TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO OFFER TO REPURCHASE THE NOTES AT A PURCHASE PRICE EQUAL TO 101% OF THEIR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID 82 TABLE OF CONTENTS INTEREST. WE ARE SUBJECT TO COVENANTS WHICH LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PLEDGE PROPERTIES AS SECURITY UNDER BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING OUR PROPERTY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SENIOR NOTES OUTSTANDING WAS $2.893 BILLION. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT OUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN BE IMPACTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES. WE MANAGE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE AND INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS THROUGH OPERATIONAL MEANS AND THROUGH THE USE OF VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS, FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED REVENUE HEDGING AND BALANCE SHEET RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO MITIGATE VOLATILITY IN FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS AND CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE CAUSED BY VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. THROUGH OUR REVENUE HEDGING PROGRAM, WE ENDEAVOR TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF POSSIBLE UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON OUR FUTURE U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS THAT ARE DERIVED FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, TYPICALLY NO MORE THAN THREE YEARS INTO THE FUTURE. WE MANAGE OUR ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION EXPOSURE PRINCIPALLY WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND OCCASIONALLY FOREIGN CURRENCY PUT AND CALL OPTIONS. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS: WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PROTECT AGAINST CHANGES IN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011 HAD SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 36 MONTHS. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AND, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THEM ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), OR OCI, AND RECLASSIFIED TO OPERATIONS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT OPERATIONS. ANY INEFFECTIVENESS ON THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IS REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME 83 TABLE OF CONTENTS (EXPENSE), NET. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES WERE AS FOLLOWS AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011: WE CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF OUR OWN AND THE COUNTERPARTIES' CREDIT RISK ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO EXECUTE ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONTRACT ON AN ONGOING BASIS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, CREDIT RISK DID NOT MATERIALLY CHANGE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS. WE ALSO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN RECOGNIZED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND, ACCORDINGLY, ANY CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD NON-DESIGNATED HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011 WERE $795.4 MILLION AND $916.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, WE BELIEVE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS A REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES. ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2012 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WOULD CHANGE BY APPROXIMATELY $227.9 MILLION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS EITHER HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES OR RELATE TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE ENTITIES' FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE EITHER REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS OR RE-MEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR LIABILITY FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS: DURING 2012, WE BEGAN HEDGING A PORTION OF OUR FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE BY UTILIZING A STRATEGY THAT INVOLVES BOTH A PURCHASED LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTION AND A WRITTEN LOCAL CURRENCY CALL OPTION THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS HEDGES OF FUTURE SALES DENOMINATED IN EUROS. SPECIFICALLY, WE SELL (OR WRITE) A LOCAL CURRENCY CALL OPTION AND PURCHASE A LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTION WITH THE SAME EXPIRATION DATES AND AMOUNTS BUT WITH DIFFERENT STRIKE PRICES; THIS COMBINATION OF TRANSACTIONS IS GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS A "COLLAR". THE EXPIRATION DATES AND NOTIONAL AMOUNTS CORRESPOND TO THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF FORECASTED FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY SALES. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS RELATIVE TO THE CURRENCY OF THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED SALES, THE PURCHASED PUT OPTION VALUE REDUCES TO ZERO AND WE BENEFIT FROM THE INCREASE IN THE U.S. DOLLAR 84 TABLE OF CONTENTS EQUIVALENT VALUE OF OUR ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS, HOWEVER THIS BENEFIT WOULD BE CAPPED AT THE STRIKE LEVEL OF THE WRITTEN CALL, WHICH FORMS THE UPPER END OF THE COLLAR. THE PREMIUM COLLECTED FROM THE CALL OPTION PARTIALLY OFFSETS THE PREMIUM PAID FOR THE PURCHASED PUT OPTION, RESULTING IN A NET COST FOR THE COLLARS. IN ORDER TO FULLY OFFSET THE NET COST OF THE COLLARS, WE ALSO SOLD LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTIONS WITH A LOWER STRIKE PRICE AND THE SAME EXPIRATION DATES AND AMOUNTS AS THE OPTION CONTRACTS THAT WERE USED TO HEDGE SALES. THESE WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS INTRODUCED RISK OF LOSS IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WERE TO STRENGTHEN BEYOND THE STRIKE PRICE OF THE WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS. IN DECEMBER 2012, WE ENTERED INTO PURCHASED PUT OPTIONS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES IN ORDER TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE RISK OF LOSS THAT WOULD BE INCURRED ON THE WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS IF THE US DOLLAR WERE TO STRENGTHEN BEYOND THE STRIKE PRICE OF THE WRITTEN PUT. GAINS AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE NON-HEDGE PUT OPTIONS HAVE BEEN RECORDED ON THE INCOME STATEMENT AS OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES WERE AS FOLLOWS AT DECEMBER 31, 2012: FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION NOTIONAL AMOUNT* 2012 DESIGNATED AS HEDGING ACTIVITY: PURCHASED PUT $ 228,779 WRITTEN CALL $ 235,920 NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING ACTIVITY: PURCHASED PUT $ 160,493 WRITTEN PUT $ (215,952 ) *U.S. DOLLAR NOTIONAL AMOUNTS ARE CALCULATED AS THE HEDGED LOCAL CURRENCY AMOUNT MULTIPLIED TIMES THE STRIKE VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION. THE LOCAL CURRENCY NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF OUR PURCHASED PUT, AND WRITTEN CALL THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING ACTIVITY ARE EQUAL TO EACH OTHER. ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, WE BELIEVE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS A REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES. ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2012 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGES WOULD CHANGE BY APPROXIMATELY $24.1 MILLION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS HEDGES HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE EITHER REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS OR RE-MEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR LIABILITY. ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2012 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES WOULD DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $0.9 MILLION IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WERE TO STRENGTHEN, AND WOULD INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $2.2 MILLION IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WERE TO WEAKEN. THIS IMPACT WOULD BE RECORDED TO INCOME DURING THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE CHANGE IN CURRENCY RATES OCCURRED. 85 TABLE OF CONTENTS INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS: DURING 2012, WE ENTERED INTO TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS, OR TREASURY RATE LOCKS, IN ANTICIPATION OF ISSUING FIXED-RATE NOTES THAT WERE ISSUED IN AUGUST 2012. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SHORT PERIOD IN JUNE WHEN CERTAIN OUTSTANDING TREASURY RATE LOCKS WERE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES, OUR TREASURY RATE LOCKS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AND, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, ANY REALIZED OR UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THEM ARE REPORTED IN OCI AND WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME OVER THE LIFE OF THE ANTICIPATED FIXED-RATE NOTES. TREASURY RATE LOCKS WERE SETTLED DURING 2012 WHICH RESULTED IN LOSSES OF $35.3 MILLION THAT WERE RECORDED TO OCI. DURING THE SHORT PERIOD IN JUNE WHEN WE HAD OUTSTANDING TREASURY RATE LOCKS THAT WERE NOT CONSIDERED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, WE RECORDED THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF $3.7 MILLION IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. NO MATERIAL AMOUNTS WERE RECORDED IN INCOME DURING 2012 OR 2011 AS A RESULT OF HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS OR HEDGE COMPONENTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING TREASURY RATE LOCKS. INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS: FROM TIME TO TIME WE HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN DEBT OBLIGATIONS THROUGH THE USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. THE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED HEDGES OF THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE NOTES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. SINCE THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE SWAP ARE INTENDED TO MATCH THOSE OF THE DEBT BEING HEDGED, IT IS ASSUMED TO BE A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE HEDGE AND ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAPS ARE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WITH NO NET IMPACT RECORDED IN INCOME. ANY NET INTEREST PAYMENTS MADE OR RECEIVED ON INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST EXPENSE. IN 2011, WE SETTLED OUTSTANDING INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS WE ENTERED INTO WITH RESPECT TO OUR $500.0 MILLION 2.45% FIXED NOTES DUE IN 2015 RESULTING IN THE RECEIPT OF $34.3 MILLION. THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SETTLEMENTS ARE BEING ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE NOTES. DURING 2012, WE TERMINATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP ON $800.0 MILLION NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF SWAP CONTRACTS THAT HAD BEEN ENTERED INTO EARLIER IN 2012 AS HEDGES OF OUR 1.9% FIXED RATE NOTES DUE IN 2017 AND OUR 3.25% FIXED RATE NOTES DUE IN 2022 BY SETTLING CERTAIN OF THE CONTRACTS AND ENTERING INTO OFFSETTING CONTRACTS FOR THOSE NOT SETTLED. THIS RESULTED IN GAINS OF $5.0 MILLION THAT ARE BEING ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE NOTES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, WE WERE A PARTY TO PAY-FLOATING, RECEIVE-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE NOTES IN WHICH THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS MATCH THE AMOUNT OF THE HEDGED FIXED-RATE NOTES. OUR SWAP CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 CONSISTED OF $100.0 MILLION AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT MATURING IN 2017, WHICH EFFECTIVELY CONVERT A PORTION OF OUR $500.0 MILLION, 1.90% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE IN 2017 TO A FLOATING RATE AND $200.0 MILLION AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT MATURING IN 2022, WHICH EFFECTIVELY CONVERTS A PORTION OF OUR $1.000 BILLION, 3.25% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE IN 2022 TO A FLOATING RATE. IN JANUARY 2013 WE ENTERED INTO ADDITIONAL INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $400.0 MILLION RELATED TO OUR 1.90% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE IN 2017 AND $800.0 MILLION RELATED TO OUR 3.25% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE IN 2022. A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO MEASURE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR DEBT AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS FROM A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES INDICATED THAT A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET PAYABLE BY $169.3 MILLION. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET PAYABLE BY $188.7 MILLION. 86 TABLE OF CONTENTS ITEM 7.

IT IS APPROVED FOR THE TREATMENT OF METASTATIC BREAST CANCER IN THE UNITED STATES AND MANY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND FOR THE TREATMENT OF NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER IN THE UNITED STATES. IN JANUARY 2013, WE ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS FROM A PHASE III TRIAL FOR ABRAXANE® IN 51 TABLE OF CONTENTS COMBINATION WITH GEMCITABINE IN TREATMENT-NAÏVE PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC PANCREATIC CANCER. THE ABRAXANE® COMBINATION DEMONSTRATED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN OVERALL SURVIVAL COMPARED TO PATIENTS RECEIVING GEMCITABINE ALONE. BASED ON THESE RESULTS, WE PLAN TO SUBMIT DOSSIERS FOR REGISTRATION IN THE U.S. AND EUROPE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2013 FOLLOWED BY SUBMISSIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND REGIONS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2013.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES TOTAL REVENUE AND EARNINGS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA): REVENUE INCREASED BY $664.6 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CONTINUED GROWTH IN SALES OF REVLIMID®, VIDAZA® AND ABRAXANE® IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE $138.0 MILLION INCREASE IN NET INCOME AND $0.45 INCREASE IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 REFLECTED A HIGHER LEVEL OF NET PRODUCT SALES, REDUCTION IN AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PRIMARILY DUE TO CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOMING FULLY AMORTIZED AT THE END OF 2011, AND A DECREASE IN COST OF GOODS SOLD RESULTING FROM THE 2011 INCLUSION OF INVENTORY STEP-UP AMORTIZATION FOR SALES OF ABRAXANE®. THESE FAVORABLE ITEMS WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LIABILITY RELATED TO PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS THAT WERE ISSUED AS PART OF THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS, INCREASE IN PAYMENTS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS AND INCREASE IN MARKETING ACTIVITY, PRIMARILY RELATED TO PRELAUNCH EXPENSES FOR POMALYST® AND ABRAXANE® FOR NEW INDICATIONS. 53 TABLE OF CONTENTS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 TOTAL REVENUE: TOTAL REVENUE AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA): TOTAL REVENUE INCREASED BY $664.6 MILLION, OR 13.7%, TO $5.507 BILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011, REFLECTING INCREASES OF $309.1 MILLION, OR 10.8%, IN THE UNITED STATES, AND $355.5 MILLION, OR 17.9%, IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

NET PRODUCT SALES: TOTAL NET PRODUCT SALES FOR 2012 INCREASED BY $685.9 MILLION, OR 14.6%, TO $5.386 BILLION COMPARED TO 2011. THE INCREASE WAS COMPRISED OF NET VOLUME INCREASES OF $559.1 MILLION AND PRICE INCREASES OF $162.2 MILLION, PARTLY OFFSET BY AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN EXCHANGE OF $35.4 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN PRICE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO PRICE INCREASES ON REVLIMID®, VIDAZA® AND THALOMID® IN THE U.S. MARKET. TOTAL NET PRODUCT SALES FOR 2011 INCREASED BY $1.191 BILLION, OR 34.0%, TO $4.7 BILLION COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE WAS COMPRISED OF NET VOLUME INCREASES OF $1.157 BILLION, PRICE DECREASES OF $4.9 MILLION AND A FAVORABLE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN EXCHANGE OF $38.7 MILLION. THE DECREASE IN PRICES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP REBATES RESULTING FROM THE HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT AND AN INCREASE IN REBATES TO U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTS RESULTING FROM THEIR ATTEMPTS TO REDUCE HEALTH CARE COSTS, PARTLY OFFSET BY PRODUCT PRICE INCREASES. REVLIMID® NET SALES INCREASED BY $558.5 MILLION, OR 17.4%, TO $3.767 BILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED UNIT SALES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. INCREASES IN MARKET PENETRATION, TREATMENT DURATION OF PATIENTS USING REVLIMID® IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND 54 TABLE OF CONTENTS PRICE CONTRIBUTED TO U.S. GROWTH.

NET SALES OF REVLIMID® INCREASED BY $739.0 MILLION, OR 29.9%, TO $3.208 BILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED UNIT SALES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. INCREASED TREATMENT DURATION OF PATIENTS USING REVLIMID® IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND AN INCREASE IN MARKET PENETRATION CONTRIBUTED TO U.S. GROWTH. THE GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS REFLECTS THE EXPANSION OF OUR COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES IN ADDITION TO PRODUCT REIMBURSEMENT APPROVALS AND THE LAUNCH OF REVLIMID® IN JAPAN IN THE LATTER PART OF 2010. VIDAZA® NET SALES INCREASED BY $117.9 MILLION, OR 16.7%, TO $823.2 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011, REFLECTING INCREASES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE U.S. GROWTH REFLECTS AN INCREASE IN VOLUME AND PRICE. THE GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS WAS PARTLY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN TREATMENT DURATION OF PATIENTS USING VIDAZA® AND LAUNCHES OF VIDAZA® IN NEW MARKETS, INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM AND JAPAN. VIDAZA® RETAINS ORPHAN DRUG EXCLUSIVITY IN EUROPE THROUGH THE END OF 2018 AND IN JAPAN UNTIL JANUARY 2021. NET SALES OF VIDAZA® INCREASED BY $171.0 MILLION, OR 32.0%, TO $705.3 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, WITH SALES INCREASES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

THE GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN TREATMENT DURATION OF PATIENTS USING VIDAZA® AND PRODUCT LAUNCHES IN MULTIPLE MARKETS, INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM AND JAPAN. ABRAXANE® NET SALES INCREASED BY $40.8 MILLION, OR 10.6%, TO $426.7 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED UNIT VOLUMES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, REFLECTING INCREASED ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRODUCT IN THE TREATMENT OF METASTATIC BREAST CANCER AND THE OCTOBER 2012 APPROVAL FOR NSCLC. NET SALES OF ABRAXANE® INCREASED BY $314.5 MILLION TO $385.9 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF A FULL YEAR OF SALES IN 2011 COMPARED TO THE 2.5 MONTH PERIOD IN 2010 SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS. THALOMID® NET SALES DECREASED BY $36.9 MILLION, OR 10.9%, TO $302.1 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER UNIT VOLUMES IN THE UNITED STATES, PARTLY RESULTING FROM THE INCREASED USE OF REVLIMID®, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PRICE AND LOWER GROSS TO NET ADJUSTMENTS. NET SALES OF THALOMID® DECREASED BY $50.5 MILLION, OR 13.0%, TO $339.1 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER UNIT VOLUMES IN THE UNITED STATES. ISTODAX® NET SALES INCREASED BY $19.1 MILLION, OR 61.7%, TO $50.0 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED UNIT SALES IN THE TREATMENT OF CTCL AND THE JUNE 2011 FDA APPROVAL OF ISTODAX® FOR THE TREATMENT OF PTCL IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY.

THE "OTHER" NET PRODUCT SALES CATEGORY DECREASED BY $13.4 MILLION, OR 44.1%, TO $17.0 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE APRIL 2011 SALE OF ABRAXIS NON-CORE ASSETS, RESULTING IN THE ELIMINATION OF FUTURE ABRAXIS NON-CORE PRODUCT SALES. SALES OF ABRAXIS NON-CORE PRODUCTS TOTALED $21.3 MILLION IN 2011. "OTHER" NET PRODUCT SALES IN 2011 PRIMARILY INCLUDED $21.3 MILLION IN ABRAXIS NON-CORE PRODUCT SALES, $5.4 MILLION IN SALES OF NON-CORE PHARMION PRODUCTS TO BE EXITED AND $1.3 MILLION IN SALES OF FOCALIN®. COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER REVENUE: REVENUE FROM COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER SOURCES DECREASED BY $8.8 MILLION TO $10.7 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $6.3 MILLION MILESTONE PAYMENT RECEIVED IN 2011 RELATED TO VIDAZA® AND A $2.4 MILLION REDUCTION IN CERTAIN MANUFACTURING AND MANAGEMENT FEES RECEIVED IN 2012. REVENUE FROM COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER SOURCES INCREASED BY $9.0 MILLION TO $19.5 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $6.3 MILLION MILESTONE PAYMENT RECEIVED IN FEBRUARY 2011 RELATED TO THE APPROVAL OF VIDAZA® IN JAPAN AND A $2.2 MILLION INCREASE IN CERTAIN MANUFACTURING AND MANAGEMENT FEES RECEIVED IN 2011. ROYALTY REVENUE: ROYALTY REVENUE DECREASED BY $12.5 MILLION TO $110.4 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED ROYALTIES EARNED FROM NOVARTIS BASED UPON ITS SALES OF RITALIN®, WHICH WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY GENERIC COMPETITION IN CERTAIN MARKETS, PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ROYALTIES FROM SALES OF FOCALIN XR®. ROYALTY REVENUE INCREASED BY $16.1 MILLION TO $122.9 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN ROYALTIES EARNED FROM NOVARTIS BASED UPON ITS SALES OF FOCALIN XR® AND THE ENTIRE RITALIN® FAMILY OF DRUGS. THE INCREASE WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN RESIDUAL PAYMENTS EARNED BY US FROM THE ALKERAN® REVENUES OF GLAXOSMITHKLINE PLC, OR GSK. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES, SALES DISCOUNTS, GOVERNMENT REBATES, AND CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES UNDER THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF REVLIMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES' SPECIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE FOR THE PRODUCT'S SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER OUR PROPRIETARY "SYSTEM FOR THALIDOMIDE EDUCATION AND PRESCRIBING SAFETY," OR S.T.E.P.S.®, PROGRAM WHICH IS A COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION AND RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF PROVIDING FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. INTERNATIONALLY, THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER MANDATORY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO MEET LOCAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES' SPECIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE FOR THE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF THALOMID®. THESE PROGRAMS MAY VARY BY COUNTRY AND, 56 TABLE OF CONTENTS DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTRY AND THE DESIGN OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, THE PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD THROUGH HOSPITALS OR RETAIL PHARMACIES. VIDAZA®, ABRAXANE® AND ISTODAX® ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AS REVLIMID® AND THALOMID®. WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. AS NOTED ABOVE, REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY. THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT. SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF THE REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE HAVE ALSO ANALYZED ACTUAL BILLINGS RECEIVED FROM CERTAIN STATES TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE ACCRUAL RATES. SUBSEQUENT TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010, OR COLLECTIVELY THE 2010 U.S. HEALTH CARE REFORM LAW, CERTAIN STATES HAVE NOT YET SUBMITTED ACTUAL MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION BILLS, RESULTING IN AN INCREASING ACCRUAL BALANCE. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011, MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT'S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL INVOICES. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS INCURRED. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES. REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. 57 TABLE OF CONTENTS SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE PROVIDE A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY. CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA. SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BELOW FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS AND THE BALANCE IN THE RELATED ALLOWANCE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS): 58 TABLE OF CONTENTS A COMPARISON OF PROVISIONS FOR ALLOWANCES FOR SALES WITHIN EACH OF THE FOUR CATEGORIES NOTED ABOVE FOR 2012 AND 2011 FOLLOWS: 2012 COMPARED TO 2011: RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES DECREASED BY $9.3 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REVERSAL OF APPROXIMATELY $7.5 MILLION IN RESERVES ESTABLISHED FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS WITH QUALITY ISSUES WHICH WERE RESOLVED IN 2012 AND LOWER RETURNS EXPERIENCE ON ALL PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $7.6 MILLION INCREASE IN THE RETURNS ALLOWANCE RELATED TO INCREASED LEVELS OF VIDAZA® INVENTORY HELD BY DISTRIBUTORS AT THE END OF 2012. DISCOUNTS INCREASED BY $8.8 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUE INCREASES IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, BOTH OF WHICH OFFER DIFFERENT DISCOUNT PROGRAMS, AND EXPANSION INTO NEW INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THESE AMOUNTS WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY REBATES RELATED TO VIDAZA® SALES IN THE JAPANESE MARKET BEING INCLUDED IN THE CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES CATEGORY IN 2012. GOVERNMENT REBATES INCREASED BY $8.7 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $15.8 MILLION IN REBATES RELATED TO VARIOUS U.S. PROGRAMS, PARTLY OFFSET BY A $7.0 MILLION DECREASE IN REBATES IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE U.S. PROGRAMS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO VOLUME INCREASES AND THE REFINEMENT OF ACCRUAL RATES FOR MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS AND MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. THE DECREASE IN GOVERNMENT REBATES OF $7.0 MILLION IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE REFINEMENT OF SELECT GOVERNMENT REBATES DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2012. CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES INCREASED BY $16.3 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. CHARGEBACKS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $2.8 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES VOLUMES.

THE INCREASES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY A $4.1 MILLION DECREASE IN TRICARE REBATES, REFLECTING LOWER UTILIZATION OF THALOMID®. 2011 COMPARED TO 2010: RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES INCREASED BY $10.3 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $7.7 MILLION RELATED TO PROVISIONS FOR PRODUCTS WITH QUALITY ISSUES FROM CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS. DISCOUNTS INCREASED BY $3.1 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUE INCREASES IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, BOTH OF WHICH OFFER DISCOUNT PROGRAMS, AND EXPANSION INTO NEW INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. GOVERNMENT REBATES INCREASED BY $69.0 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $52.5 MILLION IN REBATE RATES IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND $23.9 MILLION IN INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP, PARTLY OFFSET BY A $5.4 MILLION BENEFIT RELATED TO A REFINEMENT OF PRIOR YEAR ESTIMATES FOR MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES INCREASED BY $70.2 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. CHARGEBACKS INCREASED BY $33.3 MILLION, INCLUDING $23.2 MILLION RELATED TO THE INCLUSION OF ABRAXANE® SALES IN 2011 AND $8.8 MILLION RELATED TO SALES OF VIDAZA®, WHICH INCLUDED 59 TABLE OF CONTENTS $2.1 MILLION RELATED TO DISPUTED CLAIMS FROM 2010. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES INCREASED BY $36.9 MILLION, INCLUDING $22.8 MILLION IN SERVICE FEES PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SALES OF ABRAXANE®, $7.8 MILLION IN REBATES RELATED TO THE LAUNCH OF VIDAZA® IN JAPAN AND A $3.6 MILLION INCREASE IN TRICARE REBATES. COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS): COST OF GOODS SOLD AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS): COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS): COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS) DECREASED BY $126.7 MILLION TO $299.1 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 2011 INCLUSION OF THE FOLLOWING ITEMS: A $90.3 MILLION INVENTORY STEP-UP AMORTIZATION ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO SALES OF ABRAXANE®, AN AGGREGATE $13.2 MILLION IN COSTS RELATED TO THE SALE OF NON-CORE ABRAXIS PRODUCTS WHICH WERE DIVESTED IN APRIL 2011, $8.6 MILLION IN HIGHER COSTS RELATED TO FORMER PHARMION PRODUCTS TO BE EXITED AND A $15.3 MILLION HIGHER ALLOCATION OF PREPAID ROYALTIES RELATED TO SALES OF VIDAZA®. THESE ITEMS WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN 2012 PRODUCT MATERIAL COSTS RESULTING FROM A HIGHER LEVEL OF SALES ACTIVITY. AS A PERCENT OF NET PRODUCT SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS) DECREASED TO 5.6% IN 2012 COMPARED TO 9.1% IN 2011. EXCLUDING THE INVENTORY STEP-UP AMORTIZATION FOR ABRAXANE®, THE COST OF GOODS SOLD RATIO IN 2011 WAS 7.1%. THE COST OF GOODS SOLD RATIO IN 2012 WAS FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY 0.3% FROM A REDUCTION IN PREPAID ROYALTIES EXPENSED IN 2012 RELATED TO SALES OF VIDAZA® AND LOWER COST PRODUCTS, SUCH AS REVLIMID®, COMPRISING A LARGER PORTION OF TOTAL NET SALES. COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS) INCREASED BY $119.3 MILLION TO $425.9 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCLUSION IN 2011 OF A $90.3 MILLION INVENTORY STEP-UP AMORTIZATION ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO SALES OF ABRAXANE® SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS COMPARED TO A $34.7 MILLION STEP-UP AMORTIZATION ADJUSTMENT INCLUDED IN 2010. THE REMAINDER OF THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN MATERIAL COSTS RESULTING FROM A HIGHER LEVEL OF SALES ACTIVITY. AS A PERCENT OF NET PRODUCT SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS) INCREASED TO 9.1% IN 2011 COMPARED TO 8.7% IN 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INVENTORY STEP-UP AMORTIZATION ADJUSTMENT FOR ABRAXANE®. EXCLUDING THE STEP-UP AMORTIZATION ADJUSTMENTS IN BOTH YEARS, THE COST OF GOODS SOLD RATIOS WERE 7.1% AND 7.7% IN 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED BY $471.8 MILLION TO $1.600 BILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE IN 2011 WAS PARTLY DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $230.1 MILLION RELATED TO THE ABRAXIS BUSINESS, INCLUDING A $118.0 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO THE IPR&D ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSET. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RESULTED FROM A CHANGE IN THE PROBABILITY OF OBTAINING PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL LABELING FOR THE TREATMENT OF NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER FOR ABRAXANE® IN THE UNITED STATES. THE REMAINDER OF THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT SPENDING IN SUPPORT OF MULTIPLE PROGRAMS ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF DISEASES, WITH LATE STAGE CLINICAL TRIALS COMPLETING ENROLLMENT DURING 2011. EXPENSES FOR 2011 ALSO INCLUDED $128.5 MILLION IN UPFRONT PAYMENTS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS, A $20.0 MILLION PAYMENT TO AGIOS FOR A ONE YEAR EXTENSION OF OUR COLLABORATION AGREEMENT AND $14.5 MILLION IN MILESTONE PAYMENTS.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY $275.7 MILLION TO $1.226 BILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, PARTLY DUE TO HIGHER MARKETING AND SALES-RELATED EXPENSES RESULTING FROM ONGOING PRODUCT LAUNCH ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING REVLIMID® IN JAPAN, PREPARATION FOR THE FILING AND LAUNCH OF REVLIMID® IN CHINA, ISTODAX® IN PTCL IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABRAXANE® IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE. IN ADDITION, 2011 INCLUDED AN INCREASE OF $72.1 MILLION IN EXPENSES RELATED TO THE ABRAXIS BUSINESS, RESULTING FROM A FULL YEAR'S EXPENSE BEING INCLUDED IN 2011. AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS: AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED AS A RESULT OF BUSINESS COMBINATIONS IS SUMMARIZED BELOW FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 (IN THOUSANDS): AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS DECREASED BY $94.7 MILLION TO $194.5 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 PRIMARILY DUE TO CERTAIN PHARMION INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOMING FULLY AMORTIZED AT THE END OF 2011, WHICH REDUCED AMORTIZATION EXPENSE BY $155.8 MILLION. THE DECREASE WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY INTANGIBLE ASSETS OBTAINED IN THE MARCH 2012 ACQUISITION OF AVILA, WHICH INCREASED AMORTIZATION EXPENSE BY $39.4 MILLION. IN ADDITION, THE JUNE 2011 FDA APPROVAL OF ISTODAX® FOR TREATMENT OF PTCL IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY AND THE OCTOBER 2012 APPROVAL OF ABRAXANE® IN THE U.S. FOR THE TREATMENT OF NSCLC RESULTED IN THE COMMENCEMENT OF AMORTIZATION OF THE RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THE APPROVAL OF ABRAXANE® INCREASED AMORTIZATION EXPENSE BY $16.3 MILLION AND IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN ANNUAL AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $78.0 MILLION OVER THE 15 YEAR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSOCIATED INTANGIBLE ASSET. 64 TABLE OF CONTENTS AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCREASED BY $86.0 MILLION TO $289.2 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A FULL YEAR'S AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS OBTAINED IN THE OCTOBER 2010 ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS BEING INCLUDED IN 2011. IN ADDITION, IN JUNE 2011, THE FDA APPROVED ISTODAX®, WHICH WAS OBTAINED IN THE JANUARY 2010 ACQUISITION OF GLOUCESTER, FOR TREATMENT OF PTCL IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY. AS A RESULT OF THE FDA APPROVAL, AMORTIZATION OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET COMMENCED WITH AN 8.8 YEAR EXPECTED USEFUL LIFE, INCREASING AMORTIZATION EXPENSE BY $17.8 MILLION. ACQUISITION RELATED (GAINS) CHARGES AND RESTRUCTURING, NET: ACQUISITION RELATED (GAINS) CHARGES AND RESTRUCTURING, NET WAS A NET CHARGE OF $169.0 MILLION IN 2012 AND A NET GAIN OF $142.3 MILLION IN 2011. THE NET INCREASE OF $311.3 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $368.3 MILLION CHANGE IN THE INCOME STATEMENT IMPACT RELATED TO OUR PUBLICLY TRADED CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS, OR CVRS. WE RECORDED A $216.8 MILLION CHARGE IN 2012 AND A $151.5 MILLION FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT IN 2011. IN ADDITION, WE RECORDED A $9.2 MILLION ACCRETION OF THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF AVILA. THE INCREASES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY A $63.6 MILLION REDUCTION IN THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY RELATED TO THE APPROVAL OF ISTODAX® FOR PTCL IN EUROPE. ACQUISITION RELATED (GAINS) CHARGES AND RESTRUCTURING, NET WAS A NET GAIN OF $142.3 MILLION IN 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO A $151.5 MILLION FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT TO THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LIABILITY RELATED TO OUR PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS. THE FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY $4.0 MILLION IN ACCRETION OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO U.S. AND EU APPROVAL OF ISTODAX® FOR TREATMENT OF PTCL AND $5.2 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ACQUISITION RELATED CHARGES. INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET: INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET IS SUMMARIZED BELOW FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS): INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET: INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET DECREASED BY $10.6 MILLION TO $15.3 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $3.7 MILLION REDUCTION IN INTEREST INCOME DUE TO LOWER OVERALL INTEREST RATES, A $5.1 MILLION NET DECREASE IN GAINS ON SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND A $1.9 MILLION NET INCREASE IN THE COST OF AMORTIZATION OF DISCOUNTS AND PREMIUMS RELATED TO MARKETABLE SECURITIES. INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET DECREASED BY $18.9 MILLION TO $25.9 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $14.2 MILLION REDUCTION IN INTEREST INCOME DUE TO LOWER OVERALL YIELDS, A $7.4 MILLION NET REDUCTION IN GAINS ON SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND A $0.3 MILLION DECREASE IN DIVIDEND INCOME, PARTLY OFFSET BY A $3.0 MILLION NET DECREASE IN THE AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND DISCOUNTS RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES. 65 TABLE OF CONTENTS INTEREST (EXPENSE): INTEREST (EXPENSE) IS SUMMARIZED BELOW FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS): INTEREST (EXPENSE) INCREASED BY $20.5 MILLION TO $63.2 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEREST AND FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ISSUANCE OF AN ADDITIONAL $1.500 BILLION IN SENIOR NOTES IN AUGUST 2012 AND AN INCREASE IN INTEREST ON COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS, WHICH WAS IN EFFECT FOR FULL YEAR 2012. INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED BY $30.1 MILLION TO $42.7 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $29.6 MILLION INCREASE IN INTEREST ACCRUED ON THE $1.250 BILLION IN SENIOR NOTES ISSUED IN OCTOBER 2010 AND TO THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER BEGINNING IN SEPTEMBER 2011. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET: OTHER INCOME, NET IS SUMMARIZED BELOW FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 (IN THOUSANDS): OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET WAS A NET EXPENSE OF $17.0 MILLION IN 2012 AND PRIMARILY INCLUDED $25.5 MILLION IN IMPAIRMENT LOSSES RELATED TO COST METHOD INVESTMENTS AND NET FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSSES/FORWARD POINT AMORTIZATION OF $8.4 MILLION, PARTLY OFFSET BY A $7.4 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES, NET GAINS OF $3.7 MILLION RELATED TO THE SHORT PERIOD IN JUNE 2012 WHEN CERTAIN TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS WERE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND A $3.7 MILLION ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GRANT FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY. INCLUDED IN 2011 WERE NET FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSSES/FORWARD POINT AMORTIZATION OF $10.9 MILLION AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT LOSSES OF $2.8 MILLION, PARTLY OFFSET BY A $2.9 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF NON-CORE ASSETS AND $3.6 MILLION IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GRANT PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY. INCOME TAX PROVISION: THE INCOME TAX PROVISION INCREASED BY $123.2 MILLION TO $225.3 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. THE FULL YEAR 2012 UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 13.5% REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS FOOTPRINT. THE INCREASE IN THE UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FROM 2011 REFLECTS A DECREASE IN TAX BENEFITS FROM CERTAIN ACQUISITION-RELATED ITEMS. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2012 WAS REDUCED BY 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS AS A RESULT OF DISCRETE ITEMS, INCLUDING TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF TAX EXAMINATIONS AND EXPIRATIONS OF STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES RECORDED ON CERTAIN UNREMITTED FOREIGN EARNINGS PREVIOUSLY TREATED AS PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN SUCH FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS AND TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO THE FILING OF OUR 2011 INCOME TAX RETURNS WITH CERTAIN ITEMS BEING LESS FAVORABLE THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED. THE U.S. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND WAS RETROACTIVELY REINSTATED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013. THE TAX BENEFIT OF OUR 2012 RESEARCH CREDIT WILL BE RECORDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013. THIS CHANGE IN TAX LAW DOES NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR INCOME TAX PROVISIONS. 66 TABLE OF CONTENTS THE INCOME TAX PROVISION DECREASED BY $30.4 MILLION TO $102.1 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE FULL YEAR 2011 UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 11.5% REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS FOOTPRINT, THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF A SHIFT IN EARNINGS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND LOWER TAX FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, AND TAX DEDUCTIONS RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITIONS. THE DECREASE IN THE UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ALSO REFLECTS BENEFITS FROM AN INCREASE IN ACQUISITION-RELATED CHARGES, INCLUDING AN IPR&D ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $118.0 MILLION AND A NON-TAXABLE GAIN FROM A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LIABILITY UNDER THE CVR AGREEMENT RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS OF $151.5 MILLION. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS REDUCED BY 4.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2011 AS A RESULT OF DISCRETE ITEMS WHICH INCLUDED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO A FOREIGN TAX CREDIT, A DECREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN ONGOING INCOME TAX AUDITS AND EXPIRATIONS OF STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS, AND A NET TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO CHANGES IN STATE TAX LAWS. THE INCOME TAX PROVISION FOR 2010 INCLUDED A FULL YEAR UNDERLYING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 15.9%. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS REDUCED BY 2.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2010 AS A RESULT OF DISCRETE ITEMS WHICH INCLUDED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO A SETTLEMENT OF A TAX EXAMINATION AND A REDUCTION IN A VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATED TO CERTAIN TAX CARRYFORWARDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN ONGOING INCOME TAX AUDITS. NET INCOME: NET INCOME AND PER COMMON SHARE AMOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 WERE AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA): THE $138.0 MILLION INCREASE IN NET INCOME AND $0.45 INCREASE IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 REFLECTED A HIGHER LEVEL OF NET PRODUCT SALES, REDUCTION IN AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY DUE TO CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOMING FULLY AMORTIZED AT THE END OF 2011 AND A DECREASE IN COST OF GOODS SOLD, RESULTING FROM THE 2011 INCLUSION OF INVENTORY STEP-UP AMORTIZATION FOR SALES OF ABRAXANE®. THESE FAVORABLE ITEMS WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LIABILITY RELATED TO PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS, AN INCREASE IN PAYMENTS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS AND INCREASE IN MARKETING ACTIVITY, PRIMARILY RELATED TO PRELAUNCH EXPENSES FOR POMALYST® AND ABRAXANE® FOR NEW INDICATIONS. EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE WERE ALSO FAVORABLY IMPACTED IN 2012 BY THE REPURCHASE OF 28.6 MILLION COMMON SHARES UNDER OUR COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, REDUCING OUR OUTSTANDING SHARE BASE. NET INCOME FOR 2011 REFLECTS THE EARNINGS IMPACT FROM HIGHER SALES OF REVLIMID®, VIDAZA® AND A FULL YEAR'S SALES OF ABRAXANE®. THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF HIGHER REVENUES WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SPENDING FOR NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, EXPANSION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO 67 TABLE OF CONTENTS ACQUISITIONS AND AN INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF SENIOR NOTES IN OCTOBER 2010. EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE WERE ALSO FAVORABLY IMPACTED IN 2011 BY THE REPURCHASE OF 38.3 MILLION COMMON SHARES UNDER OUR COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, REDUCING OUR OUTSTANDING SHARE BASE. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE COMPONENTS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 (IN THOUSANDS): (1)INCLUDES CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET OF ALLOWANCES, INVENTORY AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, LESS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES, INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES. WE RELY PRIMARILY ON POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AND BORROWINGS IN THE FORM OF LONG-TERM NOTES PAYABLE AND SHORT-TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER TO PROVIDE FOR OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. WE EXPECT CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR EXPENDITURES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TRIALS, COMMERCIALIZATION OF NEW PRODUCTS, INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND EXISTING SOURCES OF AND ACCESS TO FINANCING ARE ADEQUATE TO FUND OUR OPERATING NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AND OUR PLANS TO REPURCHASE STOCK OR PURSUE OTHER STRATEGIC BUSINESS INITIATIVES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, AND SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE HELD INTERNATIONALLY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, WE HELD APPROXIMATELY $2.700 BILLION OF THESE SHORT-TERM FUNDS IN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS. THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS HELD IN U.S. TAX JURISDICTIONS CAN FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND DUE TO OTHER REASONS, SUCH AS REPURCHASES OF OUR 68 TABLE OF CONTENTS COMMON STOCK AND BUSINESS-DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. AS PART OF OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY ASSESSMENTS, WE REGULARLY MONITOR THE MIX OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CASH FLOWS (BOTH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS). REPATRIATION OF OVERSEAS FUNDS CAN RESULT IN ADDITIONAL U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAX PAYMENTS. WE RECORD U.S. DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES FOR CERTAIN UNREMITTED EARNINGS, BUT WHEN AMOUNTS EARNED OVERSEAS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., NO ACCRUAL FOR U.S. TAXES IS PROVIDED. DURING 2012, WE CONCLUDED THAT APPROXIMATELY $900.0 MILLION OF OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS MAY NOT BE REQUIRED FOR USE IN OFFSHORE OPERATIONS AND MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR USE IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE EARNINGS ARE NO LONGER TREATED AS PERMANENTLY REINVESTED, AND ACCORDINGLY, WE RECORDED A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OF $316.5 MILLION FOR THE ESTIMATED U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAXES THAT MAY BE INCURRED SHOULD THESE EARNINGS BE REPATRIATED. THE REMAINING FOREIGN EARNINGS ARE UNREMITTED AND EXPECTED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. WE DO NOT RELY ON THESE UNREMITTED EARNINGS AS A SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR OUR DOMESTIC BUSINESS AS WE EXPECT TO HAVE SUFFICIENT CURRENT CASH RESOURCES COMBINED WITH FUTURE CASH FLOWS IN THE UNITED STATES TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC NEEDS. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM: OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED AN AGGREGATE $6.500 BILLION STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF WHICH WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $1.837 BILLION REMAINING FOR FUTURE SHARE REPURCHASES. DURING 2012, WE USED $2.044 BILLION FOR REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, MEASURED ON A SETTLEMENT DATE BASIS. COMPONENTS OF WORKING CAPITAL CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: WE INVEST OUR EXCESS CASH PRIMARILY IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS, U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND SUPRANATIONAL SECURITIES AND GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES. ALL LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND ALL INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE. WE DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. THE $1.252 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ISSUANCE OF $1.500 BILLION IN SENIOR NOTES IN AUGUST 2012 AND BY CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, PARTLY OFFSET BY $2.044 BILLION PAID UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, $352.2 MILLION PAID FOR THE ACQUISITION OF AVILA, AND A NET REPAYMENT OF $217.4 MILLION IN SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. FOR MORE INFORMATION RELATED TO THE FAIR VALUE AND VALUATION OF OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES, SEE NOTE 4 TO THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET INCREASED BY $15.0 MILLION TO $960.5 MILLION AT THE END OF 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. THE IMPACT OF INCREASED U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SALES OF 69 TABLE OF CONTENTS REVLIMID®, VIDAZA® AND ABRAXANE® WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY INCREASED COLLECTIONS IN CERTAIN MARKETS. SALES MADE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES TYPICALLY HAVE PAYMENT TERMS THAT ARE GREATER THAN 60 DAYS, THEREBY EXTENDING COLLECTION PERIODS BEYOND THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE EXPECT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE TO CONTINUE TO GROW AS OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES CONTINUE TO EXPAND. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES, THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS IN CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND ASSOCIATED IMPACTS ON THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OUR BUSINESS. OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL IN THESE MARKETS IS TYPICALLY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO PRINCIPALLY GOVERNMENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED HOSPITALS, WHICH IN TURN DIRECTLY DELIVER CRITICAL CARE TO PATIENTS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE USED TO TREAT LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES AND WE BELIEVE THIS BUSINESS MODEL ENABLES TIMELY DELIVERY AND ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS. MANY OF THE OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE RELATED TO GOVERNMENT-FUNDED HOSPITALS AND WE BELIEVE THE RECEIVABLE BALANCES ARE ULTIMATELY COLLECTIBLE. SIMILARLY, WE BELIEVE THAT FUTURE SALES TO THESE CUSTOMERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE COLLECTIBLE. THE CREDIT AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WITHIN SPAIN, ITALY, PORTUGAL AND GREECE, AS WELL AS INCREASING SALES LEVELS IN THOSE COUNTRIES HAVE RESULTED IN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN, AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES TO COLLECT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. OUR TOTAL NET RECEIVABLES IN SPAIN, ITALY AND PORTUGAL ARE COMPOSED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR CONTROLLED HOSPITALS AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND AMOUNTED TO $324.2 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO $396.1 MILLION IN 2011. APPROXIMATELY $51.9 MILLION OF THE $324.2 MILLION RECEIVABLE IN 2012 WAS GREATER THAN ONE YEAR PAST DUE. OUR EXPOSURE TO THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS IN GREECE IS LIMITED, AS WE DO NOT HAVE A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF RECEIVABLES IN GREECE. WE MAINTAIN TIMELY AND DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH HOSPITAL CUSTOMERS IN SPAIN, ITALY AND PORTUGAL REGARDING BOTH THE CURRENT AND PAST DUE RECEIVABLE BALANCES. WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS FROM THESE COUNTRIES, AND CLOSELY MONITOR THE PLANS FOR PAYMENT AT THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL. PAYMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS IN THESE COUNTRIES ARE NOT RECEIVED ON REGULAR INTERVALS AND SEVERAL MONTHS COULD ELAPSE BETWEEN SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS. THIS PAYMENT PATTERN WAS OBSERVED IN SPAIN EARLIER IN 2012, WHERE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF AGED RECEIVABLES WERE PAID IN LATE JUNE AND EARLY JULY 2012. WE ALSO REGULARLY REQUEST AND RECEIVE POSITIVE CONFIRMATION OF THE VALIDITY OF OUR RECEIVABLES FROM MOST OF THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES. WE HAVE THE OPTION TO PURSUE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST CERTAIN OF OUR CUSTOMERS. IN VIEW OF THE PROTRACTED TIMELINE ASSOCIATED WITH COLLECTING THE OUTSTANDING BALANCES THROUGH LEGAL ACTION AND THE CURRENT DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, IN MANY INSTANCES, WE DO NOT BELIEVE PURSUING LEGAL ACTION TO BE THE BEST APPROACH FOR ANY OF THE PARTIES INVOLVED. IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR SPAIN, ITALY, AND PORTUGAL, WE CONSIDERED THAT THE BALANCE OF PAST DUE RECEIVABLES IS RELATED TO SALES MADE TO GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR SUPPORTED CUSTOMERS. WE REGULARLY MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS IN EUROPE TO ASSESS WHETHER THE LEVEL OF RISK OF DEFAULT FOR ANY CUSTOMERS HAS INCREASED AND NOTE THE ONGOING EFFORTS BY THE EUROPEAN UNION, EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION AND INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND TO SUPPORT COUNTRIES WITH LARGE PUBLIC DEFICITS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT BALANCES. WE ALSO MONITOR THE EFFORTS OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES TO SUPPORT THEIR REGIONS WITH LARGE PUBLIC DEFICITS AND OUTSTANDING DEBT BALANCES. WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR WRITE-OFFS WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLECTION OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN THESE COUNTRIES AS A RESULT OF THEIR ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES AND WE DO NOT EXPECT TO HAVE WRITE-OFFS OR ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 70 TABLE OF CONTENTS INVENTORY: INVENTORY BALANCES INCREASED BY $69.9 MILLION TO $259.5 MILLION AT THE END OF 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN REVLIMID®, VIDAZA® AND ABRAXANE® INVENTORIES, ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER ANTICIPATED SALES LEVELS. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS: OTHER CURRENT ASSETS DECREASED BY $74.9 MILLION TO $320.2 MILLION AT THE END OF 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 PRIMARILY DUE TO A $64.1 MILLION DECREASE IN PREPAID TAXES AND A $60.0 MILLION DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN OTHER PREPAID ACCOUNTS. COMMERCIAL PAPER: IN SEPTEMBER 2011, WE ENTERED INTO A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, OR THE PROGRAM, UNDER WHICH WE ISSUE UNSECURED COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES, OR COMMERCIAL PAPER, ON A PRIVATE PLACEMENT BASIS UP TO A MAXIMUM AGGREGATE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING AT ANY TIME OF $1.000 BILLION, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH WILL BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE MATURITIES OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MAY VARY, BUT MAY NOT EXCEED 270 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ISSUE. THE COMMERCIAL PAPER IS SOLD UNDER CUSTOMARY TERMS TO A DEALER OR IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET AND IS ISSUED AT A DISCOUNT FROM PAR OR, ALTERNATIVELY, IS SOLD AT PAR AND BEARS VARYING INTEREST RATES ON A FIXED OR FLOATING BASIS. BORROWINGS UNDER THE PROGRAM ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, $308.5 MILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER WAS OUTSTANDING BEARING AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OF 0.5%. SENIOR UNSECURED CREDIT FACILITY: IN SEPTEMBER 2011, WE ENTERED INTO A SENIOR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, OR THE CREDIT FACILITY, PROVIDING FOR REVOLVING CREDIT IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $1.000 BILLION. SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT FACILITY (BUT IN NO EVENT MORE THAN ONE TIME PER ANNUM), UP TO A MAXIMUM AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $1.250 BILLION. THE CREDIT FACILITY HAS A FIVE-YEAR TERM AND AMOUNTS MAY BE BORROWED FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE CREDIT FACILITY SERVES AS BACKUP LIQUIDITY FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 THERE WAS NO OUTSTANDING BORROWING AGAINST THE CREDIT FACILITY. THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS INCLUDING CERTAIN CUSTOMARY FINANCIAL COVENANTS. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL DEBT COVENANTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES: ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES INCREASED BY $391.0 MILLION TO $1.353 BILLION AT THE END OF 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $277.4 MILLION RECLASSIFICATION OF THE LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS FROM NON-CURRENT TO CURRENT, A $51.5 MILLION INCREASE IN CLINICAL TRIAL ACCRUALS, A $17.4 MILLION INCREASE IN THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO THE JANUARY 2012 AVILA ACQUISITION AND A $16.6 MILLION INCREASE IN ACCRUED INTEREST. INCOME TAXES PAYABLE (CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT): INCOME TAXES PAYABLE DECREASED BY $446.5 MILLION TO $200.0 MILLION AT THE END OF 2012 COMPARED TO 2011, PRIMARILY FROM TAX PAYMENTS OF $469.6 MILLION, THE APPLICATION OF PREVIOUSLY REFUNDABLE PREPAID INCOME TAXES OF $11.4 MILLION, A TAX BENEFIT OF STOCK OPTIONS OF $43.4 MILLION, NET DEFERRED INTERCOMPANY CREDITS OF $50.3 MILLION OFFSET BY THE CURRENT PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES OF $125.1 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDES A BENEFIT RELATED TO TAX SETTLEMENTS OF $373.0 MILLION. 71 TABLE OF CONTENTS SENIOR NOTES: IN AUGUST 2012, WE ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL $1.500 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 1.90% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2017, OR THE 2017 NOTES, AND $1.000 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.25% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2022 (THE "2022 NOTES" AND, TOGETHER WITH THE 2017 NOTES, REFERRED TO HEREIN AS THE "2012 ISSUED NOTES"). THE 2012 ISSUED NOTES WERE ISSUED AT 99.786% AND 99.949% OF PAR, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE DISCOUNT IS BEING AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. OFFERING COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $11.7 MILLION HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. INTEREST ON THE NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON FEBRUARY 15 AND AUGUST 15 EACH YEAR BEGINNING FEBRUARY 15, 2013 AND THE PRINCIPAL ON EACH NOTE IS DUE IN FULL AT THEIR RESPECTIVE MATURITY DATES. THE NOTES MAY BE REDEEMED AT OUR OPTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT ANY TIME AT A REDEMPTION PRICE DEFINED IN A MAKE-WHOLE CLAUSE EQUALING ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST PLUS THE GREATER OF 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES TO BE REDEEMED OR THE SUM OF THE PRESENT VALUES OF THE REMAINING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL DISCOUNTED TO THE DATE OF REDEMPTION ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS PLUS 20 BASIS POINTS IN THE CASE OF THE 2017 NOTES AND 25 BASIS POINTS IN THE CASE OF THE 2022 NOTES. IF WE EXPERIENCE A CHANGE OF CONTROL ACCOMPANIED BY A DOWNGRADE OF THE DEBT TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO OFFER TO REPURCHASE THE NOTES AT A PURCHASE PRICE EQUAL TO 101% OF THEIR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST. WE ARE SUBJECT TO COVENANTS WHICH LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PLEDGE PROPERTIES AS SECURITY UNDER BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING OUR PROPERTY. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE SENIOR NOTES WAS $2.771 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2012. CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS): OPERATING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY $242.4 MILLION TO $2.019 BILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN EXPANSION OF OUR OPERATIONS AND RELATED INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS. NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2011 INCREASED BY $594.6 MILLION TO $1.776 BILLION AS COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN EXPANSION OF OUR OPERATIONS AND RELATED INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS, PARTIALLY 72 TABLE OF CONTENTS OFFSET BY THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ASSOCIATED WITH EXPANDING INTERNATIONAL SALES, WHICH TAKE LONGER TO COLLECT, AND THE TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. INVESTING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2012 CHANGED TO A NET USAGE OF $1.554 BILLION COMPARED TO $377.7 MILLION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2011. THE DECREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO A CASH USE OF $1.025 BILLION FOR NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE DURING 2012 COMPARED TO NET SALES OF $481.8 MILLION IN 2011, PLUS USAGES OF $352.2 MILLION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF AVILA AND $48.9 MILLION FOR THE PURCHASE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER ASSETS. NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2011 CHANGED TO A POSITIVE $377.7 MILLION COMPARED TO A NET CASH USE OF $2.107 BILLION IN 2010. THE 2010 INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCLUDED NET CASH USED IN THE ACQUISITION OF ABRAXIS OF $2.315 BILLION AND THE ACQUISITION OF GLOUCESTER OF $337.6 MILLION. FINANCING ACTIVITIES: NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2012 WAS $248.7 MILLION COMPARED TO A NET CASH USE OF $1.622 BILLION IN 2011. THE $1.373 BILLION DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2012 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO $1.487 BILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $217.4 MILLION OF NET REPAYMENTS OF SHORT-TERM BORROWING IN 2012 COMPARED TO $525.7 MILLION OF NET SHORT-TERM BORROWING IN 2011. DURING 2012 AND 2011, WE USED $2.044 BILLION AND $2.189 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, MEASURED ON A SETTLEMENT DATE BASIS. NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2011 WAS $1.622 BILLION COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED OF $1.177 BILLION IN 2010. THE $2.799 BILLION DECREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2011 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN 2010 THAT PROVIDED NET CASH OF $1.237 BILLION AND THE $2.189 BILLION IN COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES IN 2011 UNDER THE COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 (IN THOUSANDS): (1)THE SENIOR NOTE OBLIGATION AMOUNTS INCLUDE FUTURE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS. SENIOR NOTES: IN AUGUST 2012, WE ISSUED $1.500 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 1.90% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2017, AND 73 TABLE OF CONTENTS $1.000 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.25% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2022. THE 2012 ISSUED NOTES WERE ISSUED AT 99.786% AND 99.949% OF PAR, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE DISCOUNT IS BEING AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. OFFERING COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $11.7 MILLION HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. INTEREST ON THE NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON FEBRUARY 15 AND AUGUST 15 EACH YEAR BEGINNING FEBRUARY 15, 2013 AND THE PRINCIPAL ON EACH NOTE IS DUE IN FULL AT THEIR RESPECTIVE MATURITY DATES. THE NOTES MAY BE REDEEMED AT THE OPTION OF THE COMPANY, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT ANY TIME AT A REDEMPTION PRICE DEFINED IN A MAKE-WHOLE CLAUSE EQUALING ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST PLUS THE GREATER OF 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES TO BE REDEEMED OR THE SUM OF THE PRESENT VALUES OF THE REMAINING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL DISCOUNTED TO THE DATE OF REDEMPTION ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS PLUS 20 BASIS POINTS IN THE CASE OF THE 2017 NOTES AND 25 BASIS POINTS IN THE CASE OF THE 2022 NOTES. IF WE EXPERIENCE A CHANGE OF CONTROL ACCOMPANIED BY A DOWNGRADE OF THE DEBT TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO OFFER TO REPURCHASE THE NOTES AT A PURCHASE PRICE EQUAL TO 101% OF THEIR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST. WE ARE SUBJECT TO COVENANTS WHICH LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PLEDGE PROPERTIES AS SECURITY UNDER BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING OUR PROPERTY. IN OCTOBER 2010, WE ISSUED A TOTAL OF $1.250 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2.45% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2015, $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.95% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2020 AND $250.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 5.7% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2040. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS: CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS INCLUDED PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND FEES OF $308.5 MILLION RELATED TO COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2012. OPERATING LEASES: WE LEASE OFFICE AND RESEARCH FACILITIES UNDER VARIOUS OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE NON-CANCELABLE LEASE TERMS FOR OPERATING LEASES EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES BETWEEN 2013 AND 2023 AND INCLUDE RENEWAL OPTIONS. IN GENERAL, WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE LESSORS FOR REAL ESTATE TAXES, INSURANCE, UTILITIES, MAINTENANCE AND OTHER OPERATING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEASES. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE MAJOR FACILITIES THAT WE OCCUPY UNDER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS REFER TO PART I, ITEM 2, "PROPERTIES" OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS: OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS OF $89.4 MILLION ON DECEMBER 31, 2012 INCLUDE $64.1 MILLION IN CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPLY CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE COMMITTED TO INVEST AN AGGREGATE $25.0 MILLION IN TWO INVESTMENT FUNDS OVER A TEN-YEAR PERIOD, WHICH IS CALLABLE AT ANY TIME. ON DECEMBER 31, 2012, OUR REMAINING INVESTMENT COMMITMENT WAS $5.4 MILLION. COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS: WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT INCLUDE THE FUNDING OF CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE MILESTONE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED DEVELOPMENTAL, REGULATORY AND/OR COMMERCIAL TARGETS. OUR OBLIGATION TO FUND THESE EFFORTS IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROGRAMS AND/OR THE LACK OF ANY ADVERSE EVENTS WHICH COULD CAUSE THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE 74 TABLE OF CONTENTS PROGRAMS. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE ATTAINMENT OF SPECIFIED DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND ACCORDINGLY, NO AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED FOR THESE FUTURE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011 CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. POTENTIAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $6.202 BILLION, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $4.284 BILLION CONTINGENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF VARIOUS RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL MILESTONES AND APPROXIMATELY $1.918 BILLION IN SALES-BASED MILESTONES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS ARE IDENTIFIED IN NOTE 17 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. NEW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN JULY 2012, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD, OR FASB, ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE, OR ASU, NO. 2012-02, "INTANGIBLES  GOODWILL AND OTHER (TOPIC 350): TESTING INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT," OR ASU 2012-02. ASU 2012-02 ALLOWS A COMPANY THE OPTION TO FIRST ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS NECESSARY TO PERFORM A QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT TEST. UNDER THAT OPTION, A COMPANY WOULD NO LONGER BE REQUIRED TO CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET UNLESS THE COMPANY DETERMINES, BASED ON THAT QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. ASU 2012-02 IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL AND INTERIM INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT TESTS PERFORMED FOR PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER SEPTEMBER 15, 2012. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED AND WE ADOPTED THIS STANDARD IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012. THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2012-02 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IS ONE THAT IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENT'S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL: REVENUE RECOGNITION: REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS OF THE PRODUCT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER. PROVISIONS FOR DISCOUNTS, EARLY PAYMENTS, REBATES, SALES RETURNS AND DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS UNDER TERMS CUSTOMARY IN THE INDUSTRY ARE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SAME PERIOD THE RELATED SALES ARE RECORDED. WE RECORD ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SALE. THE ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR SUCH VOLUME-BASED DISCOUNTS AND REBATES ARE BASED ON THE SALES TERMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND TREND ANALYSIS. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM ROYALTIES BASED ON LICENSEES' SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS USING OUR TECHNOLOGIES. ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACT TERMS WHEN ROYALTIES FROM LICENSEES CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED. IF ROYALTIES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR COLLECTABILITY OF A ROYALTY AMOUNT IS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED, ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE CASH IS RECEIVED. 75 TABLE OF CONTENTS GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES, SALES DISCOUNTS, GOVERNMENT REBATES, AND CHARGEBACKS AND DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEES. WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, MEASURED END-CUSTOMER DEMAND AS REPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED OR INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS, AS APPLICABLE. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH HOSPITALS AND CONTRACTED PHARMACIES, LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY. THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT. SALES DISCOUNT ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. GOVERNMENT REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED PAYMENTS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOR PURCHASES MADE BY THIRD PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS. U.S. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAID REBATE PERCENTAGE WAS INCREASED AND EXTENDED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN MARCH 2010. THE ACCRUAL OF THE REBATES ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS IS CALCULATED BASED ON ESTIMATED HISTORICAL PATIENT DATA RELATED TO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WE HAVE ALSO ANALYZED ACTUAL BILLINGS RECEIVED FROM CERTAIN STATES TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE ACCRUAL RATES. SUBSEQUENT TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010, OR COLLECTIVELY THE 2010 U.S. HEALTH CARE REFORM LAW, CERTAIN STATES HAVE NOT YET SUBMITTED ACTUAL MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION BILLS, RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN THE ACCRUAL BALANCE. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011, MANUFACTURERS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 50% OF THE PATIENT'S COST OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO US OF THIS COVERAGE GAP RESPONSIBILITY, WE ANALYZE DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS AGAINST DATA FOR ELIGIBLE MEDICARE PART D PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL INVOICES. THIS EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS INCURRED. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE REBATES TO BE PAID BASED ON PROGRAM SPECIFIC RULES AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY ON ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE SALES. REBATES OR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE OFFERED TO CERTAIN WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS, CONSISTENT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES. SETTLEMENT OF REBATES AND FEES MAY GENERALLY OCCUR FROM ONE TO 15 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. WE PROVIDE A PROVISION FOR REBATES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON CONTRACTED RATES AND HISTORICAL REDEMPTION RATES. ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PROVISION INCLUDE LEVEL OF WHOLESALER 76 TABLE OF CONTENTS INVENTORIES, CONTRACT SALES VOLUMES AND AVERAGE CONTRACT PRICING. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ADJUST THE PROVISION ACCORDINGLY. CHARGEBACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICE FEE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. TRICARE IS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES CIVILIAN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, MILITARY RETIREES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. TRICARE REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ELIGIBLE SALES MULTIPLIED BY THE TRICARE REBATE FORMULA. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: WE ESTIMATE AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, HISTORICAL PAYMENT PATTERNS, AGING OF RECEIVABLE BALANCES AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF COUNTRIES THEMSELVES AND PROVINCES OR AREAS WITHIN SUCH COUNTRIES WHERE THEY ARE THE ULTIMATE CUSTOMERS. INCOME TAXES: WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. WE PROVIDE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE ACCOUNT FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS PART OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THESE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATE PRIMARILY TO ISSUES COMMON AMONG MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE APPLY A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES WHICH INCLUDE STUDIES PERFORMED BY INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS, ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY AND SUBJECT EXPERTS, EVALUATION OF PUBLIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. WE PROVIDE ESTIMATES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. IF OUR ESTIMATES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ACTUAL OUTCOMES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE A PORTION WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR RECENT CUMULATIVE EARNINGS EXPERIENCE BY TAXING JURISDICTION, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, CARRYFORWARD PERIODS AVAILABLE TO US FOR TAX REPORTING PURPOSES, VARIOUS INCOME TAX STRATEGIES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT AND, TO THE EXTENT FUTURE EXPECTATIONS CHANGE, WE WOULD HAVE TO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THAT TIME. AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION: THE COST OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IS RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL AWARDS GRANTED, USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES METHOD OF VALUATION FOR STOCK OPTIONS. THE FAIR VALUES OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND PERFORMANCE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ARE BASED ON THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH AWARD IS DETERMINED AND THE COMPENSATION COST IS 77 TABLE OF CONTENTS RECOGNIZED OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD REQUIRED TO OBTAIN FULL VESTING. COMPENSATION COST TO BE RECOGNIZED REFLECTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF AWARDS EXPECTED TO VEST AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AN ESTIMATE OF AWARD FORFEITURES BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE. OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES: A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF ANY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY BELOW ITS COST THAT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN CARRYING AMOUNT TO FAIR VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT IS CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AND A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE SECURITY ESTABLISHED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INCLUDE: SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE ISSUER'S EARNINGS PERFORMANCE, CREDIT RATING, ASSET QUALITY, BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE ISSUER OPERATES, LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW OUR COST, OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE SECURITY, OUR INTENT NOT TO SELL, AN EVALUATION AS TO WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO SELL BEFORE RECOVERY OF OUR COST BASIS, AND ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ISSUER'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD DIFFER FROM OUR ASSESSMENT. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES: ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN CURRENT EARNINGS OR OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), DEPENDING ON WHETHER A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION AND, IF IT IS, THE TYPE OF HEDGING TRANSACTION. FOR A DERIVATIVE TO QUALIFY AS A HEDGE AT INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE HEDGED PERIOD, WE FORMALLY DOCUMENT THE NATURE AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEM. WE ASSESS, BOTH AT INCEPTION AND ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING TRANSACTIONS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING THE CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS. WE ASSESS HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND RECORD THE GAIN OR LOSS RELATED TO THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IF ANY, TO CURRENT EARNINGS. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER PROBABLE OF OCCURRING, WE DISCONTINUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING AND ANY RELATED UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE NOT DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGING TRANSACTION, TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES. THE USE OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE EXPOSURE OF THESE RISKS WITH THE INTENT TO REDUCE OUR RISK OR COST. WE DO NOT USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR SPECULATIVE TRADING PURPOSES AND ARE NOT A PARTY TO LEVERAGED DERIVATIVES. INVESTMENTS IN OTHER ENTITIES: WE HOLD A PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER EITHER THE EQUITY METHOD OR COST METHOD. INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES OR CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS OVER WHICH WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD, WITH OUR SHARE OF EARNINGS OR LOSSES REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. OUR COST METHOD AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT. IF AN INVESTMENT'S FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN ITS NET CARRYING VALUE AND THE DECLINE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE. SUCH AN EVALUATION IS 78 TABLE OF CONTENTS JUDGMENTAL AND DEPENDENT ON SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE HAS OCCURRED INCLUDE: MARKET VALUE OR EXIT PRICE OF THE INVESTMENT BASED ON EITHER MARKET-QUOTED PRICES OR FUTURE ROUNDS OF FINANCING BY THE INVESTEE; LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE MARKET VALUE WAS BELOW ITS COST BASIS; FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE INVESTEE; OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT; ISSUES THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INVESTEE'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN; AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE MAY BE AWARE OF RELATED TO THE INVESTMENT. ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, OR LTIP, DESIGNED TO PROVIDE KEY OFFICERS AND EXECUTIVES WITH PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES CONTINGENT UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED CORPORATE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES COVERING A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE SEPARATE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLES RUNNING CONCURRENTLY ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2014 AND 2015. PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THE PERFORMANCE CYCLE ENDING IN 2013 ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE THREE-YEAR CYCLE: 25% ON NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE; 25% ON NON-GAAP NET INCOME; AND 50% ON TOTAL NON-GAAP REVENUE, AS DEFINED. THE PERFORMANCE CYCLES ENDING IN 2014 AND 2015 ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS: 37.5% ON NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE; 37.5% ON TOTAL NON-GAAP REVENUE, AS DEFINED; AND 25% ON RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, WHICH IS A MEASUREMENT OF OUR STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR COMPARED WITH A GROUP OF OTHER COMPANIES IN THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. PAYOUTS MAY BE IN THE RANGE OF 0% TO 200% OF THE PARTICIPANT'S SALARY FOR THE LTIPS. SUCH AWARDS ARE PAYABLE IN CASH OR COMMON STOCK OR A MIXTURE OF CASH AND COMMON STOCK, WHICH WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AT THE TIME OF AWARD DELIVERY. FOR AWARDS PAYABLE IN COMMON STOCK, THE NUMBER OF SHARES IS DETERMINED USING THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE FOR THE 30 TRADING DAYS PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CYCLE. PAYMENTS MADE IN COMMON STOCK ARE RESTRICTED FROM TRADING FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS. WE ACCRUE THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE LIABILITY OVER EACH THREE-YEAR CYCLE. PRIOR TO THE END OF A THREE-YEAR CYCLE, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT DURING THE CYCLE. UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT EQUAL TO THEIR TARGET AWARD OR, IF HIGHER, AN AWARD BASED ON ACTUAL PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL. ACCRUALS RECORDED FOR THE LTIP ENTAIL MAKING CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE, NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND NON-GAAP REVENUES, AS DEFINED; THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED. ACCRUALS FOR THE LTIP ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND REVISED ACCORDINGLY SO THAT THE LIABILITY RECORDED REFLECTS UPDATED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PAYOUTS. IN ESTIMATING THE ACCRUALS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DATE FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, EXPECTED RESULTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, OPERATING TRENDS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICING AND COMPETITION. VALUATION OF GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IPR&D: WE HAVE RECORDED GOODWILL, ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IPR&D PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ACQUISITIONS OF PHARMION, GLOUCESTER, ABRAXIS AND AVILA. WHEN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, ARE ACQUIRED, WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS ARE TYPICALLY USED IN THESE VALUATIONS IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES 79 TABLE OF CONTENTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, AND THE MODELS REQUIRE THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: PROJECTING REGULATORY APPROVALS, ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM PRODUCT SALES RESULTING FROM COMPLETED PRODUCTS AND IN-PROCESS PROJECTS AND DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES AND PROBABILITY RATES GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. WE TEST OUR GOODWILL ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT EACH NOVEMBER 30. WE ARE ORGANIZED AS A SINGLE REPORTING UNIT AND THEREFORE THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS DONE USING OUR OVERALL MARKET VALUE, AS DETERMINED BY OUR TRADED SHARE PRICE, AS COMPARED TO OUR BOOK VALUE OF NET ASSETS. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE AMORTIZED TO THEIR ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR. INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO IPR&D PRODUCT RIGHTS ARE TREATED AS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND NOT AMORTIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS APPROVED FOR SALE BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN SPECIFIED MARKETS. AT THAT TIME, WE WILL DETERMINE THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET, RECLASSIFY THE ASSET OUT OF IPR&D AND BEGIN AMORTIZATION. IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS ALSO PERFORMED AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS THAT COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. SUCH TEST ENTAILS COMPLETING AN UPDATED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET. OUR EXISTING IPR&D PRODUCT RIGHTS WERE OBTAINED IN THE ACQUISITIONS OF GLOUCESTER AND AVILA. THE GLOUCESTER RELATED PRODUCT RIGHTS WILL BECOME DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES WHEN MARKETING APPROVAL IS RECEIVED FOR ISTODAX® FOR TREATMENT OF PTCL IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE AVILA RELATED PRODUCT RIGHTS WILL BECOME DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES WHEN MARKETING APPROVAL IS RECEIVED FOR CC-292 FOR ANY INDICATION IN ANY MAJOR MARKET. VALUATION OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION: WE RECORD CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION AT ITS FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE, AND FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT REPORTING PERIOD REVALUE THESE OBLIGATIONS AND RECORD INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPERATING EARNINGS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. CHANGES TO CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION OBLIGATIONS CAN RESULT FROM MOVEMENTS IN PUBLICLY TRADED SHARE PRICES OF CVRS, ADJUSTMENTS TO DISCOUNT RATES AND PERIODS, UPDATES IN THE ASSUMED ACHIEVEMENT OR TIMING OF ANY DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES OR CHANGES IN THE PROBABILITY OF CERTAIN CLINICAL EVENTS AND CHANGES IN THE ASSUMED PROBABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATORY APPROVAL. THE ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT AND ANY CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION EXPENSE RECORDED IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. OUR CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES WERE ACQUIRED IN THE ACQUISITIONS OF GLOUCESTER, ABRAXIS, AND AVILA. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE GLOUCESTER AND AVILA CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE DISCOUNT RATE, PROBABILITY AND ESTIMATED TIMING OF CASH MILESTONE PAYMENTS TO THE FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OR EACH COMPANY. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ABRAXIS 80 TABLE OF CONTENTS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY IS BASED ON THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED CVRS. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES FORWARD-LOOKING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RISK OF LOSS IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES, CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE EARNINGS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, OUR MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS CONSISTED OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, OUR LONG-TERM DEBT AND CERTAIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE CONSISTED OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT, AGENCY AND SUPRANATIONAL SECURITIES, GLOBAL CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES AND A MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITY. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES INCLUDE GENERAL UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS EITHER ISSUED DIRECTLY BY OR GUARANTEED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTERPRISES. U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY MBS INCLUDE MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION AND THE GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION. NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT, AGENCY AND SUPRANATIONAL SECURITIES CONSIST OF DIRECT OBLIGATIONS OF HIGHLY RATED GOVERNMENTS OF NATIONS OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES, OBLIGATIONS OF SPONSORED AGENCIES AND OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE GUARANTEED OR SUPPORTED BY HIGHLY RATED GOVERNMENTS OF NATIONS OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES. CORPORATE DEBT  GLOBAL INCLUDES OBLIGATIONS ISSUED BY INVESTMENT-GRADE CORPORATIONS INCLUDING SOME ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN GUARANTEED BY GOVERNMENTS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. 81 TABLE OF CONTENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, FAIR VALUES AND RELATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS): LONG-TERM DEBT: IN AUGUST 2012, WE ISSUED A TOTAL OF $1.500 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTING OF $500.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 1.90% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2017AND $1.000 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.25% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2022. THE 2012 ISSUED NOTES WERE ISSUED AT 99.786% AND 99.949% OF PAR, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE DISCOUNT IS BEING AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. OFFERING COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $11.7 MILLION HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD OVER THE PERIOD FROM ISSUANCE THROUGH MATURITY. INTEREST ON THE NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON FEBRUARY 15 AND AUGUST 15 EACH YEAR BEGINNING FEBRUARY 15, 2013 AND THE PRINCIPAL ON EACH NOTE IS DUE IN FULL AT THEIR RESPECTIVE MATURITY DATES.

IF A CHANGE OF CONTROL OCCURS ACCOMPANIED BY A DOWNGRADE OF THE DEBT TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO OFFER TO REPURCHASE THE NOTES AT A PURCHASE PRICE EQUAL TO 101% OF THEIR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST. WE ARE SUBJECT TO COVENANTS WHICH LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PLEDGE PROPERTIES AS SECURITY UNDER BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING OUR PROPERTY.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO COVENANTS WHICH LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PLEDGE PROPERTIES AS SECURITY UNDER BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING OUR PROPERTY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SENIOR NOTES OUTSTANDING WAS $2.893 BILLION. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT OUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN BE IMPACTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES. WE MANAGE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE AND INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS THROUGH OPERATIONAL MEANS AND THROUGH THE USE OF VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS, FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED REVENUE HEDGING AND BALANCE SHEET RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO MITIGATE VOLATILITY IN FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS AND CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE CAUSED BY VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. THROUGH OUR REVENUE HEDGING PROGRAM, WE ENDEAVOR TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF POSSIBLE UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON OUR FUTURE U.S. DOLLAR CASH FLOWS THAT ARE DERIVED FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, TYPICALLY NO MORE THAN THREE YEARS INTO THE FUTURE. WE MANAGE OUR ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION EXPOSURE PRINCIPALLY WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND OCCASIONALLY FOREIGN CURRENCY PUT AND CALL OPTIONS. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS: WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PROTECT AGAINST CHANGES IN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011 HAD SETTLEMENT DATES WITHIN 36 MONTHS. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AND, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THEM ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), OR OCI, AND RECLASSIFIED TO OPERATIONS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT OPERATIONS. ANY INEFFECTIVENESS ON THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IS REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME 83 TABLE OF CONTENTS (EXPENSE), NET. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES WERE AS FOLLOWS AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011: WE CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF OUR OWN AND THE COUNTERPARTIES' CREDIT RISK ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO EXECUTE ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONTRACT ON AN ONGOING BASIS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, CREDIT RISK DID NOT MATERIALLY CHANGE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS. WE ALSO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF CERTAIN RECOGNIZED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND, ACCORDINGLY, ANY CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD NON-DESIGNATED HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011 WERE $795.4 MILLION AND $916.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, WE BELIEVE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS A REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES. ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2012 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WOULD CHANGE BY APPROXIMATELY $227.9 MILLION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS EITHER HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES OR RELATE TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE ENTITIES' FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE EITHER REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS OR RE-MEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR LIABILITY FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS: DURING 2012, WE BEGAN HEDGING A PORTION OF OUR FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE BY UTILIZING A STRATEGY THAT INVOLVES BOTH A PURCHASED LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTION AND A WRITTEN LOCAL CURRENCY CALL OPTION THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS HEDGES OF FUTURE SALES DENOMINATED IN EUROS. SPECIFICALLY, WE SELL (OR WRITE) A LOCAL CURRENCY CALL OPTION AND PURCHASE A LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTION WITH THE SAME EXPIRATION DATES AND AMOUNTS BUT WITH DIFFERENT STRIKE PRICES; THIS COMBINATION OF TRANSACTIONS IS GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS A "COLLAR". THE EXPIRATION DATES AND NOTIONAL AMOUNTS CORRESPOND TO THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF FORECASTED FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY SALES. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS RELATIVE TO THE CURRENCY OF THE HEDGED ANTICIPATED SALES, THE PURCHASED PUT OPTION VALUE REDUCES TO ZERO AND WE BENEFIT FROM THE INCREASE IN THE U.S. DOLLAR 84 TABLE OF CONTENTS EQUIVALENT VALUE OF OUR ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS, HOWEVER THIS BENEFIT WOULD BE CAPPED AT THE STRIKE LEVEL OF THE WRITTEN CALL, WHICH FORMS THE UPPER END OF THE COLLAR. THE PREMIUM COLLECTED FROM THE CALL OPTION PARTIALLY OFFSETS THE PREMIUM PAID FOR THE PURCHASED PUT OPTION, RESULTING IN A NET COST FOR THE COLLARS. IN ORDER TO FULLY OFFSET THE NET COST OF THE COLLARS, WE ALSO SOLD LOCAL CURRENCY PUT OPTIONS WITH A LOWER STRIKE PRICE AND THE SAME EXPIRATION DATES AND AMOUNTS AS THE OPTION CONTRACTS THAT WERE USED TO HEDGE SALES. THESE WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS INTRODUCED RISK OF LOSS IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WERE TO STRENGTHEN BEYOND THE STRIKE PRICE OF THE WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS. IN DECEMBER 2012, WE ENTERED INTO PURCHASED PUT OPTIONS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES IN ORDER TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE RISK OF LOSS THAT WOULD BE INCURRED ON THE WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS IF THE US DOLLAR WERE TO STRENGTHEN BEYOND THE STRIKE PRICE OF THE WRITTEN PUT. GAINS AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE NON-HEDGE PUT OPTIONS HAVE BEEN RECORDED ON THE INCOME STATEMENT AS OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES WERE AS FOLLOWS AT DECEMBER 31, 2012: FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION NOTIONAL AMOUNT* 2012 DESIGNATED AS HEDGING ACTIVITY: PURCHASED PUT $ 228,779 WRITTEN CALL $ 235,920 NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING ACTIVITY: PURCHASED PUT $ 160,493 WRITTEN PUT $ (215,952 ) *U.S. DOLLAR NOTIONAL AMOUNTS ARE CALCULATED AS THE HEDGED LOCAL CURRENCY AMOUNT MULTIPLIED TIMES THE STRIKE VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION. THE LOCAL CURRENCY NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF OUR PURCHASED PUT, AND WRITTEN CALL THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING ACTIVITY ARE EQUAL TO EACH OTHER. ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, WE BELIEVE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS A REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES. ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2012 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGES WOULD CHANGE BY APPROXIMATELY $24.1 MILLION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS HEDGES HEDGE SPECIFIC FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE EITHER REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIODS DURING WHICH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS OR RE-MEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR LIABILITY. ASSUMING THAT THE DECEMBER 31, 2012 EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES WOULD DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $0.9 MILLION IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WERE TO STRENGTHEN, AND WOULD INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $2.2 MILLION IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WERE TO WEAKEN. THIS IMPACT WOULD BE RECORDED TO INCOME DURING THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE CHANGE IN CURRENCY RATES OCCURRED. 85 TABLE OF CONTENTS INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS: DURING 2012, WE ENTERED INTO TREASURY RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS, OR TREASURY RATE LOCKS, IN ANTICIPATION OF ISSUING FIXED-RATE NOTES THAT WERE ISSUED IN AUGUST 2012. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SHORT PERIOD IN JUNE WHEN CERTAIN OUTSTANDING TREASURY RATE LOCKS WERE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES, OUR TREASURY RATE LOCKS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AND, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, ANY REALIZED OR UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THEM ARE REPORTED IN OCI AND WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME OVER THE LIFE OF THE ANTICIPATED FIXED-RATE NOTES. TREASURY RATE LOCKS WERE SETTLED DURING 2012 WHICH RESULTED IN LOSSES OF $35.3 MILLION THAT WERE RECORDED TO OCI. DURING THE SHORT PERIOD IN JUNE WHEN WE HAD OUTSTANDING TREASURY RATE LOCKS THAT WERE NOT CONSIDERED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, WE RECORDED THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF $3.7 MILLION IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. NO MATERIAL AMOUNTS WERE RECORDED IN INCOME DURING 2012 OR 2011 AS A RESULT OF HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS OR HEDGE COMPONENTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING TREASURY RATE LOCKS. INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS: FROM TIME TO TIME WE HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN DEBT OBLIGATIONS THROUGH THE USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. THE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED HEDGES OF THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE NOTES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. SINCE THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE SWAP ARE INTENDED TO MATCH THOSE OF THE DEBT BEING HEDGED, IT IS ASSUMED TO BE A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE HEDGE AND ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAPS ARE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WITH NO NET IMPACT RECORDED IN INCOME. ANY NET INTEREST PAYMENTS MADE OR RECEIVED ON INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST EXPENSE. IN 2011, WE SETTLED OUTSTANDING INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS WE ENTERED INTO WITH RESPECT TO OUR $500.0 MILLION 2.45% FIXED NOTES DUE IN 2015 RESULTING IN THE RECEIPT OF $34.3 MILLION. THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SETTLEMENTS ARE BEING ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE NOTES. DURING 2012, WE TERMINATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP ON $800.0 MILLION NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF SWAP CONTRACTS THAT HAD BEEN ENTERED INTO EARLIER IN 2012 AS HEDGES OF OUR 1.9% FIXED RATE NOTES DUE IN 2017 AND OUR 3.25% FIXED RATE NOTES DUE IN 2022 BY SETTLING CERTAIN OF THE CONTRACTS AND ENTERING INTO OFFSETTING CONTRACTS FOR THOSE NOT SETTLED. THIS RESULTED IN GAINS OF $5.0 MILLION THAT ARE BEING ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE NOTES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, WE WERE A PARTY TO PAY-FLOATING, RECEIVE-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE NOTES IN WHICH THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS MATCH THE AMOUNT OF THE HEDGED FIXED-RATE NOTES. OUR SWAP CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 CONSISTED OF $100.0 MILLION AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT MATURING IN 2017, WHICH EFFECTIVELY CONVERT A PORTION OF OUR $500.0 MILLION, 1.90% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE IN 2017 TO A FLOATING RATE AND $200.0 MILLION AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT MATURING IN 2022, WHICH EFFECTIVELY CONVERTS A PORTION OF OUR $1.000 BILLION, 3.25% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE IN 2022 TO A FLOATING RATE. IN JANUARY 2013 WE ENTERED INTO ADDITIONAL INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $400.0 MILLION RELATED TO OUR 1.90% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE IN 2017 AND $800.0 MILLION RELATED TO OUR 3.25% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE IN 2022. A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO MEASURE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR DEBT AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS FROM A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES INDICATED THAT A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET PAYABLE BY $169.3 MILLION. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET PAYABLE BY $188.7 MILLION. 86 TABLE OF CONTENTS
