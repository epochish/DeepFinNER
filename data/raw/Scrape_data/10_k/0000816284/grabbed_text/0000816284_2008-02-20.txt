DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION CELGENE CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY WE OR OUR) IS A GLOBAL BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN THE DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF INNOVATIVE THERAPIES DESIGNED TO TREAT CANCER AND IMMUNE-INFLAMMATORY RELATED DISEASES. OUR PRIMARY COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS INCLUDE REVLIMID® AND THALOMID®. REVLIMID® IS AN ORAL IMMUNOMODULATORY DRUG APPROVED BY THE FDA, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, OR EC, SWISSMEDIC AND THE AUSTRALIAN THERAPEUTIC GOODS ADMINISTRATION FOR TREATMENT IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE FOR MULTIPLE MYELOMA PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY. REVLIMID® IS ALSO APPROVED BY THE FDA AND CANADIAN THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS DIRECTORATE FOR TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH TRANSFUSION-DEPENDENT ANEMIA DUE TO LOW- OR INTERMEDIATE-1-RISK MDS, ASSOCIATED WITH A DELETION 5Q CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITY WITH OR WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITIES. THALOMID® WAS APPROVED BY THE FDA IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE FOR THE TREATMENT OF NEWLY DIAGNOSED MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND FOR THE TREATMENT OF ACUTE CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF MODERATE TO SEVERE ERYTHEMA NODOSUM LEPROSUM, OR ENL, AND AS MAINTENANCE THERAPY FOR PREVENTION AND SUPPRESSION OF THE CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATION OF ENL RECURRENCE. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE MADE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND THE DRUG CANDIDATES IN OUR PIPELINE ARE AT VARIOUS STAGES OF PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT. THESE CANDIDATES INCLUDE OUR IMIDS® COMPOUNDS, WHICH ARE A CLASS OF COMPOUNDS PROPRIETARY TO US AND HAVING CERTAIN IMMUNOMODULATORY AND OTHER BIOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT PROPERTIES IN ADDITION TO OUR LEADING ORAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PRIMARY COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS AND DEPTH OF OUR PRODUCT PIPELINE PROVIDE THE CATALYSTS FOR OUR FUTURE GROWTH. FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, REGULATORY APPROVALS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES, THE TIMING AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS LAUNCHED 32 TABLE OF CONTENTS BY US OR COMPETING COMPANIES, THE TIMING OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES, CHALLENGES TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL COSTS. SEE ALSO THE RISK FACTORS DISCUSSION CONTAINED IN PART I, ITEM 1A. SOME OF THE MORE SIGNFICANT FACTORS THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON INCLUDE: THE ABILITY OF REVLIMID® TO SUCCESSFULLY PENETRATE AND EXPAND IN RELEVANT MARKETS, OUR ABILITY TO ADVANCE CLINICAL AND REGULATORY PROGRAMS AND COMPETITIVE RISKS. THE ABILITY OF REVLIMID® TO SUCCESSFULLY PENETRATE AND EXPAND IN RELEVANT MARKETS: THE INTRODUCTION OF REVLIMID® IN THE UNITED STATES HAS INCLUDED AMONG OTHER THINGS, REGISTERING PHYSICIANS IN THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE USE OF REVLIMID® AND PARTNERING WITH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES TO ENSURE, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE, SAFE AND RAPID DISTRIBUTION OF REVLIMID®. IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, REVLIMID® WAS GRANTED APPROVAL BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, SWISSMEDIC, CANADIAN THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS DIRECTORATE AND AUSTRALIAN THERAPEUTIC GOODS ADMINISTRATION WITH PRODUCT LAUNCHES ALREADY INITIATED IN SEVERAL OF THE APPROVED COUNTRIES. WE ARE ALSO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE APPROPRIATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES TO DETERMINE NEXT STEPS FOR PRICING, REIMBURSEMENT AND DISTRIBUTION IN THOSE COUNTRIES IN WHICH REVLIMID® HAS NOT YET BEEN LAUNCHED. WE DO NOT HAVE LONG-TERM DATA ON THE USE OF REVLIMID® AND CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER REVLIMID® WILL CONTINUE TO GAIN WIDESPREAD ACCEPTANCE FROM REGULATORS, PHYSICIANS, PATIENTS, OPINION LEADERS, GOVERNMENT HEALTH AGENCIES AND PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS. THE ABILITY TO ADVANCE REGULATORY AND CLINICAL PROGRAMS: A MARKETING AUTHORIZATION APPLICATION, OR MAA, SEEKING APPROVAL TO MARKET REVLIMID® FOR TREATMENT OF TRANSFUSION-DEPENDENT ANEMIA DUE TO LOW-OR-INTERMEDIATE-1 RISK MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES ASSOCIATED WITH A DELETION 5Q CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITY WITH OR WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITIES WAS EVALUATED BY THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCYS, OR EMEA, COMMITTEE FOR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE, OR CHMP AND A NEGATIVE OPINION ISSUED IN JANUARY 2008. THE CHMP CONCLUDED THAT LENALIDOMIDE IS EFFICACIOUS IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM DELETION 5Q MDS. BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE CHMP FROM THE UNCONTROLLED, OPEN-LABEL, 148-PATIENT PHASE II STUDY (MDS-003), THE CHMP WAS NOT CONVINCED THE DATA WERE SUFFICIENT TO ASSURE SAFETY. WE INTEND TO APPLY FOR A REEXAMINATION OF THE CHMP OPINION IN ACCORDANCE WITH RELEVANT EMEA PROCEDURES. OTHER INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY INITIATIVES INCLUDE MAAS UNDER EVALUATION IN NEW ZEALAND AND ISRAEL. IN APRIL 2007, THE EASTERN COOPERATIVE ONCOLOGY GROUP REPORTED THAT ITS DATA MONITORING COMMITTEES REVIEW OF PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM A LARGE, RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL FOR PATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED MULTIPLE MYELOMA FOUND THAT THE USE OF A LOW-DOSE OF DEXAMETHASONE IN COMBINATION WITH REVLIMID® SUGGESTS SURVIVAL ADVANTAGE FOR PATIENTS WHEN COMPARED TO THE HIGHER, STANDARD-DOSE OF DEXAMETHASONE THAT IS USED IN COMBINATION WITH REVLIMID® TO TREAT THE DISEASE. THESE RESULTS WERE ALSO PRESENTED AT THE JUNE 2007 ANNUAL AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY MEDICAL CONFERENCE AND UPDATED AT THE DECEMBER 2007 ANNUAL AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HEMATOLOGY MEETING. THE REGULATORY UTILITY OF THESE FINDINGS WILL BE DISCUSSED WITH THE FDA. A MAJOR OBJECTIVE OF OUR ON-GOING CLINICAL PROGRAMS IS TO BROADEN OUR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE FULL POTENTIAL OF REVLIMID® AND OUR OTHER PROPRIETARY IMIDS® COMPOUNDS AND TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THEM IN A BROAD RANGE OF HEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES AND OTHER CANCERS. OUR NEAR-TERM FOCUS IS ON EVALUATING REVLIMID® AS A TREATMENT OF CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA, OR CLL, AND AGGRESSIVE NON-HODGKINS LYMPHOMAS, OR NHL. IN NOVEMBER 2007, REVLIMID® WAS GRANTED ORPHAN MEDICINAL PRODUCT DESIGNATION BY THE EC FOR TREATMENT OF CLL. COMPETITIVE RISKS: WHILE COMPETITION COULD LIMIT REVLIMID® AND THALOMID® SALES, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT COMPETING PRODUCTS WOULD ELIMINATE THEIR USE ENTIRELY. MOREOVER, WHILE GENERIC COMPETITORS COULD SEEK TO CHALLENGE OUR THALOMID® FRANCHISE, WE OWN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WHICH INCLUDES, FOR EXAMPLE, U.S. PATENTS COVERING OUR S.T.E.P.S.® DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM FOR THE SAFE DISTRIBUTION AND APPROPRIATE USE OF THALIDOMIDE, WHICH ALL PHYSICIANS, PATIENTS AND PHARMACIES PRESCRIBING, RECEIVING OR DISPENSING THALIDOMIDE IN THE UNITED STATES MUST FOLLOW. WE ALSO HAVE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO SEVERAL ISSUED PATENTS COVERING THE USE OF THALOMID® IN ONCOLOGY AND OTHER THERAPEUTIC AREAS. 33 TABLE OF CONTENTS COMPANY BACKGROUND  IN 1986, WE WERE SPUN OFF FROM CELANESE CORPORATION AND, IN JULY 1987, WE COMPLETED AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING. INITIALLY, OUR OPERATIONS INVOLVED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF CHEMICAL AND BIOTREATMENT PROCESSES FOR THE CHEMICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES. BETWEEN 1990 AND 1998, OUR REVENUES WERE DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM THE DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY OF CHIRALLY PURE INTERMEDIATES TO PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES FOR USE IN NEW DRUG DEVELOPMENT. BY 1998, SALES OF CHIRALLY PURE INTERMEDIATES BECAME A LESS INTEGRAL PART OF OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS AND, IN JANUARY 1998, WE SOLD THE CHIRAL INTERMEDIATES BUSINESS TO CAMBREX CORPORATION.  IN JULY 1998, WE RECEIVED OUR FIRST APPROVAL FOR THALOMID® FROM THE FDA WHICH ALLOWED US TO MARKET THALOMID® FOR THE TREATMENT AND SUPPRESSION OF ENL, AN INFLAMMATORY COMPLICATION OF LEPROSY. IN MAY 2006, THE FDA APPROVED THALOMID® IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE FOR THE TREATMENT OF NEWLY DIAGNOSED MULTIPLE MYELOMA.  IN APRIL 2000, WE ENTERED INTO A DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH NOVARTIS PHARMA AG IN WHICH WE GRANTED TO NOVARTIS AN EXCLUSIVE WORLDWIDE LICENSE TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND MARKET FOCALINTM, OUR CHIRALLY PURE VERSION OF RITALIN®. THE AGREEMENT PROVIDED FOR SIGNIFICANT UPFRONT AND MILESTONE PAYMENTS TO US BASED ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF VARIOUS STAGES IN THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, WE SELL FOCALINTM TO NOVARTIS AS WELL AS RECEIVE ROYALTIES ON ALL OF NOVARTIS SALES OF FOCALIN XRTM AND RITALIN® FAMILY OF ADHD-RELATED PRODUCTS.  IN AUGUST 2000, WE ACQUIRED SIGNAL PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., CURRENTLY KNOWN AS SIGNAL PHARMACEUTICALS LLC, D/B/A CELGENE RESEARCH SAN DIEGO, A BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY FOCUSED ON THE DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF DRUGS THAT REGULATE GENES ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE.  IN NOVEMBER 2001, WE LICENSED TO PHARMION CORPORATION EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS RELATING TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIAL USE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COVERING THALIDOMIDE AND S.T.E.P.S.® IN ALL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA, JAPAN, CHINA, TAIWAN AND KOREA (SEE OUR REFERENCES BELOW TO THE DECEMBER 2004 AMENDMENT WITH RESPECT TO THESE TERRITORIES).  IN DECEMBER 2002, WE ACQUIRED ANTHROGENESIS CORP., WHICH WAS A PRIVATELY HELD NEW JERSEY-BASED BIOTHERAPEUTICS COMPANY AND CORD BLOOD BANKING BUSINESS DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE RECOVERY OF STEM CELLS FROM HUMAN PLACENTAL TISSUES FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF FULL-TERM, SUCCESSFUL PREGNANCIES. ANTHROGENESIS, D/B/A CELGENE CELLULAR THERAPEUTICS, OR CCT, NOW OPERATES AS A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF CELGENE CORPORATION, ENGAGED IN THE RESEARCH, RECOVERY, CULTURE-EXPANSION, PRESERVATION, DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF PLACENTAL STEM CELLS AS THERAPEUTIC AGENTS.  IN MARCH 2003, WE ENTERED INTO A SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT WITH GLAXOSMITHKLINE, OR GSK, TO DISTRIBUTE, PROMOTE AND SELL ALKERAN®, OR MELPHALAN, A THERAPY APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR THE PALLIATIVE TREATMENT OF MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND CARCINOMA OF THE OVARY. THE AGREEMENT REQUIRES THAT WE PURCHASE ALKERAN® FROM GSK AND DISTRIBUTE THE PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER THE CELGENE LABEL. THE AGREEMENT HAS BEEN EXTENDED THROUGH MARCH 31, 2009.  IN OCTOBER 2004, WE ACQUIRED PENN T LIMITED, OR PENN T, A SUPPLIER OF THALOMID®. THROUGH MANUFACTURING AGREEMENTS ACQUIRED IN THE TRANSACTION, WE ARE ABLE TO CONTROL MANUFACTURING FOR THALOMID®. IN THE TRANSACTION, WE ALSO ACQUIRED A PRODUCT SUPPLY AGREEMENT TO EXCLUSIVELY SUPPLY PHARMION WITH THALIDOMIDE, THEREBY ENABLING US TO INCREASE OUR PARTICIPATION IN THALIDOMIDE SALES IN KEY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. SUBSEQUENTLY, IN DECEMBER 2004, WE AMENDED THE THALIDOMIDE SUPPLY AGREEMENT WITH PHARMION AND GRANTED THEM LICENSE RIGHTS IN ADDITIONAL TERRITORIES. AS AMENDED, THE TERRITORY LICENSED TO PHARMION IS FOR ALL COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, MEXICO, JAPAN AND CHINA, EXCLUDING HONG KONG.  IN DECEMBER 2005, THE FDA APPROVED REVLIMID® FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH TRANSFUSION-DEPENDENT ANEMIA DUE TO LOW- OR INTERMEDIATE-1-RISK MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES ASSOCIATED WITH A DELETION 5Q CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITY WITH OR WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITIES AND, IN JUNE 2006, THE FDA APPROVED REVLIMID® FOR TREATMENT IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE FOR MULTIPLE 34 TABLE OF CONTENTS MYELOMA PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY. IN JUNE 2007, REVLIMID® WAS GRANTED FULL MARKETING AUTHORIZATION BY THE EC FOR USE IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE AS A TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE MYELOMA WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY AND IN SEPTEMBER 2007, APPROVAL WAS GRANTED BY SWISSMEDIC AND IN JANUARY 2008 BY THE AUSTRALIAN DRUG EVALUATION COMMITTEE FOR USE IN THIS SAME INDICATION. IN NOVEMBER 2007 THE EC GRANTED REVLIMID® ORPHAN MEDICINAL PRODUCT DESIGNATION FOR TREATMENT OF CLL. IN ADDITION, IN JANUARY 2008, REVLIMID® WAS APPROVED BY THE CANADIAN THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS DIRECTORATE FOR TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH MDS, ASSOCIATED WITH A DELETION 5Q CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITY WITH OR WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITIES.  IN NOVEMBER 2006, WE ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL 20,000,000 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE OF $51.60 PER SHARE WITH NET PROCEEDS OF $1.006 BILLION.  IN DECEMBER 2006, WE PURCHASED AN API MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FROM SIEGFRIED LOCATED IN ZOFINGEN, SWITZERLAND. THE API FACILITY HAS THE CAPABILITY TO PRODUCE MULTIPLE DRUG SUBSTANCES AND IS BEING USED TO PRODUCE REVLIMID® AND THALOMID® API TO SUPPLY GLOBAL MARKETS. THE FACILITY ALSO MAY BE USED TO PRODUCE DRUG SUBSTANCE FOR OUR FUTURE DRUGS AND DRUG CANDIDATES.  IN NOVEMBER 2007, WE ANNOUNCED THE SIGNING OF A DEFINITIVE MERGER AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO WHICH WE AGREED TO ACQUIRE PHARMION CORPORATION. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, WE WILL ACQUIRE ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF PHARMION COMMON STOCK FOR $72.00 PER SHARE PAYABLE IN A COMBINATION OF CASH AND SHARES OF CELGENE COMMON STOCK. THE TRANSACTION HAS BEEN UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED BY THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS OF BOTH COMPANIES AND IS SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS INCLUDING THE APPROVAL OF THE ACQUISITION BY PHARMION STOCKHOLDERS AND RECEIPT OF ANTITRUST CLEARANCES. THE HART-SCOTT-RODINO ACT, OR HSR, THIRTY DAY WAITING PERIOD HAS EXPIRED WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION, OR FTC, REQUESTING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO THE MERGER. IN ADDITION, THE BUNDESKARTELLAMT, GERMANYS FEDERAL CARTEL OFFICE IN CHARGE OF REVIEWING THE ANTITRUST ASPECTS OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, HAS CLEARED CELGENES PENDING ACQUISITION OF PHARMION CORPORATION. ON FEBRUARY 5, 2008 THE FORM S-4 RELATING TO THE MERGER OF PHARMION AND CELGENE WAS DECLARED EFFECTIVE BY THE SEC. THE MERGER IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN MARCH 2008. REFER TO NOTE 2 OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN SALES WERE PRICE INCREASES AND INCREASED SALES FROM OUR EUROPEAN NAMED PATIENT PROGRAM, OR NPP, WHICH OFFERS EUROPEAN PATIENTS IN NEED OF TREATMENT ACCESS TO REVLIMID® ON A COMPASSIONATE USE BASIS. NET SALES OF THALOMID® WERE HIGHER IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO PRICE INCREASES, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES VOLUMES AS PRESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN DECLINED, REFLECTING THE EXPANDED USE OF REVLIMID®. ALKERAN® NET SALES WERE HIGHER IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED PRICES AND A DECREASE IN PRODUCT RETURNS. 2006 COMPARED TO 2005: IN 2006, NET SALES OF REVLIMID® WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE DECEMBER 2005 FDA APPROVAL FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH TRANSFUSION-DEPENDENT ANEMIA DUE TO LOW- OR INTERMEDIATE-1-RISK MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES ASSOCIATED WITH A DELETION 5Q CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITY WITH OR WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITIES AND THE JUNE 2006 APPROVAL FOR TREATMENT IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE OF PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE MYELOMA WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY. REVLIMID® NET SALES RECORDED IN 2005 RELATED TO INITIAL STOCKING AT CERTAIN CONTRACTED PHARMACIES FOLLOWING THE PRODUCTS APPROVAL ON DECEMBER 27, 2005. THALOMID® NET SALES WERE HIGHER IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FDAS MAY 2006 APPROVAL FOR TREATMENT IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE OF NEWLY DIAGNOSED MULTIPLE MYELOMA. PRICE INCREASES IMPLEMENTED AS WE SHIFTED TOWARDS A COST OF THERAPY PRICING STRUCTURE AS OPPOSED TO A PRICE PER MILLIGRAM BASIS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE INCREASE IN THALOMID® SALES WERE SALES VOLUME DECREASES AND HIGHER GROSS TO NET SALES ADJUSTMENTS. ALKERAN® NET SALES WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN 2006, COMPARED TO 2005 AS SALES BENEFITED FROM AN INCREASE IN ALKERAN® TABLET SALES VOLUMES, AS WELL AS PRICE INCREASES IMPLEMENTED DURING 2006, PARTICULARLY IN ALKERAN® IVS (INJECTABLES). LARGELY OFFSETTING THE INCREASE IN SALES WERE HIGHER GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS. SALES OF FOCALINTM, WHICH IS SOLD EXCLUSIVELY TO NOVARTIS AND IS DEPENDENT ON THE TIMING OF ORDERS FROM NOVARTIS FOR THEIR COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION, WERE HIGHER IN 2006, COMPARED TO 2005, DUE TO INCREASED END-MARKET DEMAND. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS, SALES DISCOUNTS, MEDICAID REBATES AND DISTRIBUTOR CHARGE-BACKS AND SERVICE FEES. WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATES TO THALOMID®, ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER KNOWN FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED AND INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DOES NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. WE DO NOT USE INFORMATION FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES IN ESTIMATING OUR PRODUCT RETURNS. THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY TO DATE. SALES DISCOUNTS ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE AMOUNT FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. 36 TABLE OF CONTENTS DISTRIBUTOR CHARGE-BACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICES ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS AND THE BALANCE IN THE RELATED ALLOWANCE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 WERE AS FOLLOWS: RETURNS DISTRIBUTOR AND MEDICAID CHARGEBACKS ALLOWANCES DISCOUNTS REBATES AND SERVICES TOTAL IN THOUSANDS $ BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 $ 9,600 $ 837 $ 5,534 $ 3,721 $ 19,692 ALLOWANCES FOR SALES DURING 2005 19,476 10,948 35,009 35,926 101,359 ALLOWANCES FOR SALES DURING PRIOR PERIODS 1,780  89  1,869 CREDITS ISSUED FOR PRIOR YEAR SALES (11,380 ) (834 ) (5,623 ) (3,264 ) (21,101 ) CREDITS ISSUED FOR SALES DURING 2005 (14,459 ) (9,504 ) (14,049 ) (29,605 ) (67,617 ) BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 $ 5,017 $ 1,447 $ 20,960 $ 6,778 $ 34,202 ALLOWANCES FOR SALES DURING 2006 23,944 18,847 22,353 57,750 122,894 ALLOWANCES FOR SALES DURING PRIOR PERIODS 30,607 34   30,641 CREDITS ISSUED FOR PRIOR YEAR SALES (35,624 ) (1,481 ) (20,357 ) (6,315 ) (63,777 ) CREDITS ISSUED FOR SALES DURING 2006 (14,464 ) (16,551 ) (15,488 ) (47,580 ) (94,083 ) BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 $ 9,480 $ 2,296 $ 7,468 $ 10,633 $ 29,877 ALLOWANCES FOR SALES DURING 2007 22,303 27,999 28,420 72,982 151,704 ALLOWANCES/ADJUSTMENTS FOR SALES DURING PRIOR PERIODS 17,498   (2,776 ) 14,722 CREDITS ISSUED FOR PRIOR YEAR SALES (26,979 ) (2,206 ) (7,071 ) (6,725 ) (42,981 ) CREDITS ISSUED FOR SALES DURING 2007 (5,568 ) (25,194 ) (19,615 ) (65,275 ) (115,652 ) BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 $ 16,734 $ 2,895 $ 9,202 $ 8,839 $ 37,670 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: SALES RETURN ALLOWANCES DECREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER RETURNS OF ALKERAN® IV RESULTING FROM IMPROVED EXPIRATION DATING ON 2006 AND 2007 PRODUCT SALES. IN ADDITION, THALOMID® RETURNS WERE LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO A 2006 THALOMID® RETURNS INITIATIVE UNDERTAKEN BY ONE LARGE RETAIL PHARMACY CHAIN. IN RESPONSE TO THIS INITIATIVE, WE INTRODUCED SINGLE SLEEVES OF THALOMID® FOR SALE IN JUNE OF 2006. PREVIOUSLY, THALOMID® WAS SOLD ONLY IN MULTI-SLEEVE PACKAGE CONFIGURATIONS. THE ADDITIONAL TRADE PACKAGE CONFIGURATION ENABLED ALL RETAILERS TO MORE EFFICIENTLY MANAGE THEIR THALOMID® INVENTORIES RESULTING IN LOWER 2007 RETURNS. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY CURRENT YEAR THALOMID® RETURNS, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF A 2007 INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVE CONDUCTED BY SEVERAL MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS. UNDER THIS INITIATIVE, INVENTORY WAS REDISTRIBUTED AMONGST INDIVIDUAL CHAIN STORES IN A S.T.E.P.S.® COMPLIANT MANNER. THIS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THALOMID® RETURNS AS THESE MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS MORE EFFECTIVELY MANAGED THEIR INVENTORY LEVELS AT THE CHAIN STORES. DISCOUNTS INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED SALES OF REVLIMID®. MEDICAID REBATE ALLOWANCES INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 DUE TO INCREASED SALES OF REVLIMID® AS WELL AS PRICE INCREASES FOR BOTH THALOMID® AND REVLIMID®. OUR MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE AMOUNT FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES USING THE ESTIMATED MEDICAID DISPENSE QUANTITIES. REVLIMID® DISPENSES INCREASED RESULTING FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF THE 15MG AND 25MG STRENGTH TABLETS. 37 TABLE OF CONTENTS DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO REVLIMID®, THALOMID® AND ALKERAN® IV PRICE INCREASES, WHICH INCREASED THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN ANNUAL CONTRACT PRICING AVAILABLE TO FEDERALLY FUNDED HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND OUR WHOLESALE ACQUISITION COST. 2006 COMPARED TO 2005: SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCES INCREASED IN 2006, COMPARED TO 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO UNUSUALLY HIGH THALOMID® RETURNS FROM ONE SPECIFIC LARGE RETAIL PHARMACY CHAIN, WHICH OCCURRED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2006. THE RETURNS FROM THIS CUSTOMER WERE THE RESULTS OF ITS EFFORTS TO MORE AGGRESSIVELY MANAGE INVENTORY, OUR PACKAGE CONFIGURATION WHICH REQUIRED PHARMACIES TO PURCHASE FULL CARTONS OF UP TO TEN SLEEVES OF THALOMID® CAPSULES WITH EACH ORDER AND S.T.E.P.S. ®RELATED RESTRICTIONS, WHICH LIMITED THE CUSTOMERS ABILITY TO TRANSFER INVENTORIES BETWEEN ITS LOCATIONS. FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SALES RETURNS OF APPROXIMATELY 4% OF SALES. AS A RESULT OF THE HIGHER RETURNS ACTIVITY DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2006, WE RECORDED ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES TO INCREASE OUR RESERVE TO APPROXIMATELY 9% OF ALL ESTIMATED THALOMID® PHARMACY INVENTORIES. IN ADDITION, WE INTRODUCED SINGLE SLEEVE UNITS, BEGINNING JUNE 7, 2006 (RATHER THAN REQUIRING FULL CARTON PURCHASES) AND WE AMENDED OUR PRODUCT RETURNS POLICY TO INCLUDE A PRODUCT RETURNS HANDLING FEE. THESE MEASURES WERE DESIGNED TO ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO MORE EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THEIR INVENTORIES, SINCE THEY CAN NOW ORDER SMALLER QUANTITIES, AS WELL AS LIMIT OUR PRODUCT RETURNS EXPOSURE. TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE INCREASE IN SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCES ALSO RESULTED FROM HIGHER RETURNS OF EXPIRED ALKERAN® IV PRODUCT. SALES DISCOUNTS INCREASED IN 2006, COMPARED TO 2005, DUE TO HIGHER NET SALES. MEDICAID REBATE ALLOWANCES DECREASED IN 2006, COMPARED TO 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE NEW MEDICARE PART D LEGISLATION, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006. AS A RESULT OF THE NEW LEGISLATION, MANY PATIENTS WHO HAD BEEN ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THALOMID® THROUGH MEDICAID COVERAGE ARE NOW COVERED UNDER MEDICARE PART D. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE THALOMID® DECREASE ARE MEDICAID REBATE ALLOWANCES INCLUDED IN 2006 FOR REVLIMID® SALES. DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS INCREASED IN 2006, COMPARED TO 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO THALOMID® PRICE INCREASES, WHICH INCREASED THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN ANNUAL CONTRACT PRICING AVAILABLE TO FEDERALLY FUNDED HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND OUR WHOLESALE ACQUISITION COST. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACK ALLOWANCES WAS AN INCREASE IN ALKERAN® IV SALES TO CERTAIN PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES CONTRACT ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS AND ACCRUALS FOR REVLIMID®, WHICH WAS APPROVED IN THE U.S. IN DECEMBER 2005. OTHER REVENUES: 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: REVENUES FROM COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER SOURCES TOTALED $20.1 MILLION AND $18.2 MILLION FOR 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. THE $1.9 MILLION INCREASE IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN LICENSE FEES GENERATED FROM OUR S.T.E.P.S.® PROGRAM AND AN INCREASE IN UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD ENROLLMENT, COLLECTION AND STORAGE FEES GENERATED THROUGH OUR LIFEBANK USASM BUSINESS. ROYALTY REVENUE TOTALED $85.3 MILLION IN 2007, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $16.2 MILLION COMPARED TO 2006. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AMOUNTS RECEIVED FROM NOVARTIS ON SALES OF THEIR ENTIRE FAMILY OF RITALIN® DRUGS AND FOCALIN XRTM. 2006 COMPARED TO 2005: REVENUES FROM COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER SOURCES TOTALED $18.2 MILLION IN 2006, COMPARED TO $41.3 MILLION IN 2005. THE $23.1 MILLION DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCLUSION IN 2005 OF A $20.0 MILLION MILESTONE PAYMENT RECEIVED FROM NOVARTIS RELATING TO THE FDA MARKETING APPROVAL FOR FOCALIN XRTM. ROYALTY REVENUE TOTALED $69.1 MILLION IN 2006, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $19.1 MILLION COMPARED TO 2005. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AMOUNTS RECEIVED FROM NOVARTIS ON THEIR SALES OF FOCALIN XRTM. 38 TABLE OF CONTENTS COST OF GOODS SOLD: COST OF GOODS SOLD AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 2007 2006 2005 IN THOUSANDS $ COST OF GOODS SOLD $ 130,239 $ 125,892 $ 80,727 INCREASE FROM PRIOR YEAR $ 4,347 $ 45,165 $ 21,001 PERCENTAGE INCREASE FROM PRIOR YEAR 3.5 % 55.9 % 35.2 % PERCENTAGE OF NET PRODUCT SALES 10.0 % 15.5 % 18.1 % 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN REVLIMID® MATERIAL COSTS AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS RELATED TO BOTH REVLIMID® AND THALOMID® AS SALES INCREASED FOR THESE TWO PRODUCTS. THE INCREASE WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER ALKERAN® MATERIAL COSTS RELATED TO ALKERAN® FOR INJECTION. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET PRODUCT SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD DECREASED FROM 18.1% IN 2005 AND 15.5% IN 2006 TO 10.0% IN 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE GROWTH OF REVLIMID®, THE PRODUCTS LOWER COST RELATIVE TO OUR OTHER PRODUCTS AND SALES PRICE INCREASES. 2006 COMPARED TO 2005: COST OF GOODS SOLD WAS HIGHER IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER ALKERAN® COSTS. ALKERAN® COSTS TEND TO EXPERIENCE VARIABILITY DEPENDING ON THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE SPECIFIC UNITS SOLD DURING A GIVEN PERIOD. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN COST OF GOODS SOLD WERE HIGHER ROYALTIES ON THALOMID® WHICH RESULTED FROM HIGHER NET SALES AND THE INCLUSION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REVLIMID® SALES. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 2007 2006 2005 IN THOUSANDS $ RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT $ 398,590 $ 258,621 $ 190,834 INCREASE FROM PRIOR YEAR $ 139,969 $ 67,787 $ 29,982 PERCENTAGE INCREASE FROM PRIOR YEAR 54.1 % 35.5 % 18.6 % PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE 28.4 % 28.8 % 35.5 % 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED BY $140.0 MILLION IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO SPENDING RELATED TO CLINICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN SUPPORT OF MULTIPLE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING REVLIMID® AND OTHER IMIDS® ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF CANCERS, INCLUDING NHL AND CLL. EXPENSES ALSO INCREASED TO SUPPORT ONGOING RESEARCH OF OTHER COMPOUNDS, SUCH AS OUR KINASE AND LIGASE INHIBITOR PROGRAMS AND PLACENTAL-DERIVED STEM/PROGENITOR CELL PROGRAM. REGULATORY SPENDING INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF REVLIMID® IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE EXPENSE FOR 2007 ALSO INCLUDED A COMBINED $41.1 MILLION IN COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR EARLY STAGE COMPOUNDS WITH ARRAY BIOPHARMA INC. AND PTC THERAPEUTICS. IN 2007, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES CONSISTED OF $137.7 MILLION SPENT ON HUMAN PHARMACEUTICAL CLINICAL PROGRAMS, INCLUDING $41.1 MILLION FOR COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ARRANGEMENTS; $203.0 MILLION SPENT ON OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL PROGRAMS, INCLUDING TOXICOLOGY, ANALYTICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, DRUG DISCOVERY, QUALITY AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS; $42.8 MILLION SPENT ON BIOPHARMACEUTICAL DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS; AND $15.1 MILLION SPENT ON PLACENTAL STEM CELL AND BIOMATERIALS PROGRAMS. THESE EXPENDITURES SUPPORT ONGOING CLINICAL PROGRESS IN MULTIPLE PROPRIETARY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS FOR REVLIMID® AND THALOMID®, AND FOR OTHER COMPOUNDS SUCH AS: CC-10004, OUR LEAD ANTI-INFLAMMATORY COMPOUND THAT INHIBITS PDE-4, WHICH RESULTS IN THE INHIBITION OF MULTIPLE PROINFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS SUCH AS TNF-Α AND WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED IN PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS IN THE TREATMENT OF PSORIASIS AND PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS; CC-4047, CC-11006 AND CC-11050 WHICH ARE CURRENTLY EITHER BEING EVALUATED IN PHASE I CLINICAL TRIALS OR FOR WHICH PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS ARE PLANNED OR ONGOING; AND OUR KINASE AND LIGASE INHIBITOR PROGRAMS AS WELL AS THE PLACENTAL STEM CELL PROGRAM. 39 TABLE OF CONTENTS 2006 COMPARED TO 2005: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED BY $67.8 MILLION IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO SPENDING RELATED TO CLINICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT; MEDICAL INFORMATION AND EDUCATION EXPENSES, WHICH SUPPORT EDUCATING AND TRAINING THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY ON HEMATOLOGICAL CANCERS SUCH AS MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND MDS; AND ONGOING DEVELOPMENT OF A BROAD RANGE OF COMPOUNDS AND PLACENTAL-DERIVED STEM CELL PROGRAMS. IN 2006, WE SPENT $95.4 MILLION ON HUMAN PHARMACEUTICAL CLINICAL PROGRAMS; $109.1 MILLION ON OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL PROGRAMS, INCLUDING TOXICOLOGY, ANALYTICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, DRUG DISCOVERY, QUALITY AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS; $40.8 MILLION ON BIOPHARMACEUTICAL DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS; AND $13.3 MILLION ON PLACENTAL STEM CELL AND BIOMATERIALS PROGRAMS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE MAY CONTINUE TO GROW AS EARLIER STAGE COMPOUNDS ARE MOVED THROUGH THE PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL STAGES. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN PRECLINICAL TESTS AND CLINICAL TRIALS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, THE COST TO COMPLETE SUCH PROJECTS CAN VARY. THE DATA OBTAINED FROM THESE TESTS AND TRIALS MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING INTERPRETATION THAT COULD DELAY, LIMIT OR PREVENT A PROJECTS ADVANCEMENT THROUGH THE VARIOUS STAGES OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE COSTS INCURRED TO BRING A PROJECT TO COMPLETION.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 159, THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, OR SFAS 159, WHICH PROVIDES COMPANIES WITH AN OPTION TO REPORT SELECTED FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. SFAS 159 ESTABLISHES PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS DESIGNED TO FACILITATE COMPARISONS BETWEEN COMPANIES THAT CHOOSE DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTES FOR SIMILAR TYPES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND HIGHLIGHTS THE EFFECT OF A COMPANYS CHOICE TO USE FAIR VALUE ON ITS EARNINGS. IT ALSO REQUIRES A COMPANY TO DISPLAY THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR WHICH IT HAS CHOSEN TO USE FAIR VALUE ON THE FACE OF THE BALANCE SHEET. SFAS 159 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2008 AND IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN JUNE 2007, THE FASB RATIFIED EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE, OR EITF, ISSUE NO. 07-3, ACCOUNTING FOR NON-REFUNDABLE ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR GOODS OR SERVICES TO BE USED IN FUTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, OR EITF 07-3, WHICH PROVIDES THAT NON-REFUNDABLE ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE DEFERRED AND CAPITALIZED UNTIL THE RELATED GOODS ARE DELIVERED OR THE RELATED SERVICES ARE PERFORMED. EITF 07-3 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2008. IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB RATIFIED EITF ISSUE NO. 07-1, ACCOUNTING FOR COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OR EITF 07-1, WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON HOW THE PARTIES TO A COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENT SHOULD ACCOUNT FOR COSTS INCURRED AND REVENUE GENERATED ON SALES TO THIRD PARTIES, HOW SHARING PAYMENTS PURSUANT TO A COLLABORATION AGREEMENT SHOULD BE PRESENTED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT AND CERTAIN RELATED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. EITF 07-1 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 2009 ON A RETROSPECTIVE BASIS. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF EITF 07-1 WILL HAVE, IF ANY, ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IS ONE THAT IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENTS MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL: REVENUE RECOGNITION ON COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS: WE HAVE FORMED COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS AND ALLIANCES WITH SEVERAL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE IN THE FORM OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS. THE AGREEMENTS CALL FOR NONREFUNDABLE UPFRONT PAYMENTS, MILESTONE PAYMENTS ON ACHIEVING SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE EVENTS, AND IN SOME CASES ONGOING RESEARCH FUNDING. THE AGREEMENTS ALSO CONTEMPLATE ROYALTY PAYMENTS ON SALES IF AND WHEN THE COMPOUNDS RECEIVE REGULATORY MARKETING APPROVAL. OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES FOR ALL NONREFUNDABLE UPFRONT LICENSE FEES AND MILESTONE ARRANGEMENTS ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE PROVIDED IN THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONS STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN, OR SAB, NO. 101, REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS AMENDED BY SAB NO. 104, REVENUE RECOGNITION, OR SAB 104. IN ADDITION, WE FOLLOW THE PROVISIONS OF EITF ISSUE NO. 00-21, REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES, OR EITF 00-21, FOR MULTIPLE ELEMENT REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO OR MATERIALLY AMENDED AFTER JUNE 30, 2003. EITF 00-21 PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON HOW TO DETERMINE WHEN AN ARRANGEMENT THAT INVOLVES MULTIPLE REVENUE-GENERATING ACTIVITIES OR DELIVERABLES SHOULD BE DIVIDED INTO SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION PURPOSES, AND IF THIS DIVISION IS REQUIRED, HOW THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE ALLOCATED AMONG THE SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING. IF THE DELIVERABLES IN A REVENUE ARRANGEMENT CONSTITUTE SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING ACCORDING TO THE EITFS SEPARATION CRITERIA, THE REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY MUST BE DETERMINED FOR EACH IDENTIFIED UNIT. IF THE ARRANGEMENT IS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, THE REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY MUST BE DETERMINED FOR THE ENTIRE ARRANGEMENT. UNDER ARRANGEMENTS WHERE THE LICENSE FEES AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, NONREFUNDABLE UPFRONT LICENSE FEES ARE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE ON 46 TABLE OF CONTENTS A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE EXPECTED TERM OF OUR CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. REVENUES FROM THE ACHIEVEMENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES, IF DEEMED SUBSTANTIVE, ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE MILESTONES ARE ACHIEVED, AND THE MILESTONE PAYMENTS ARE DUE AND COLLECTIBLE. MILESTONES ARE CONSIDERED SUBSTANTIVE IF ALL OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS ARE MET: (1) THE MILESTONE IS NONREFUNDABLE; (2) ACHIEVEMENT OF THE MILESTONE WAS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED AT THE INCEPTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT; (3) SUBSTANTIVE EFFORT IS INVOLVED TO ACHIEVE THE MILESTONE; AND (4) THE AMOUNT OF THE MILESTONE APPEARS REASONABLE IN RELATION TO THE EFFORT EXPENDED, THE OTHER MILESTONES IN THE ARRANGEMENT AND THE RELATED RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ACHIEVEMENT OF THE MILESTONE. IF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET, WE WOULD RECOGNIZE A PROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF THE MILESTONE PAYMENT UPON RECEIPT AS REVENUE THAT CORRELATES TO WORK ALREADY PERFORMED AND THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE MILESTONE PAYMENT WILL BE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE AS WE COMPLETE OUR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS, MEDICAID REBATES AND CHARGEBACKS: OUR GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS, MEDICAID REBATES AND CHARGEBACKS ARE BASED ON OUR SALES AND/OR ESTIMATES OF THIRD-PARTY INVENTORIES. OUR ACCRUAL METHODOLOGIES ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW. THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER OUR S.T.E.P.S.® DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM. AMONG OTHER THINGS, S.T.E.P.S.®, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION AND RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM, REQUIRES PRESCRIBERS, PATIENTS AND DISPENSING PHARMACIES TO PARTICIPATE IN A REGISTRY AND PROHIBITS THE FILLING OF A THALOMID® ORDER UNLESS THE PHYSICIAN, PATIENT AND PHARMACY HAVE ALL OBTAINED AN APPROPRIATE AUTHORIZATION NUMBER. AUTOMATIC REFILLS ARE NOT PERMITTED UNDER THE PROGRAM. EACH PRESCRIPTION MAY NOT EXCEED A 28-DAY SUPPLY AND A NEW PRESCRIPTION IS REQUIRED WITH EACH ORDER. ALTHOUGH WE INVOICE THROUGH TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL WHOLESALERS, ALL THALOMID® ORDERS ARE DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY OVERNIGHT. WHOLESALER STOCKING OF THIS PRODUCT IS PROHIBITED. IN ADDITION, WE DO NOT OFFER COMMERCIAL DISCOUNTS ON OUR PRODUCTS TO PHARMACIES OR HOSPITALS AND, THEREFORE, HAVE NO COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE USE OF REVLIMID®, AND IS SOLD PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL. THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM INCLUDES MOST OF THE SAME ATTRIBUTES OF THE S.T.E.P.S.® PROGRAM MENTIONED ABOVE. ALKERAN® IS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN. ALKERAN® IS NOT SUBJECTED TO S.T.E.P.S.® OR REVASSIST® DISTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS. IT MAY BE STOCKED BY MULTIPLE WHOLESALERS AND PRESCRIBED BY PHYSICIANS WITHOUT OUR PREAUTHORIZATION. SALES RETURNS: WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATES TO THALOMID®, ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER KNOWN FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED AND INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DOES NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. WE DO NOT USE INFORMATION FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES IN ESTIMATING OUR PRODUCT RETURNS. AS INDICATED ABOVE, THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY TO DATE. EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS PRICE CHANGES FROM COMPETITORS AND INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW AND GENERIC COMPETING PRODUCTS COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR SALES RETURNS. OUR SALES RETURNS HAVE NOT BEEN IMPACTED THUS FAR BY SUCH EXTERNAL FACTORS; HOWEVER, WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR SUCH FACTORS. OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCES WERE $39.8 MILLION, $54.6 MILLION AND $21.3 MILLION IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH EQUATES TO AN ACCRUAL RATE OF 47 TABLE OF CONTENTS 2.7%, 5.7% AND 3.9% OF GROSS PRODUCT SALES IN EACH OF THE THREE RESPECTIVE YEARS. A 10% INCREASE IN OUR 2007 RETURNS RATE WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A $4.0 MILLION DECREASE IN OUR 2007 REPORTED REVENUE. MEDICAID REBATES: OUR MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE COMPUTED USING THE MEDICAID REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES. THIS FORMULA ESTABLISHES A QUARTERLY UNIT REBATE AMOUNT (URA) FOR ELIGIBLE DRUGS BASED ON OUR QUARTERLY AVERAGE MANUFACTURERS PRICE (AMP). WE APPLY THE CALCULATED AMP TO ESTIMATED QUARTERLY MEDICAID DISPENSE QUANTITIES FOR OUR PRODUCTS. ACTUAL MEDICAID DISPENSE QUANTITIES ARE REPORTED BY INDIVIDUAL STATES ON A 45-60 DAY QUARTER-END LAG. DIFFERENCES IN MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS RESULTING FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE ESTIMATED MEDICAID DISPENSE QUANTITIES AND ACTUAL MEDICAID DISPENSE QUANTITIES ARE ADJUSTED IN THE FOLLOWING PERIOD. THE URA CALCULATION ALLOWS FOR MANUFACTURER PRICE INCREASES BASED ON INCREASES IN THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX-ALL URBAN CONSUMERS. PRICE INCREASES IN EXCESS OF THE ALLOWABLE MEDICAID INCREASE RESULT IN A HIGHER UNIT REBATE AMOUNT. OUR MEDICAID REBATE ALLOWANCES INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED SALES OF REVLIMID® AS WELL AS PRICE INCREASES FOR BOTH THALOMID® AND REVLIMID® ABOVE THE ALLOWABLE MEDICAID INCREASE. DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS: AS INDICATED ABOVE, WE DO NOT OFFER COMMERCIAL DISCOUNTS ON OUR PRODUCTS TO PHARMACIES OR HOSPITALS AND, THEREFORE, HAVE NO COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS. OUR DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS RESULT FROM THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRICES PAID BY THE WHOLESALER TO ACQUIRE OUR PRODUCTS AND THE LOWER PRICES THE WHOLESALER IS LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO EXTEND TO FEDERALLY FUNDED HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS SUCH AS VETERANS AFFAIRS AND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ENTITIES AS WELL AS NON-FEDERAL PHS/340B ENTITIES. WE ESTIMATE DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACK ALLOWANCES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON THE PHARMACIES TO WHICH THE ORDER WAS DROP-SHIPPED AND ITS ELIGIBILITY FOR THE LOWER PRICING. ACTUAL CHARGEBACK CREDITS CLAIMED BY THE WHOLESALER MAY SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER FROM OUR ACCRUALS. THALOMID® CHARGEBACK ALLOWANCES ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO CURRENT PRICE CHANGES DUE TO THE CUMULATIVE INCREASE TO THE THALOMID® WHOLESALE ACQUISITION PRICE SINCE ITS INITIAL COMMERCIAL LAUNCH DATE. REVLIMID® CHARGEBACK ALLOWANCES ARE LESS SENSITIVE TO CURRENT WHOLESALE ACQUISITION COST PRICE INCREASES DUE TO ITS RELATIVELY RECENT COMMERCIAL LAUNCH DATE. OTHER GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD SALES DISCOUNTS ACCRUALS BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS AND WE RECORD DISTRIBUTOR SERVICES ACCRUALS BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES INCURRED FOR THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR SERVICES PROVIDED. INCOME TAXES: WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. WE PROVIDE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. OUR 2007 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS APPROXIMATELY 56.2%. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE EXCEEDS THE STATUTORY TAX RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO CERTAIN EXPENSES INCURRED IN TAXING JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES FOR WHICH WE DO NOT PRESENTLY RECEIVE A TAX BENEFIT AND NONDEDUCTIBLE EXPENSES WHICH INCLUDE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS. WE OPERATE UNDER AN INCENTIVE TAX HOLIDAY IN SWITZERLAND THAT EXPIRES IN 2015 AND EXEMPTS US FROM CERTAIN SWISS TAXES. LIKEWISE, EXPENSES CURRENTLY BEING INCURRED IN SWITZERLAND DO NOT PROVIDE A TAX BENEFIT. TO THE EXTENT WE RECEIVE APPROVALS IN MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, AND MANUFACTURE AND GENERATE TAXABLE INCOME SUBJECT TO OUR SWISS TAX HOLIDAY, WE WOULD EXPECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO BE LOWER IN THE FUTURE. WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 48 AND FSP FIN 48-1 EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007. FIN 48 CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTERPRISES FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, AND PRESCRIBES A RECOGNITION THRESHOLD AND MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF A TAX POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. FIN 48 ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION, CLASSIFICATION, INTEREST AND PENALTIES, ACCOUNTING IN INTERIM PERIODS, DISCLOSURE AND TRANSITION. WE HAD NO CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO THE ADOPTION. WE ACCOUNT FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS PART OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THESE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATE PRIMARILY TO ISSUES COMMON AMONG MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE APPLY A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES WHICH INCLUDE STUDIES PERFORMED BY INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS, ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY AND SUBJECT EXPERTS, EVALUATION OF PUBLIC 48 TABLE OF CONTENTS ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. WE PROVIDE ESTIMATES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. IF OUR ESTIMATES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ACTUAL OUTCOMES, OUR RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED. AT MARCH 31, 2005, WE DETERMINED IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD GENERATE SUFFICIENT TAXABLE INCOME TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND, AS A RESULT, ELIMINATED CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES, WHICH RESULTED IN US RECORDING AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT IN 2005 OF $42.6 MILLION AND AN INCREASE TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL OF $30.2 MILLION. THE DECISION TO ELIMINATE THE DEFERRED TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES WAS BASED ON AN EXTERNAL INDEPENDENT DATA MONITORING COMMITTEES, OR IDMC, ANALYSIS OF TWO PHASE III SPECIAL PROTOCOL ASSESSMENT MULTIPLE MYELOMA TRIALS AND THE CONCLUSION THAT THESE TRIALS EXCEEDED THE PRE-SPECIFIED STOPPING RULE. THE IDMC FOUND A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN TIME TO DISEASE PROGRESSION  THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT OF THESE PHASE III TRIALS  IN PATIENTS RECEIVING REVLIMID® PLUS DEXAMETHASONE COMPARED TO PATIENTS RECEIVING DEXAMETHASONE ALONE. THIS, IN CONCERT WITH OUR NINE CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS OF PROFITABILITY, LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD GENERATE SUFFICIENT TAXABLE INCOME TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE A PORTION WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR RECENT CUMULATIVE EARNINGS EXPERIENCE BY TAXING JURISDICTION, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, CARRYFORWARD PERIODS AVAILABLE TO US FOR TAX REPORTING PURPOSES, VARIOUS INCOME TAX STRATEGIES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT AND, TO THE EXTENT FUTURE EXPECTATIONS CHANGE, WE WOULD HAVE TO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THAT TIME. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION: WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, OR SFAS, NO. 123R, SHARE-BASED PAYMENT, OR SFAS 123R, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, WHICH REQUIRES THAT ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT THEIR FAIR VALUES. WE ADOPTED SFAS 123R USING THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION METHOD UNDER WHICH THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS 123R APPLY TO NEW AWARDS AND TO AWARDS MODIFIED, REPURCHASED, OR CANCELLED AFTER THE ADOPTION DATE. WE USE THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS ON THE DATE OF GRANT WHICH REQUIRES CERTAIN ESTIMATES TO BE MADE BY MANAGEMENT INCLUDING THE EXPECTED FORFEITURE RATE AND EXPECTED TERM OF THE OPTIONS. MANAGEMENT ALSO MAKES DECISIONS REGARDING THE METHOD OF CALCULATING THE EXPECTED VOLATILITIES AND THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE USED IN THE MODEL. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET THAT AFFECT THESE ESTIMATES COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE RESULTING COMPENSATION COST. ADDITIONALLY, COMPENSATION COST FOR THE PORTION OF AWARDS FOR WHICH THE REQUISITE SERVICE HAS NOT BEEN RENDERED THAT ARE OUTSTANDING AS OF THE ADOPTION DATE IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE REMAINING SERVICE PERIOD AFTER THE ADOPTION DATE (FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REFER TO NOTE 13 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT). OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES: A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF ANY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY BELOW ITS COST THAT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN CARRYING AMOUNT TO FAIR VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT IS CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AND A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE SECURITY ESTABLISHED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INCLUDE: SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE ISSUERS EARNINGS PERFORMANCE, CREDIT RATING, ASSET QUALITY, BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE ISSUER OPERATES, LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW OUR COST, OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE SECURITY AND OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD DIFFER FROM OUR ASSESSMENT. DURING 2007 AND 2006, WE DETERMINED THAT CERTAIN SECURITIES HAD SUSTAINED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS AND, AS A RESULT, WE RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES OF $5.5 MILLION AND $3.8 MILLION IN 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WERE RECORDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. 49 TABLE OF CONTENTS INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATED COMPANIES: OUR INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATED COMPANIES INCLUDES AN INVESTMENT IN ENTREMED WHICH HAD A CARRYING VALUE OF $12.2 MILLION AND A FAIR VALUE OF $12.4 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT WERE TO EXCEED ITS FAIR VALUE, WE WOULD REVIEW IT TO DETERMINE IF AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT HAS BEEN SUSTAINED. IF THE INVESTMENT IS DETERMINED TO HAVE SUSTAINED AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE, THE INVESTMENT WILL BE WRITTEN-DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE. SUCH AN EVALUATION IS JUDGMENTAL AND DEPENDENT ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. FACTORS THAT WE CONSIDER IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE HAS OCCURRED INCLUDE: THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITY IN RELATION TO ITS COST BASIS, THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT THE MARKET VALUE IS BELOW COST, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE INVESTEE AND OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. WE EVALUATE INFORMATION THAT WE ARE AWARE OF IN ADDITION TO QUOTED MARKET PRICES, IF ANY, IN DETERMINING IF AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE EXISTS. ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, OR LTIP, DESIGNED TO PROVIDE KEY OFFICERS AND EXECUTIVES WITH PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES CONTINGENT UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED CORPORATE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES COVERING A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLES RUNNING CONCURRENTLY ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2009 AND 2010. THE 2008 PERFORMANCE CYCLE WAS APPROVED BY THE MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION AND DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN FEBRUARY 2008 AND BEGAN ON JANUARY 1, 2008 WITH AN ENDING DATE OF DECEMBER 31, 2010. PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR EACH LTIP ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE THREE-YEAR CYCLE: 25% ON EARNINGS PER SHARE, 25% ON NET INCOME AND 50% ON REVENUE. PAYOUTS MAY BE IN THE RANGE OF 0% TO 200% OF THE PARTICIPANTS SALARY FOR THE 2008, 2009 AND 2010 PLANS. THE ESTIMATED PAYOUT FOR THE CONCLUDED 2007 CYCLE IS $6.2 MILLION AND THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL PAYOUT, ASSUMING OBJECTIVES ARE ACHIEVED AT THE MAXIMUM LEVEL FOR THE 2008, 2009 AND 2010 CYCLES, ARE $6.4 MILLION, $8.0 MILLION AND $10.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SUCH AWARDS ARE PAYABLE IN CASH OR, AT OUR DISCRETION, IN OUR COMMON STOCK BASED UPON OUR STOCK PRICE AT THE PAYOUT DATE. WE ACCRUE THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE LIABILITY OVER EACH THREE-YEAR CYCLE. PRIOR TO THE END OF A THREE-YEAR CYCLE, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT DURING THE CYCLE. UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT EQUAL TO THEIR TARGET AWARD, OR, IF HIGHER, AN AWARD BASED ON ACTUAL PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL. FOR 2007, 2006 AND 2005, WE RECOGNIZED EXPENSE RELATED TO THE LTIP OF $6.9 MILLION, $4.6 MILLION AND $4.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ACCRUALS RECORDED FOR THE LTIP ENTAIL MAKING CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE EARNINGS PER SHARE, NET INCOME AND REVENUES, THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED. ACCRUALS FOR THE LTIP ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND REVISED ACCORDINGLY SO THAT THE LIABILITY RECORDED REFLECTS UPDATED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PAYOUTS. IN ESTIMATING THE ACCRUALS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DATE FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, EXPECTED RESULTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, OPERATING TRENDS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICING AND COMPETITION. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES FORWARD-LOOKING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RISK OF LOSS IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES, CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE EARNINGS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, OUR MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS CONSISTED OF DERIVATIVES, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, UNSECURED CONVERTIBLE NOTES ISSUED BY US AND OUR NOTES PAYABLE TO SIEGFRIED. DERIVATIVES: WE PERIODICALLY UTILIZE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO ECONOMICALLY HEDGE NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY EXPOSURES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, WE HAD FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING TO HEDGE NON- 50 TABLE OF CONTENTS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ASSETS DENOMINATED IN SWISS FRANCS, BRITISH POUNDS, JAPANESE YEN AND U.S. DOLLARS. THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THESE CONTRACTS WAS $43.1 MILLION AND THEY EXPIRE WITHIN ONE YEAR. THE CONTRACTS ARE HEDGES OF RECEIVABLES AT U.K. AND SWISS FOREIGN ENTITIES AND ARE REMEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEM. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE NET UNREALIZED GAIN ON THE FORWARD CONTRACTS WAS APPROXIMATELY $0.1 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE. ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, WE BELIEVE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS A REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES. ASSUMING THAT THE YEAR-END EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO ADVERSELY CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10% DECREASE IN THE UNDERLYING CURRENCIES, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS WOULD DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $7.6 MILLION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS HEDGE ASSETS DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE ENTITYS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE OFFSET BY A CHANGE IN THE UNDERLYING VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEMS. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE CONSISTED OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES, MORTGAGE-BACKED OBLIGATIONS, CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES AND 1,939,598 SHARES OF PHARMION CORPORATION COMMON STOCK. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, FAIR VALUES AND RELATED WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE WERE AS FOLLOWS: DURATION LESS THAN MORE THAN 1 YEAR 1 TO 3 YEARS 3 TO 5 YEARS 5 YEARS TOTAL IN THOUSANDS $ PRINCIPAL AMOUNT $ 624,243 $ 694,011 $ 55,988 $ 10,000 $ 1,384,242 FAIR VALUE $ 625,830 $ 705,326 $ 56,943 $ 10,623 $ 1,398,722 AVERAGE INTEREST RATE 4.6 % 4.5 % 4.7 % 4.5 % 4.6 % PHARMION COMMON STOCK: AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, WE HELD A TOTAL OF 1,939,598 SHARES OF PHARMION CORPORATION COMMON STOCK, WHICH HAD AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $121.9 MILLION (BASED ON THE CLOSING PRICE REPORTED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SECURITIES DEALERS AUTOMATED QUOTATIONS, OR NASDAQ), AND, WHICH EXCEEDED THE COST BY APPROXIMATELY $101.7 MILLION. THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED THE COST (I.E., THE UNREALIZED GAIN) WAS INCLUDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN THE STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY SECTION OF THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PHARMION COMMON STOCK INVESTMENT IS SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE VOLATILITY AND ANY INCREASE OR DECREASE IN PHARMIONS COMMON STOCK QUOTED MARKET PRICE WILL HAVE A SIMILAR PERCENTAGE INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT (REFER TO NOTE 2 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION RELATED TO THE PROPOSED MERGER WITH PHARMION). CONVERTIBLE DEBT: IN JUNE 2003, WE ISSUED AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $400.0 MILLION OF UNSECURED CONVERTIBLE NOTES. THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES HAVE A FIVE-YEAR TERM AND A COUPON RATE OF 1.75% PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY. THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 CAN BE CONVERTED AT ANY TIME INTO 16,227,441 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A STOCK-SPLIT ADJUSTED CONVERSION PRICE OF $12.1125 PER SHARE (FOR MORE INFORMATION REFER TO NOTE 9 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE OF $196.6 MILLION BY APPROXIMATELY $514.4 MILLION, WHICH WE BELIEVE REFLECTS THE INCREASE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO $46.21 PER SHARE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007. ASSUMING OTHER FACTORS ARE HELD CONSTANT, AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES GENERALLY RESULTS IN A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF FIXED-RATE CONVERTIBLE DEBT, BUT DOES NOT IMPACT THE CARRYING VALUE, AND AN INCREASE IN OUR STOCK PRICE GENERALLY RESULTS IN AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT, BUT DOES NOT IMPACT THE CARRYING VALUE. 51 TABLE OF CONTENTS NOTE PAYABLE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NOTE PAYABLE TO SIEGFRIED APPROXIMATED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTE OF $26.2 MILLION. ASSUMING OTHER FACTORS ARE HELD CONSTANT, AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES GENERALLY WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NOTE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NOTE WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR / SWISS FRANC EXCHANGE RATE. THE NOTE IS DENOMINATED IN SWISS FRANCS. DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION CELGENE CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY WE OR OUR) IS A GLOBAL BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN THE DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF INNOVATIVE THERAPIES DESIGNED TO TREAT CANCER AND IMMUNE-INFLAMMATORY RELATED DISEASES. OUR PRIMARY COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS INCLUDE REVLIMID® AND THALOMID®. REVLIMID® IS AN ORAL IMMUNOMODULATORY DRUG APPROVED BY THE FDA, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, OR EC, SWISSMEDIC AND THE AUSTRALIAN THERAPEUTIC GOODS ADMINISTRATION FOR TREATMENT IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE FOR MULTIPLE MYELOMA PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY. REVLIMID® IS ALSO APPROVED BY THE FDA AND CANADIAN THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS DIRECTORATE FOR TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH TRANSFUSION-DEPENDENT ANEMIA DUE TO LOW- OR INTERMEDIATE-1-RISK MDS, ASSOCIATED WITH A DELETION 5Q CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITY WITH OR WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITIES. THALOMID® WAS APPROVED BY THE FDA IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE FOR THE TREATMENT OF NEWLY DIAGNOSED MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND FOR THE TREATMENT OF ACUTE CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF MODERATE TO SEVERE ERYTHEMA NODOSUM LEPROSUM, OR ENL, AND AS MAINTENANCE THERAPY FOR PREVENTION AND SUPPRESSION OF THE CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATION OF ENL RECURRENCE. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE MADE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND THE DRUG CANDIDATES IN OUR PIPELINE ARE AT VARIOUS STAGES OF PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT. THESE CANDIDATES INCLUDE OUR IMIDS® COMPOUNDS, WHICH ARE A CLASS OF COMPOUNDS PROPRIETARY TO US AND HAVING CERTAIN IMMUNOMODULATORY AND OTHER BIOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT PROPERTIES IN ADDITION TO OUR LEADING ORAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PRIMARY COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS AND DEPTH OF OUR PRODUCT PIPELINE PROVIDE THE CATALYSTS FOR OUR FUTURE GROWTH. FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, REGULATORY APPROVALS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES, THE TIMING AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS LAUNCHED 32 TABLE OF CONTENTS BY US OR COMPETING COMPANIES, THE TIMING OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES, CHALLENGES TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL COSTS. SEE ALSO THE RISK FACTORS DISCUSSION CONTAINED IN PART I, ITEM 1A. SOME OF THE MORE SIGNFICANT FACTORS THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON INCLUDE: THE ABILITY OF REVLIMID® TO SUCCESSFULLY PENETRATE AND EXPAND IN RELEVANT MARKETS, OUR ABILITY TO ADVANCE CLINICAL AND REGULATORY PROGRAMS AND COMPETITIVE RISKS. THE ABILITY OF REVLIMID® TO SUCCESSFULLY PENETRATE AND EXPAND IN RELEVANT MARKETS: THE INTRODUCTION OF REVLIMID® IN THE UNITED STATES HAS INCLUDED AMONG OTHER THINGS, REGISTERING PHYSICIANS IN THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE USE OF REVLIMID® AND PARTNERING WITH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES TO ENSURE, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE, SAFE AND RAPID DISTRIBUTION OF REVLIMID®. IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, REVLIMID® WAS GRANTED APPROVAL BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, SWISSMEDIC, CANADIAN THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS DIRECTORATE AND AUSTRALIAN THERAPEUTIC GOODS ADMINISTRATION WITH PRODUCT LAUNCHES ALREADY INITIATED IN SEVERAL OF THE APPROVED COUNTRIES. WE ARE ALSO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE APPROPRIATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES TO DETERMINE NEXT STEPS FOR PRICING, REIMBURSEMENT AND DISTRIBUTION IN THOSE COUNTRIES IN WHICH REVLIMID® HAS NOT YET BEEN LAUNCHED. WE DO NOT HAVE LONG-TERM DATA ON THE USE OF REVLIMID® AND CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER REVLIMID® WILL CONTINUE TO GAIN WIDESPREAD ACCEPTANCE FROM REGULATORS, PHYSICIANS, PATIENTS, OPINION LEADERS, GOVERNMENT HEALTH AGENCIES AND PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS. THE ABILITY TO ADVANCE REGULATORY AND CLINICAL PROGRAMS: A MARKETING AUTHORIZATION APPLICATION, OR MAA, SEEKING APPROVAL TO MARKET REVLIMID® FOR TREATMENT OF TRANSFUSION-DEPENDENT ANEMIA DUE TO LOW-OR-INTERMEDIATE-1 RISK MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES ASSOCIATED WITH A DELETION 5Q CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITY WITH OR WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITIES WAS EVALUATED BY THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCYS, OR EMEA, COMMITTEE FOR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE, OR CHMP AND A NEGATIVE OPINION ISSUED IN JANUARY 2008. THE CHMP CONCLUDED THAT LENALIDOMIDE IS EFFICACIOUS IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM DELETION 5Q MDS. BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE CHMP FROM THE UNCONTROLLED, OPEN-LABEL, 148-PATIENT PHASE II STUDY (MDS-003), THE CHMP WAS NOT CONVINCED THE DATA WERE SUFFICIENT TO ASSURE SAFETY. WE INTEND TO APPLY FOR A REEXAMINATION OF THE CHMP OPINION IN ACCORDANCE WITH RELEVANT EMEA PROCEDURES. OTHER INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY INITIATIVES INCLUDE MAAS UNDER EVALUATION IN NEW ZEALAND AND ISRAEL. IN APRIL 2007, THE EASTERN COOPERATIVE ONCOLOGY GROUP REPORTED THAT ITS DATA MONITORING COMMITTEES REVIEW OF PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM A LARGE, RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL FOR PATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED MULTIPLE MYELOMA FOUND THAT THE USE OF A LOW-DOSE OF DEXAMETHASONE IN COMBINATION WITH REVLIMID® SUGGESTS SURVIVAL ADVANTAGE FOR PATIENTS WHEN COMPARED TO THE HIGHER, STANDARD-DOSE OF DEXAMETHASONE THAT IS USED IN COMBINATION WITH REVLIMID® TO TREAT THE DISEASE. THESE RESULTS WERE ALSO PRESENTED AT THE JUNE 2007 ANNUAL AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY MEDICAL CONFERENCE AND UPDATED AT THE DECEMBER 2007 ANNUAL AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HEMATOLOGY MEETING. THE REGULATORY UTILITY OF THESE FINDINGS WILL BE DISCUSSED WITH THE FDA. A MAJOR OBJECTIVE OF OUR ON-GOING CLINICAL PROGRAMS IS TO BROADEN OUR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE FULL POTENTIAL OF REVLIMID® AND OUR OTHER PROPRIETARY IMIDS® COMPOUNDS AND TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THEM IN A BROAD RANGE OF HEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES AND OTHER CANCERS. OUR NEAR-TERM FOCUS IS ON EVALUATING REVLIMID® AS A TREATMENT OF CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA, OR CLL, AND AGGRESSIVE NON-HODGKINS LYMPHOMAS, OR NHL. IN NOVEMBER 2007, REVLIMID® WAS GRANTED ORPHAN MEDICINAL PRODUCT DESIGNATION BY THE EC FOR TREATMENT OF CLL. COMPETITIVE RISKS: WHILE COMPETITION COULD LIMIT REVLIMID® AND THALOMID® SALES, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT COMPETING PRODUCTS WOULD ELIMINATE THEIR USE ENTIRELY. MOREOVER, WHILE GENERIC COMPETITORS COULD SEEK TO CHALLENGE OUR THALOMID® FRANCHISE, WE OWN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WHICH INCLUDES, FOR EXAMPLE, U.S. PATENTS COVERING OUR S.T.E.P.S.® DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM FOR THE SAFE DISTRIBUTION AND APPROPRIATE USE OF THALIDOMIDE, WHICH ALL PHYSICIANS, PATIENTS AND PHARMACIES PRESCRIBING, RECEIVING OR DISPENSING THALIDOMIDE IN THE UNITED STATES MUST FOLLOW. WE ALSO HAVE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO SEVERAL ISSUED PATENTS COVERING THE USE OF THALOMID® IN ONCOLOGY AND OTHER THERAPEUTIC AREAS. 33 TABLE OF CONTENTS COMPANY BACKGROUND  IN 1986, WE WERE SPUN OFF FROM CELANESE CORPORATION AND, IN JULY 1987, WE COMPLETED AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING. INITIALLY, OUR OPERATIONS INVOLVED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF CHEMICAL AND BIOTREATMENT PROCESSES FOR THE CHEMICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES. BETWEEN 1990 AND 1998, OUR REVENUES WERE DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM THE DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY OF CHIRALLY PURE INTERMEDIATES TO PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES FOR USE IN NEW DRUG DEVELOPMENT. BY 1998, SALES OF CHIRALLY PURE INTERMEDIATES BECAME A LESS INTEGRAL PART OF OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS AND, IN JANUARY 1998, WE SOLD THE CHIRAL INTERMEDIATES BUSINESS TO CAMBREX CORPORATION.  IN JULY 1998, WE RECEIVED OUR FIRST APPROVAL FOR THALOMID® FROM THE FDA WHICH ALLOWED US TO MARKET THALOMID® FOR THE TREATMENT AND SUPPRESSION OF ENL, AN INFLAMMATORY COMPLICATION OF LEPROSY. IN MAY 2006, THE FDA APPROVED THALOMID® IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE FOR THE TREATMENT OF NEWLY DIAGNOSED MULTIPLE MYELOMA.  IN APRIL 2000, WE ENTERED INTO A DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH NOVARTIS PHARMA AG IN WHICH WE GRANTED TO NOVARTIS AN EXCLUSIVE WORLDWIDE LICENSE TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND MARKET FOCALINTM, OUR CHIRALLY PURE VERSION OF RITALIN®. THE AGREEMENT PROVIDED FOR SIGNIFICANT UPFRONT AND MILESTONE PAYMENTS TO US BASED ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF VARIOUS STAGES IN THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, WE SELL FOCALINTM TO NOVARTIS AS WELL AS RECEIVE ROYALTIES ON ALL OF NOVARTIS SALES OF FOCALIN XRTM AND RITALIN® FAMILY OF ADHD-RELATED PRODUCTS.  IN AUGUST 2000, WE ACQUIRED SIGNAL PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., CURRENTLY KNOWN AS SIGNAL PHARMACEUTICALS LLC, D/B/A CELGENE RESEARCH SAN DIEGO, A BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY FOCUSED ON THE DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF DRUGS THAT REGULATE GENES ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE.  IN NOVEMBER 2001, WE LICENSED TO PHARMION CORPORATION EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS RELATING TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIAL USE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COVERING THALIDOMIDE AND S.T.E.P.S.® IN ALL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA, JAPAN, CHINA, TAIWAN AND KOREA (SEE OUR REFERENCES BELOW TO THE DECEMBER 2004 AMENDMENT WITH RESPECT TO THESE TERRITORIES).  IN DECEMBER 2002, WE ACQUIRED ANTHROGENESIS CORP., WHICH WAS A PRIVATELY HELD NEW JERSEY-BASED BIOTHERAPEUTICS COMPANY AND CORD BLOOD BANKING BUSINESS DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE RECOVERY OF STEM CELLS FROM HUMAN PLACENTAL TISSUES FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF FULL-TERM, SUCCESSFUL PREGNANCIES. ANTHROGENESIS, D/B/A CELGENE CELLULAR THERAPEUTICS, OR CCT, NOW OPERATES AS A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF CELGENE CORPORATION, ENGAGED IN THE RESEARCH, RECOVERY, CULTURE-EXPANSION, PRESERVATION, DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF PLACENTAL STEM CELLS AS THERAPEUTIC AGENTS.  IN MARCH 2003, WE ENTERED INTO A SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT WITH GLAXOSMITHKLINE, OR GSK, TO DISTRIBUTE, PROMOTE AND SELL ALKERAN®, OR MELPHALAN, A THERAPY APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR THE PALLIATIVE TREATMENT OF MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND CARCINOMA OF THE OVARY. THE AGREEMENT REQUIRES THAT WE PURCHASE ALKERAN® FROM GSK AND DISTRIBUTE THE PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER THE CELGENE LABEL. THE AGREEMENT HAS BEEN EXTENDED THROUGH MARCH 31, 2009.  IN OCTOBER 2004, WE ACQUIRED PENN T LIMITED, OR PENN T, A SUPPLIER OF THALOMID®. THROUGH MANUFACTURING AGREEMENTS ACQUIRED IN THE TRANSACTION, WE ARE ABLE TO CONTROL MANUFACTURING FOR THALOMID®. IN THE TRANSACTION, WE ALSO ACQUIRED A PRODUCT SUPPLY AGREEMENT TO EXCLUSIVELY SUPPLY PHARMION WITH THALIDOMIDE, THEREBY ENABLING US TO INCREASE OUR PARTICIPATION IN THALIDOMIDE SALES IN KEY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. SUBSEQUENTLY, IN DECEMBER 2004, WE AMENDED THE THALIDOMIDE SUPPLY AGREEMENT WITH PHARMION AND GRANTED THEM LICENSE RIGHTS IN ADDITIONAL TERRITORIES. AS AMENDED, THE TERRITORY LICENSED TO PHARMION IS FOR ALL COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, MEXICO, JAPAN AND CHINA, EXCLUDING HONG KONG.  IN DECEMBER 2005, THE FDA APPROVED REVLIMID® FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH TRANSFUSION-DEPENDENT ANEMIA DUE TO LOW- OR INTERMEDIATE-1-RISK MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES ASSOCIATED WITH A DELETION 5Q CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITY WITH OR WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITIES AND, IN JUNE 2006, THE FDA APPROVED REVLIMID® FOR TREATMENT IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE FOR MULTIPLE 34 TABLE OF CONTENTS MYELOMA PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY. IN JUNE 2007, REVLIMID® WAS GRANTED FULL MARKETING AUTHORIZATION BY THE EC FOR USE IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE AS A TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE MYELOMA WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY AND IN SEPTEMBER 2007, APPROVAL WAS GRANTED BY SWISSMEDIC AND IN JANUARY 2008 BY THE AUSTRALIAN DRUG EVALUATION COMMITTEE FOR USE IN THIS SAME INDICATION. IN NOVEMBER 2007 THE EC GRANTED REVLIMID® ORPHAN MEDICINAL PRODUCT DESIGNATION FOR TREATMENT OF CLL. IN ADDITION, IN JANUARY 2008, REVLIMID® WAS APPROVED BY THE CANADIAN THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS DIRECTORATE FOR TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH MDS, ASSOCIATED WITH A DELETION 5Q CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITY WITH OR WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITIES.  IN NOVEMBER 2006, WE ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL 20,000,000 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE OF $51.60 PER SHARE WITH NET PROCEEDS OF $1.006 BILLION.  IN DECEMBER 2006, WE PURCHASED AN API MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FROM SIEGFRIED LOCATED IN ZOFINGEN, SWITZERLAND. THE API FACILITY HAS THE CAPABILITY TO PRODUCE MULTIPLE DRUG SUBSTANCES AND IS BEING USED TO PRODUCE REVLIMID® AND THALOMID® API TO SUPPLY GLOBAL MARKETS. THE FACILITY ALSO MAY BE USED TO PRODUCE DRUG SUBSTANCE FOR OUR FUTURE DRUGS AND DRUG CANDIDATES.  IN NOVEMBER 2007, WE ANNOUNCED THE SIGNING OF A DEFINITIVE MERGER AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO WHICH WE AGREED TO ACQUIRE PHARMION CORPORATION. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, WE WILL ACQUIRE ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF PHARMION COMMON STOCK FOR $72.00 PER SHARE PAYABLE IN A COMBINATION OF CASH AND SHARES OF CELGENE COMMON STOCK. THE TRANSACTION HAS BEEN UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED BY THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS OF BOTH COMPANIES AND IS SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS INCLUDING THE APPROVAL OF THE ACQUISITION BY PHARMION STOCKHOLDERS AND RECEIPT OF ANTITRUST CLEARANCES. THE HART-SCOTT-RODINO ACT, OR HSR, THIRTY DAY WAITING PERIOD HAS EXPIRED WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION, OR FTC, REQUESTING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO THE MERGER. IN ADDITION, THE BUNDESKARTELLAMT, GERMANYS FEDERAL CARTEL OFFICE IN CHARGE OF REVIEWING THE ANTITRUST ASPECTS OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, HAS CLEARED CELGENES PENDING ACQUISITION OF PHARMION CORPORATION. ON FEBRUARY 5, 2008 THE FORM S-4 RELATING TO THE MERGER OF PHARMION AND CELGENE WAS DECLARED EFFECTIVE BY THE SEC. THE MERGER IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN MARCH 2008. REFER TO NOTE 2 OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN SALES WERE PRICE INCREASES AND INCREASED SALES FROM OUR EUROPEAN NAMED PATIENT PROGRAM, OR NPP, WHICH OFFERS EUROPEAN PATIENTS IN NEED OF TREATMENT ACCESS TO REVLIMID® ON A COMPASSIONATE USE BASIS. NET SALES OF THALOMID® WERE HIGHER IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO PRICE INCREASES, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES VOLUMES AS PRESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN DECLINED, REFLECTING THE EXPANDED USE OF REVLIMID®. ALKERAN® NET SALES WERE HIGHER IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED PRICES AND A DECREASE IN PRODUCT RETURNS. 2006 COMPARED TO 2005: IN 2006, NET SALES OF REVLIMID® WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE DECEMBER 2005 FDA APPROVAL FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH TRANSFUSION-DEPENDENT ANEMIA DUE TO LOW- OR INTERMEDIATE-1-RISK MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES ASSOCIATED WITH A DELETION 5Q CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITY WITH OR WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITIES AND THE JUNE 2006 APPROVAL FOR TREATMENT IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE OF PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE MYELOMA WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE PRIOR THERAPY. REVLIMID® NET SALES RECORDED IN 2005 RELATED TO INITIAL STOCKING AT CERTAIN CONTRACTED PHARMACIES FOLLOWING THE PRODUCTS APPROVAL ON DECEMBER 27, 2005. THALOMID® NET SALES WERE HIGHER IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FDAS MAY 2006 APPROVAL FOR TREATMENT IN COMBINATION WITH DEXAMETHASONE OF NEWLY DIAGNOSED MULTIPLE MYELOMA. PRICE INCREASES IMPLEMENTED AS WE SHIFTED TOWARDS A COST OF THERAPY PRICING STRUCTURE AS OPPOSED TO A PRICE PER MILLIGRAM BASIS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE INCREASE IN THALOMID® SALES WERE SALES VOLUME DECREASES AND HIGHER GROSS TO NET SALES ADJUSTMENTS. ALKERAN® NET SALES WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN 2006, COMPARED TO 2005 AS SALES BENEFITED FROM AN INCREASE IN ALKERAN® TABLET SALES VOLUMES, AS WELL AS PRICE INCREASES IMPLEMENTED DURING 2006, PARTICULARLY IN ALKERAN® IVS (INJECTABLES). LARGELY OFFSETTING THE INCREASE IN SALES WERE HIGHER GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS AND DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS. SALES OF FOCALINTM, WHICH IS SOLD EXCLUSIVELY TO NOVARTIS AND IS DEPENDENT ON THE TIMING OF ORDERS FROM NOVARTIS FOR THEIR COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION, WERE HIGHER IN 2006, COMPARED TO 2005, DUE TO INCREASED END-MARKET DEMAND. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS, SALES DISCOUNTS, MEDICAID REBATES AND DISTRIBUTOR CHARGE-BACKS AND SERVICE FEES. WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATES TO THALOMID®, ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER KNOWN FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED AND INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DOES NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. WE DO NOT USE INFORMATION FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES IN ESTIMATING OUR PRODUCT RETURNS. THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY TO DATE. SALES DISCOUNTS ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS. MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL PAYMENT DATA AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAID BENEFICIARY UTILIZATION APPLIED TO THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE AMOUNT FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. 36 TABLE OF CONTENTS DISTRIBUTOR CHARGE-BACK ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PRODUCT ACQUISITION PRICES PAID BY WHOLESALERS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT CONTRACT PRICING PAID BY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS COVERED UNDER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED PROGRAMS. DISTRIBUTOR SERVICES ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES TO BE PAID TO THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS AND THE BALANCE IN THE RELATED ALLOWANCE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 WERE AS FOLLOWS: RETURNS DISTRIBUTOR AND MEDICAID CHARGEBACKS ALLOWANCES DISCOUNTS REBATES AND SERVICES TOTAL IN THOUSANDS $ BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 $ 9,600 $ 837 $ 5,534 $ 3,721 $ 19,692 ALLOWANCES FOR SALES DURING 2005 19,476 10,948 35,009 35,926 101,359 ALLOWANCES FOR SALES DURING PRIOR PERIODS 1,780  89  1,869 CREDITS ISSUED FOR PRIOR YEAR SALES (11,380 ) (834 ) (5,623 ) (3,264 ) (21,101 ) CREDITS ISSUED FOR SALES DURING 2005 (14,459 ) (9,504 ) (14,049 ) (29,605 ) (67,617 ) BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 $ 5,017 $ 1,447 $ 20,960 $ 6,778 $ 34,202 ALLOWANCES FOR SALES DURING 2006 23,944 18,847 22,353 57,750 122,894 ALLOWANCES FOR SALES DURING PRIOR PERIODS 30,607 34   30,641 CREDITS ISSUED FOR PRIOR YEAR SALES (35,624 ) (1,481 ) (20,357 ) (6,315 ) (63,777 ) CREDITS ISSUED FOR SALES DURING 2006 (14,464 ) (16,551 ) (15,488 ) (47,580 ) (94,083 ) BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 $ 9,480 $ 2,296 $ 7,468 $ 10,633 $ 29,877 ALLOWANCES FOR SALES DURING 2007 22,303 27,999 28,420 72,982 151,704 ALLOWANCES/ADJUSTMENTS FOR SALES DURING PRIOR PERIODS 17,498   (2,776 ) 14,722 CREDITS ISSUED FOR PRIOR YEAR SALES (26,979 ) (2,206 ) (7,071 ) (6,725 ) (42,981 ) CREDITS ISSUED FOR SALES DURING 2007 (5,568 ) (25,194 ) (19,615 ) (65,275 ) (115,652 ) BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 $ 16,734 $ 2,895 $ 9,202 $ 8,839 $ 37,670 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: SALES RETURN ALLOWANCES DECREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER RETURNS OF ALKERAN® IV RESULTING FROM IMPROVED EXPIRATION DATING ON 2006 AND 2007 PRODUCT SALES. IN ADDITION, THALOMID® RETURNS WERE LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO A 2006 THALOMID® RETURNS INITIATIVE UNDERTAKEN BY ONE LARGE RETAIL PHARMACY CHAIN. IN RESPONSE TO THIS INITIATIVE, WE INTRODUCED SINGLE SLEEVES OF THALOMID® FOR SALE IN JUNE OF 2006. PREVIOUSLY, THALOMID® WAS SOLD ONLY IN MULTI-SLEEVE PACKAGE CONFIGURATIONS. THE ADDITIONAL TRADE PACKAGE CONFIGURATION ENABLED ALL RETAILERS TO MORE EFFICIENTLY MANAGE THEIR THALOMID® INVENTORIES RESULTING IN LOWER 2007 RETURNS. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY CURRENT YEAR THALOMID® RETURNS, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF A 2007 INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVE CONDUCTED BY SEVERAL MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS. UNDER THIS INITIATIVE, INVENTORY WAS REDISTRIBUTED AMONGST INDIVIDUAL CHAIN STORES IN A S.T.E.P.S.® COMPLIANT MANNER. THIS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THALOMID® RETURNS AS THESE MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS MORE EFFECTIVELY MANAGED THEIR INVENTORY LEVELS AT THE CHAIN STORES. DISCOUNTS INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED SALES OF REVLIMID®. MEDICAID REBATE ALLOWANCES INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 DUE TO INCREASED SALES OF REVLIMID® AS WELL AS PRICE INCREASES FOR BOTH THALOMID® AND REVLIMID®. OUR MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON THE MEDICAID UNIT REBATE AMOUNT FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES USING THE ESTIMATED MEDICAID DISPENSE QUANTITIES. REVLIMID® DISPENSES INCREASED RESULTING FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF THE 15MG AND 25MG STRENGTH TABLETS. 37 TABLE OF CONTENTS DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO REVLIMID®, THALOMID® AND ALKERAN® IV PRICE INCREASES, WHICH INCREASED THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN ANNUAL CONTRACT PRICING AVAILABLE TO FEDERALLY FUNDED HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND OUR WHOLESALE ACQUISITION COST. 2006 COMPARED TO 2005: SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCES INCREASED IN 2006, COMPARED TO 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO UNUSUALLY HIGH THALOMID® RETURNS FROM ONE SPECIFIC LARGE RETAIL PHARMACY CHAIN, WHICH OCCURRED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2006. THE RETURNS FROM THIS CUSTOMER WERE THE RESULTS OF ITS EFFORTS TO MORE AGGRESSIVELY MANAGE INVENTORY, OUR PACKAGE CONFIGURATION WHICH REQUIRED PHARMACIES TO PURCHASE FULL CARTONS OF UP TO TEN SLEEVES OF THALOMID® CAPSULES WITH EACH ORDER AND S.T.E.P.S. ®RELATED RESTRICTIONS, WHICH LIMITED THE CUSTOMERS ABILITY TO TRANSFER INVENTORIES BETWEEN ITS LOCATIONS. FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SALES RETURNS OF APPROXIMATELY 4% OF SALES. AS A RESULT OF THE HIGHER RETURNS ACTIVITY DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2006, WE RECORDED ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES TO INCREASE OUR RESERVE TO APPROXIMATELY 9% OF ALL ESTIMATED THALOMID® PHARMACY INVENTORIES. IN ADDITION, WE INTRODUCED SINGLE SLEEVE UNITS, BEGINNING JUNE 7, 2006 (RATHER THAN REQUIRING FULL CARTON PURCHASES) AND WE AMENDED OUR PRODUCT RETURNS POLICY TO INCLUDE A PRODUCT RETURNS HANDLING FEE. THESE MEASURES WERE DESIGNED TO ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO MORE EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THEIR INVENTORIES, SINCE THEY CAN NOW ORDER SMALLER QUANTITIES, AS WELL AS LIMIT OUR PRODUCT RETURNS EXPOSURE. TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE INCREASE IN SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCES ALSO RESULTED FROM HIGHER RETURNS OF EXPIRED ALKERAN® IV PRODUCT. SALES DISCOUNTS INCREASED IN 2006, COMPARED TO 2005, DUE TO HIGHER NET SALES. MEDICAID REBATE ALLOWANCES DECREASED IN 2006, COMPARED TO 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE NEW MEDICARE PART D LEGISLATION, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006. AS A RESULT OF THE NEW LEGISLATION, MANY PATIENTS WHO HAD BEEN ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THALOMID® THROUGH MEDICAID COVERAGE ARE NOW COVERED UNDER MEDICARE PART D. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE THALOMID® DECREASE ARE MEDICAID REBATE ALLOWANCES INCLUDED IN 2006 FOR REVLIMID® SALES. DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS INCREASED IN 2006, COMPARED TO 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO THALOMID® PRICE INCREASES, WHICH INCREASED THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN ANNUAL CONTRACT PRICING AVAILABLE TO FEDERALLY FUNDED HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND OUR WHOLESALE ACQUISITION COST. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACK ALLOWANCES WAS AN INCREASE IN ALKERAN® IV SALES TO CERTAIN PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES CONTRACT ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS AND ACCRUALS FOR REVLIMID®, WHICH WAS APPROVED IN THE U.S. IN DECEMBER 2005. OTHER REVENUES: 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: REVENUES FROM COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER SOURCES TOTALED $20.1 MILLION AND $18.2 MILLION FOR 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. THE $1.9 MILLION INCREASE IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN LICENSE FEES GENERATED FROM OUR S.T.E.P.S.® PROGRAM AND AN INCREASE IN UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD ENROLLMENT, COLLECTION AND STORAGE FEES GENERATED THROUGH OUR LIFEBANK USASM BUSINESS. ROYALTY REVENUE TOTALED $85.3 MILLION IN 2007, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $16.2 MILLION COMPARED TO 2006. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AMOUNTS RECEIVED FROM NOVARTIS ON SALES OF THEIR ENTIRE FAMILY OF RITALIN® DRUGS AND FOCALIN XRTM. 2006 COMPARED TO 2005: REVENUES FROM COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER SOURCES TOTALED $18.2 MILLION IN 2006, COMPARED TO $41.3 MILLION IN 2005. THE $23.1 MILLION DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCLUSION IN 2005 OF A $20.0 MILLION MILESTONE PAYMENT RECEIVED FROM NOVARTIS RELATING TO THE FDA MARKETING APPROVAL FOR FOCALIN XRTM. ROYALTY REVENUE TOTALED $69.1 MILLION IN 2006, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $19.1 MILLION COMPARED TO 2005. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AMOUNTS RECEIVED FROM NOVARTIS ON THEIR SALES OF FOCALIN XRTM. 38 TABLE OF CONTENTS COST OF GOODS SOLD: COST OF GOODS SOLD AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 2007 2006 2005 IN THOUSANDS $ COST OF GOODS SOLD $ 130,239 $ 125,892 $ 80,727 INCREASE FROM PRIOR YEAR $ 4,347 $ 45,165 $ 21,001 PERCENTAGE INCREASE FROM PRIOR YEAR 3.5 % 55.9 % 35.2 % PERCENTAGE OF NET PRODUCT SALES 10.0 % 15.5 % 18.1 % 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN REVLIMID® MATERIAL COSTS AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS RELATED TO BOTH REVLIMID® AND THALOMID® AS SALES INCREASED FOR THESE TWO PRODUCTS. THE INCREASE WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER ALKERAN® MATERIAL COSTS RELATED TO ALKERAN® FOR INJECTION. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET PRODUCT SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD DECREASED FROM 18.1% IN 2005 AND 15.5% IN 2006 TO 10.0% IN 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE GROWTH OF REVLIMID®, THE PRODUCTS LOWER COST RELATIVE TO OUR OTHER PRODUCTS AND SALES PRICE INCREASES. 2006 COMPARED TO 2005: COST OF GOODS SOLD WAS HIGHER IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER ALKERAN® COSTS. ALKERAN® COSTS TEND TO EXPERIENCE VARIABILITY DEPENDING ON THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE SPECIFIC UNITS SOLD DURING A GIVEN PERIOD. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN COST OF GOODS SOLD WERE HIGHER ROYALTIES ON THALOMID® WHICH RESULTED FROM HIGHER NET SALES AND THE INCLUSION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REVLIMID® SALES. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND RELATED PERCENTAGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 WERE AS FOLLOWS: 2007 2006 2005 IN THOUSANDS $ RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT $ 398,590 $ 258,621 $ 190,834 INCREASE FROM PRIOR YEAR $ 139,969 $ 67,787 $ 29,982 PERCENTAGE INCREASE FROM PRIOR YEAR 54.1 % 35.5 % 18.6 % PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE 28.4 % 28.8 % 35.5 % 2007 COMPARED TO 2006: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED BY $140.0 MILLION IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO SPENDING RELATED TO CLINICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN SUPPORT OF MULTIPLE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING REVLIMID® AND OTHER IMIDS® ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF CANCERS, INCLUDING NHL AND CLL. EXPENSES ALSO INCREASED TO SUPPORT ONGOING RESEARCH OF OTHER COMPOUNDS, SUCH AS OUR KINASE AND LIGASE INHIBITOR PROGRAMS AND PLACENTAL-DERIVED STEM/PROGENITOR CELL PROGRAM. REGULATORY SPENDING INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF REVLIMID® IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE EXPENSE FOR 2007 ALSO INCLUDED A COMBINED $41.1 MILLION IN COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR EARLY STAGE COMPOUNDS WITH ARRAY BIOPHARMA INC. AND PTC THERAPEUTICS. IN 2007, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES CONSISTED OF $137.7 MILLION SPENT ON HUMAN PHARMACEUTICAL CLINICAL PROGRAMS, INCLUDING $41.1 MILLION FOR COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ARRANGEMENTS; $203.0 MILLION SPENT ON OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL PROGRAMS, INCLUDING TOXICOLOGY, ANALYTICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, DRUG DISCOVERY, QUALITY AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS; $42.8 MILLION SPENT ON BIOPHARMACEUTICAL DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS; AND $15.1 MILLION SPENT ON PLACENTAL STEM CELL AND BIOMATERIALS PROGRAMS. THESE EXPENDITURES SUPPORT ONGOING CLINICAL PROGRESS IN MULTIPLE PROPRIETARY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS FOR REVLIMID® AND THALOMID®, AND FOR OTHER COMPOUNDS SUCH AS: CC-10004, OUR LEAD ANTI-INFLAMMATORY COMPOUND THAT INHIBITS PDE-4, WHICH RESULTS IN THE INHIBITION OF MULTIPLE PROINFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS SUCH AS TNF-Α AND WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED IN PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS IN THE TREATMENT OF PSORIASIS AND PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS; CC-4047, CC-11006 AND CC-11050 WHICH ARE CURRENTLY EITHER BEING EVALUATED IN PHASE I CLINICAL TRIALS OR FOR WHICH PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS ARE PLANNED OR ONGOING; AND OUR KINASE AND LIGASE INHIBITOR PROGRAMS AS WELL AS THE PLACENTAL STEM CELL PROGRAM. 39 TABLE OF CONTENTS 2006 COMPARED TO 2005: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED BY $67.8 MILLION IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO SPENDING RELATED TO CLINICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT; MEDICAL INFORMATION AND EDUCATION EXPENSES, WHICH SUPPORT EDUCATING AND TRAINING THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY ON HEMATOLOGICAL CANCERS SUCH AS MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND MDS; AND ONGOING DEVELOPMENT OF A BROAD RANGE OF COMPOUNDS AND PLACENTAL-DERIVED STEM CELL PROGRAMS. IN 2006, WE SPENT $95.4 MILLION ON HUMAN PHARMACEUTICAL CLINICAL PROGRAMS; $109.1 MILLION ON OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL PROGRAMS, INCLUDING TOXICOLOGY, ANALYTICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, DRUG DISCOVERY, QUALITY AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS; $40.8 MILLION ON BIOPHARMACEUTICAL DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS; AND $13.3 MILLION ON PLACENTAL STEM CELL AND BIOMATERIALS PROGRAMS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE MAY CONTINUE TO GROW AS EARLIER STAGE COMPOUNDS ARE MOVED THROUGH THE PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL STAGES. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN PRECLINICAL TESTS AND CLINICAL TRIALS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, THE COST TO COMPLETE SUCH PROJECTS CAN VARY. THE DATA OBTAINED FROM THESE TESTS AND TRIALS MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING INTERPRETATION THAT COULD DELAY, LIMIT OR PREVENT A PROJECTS ADVANCEMENT THROUGH THE VARIOUS STAGES OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE COSTS INCURRED TO BRING A PROJECT TO COMPLETION.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB RATIFIED EITF ISSUE NO. 07-1, ACCOUNTING FOR COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OR EITF 07-1, WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON HOW THE PARTIES TO A COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENT SHOULD ACCOUNT FOR COSTS INCURRED AND REVENUE GENERATED ON SALES TO THIRD PARTIES, HOW SHARING PAYMENTS PURSUANT TO A COLLABORATION AGREEMENT SHOULD BE PRESENTED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT AND CERTAIN RELATED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. EITF 07-1 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 2009 ON A RETROSPECTIVE BASIS. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF EITF 07-1 WILL HAVE, IF ANY, ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IS ONE THAT IS BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION AND REQUIRES MANAGEMENTS MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL: REVENUE RECOGNITION ON COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS: WE HAVE FORMED COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS AND ALLIANCES WITH SEVERAL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE IN THE FORM OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS. THE AGREEMENTS CALL FOR NONREFUNDABLE UPFRONT PAYMENTS, MILESTONE PAYMENTS ON ACHIEVING SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE EVENTS, AND IN SOME CASES ONGOING RESEARCH FUNDING. THE AGREEMENTS ALSO CONTEMPLATE ROYALTY PAYMENTS ON SALES IF AND WHEN THE COMPOUNDS RECEIVE REGULATORY MARKETING APPROVAL. OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES FOR ALL NONREFUNDABLE UPFRONT LICENSE FEES AND MILESTONE ARRANGEMENTS ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE PROVIDED IN THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONS STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN, OR SAB, NO. 101, REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS AMENDED BY SAB NO. 104, REVENUE RECOGNITION, OR SAB 104. IN ADDITION, WE FOLLOW THE PROVISIONS OF EITF ISSUE NO. 00-21, REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES, OR EITF 00-21, FOR MULTIPLE ELEMENT REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO OR MATERIALLY AMENDED AFTER JUNE 30, 2003. EITF 00-21 PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON HOW TO DETERMINE WHEN AN ARRANGEMENT THAT INVOLVES MULTIPLE REVENUE-GENERATING ACTIVITIES OR DELIVERABLES SHOULD BE DIVIDED INTO SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION PURPOSES, AND IF THIS DIVISION IS REQUIRED, HOW THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE ALLOCATED AMONG THE SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING. IF THE DELIVERABLES IN A REVENUE ARRANGEMENT CONSTITUTE SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING ACCORDING TO THE EITFS SEPARATION CRITERIA, THE REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY MUST BE DETERMINED FOR EACH IDENTIFIED UNIT. IF THE ARRANGEMENT IS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, THE REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY MUST BE DETERMINED FOR THE ENTIRE ARRANGEMENT. UNDER ARRANGEMENTS WHERE THE LICENSE FEES AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, NONREFUNDABLE UPFRONT LICENSE FEES ARE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE ON 46 TABLE OF CONTENTS A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE EXPECTED TERM OF OUR CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. REVENUES FROM THE ACHIEVEMENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES, IF DEEMED SUBSTANTIVE, ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE MILESTONES ARE ACHIEVED, AND THE MILESTONE PAYMENTS ARE DUE AND COLLECTIBLE. MILESTONES ARE CONSIDERED SUBSTANTIVE IF ALL OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS ARE MET: (1) THE MILESTONE IS NONREFUNDABLE; (2) ACHIEVEMENT OF THE MILESTONE WAS NOT REASONABLY ASSURED AT THE INCEPTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT; (3) SUBSTANTIVE EFFORT IS INVOLVED TO ACHIEVE THE MILESTONE; AND (4) THE AMOUNT OF THE MILESTONE APPEARS REASONABLE IN RELATION TO THE EFFORT EXPENDED, THE OTHER MILESTONES IN THE ARRANGEMENT AND THE RELATED RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ACHIEVEMENT OF THE MILESTONE. IF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET, WE WOULD RECOGNIZE A PROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF THE MILESTONE PAYMENT UPON RECEIPT AS REVENUE THAT CORRELATES TO WORK ALREADY PERFORMED AND THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE MILESTONE PAYMENT WILL BE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE AS WE COMPLETE OUR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS, MEDICAID REBATES AND CHARGEBACKS: OUR GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS, MEDICAID REBATES AND CHARGEBACKS ARE BASED ON OUR SALES AND/OR ESTIMATES OF THIRD-PARTY INVENTORIES. OUR ACCRUAL METHODOLOGIES ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW. THALOMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER OUR S.T.E.P.S.® DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM. AMONG OTHER THINGS, S.T.E.P.S.®, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION AND RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM, REQUIRES PRESCRIBERS, PATIENTS AND DISPENSING PHARMACIES TO PARTICIPATE IN A REGISTRY AND PROHIBITS THE FILLING OF A THALOMID® ORDER UNLESS THE PHYSICIAN, PATIENT AND PHARMACY HAVE ALL OBTAINED AN APPROPRIATE AUTHORIZATION NUMBER. AUTOMATIC REFILLS ARE NOT PERMITTED UNDER THE PROGRAM. EACH PRESCRIPTION MAY NOT EXCEED A 28-DAY SUPPLY AND A NEW PRESCRIPTION IS REQUIRED WITH EACH ORDER. ALTHOUGH WE INVOICE THROUGH TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL WHOLESALERS, ALL THALOMID® ORDERS ARE DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY OVERNIGHT. WHOLESALER STOCKING OF THIS PRODUCT IS PROHIBITED. IN ADDITION, WE DO NOT OFFER COMMERCIAL DISCOUNTS ON OUR PRODUCTS TO PHARMACIES OR HOSPITALS AND, THEREFORE, HAVE NO COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED UNDER THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM, WHICH IS A PROPRIETARY RISK-MANAGEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFE USE OF REVLIMID®, AND IS SOLD PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL. THE REVASSIST® PROGRAM INCLUDES MOST OF THE SAME ATTRIBUTES OF THE S.T.E.P.S.® PROGRAM MENTIONED ABOVE. ALKERAN® IS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MORE TRADITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN. ALKERAN® IS NOT SUBJECTED TO S.T.E.P.S.® OR REVASSIST® DISTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS. IT MAY BE STOCKED BY MULTIPLE WHOLESALERS AND PRESCRIBED BY PHYSICIANS WITHOUT OUR PREAUTHORIZATION. SALES RETURNS: WE BASE OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCE, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATES TO THALOMID®, ON ESTIMATED ON-HAND RETAIL/HOSPITAL INVENTORIES, ACTUAL RETURNS HISTORY AND OTHER KNOWN FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TREND EXPERIENCE FOR LOTS WHERE PRODUCT IS STILL BEING RETURNED AND INVENTORY CENTRALIZATION AND RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES CONDUCTED BY MAJOR PHARMACY CHAINS. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DOES NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS, THEN A CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MADE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE AND REVENUES IN THAT PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, WE TRACK ACTUAL RETURNS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION LOTS. RETURNS ON CLOSED LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE HISTORICAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. RETURNS ON OPEN LOTS, THAT IS, LOTS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN CREDITS, ARE MONITORED AND COMPARED WITH HISTORICAL RETURN TREND RATES. ANY CHANGES FROM THE HISTORICAL TREND RATES ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE CURRENT SALES RETURN ALLOWANCE. WE DO NOT USE INFORMATION FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES IN ESTIMATING OUR PRODUCT RETURNS. AS INDICATED ABOVE, THALOMID® IS DROP-SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE PRESCRIBING PHARMACY AND, AS A RESULT, WHOLESALERS DO NOT STOCK THE PRODUCT. REVLIMID® IS DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH CONTRACTED PHARMACIES LENDING ITSELF TO TIGHTER CONTROLS OF INVENTORY QUANTITIES WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHANNEL AND, THUS, RESULTING IN LOWER RETURNS ACTIVITY TO DATE. EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS PRICE CHANGES FROM COMPETITORS AND INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW AND GENERIC COMPETING PRODUCTS COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR SALES RETURNS. OUR SALES RETURNS HAVE NOT BEEN IMPACTED THUS FAR BY SUCH EXTERNAL FACTORS; HOWEVER, WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR SUCH FACTORS. OUR SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCES WERE $39.8 MILLION, $54.6 MILLION AND $21.3 MILLION IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH EQUATES TO AN ACCRUAL RATE OF 47 TABLE OF CONTENTS 2.7%, 5.7% AND 3.9% OF GROSS PRODUCT SALES IN EACH OF THE THREE RESPECTIVE YEARS. A 10% INCREASE IN OUR 2007 RETURNS RATE WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A $4.0 MILLION DECREASE IN OUR 2007 REPORTED REVENUE. MEDICAID REBATES: OUR MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS ARE COMPUTED USING THE MEDICAID REBATE FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES. THIS FORMULA ESTABLISHES A QUARTERLY UNIT REBATE AMOUNT (URA) FOR ELIGIBLE DRUGS BASED ON OUR QUARTERLY AVERAGE MANUFACTURERS PRICE (AMP). WE APPLY THE CALCULATED AMP TO ESTIMATED QUARTERLY MEDICAID DISPENSE QUANTITIES FOR OUR PRODUCTS. ACTUAL MEDICAID DISPENSE QUANTITIES ARE REPORTED BY INDIVIDUAL STATES ON A 45-60 DAY QUARTER-END LAG. DIFFERENCES IN MEDICAID REBATE ACCRUALS RESULTING FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE ESTIMATED MEDICAID DISPENSE QUANTITIES AND ACTUAL MEDICAID DISPENSE QUANTITIES ARE ADJUSTED IN THE FOLLOWING PERIOD. THE URA CALCULATION ALLOWS FOR MANUFACTURER PRICE INCREASES BASED ON INCREASES IN THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX-ALL URBAN CONSUMERS. PRICE INCREASES IN EXCESS OF THE ALLOWABLE MEDICAID INCREASE RESULT IN A HIGHER UNIT REBATE AMOUNT. OUR MEDICAID REBATE ALLOWANCES INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED SALES OF REVLIMID® AS WELL AS PRICE INCREASES FOR BOTH THALOMID® AND REVLIMID® ABOVE THE ALLOWABLE MEDICAID INCREASE. DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS: AS INDICATED ABOVE, WE DO NOT OFFER COMMERCIAL DISCOUNTS ON OUR PRODUCTS TO PHARMACIES OR HOSPITALS AND, THEREFORE, HAVE NO COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS. OUR DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACKS RESULT FROM THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRICES PAID BY THE WHOLESALER TO ACQUIRE OUR PRODUCTS AND THE LOWER PRICES THE WHOLESALER IS LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO EXTEND TO FEDERALLY FUNDED HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS SUCH AS VETERANS AFFAIRS AND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ENTITIES AS WELL AS NON-FEDERAL PHS/340B ENTITIES. WE ESTIMATE DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACK ALLOWANCES AT THE TIME OF SALE BASED ON THE PHARMACIES TO WHICH THE ORDER WAS DROP-SHIPPED AND ITS ELIGIBILITY FOR THE LOWER PRICING. ACTUAL CHARGEBACK CREDITS CLAIMED BY THE WHOLESALER MAY SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER FROM OUR ACCRUALS. THALOMID® CHARGEBACK ALLOWANCES ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO CURRENT PRICE CHANGES DUE TO THE CUMULATIVE INCREASE TO THE THALOMID® WHOLESALE ACQUISITION PRICE SINCE ITS INITIAL COMMERCIAL LAUNCH DATE. REVLIMID® CHARGEBACK ALLOWANCES ARE LESS SENSITIVE TO CURRENT WHOLESALE ACQUISITION COST PRICE INCREASES DUE TO ITS RELATIVELY RECENT COMMERCIAL LAUNCH DATE. OTHER GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: WE RECORD SALES DISCOUNTS ACCRUALS BASED ON PAYMENT TERMS EXTENDED TO CUSTOMERS AND WE RECORD DISTRIBUTOR SERVICES ACCRUALS BASED ON CONTRACTUAL FEES INCURRED FOR THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR SERVICES PROVIDED. INCOME TAXES: WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. WE PROVIDE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. OUR 2007 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS APPROXIMATELY 56.2%. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE EXCEEDS THE STATUTORY TAX RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO CERTAIN EXPENSES INCURRED IN TAXING JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES FOR WHICH WE DO NOT PRESENTLY RECEIVE A TAX BENEFIT AND NONDEDUCTIBLE EXPENSES WHICH INCLUDE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS. WE OPERATE UNDER AN INCENTIVE TAX HOLIDAY IN SWITZERLAND THAT EXPIRES IN 2015 AND EXEMPTS US FROM CERTAIN SWISS TAXES. LIKEWISE, EXPENSES CURRENTLY BEING INCURRED IN SWITZERLAND DO NOT PROVIDE A TAX BENEFIT. TO THE EXTENT WE RECEIVE APPROVALS IN MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, AND MANUFACTURE AND GENERATE TAXABLE INCOME SUBJECT TO OUR SWISS TAX HOLIDAY, WE WOULD EXPECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO BE LOWER IN THE FUTURE. WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 48 AND FSP FIN 48-1 EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007. FIN 48 CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTERPRISES FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, AND PRESCRIBES A RECOGNITION THRESHOLD AND MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF A TAX POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. FIN 48 ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION, CLASSIFICATION, INTEREST AND PENALTIES, ACCOUNTING IN INTERIM PERIODS, DISCLOSURE AND TRANSITION. WE HAD NO CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO THE ADOPTION. WE ACCOUNT FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS PART OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THESE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATE PRIMARILY TO ISSUES COMMON AMONG MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE APPLY A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES WHICH INCLUDE STUDIES PERFORMED BY INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS, ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY AND SUBJECT EXPERTS, EVALUATION OF PUBLIC 48 TABLE OF CONTENTS ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAXING AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. WE PROVIDE ESTIMATES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. IF OUR ESTIMATES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ACTUAL OUTCOMES, OUR RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED. AT MARCH 31, 2005, WE DETERMINED IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD GENERATE SUFFICIENT TAXABLE INCOME TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND, AS A RESULT, ELIMINATED CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES, WHICH RESULTED IN US RECORDING AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT IN 2005 OF $42.6 MILLION AND AN INCREASE TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL OF $30.2 MILLION. THE DECISION TO ELIMINATE THE DEFERRED TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES WAS BASED ON AN EXTERNAL INDEPENDENT DATA MONITORING COMMITTEES, OR IDMC, ANALYSIS OF TWO PHASE III SPECIAL PROTOCOL ASSESSMENT MULTIPLE MYELOMA TRIALS AND THE CONCLUSION THAT THESE TRIALS EXCEEDED THE PRE-SPECIFIED STOPPING RULE. THE IDMC FOUND A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN TIME TO DISEASE PROGRESSION  THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT OF THESE PHASE III TRIALS  IN PATIENTS RECEIVING REVLIMID® PLUS DEXAMETHASONE COMPARED TO PATIENTS RECEIVING DEXAMETHASONE ALONE. THIS, IN CONCERT WITH OUR NINE CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS OF PROFITABILITY, LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD GENERATE SUFFICIENT TAXABLE INCOME TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE A PORTION WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR RECENT CUMULATIVE EARNINGS EXPERIENCE BY TAXING JURISDICTION, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, CARRYFORWARD PERIODS AVAILABLE TO US FOR TAX REPORTING PURPOSES, VARIOUS INCOME TAX STRATEGIES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT AND, TO THE EXTENT FUTURE EXPECTATIONS CHANGE, WE WOULD HAVE TO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THAT TIME. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WOULD REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION: WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, OR SFAS, NO. 123R, SHARE-BASED PAYMENT, OR SFAS 123R, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, WHICH REQUIRES THAT ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT THEIR FAIR VALUES. WE ADOPTED SFAS 123R USING THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION METHOD UNDER WHICH THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS 123R APPLY TO NEW AWARDS AND TO AWARDS MODIFIED, REPURCHASED, OR CANCELLED AFTER THE ADOPTION DATE. WE USE THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS ON THE DATE OF GRANT WHICH REQUIRES CERTAIN ESTIMATES TO BE MADE BY MANAGEMENT INCLUDING THE EXPECTED FORFEITURE RATE AND EXPECTED TERM OF THE OPTIONS. MANAGEMENT ALSO MAKES DECISIONS REGARDING THE METHOD OF CALCULATING THE EXPECTED VOLATILITIES AND THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE USED IN THE MODEL. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET THAT AFFECT THESE ESTIMATES COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE RESULTING COMPENSATION COST. ADDITIONALLY, COMPENSATION COST FOR THE PORTION OF AWARDS FOR WHICH THE REQUISITE SERVICE HAS NOT BEEN RENDERED THAT ARE OUTSTANDING AS OF THE ADOPTION DATE IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE REMAINING SERVICE PERIOD AFTER THE ADOPTION DATE (FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REFER TO NOTE 13 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT). OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES: A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF ANY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY BELOW ITS COST THAT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN CARRYING AMOUNT TO FAIR VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT IS CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AND A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE SECURITY ESTABLISHED. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INCLUDE: SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE ISSUERS EARNINGS PERFORMANCE, CREDIT RATING, ASSET QUALITY, BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE ISSUER OPERATES, LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW OUR COST, OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE SECURITY AND OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD DIFFER FROM OUR ASSESSMENT. DURING 2007 AND 2006, WE DETERMINED THAT CERTAIN SECURITIES HAD SUSTAINED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS AND, AS A RESULT, WE RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES OF $5.5 MILLION AND $3.8 MILLION IN 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WERE RECORDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. 49 TABLE OF CONTENTS INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATED COMPANIES: OUR INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATED COMPANIES INCLUDES AN INVESTMENT IN ENTREMED WHICH HAD A CARRYING VALUE OF $12.2 MILLION AND A FAIR VALUE OF $12.4 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT WERE TO EXCEED ITS FAIR VALUE, WE WOULD REVIEW IT TO DETERMINE IF AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT HAS BEEN SUSTAINED. IF THE INVESTMENT IS DETERMINED TO HAVE SUSTAINED AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE, THE INVESTMENT WILL BE WRITTEN-DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE. SUCH AN EVALUATION IS JUDGMENTAL AND DEPENDENT ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. FACTORS THAT WE CONSIDER IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE HAS OCCURRED INCLUDE: THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITY IN RELATION TO ITS COST BASIS, THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT THE MARKET VALUE IS BELOW COST, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE INVESTEE AND OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. WE EVALUATE INFORMATION THAT WE ARE AWARE OF IN ADDITION TO QUOTED MARKET PRICES, IF ANY, IN DETERMINING IF AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE EXISTS. ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, OR LTIP, DESIGNED TO PROVIDE KEY OFFICERS AND EXECUTIVES WITH PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES CONTINGENT UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF PRE-ESTABLISHED CORPORATE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES COVERING A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLES RUNNING CONCURRENTLY ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2009 AND 2010. THE 2008 PERFORMANCE CYCLE WAS APPROVED BY THE MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION AND DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN FEBRUARY 2008 AND BEGAN ON JANUARY 1, 2008 WITH AN ENDING DATE OF DECEMBER 31, 2010. PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR EACH LTIP ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE THREE-YEAR CYCLE: 25% ON EARNINGS PER SHARE, 25% ON NET INCOME AND 50% ON REVENUE. PAYOUTS MAY BE IN THE RANGE OF 0% TO 200% OF THE PARTICIPANTS SALARY FOR THE 2008, 2009 AND 2010 PLANS. THE ESTIMATED PAYOUT FOR THE CONCLUDED 2007 CYCLE IS $6.2 MILLION AND THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL PAYOUT, ASSUMING OBJECTIVES ARE ACHIEVED AT THE MAXIMUM LEVEL FOR THE 2008, 2009 AND 2010 CYCLES, ARE $6.4 MILLION, $8.0 MILLION AND $10.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SUCH AWARDS ARE PAYABLE IN CASH OR, AT OUR DISCRETION, IN OUR COMMON STOCK BASED UPON OUR STOCK PRICE AT THE PAYOUT DATE. WE ACCRUE THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE LIABILITY OVER EACH THREE-YEAR CYCLE. PRIOR TO THE END OF A THREE-YEAR CYCLE, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT DURING THE CYCLE. UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT EQUAL TO THEIR TARGET AWARD, OR, IF HIGHER, AN AWARD BASED ON ACTUAL PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL. FOR 2007, 2006 AND 2005, WE RECOGNIZED EXPENSE RELATED TO THE LTIP OF $6.9 MILLION, $4.6 MILLION AND $4.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ACCRUALS RECORDED FOR THE LTIP ENTAIL MAKING CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE EARNINGS PER SHARE, NET INCOME AND REVENUES, THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED. ACCRUALS FOR THE LTIP ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND REVISED ACCORDINGLY SO THAT THE LIABILITY RECORDED REFLECTS UPDATED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PAYOUTS. IN ESTIMATING THE ACCRUALS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DATE FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, EXPECTED RESULTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, OPERATING TRENDS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICING AND COMPETITION. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES FORWARD-LOOKING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RISK OF LOSS IS ASSESSED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES, CASH FLOWS OR FUTURE EARNINGS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND MAY BE MODIFIED DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY SPECIFIES CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM ANY SINGLE ISSUE, ISSUER OR TYPE OF INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, OUR MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS CONSISTED OF DERIVATIVES, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, UNSECURED CONVERTIBLE NOTES ISSUED BY US AND OUR NOTES PAYABLE TO SIEGFRIED. DERIVATIVES: WE PERIODICALLY UTILIZE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO ECONOMICALLY HEDGE NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY EXPOSURES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, WE HAD FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING TO HEDGE NON- 50 TABLE OF CONTENTS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ASSETS DENOMINATED IN SWISS FRANCS, BRITISH POUNDS, JAPANESE YEN AND U.S. DOLLARS. THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THESE CONTRACTS WAS $43.1 MILLION AND THEY EXPIRE WITHIN ONE YEAR. THE CONTRACTS ARE HEDGES OF RECEIVABLES AT U.K. AND SWISS FOREIGN ENTITIES AND ARE REMEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS EACH PERIOD ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEM. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE NET UNREALIZED GAIN ON THE FORWARD CONTRACTS WAS APPROXIMATELY $0.1 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE. ALTHOUGH NOT PREDICTIVE IN NATURE, WE BELIEVE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% THRESHOLD REFLECTS A REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES. ASSUMING THAT THE YEAR-END EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO ADVERSELY CHANGE BY A HYPOTHETICAL 10% DECREASE IN THE UNDERLYING CURRENCIES, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS WOULD DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $7.6 MILLION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACTS HEDGE ASSETS DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE ENTITYS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE OFFSET BY A CHANGE IN THE UNDERLYING VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEMS. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE CONSISTED OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCY SECURITIES, MORTGAGE-BACKED OBLIGATIONS, CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES AND 1,939,598 SHARES OF PHARMION CORPORATION COMMON STOCK. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, HELD FOR AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME AND INTENDED FOR USE IN MEETING OUR ONGOING LIQUIDITY NEEDS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY, ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, NET OF TAX. THE COST OF DEBT SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS TO MATURITY. THE AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, FAIR VALUES AND RELATED WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE WERE AS FOLLOWS: DURATION LESS THAN MORE THAN 1 YEAR 1 TO 3 YEARS 3 TO 5 YEARS 5 YEARS TOTAL IN THOUSANDS $ PRINCIPAL AMOUNT $ 624,243 $ 694,011 $ 55,988 $ 10,000 $ 1,384,242 FAIR VALUE $ 625,830 $ 705,326 $ 56,943 $ 10,623 $ 1,398,722 AVERAGE INTEREST RATE 4.6 % 4.5 % 4.7 % 4.5 % 4.6 % PHARMION COMMON STOCK: AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, WE HELD A TOTAL OF 1,939,598 SHARES OF PHARMION CORPORATION COMMON STOCK, WHICH HAD AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $121.9 MILLION (BASED ON THE CLOSING PRICE REPORTED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SECURITIES DEALERS AUTOMATED QUOTATIONS, OR NASDAQ), AND, WHICH EXCEEDED THE COST BY APPROXIMATELY $101.7 MILLION. THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED THE COST (I.E., THE UNREALIZED GAIN) WAS INCLUDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN THE STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY SECTION OF THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PHARMION COMMON STOCK INVESTMENT IS SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE VOLATILITY AND ANY INCREASE OR DECREASE IN PHARMIONS COMMON STOCK QUOTED MARKET PRICE WILL HAVE A SIMILAR PERCENTAGE INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT (REFER TO NOTE 2 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION RELATED TO THE PROPOSED MERGER WITH PHARMION). CONVERTIBLE DEBT: IN JUNE 2003, WE ISSUED AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $400.0 MILLION OF UNSECURED CONVERTIBLE NOTES. THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES HAVE A FIVE-YEAR TERM AND A COUPON RATE OF 1.75% PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY. THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 CAN BE CONVERTED AT ANY TIME INTO 16,227,441 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A STOCK-SPLIT ADJUSTED CONVERSION PRICE OF $12.1125 PER SHARE (FOR MORE INFORMATION REFER TO NOTE 9 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE OF $196.6 MILLION BY APPROXIMATELY $514.4 MILLION, WHICH WE BELIEVE REFLECTS THE INCREASE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO $46.21 PER SHARE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007. ASSUMING OTHER FACTORS ARE HELD CONSTANT, AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES GENERALLY RESULTS IN A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF FIXED-RATE CONVERTIBLE DEBT, BUT DOES NOT IMPACT THE CARRYING VALUE, AND AN INCREASE IN OUR STOCK PRICE GENERALLY RESULTS IN AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT, BUT DOES NOT IMPACT THE CARRYING VALUE. 51 TABLE OF CONTENTS NOTE PAYABLE: AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NOTE PAYABLE TO SIEGFRIED APPROXIMATED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTE OF $26.2 MILLION. ASSUMING OTHER FACTORS ARE HELD CONSTANT, AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES GENERALLY WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NOTE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NOTE WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR / SWISS FRANC EXCHANGE RATE. THE NOTE IS DENOMINATED IN SWISS FRANCS.
