BUSINESS          GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS          Abbott Laboratories is an Illinois corporation, incorporated in 1900. Abbott's* principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a broad and diversified line of health care products and services.      FINANCIAL INFORMATION RELATING TO INDUSTRY SEGMENTS,  GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, AND CLASSES OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS          Incorporated herein by reference is Note 13 entitled "Segment and Geographic Area Information" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."      NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS          Abbott has five reporting revenue segments: Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Hospital Products, Ross Products, and International. Abbott also has a 50 percent owned joint venture, TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. On December 15, 2000, Abbott announced that it has a definitive agreement with BASF to acquire the pharmaceutical business of BASF, which includes the global pharmaceutical operations of Knoll. This acquisition is subject to approval by regulatory agencies and satisfaction of customary closing conditions.  Pharmaceutical Products       This segment's products include a broad line of adult and pediatric pharmaceuticals which are sold primarily on the prescription or recommendation of physicians.      The principal products included in this segment are the anti-infectives clarithromycin, sold in the United States under the trademark Biaxin®, Omnicef®, an oral cephalosporin antibiotic, and various forms of erythromycin, sold primarily as PCE® or polymer-coated erythromycin, Erythrocin®, and E.E.S.®; agents for the treatment of epilepsy, migraine, and bipolar disorder, including Depakote®; a broad line of other products, including Flomax® for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, Mobic® for the treatment of arthritis, Micardis® for the treatment of hypertension, TriCor® for the treatment of elevated triglycerides, and the anti-virals Kaletra and Norvir®, protease inhibitors for the treatment of HIV infection. In addition, this segment co-promotes the proton pump inhibitor Prevacid® (lansoprazole) for short-term treatment of duodenal ulcers, gastric ulcers and erosive esophagitis under an agreement with TAP Pharmaceuticals Inc.      This segment markets its products in the United States. These products are generally sold directly to wholesalers, government agencies, health care facilities, and independent retailers from Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Primary marketing efforts for pharmaceutical products are directed toward securing the prescription of Abbott's brand of products by physicians. Managed care purchasers (for example, health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers) are increasingly important customers.    *As used throughout the text of this report on Form 10-K, the term "Abbott" refers to Abbott Laboratories, an Illinois corporation, or Abbott Laboratories and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires.  1         Competition is generally from other broad line pharmaceutical companies. A significant aspect of competition is the search for technological innovations. The introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence. Price can also be a factor. In addition, the substitution of generic drugs for the brand prescribed has increased competitive pressures on pharmaceutical products which are off-patent.  Diagnostic Products       This segment's products include diagnostic systems and tests for blood banks, hospitals, reference laboratories, alternate-care testing sites, and consumers.      The principal products included in this segment are systems and reagents used to perform immunoassay tests including Architect®, AxSYM®, IMx®, Abbott Quantum; Commander®, and Abbott PRISM®; screening and diagnostic tests for hepatitis B, HTLV-I/II, hepatitis B core, and hepatitis C; tests for detection of HIV antibodies and antigens, and other infectious disease detection systems; tests for determining levels of abused drugs; physiological diagnostic tests; cancer monitoring tests including tests for prostate specific antigen (PSA); therapeutic drug monitoring tests, fertility and pregnancy tests and systems such as TDx® and TDxFlx®; the Murex® line of microtiter-based immunoassay test kits; the LCx® amplified probe system and reagents; the Abbott TestPack® and Determine systems for rapid diagnostic testing; clinical chemistry systems such as Abbott Spectrum®, Aeroset®, Alcyon®, and Abbott Vision®; a full line of hematology systems and reagents known as the Cell-Dyn® series; the MediSense® product line of blood glucose monitoring meters, test strips, data management software and accessories for people with diabetes including Precision Xtra, MediSense Optium®, Sof-Tact, Soft-Sense, Precision Q.I.D.®, MediSense II, ExacTech® and ExacTech RSG®, Precision Link Direct, and Precision Sure-Dose insulin syringes.

Under an agreement between Abbott and Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd. of Japan (Takeda), TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. (owned 50 percent by Abbott and 50 percent by an affiliate of Takeda), together with its subsidiary, TAP Pharmaceuticals Inc. (TAP), develops and markets pharmaceutical products for the United States and Canada. TAP markets Lupron®, an LH-RH analog, and Lupron Depot®, a sustained release form of Lupron®, in the United States. Lupron® and Lupron Depot® are used principally for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer and for the treatment of endometriosis and central precocious puberty and for the preoperative treatment of patients with anemia caused by uterine fibroids. TAP also markets Prevacid® (lansoprazole), a proton pump inhibitor, and has a co-promotion arrangement with Abbott for Prevacid®. Its principal indications are for short-term treatment of duodenal ulcers, gastric ulcers, and erosive esophagitis.      TAP's products are generally sold directly to physicians, retailers, wholesalers, health care facilities, and government agencies. In most cases, they are distributed from Abbott-owned distribution centers.

INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ABBOTT'S BUSINESS IN GENERAL      Sources and Availability of Raw Materials       Abbott purchases, in the ordinary course of business, necessary raw materials and supplies essential to Abbott's operations from numerous suppliers in the United States and overseas. There have been no recent significant availability problems or supply shortages.  Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses       Abbott is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection for its products. Accordingly, where possible, patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for Abbott's products in the United States and all countries of major marketing interest to Abbott. Abbott owns and is licensed under a substantial number of patents and patent applications. Principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the Narrative Description of Business on pages 1 through 5. These, and various patents which expire during the period 2001 to 2021, in the aggregate, are believed to be of material importance in the operation of Abbott's business. Abbott believes that no single patent, license, trademark (or related group of patents, licenses, or trademarks), except for those related to clarithromycin (which is sold under the trademarks Biaxin®, Klacid® and Klaricid®), are material in relation to Abbott's business as a whole. The original United States compound patent covering clarithromycin is licensed from Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. of Tokyo, Japan, and will expire in 2005. In addition, the patents, licenses, and trademarks related to divalproex sodium (which is sold under the trademark Depakote®) are significant for Abbott's Pharmaceutical Products segment. The original United States compound patents covering divalproex sodium will expire in 2008. Litigation involving Abbott's patents covering divalproex sodium is discussed in Legal Proceedings on pages 10 and 11.  Seasonal Aspects, Customers, Backlog, and Renegotiation       There are no significant seasonal aspects to Abbott's business. The incidence of certain infectious diseases which occur at various times in different areas of the world does, however, affect the demand for  5      Abbott's anti-infective products. Orders for Abbott's products are generally filled on a current basis, and order backlog is not material to Abbott's business. No single customer accounted for sales equaling 10 percent or more of Abbott's consolidated net sales. No material portion of Abbott's business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government.  Research and Development       Abbott spent $1,351,024,000 in 2000, $1,193,963,000 in 1999, and $1,228,777,000 in 1998 on research to discover and develop new products and processes and to improve existing products and processes. Abbott continues to concentrate research expenditures on pharmaceutical and diagnostic products.  Environmental Matters       Abbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. Abbott's capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2000 were approximately $23 million and $59 million, respectively. Capital and operating expenditures for pollution control are estimated to approximate $27 million and $62 million, respectively, in 2001.      Abbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at 24 locations in the United States including Puerto Rico under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. The aggregate costs of remediation at these sites by all identified parties are uncertain but have been subject to widely ranging estimates totaling as much as several hundred million dollars. In many cases, Abbott believes that the actual costs will be lower than these estimates, and the fraction for which Abbott may be responsible is anticipated to be considerably less and will be paid out over a number of years. Abbott may participate in the investigation or cleanup at these sites. Abbott is also voluntarily investigating potential contamination at six Abbott-owned sites, and is engaged in remediation at three sites, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state agencies.      While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the costs related to the previously described investigations and cleanup activities, Abbott believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.  Employees       Abbott employed 60,571 persons as of December 31, 2000.  Regulation       In late 1998, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suspended its approval of the release of production lots of Abbott's pharmaceutical product Abbokinase® due to current Good Manufacturing Practice concerns raised by the FDA following inspections of Abbott and its raw material supplier. In January 1999, after Abbott revised the product's labeling to add additional warnings and the FDA issued a health care provider information sheet, the FDA released certain lots that were under its review. No lots have been released since January 1999. Abbott submitted a letter to the FDA on October 7, 1999, responding to the FDA's concerns and committing to meet all outlined criteria for the release of Abbokinase. On December 10, 1999, Abbott met with the FDA to review Abbott's plan for the qualification of new raw materials and reinitiation of manufacturing. The FDA concurred with Abbott's strategy. In the future, Abbott will sell only Abbokinase that is manufactured with new raw materials that meet current criteria. Abbott cannot predict, however, whether it will be successful in qualifying new raw material sources or the effect of this matter on future sales of Abbokinase.  6          On November 4, 1999, a consent decree was entered in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois which settled issues with the United States government involving alleged noncompliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulations at Abbott's diagnostic manufacturing operations in Lake County, Illinois. The decree required Abbott to make a payment of $100 million to the United States government and to ensure its diagnostic manufacturing processes in Lake County, Illinois conform with the FDA's current Quality System Regulation. The consent decree does not represent an admission by Abbott of any violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or its regulations. The decree allows for the continued manufacture and distribution of medically necessary diagnostic products made in Lake County, Illinois, such as certain assays for hepatitis, retrovirus, cardiovascular disease, cancer, thyroid disorders, fertility, drug monitoring, and congenital and respiratory conditions. However, Abbott is prohibited from manufacturing or distributing certain other diagnostic products until Abbott ensures the processes in its Lake County, Illinois diagnostics manufacturing operations conform with the current Quality System Regulation. Under the terms of the consent decree, among other actions, Abbott has submitted to the FDA proposed master compliance and validation plans to ensure its processes conform with the current Quality System Regulation. Originally, the decree required Abbott to ensure its facilities are in conformance with the current Quality System Regulation by November 3, 2000. However, on December 19, 2000, upon a joint motion by Abbott and the U.S. government, the Court entered an Amended Consent Decree, which extended to January 15, 2001, the deadline for ensuring conformance with the Quality System Regulation. The consent decree does not affect Abbott's MediSense, i-STAT, hematology or Murex products; the clinical chemistry products Abbott Spectrum®, Aeroset®, and Alcyon®; or any other Abbott divisions or their products. The consent decree allows Abbott to export diagnostic products and components for sale and distribution outside the United States if they meet the export requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.      The development, manufacture, sale, and distribution of Abbott's products are subject to comprehensive government regulation. Government regulation by various federal, state, and local agencies, which includes detailed inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, and manufacturing, marketing, sampling, distribution, record keeping, storage, and disposal practices, substantially increases the time, difficulty, and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining the approval to market newly developed and existing products. Government regulatory actions can result in delay in the release of products, seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for their production and sale, and other civil or criminal sanctions.      Continuing studies of the utilization, safety, and efficacy of health care products and their components are being conducted by industry, government agencies, and others. Such studies, which employ increasingly sophisticated methods and techniques, can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed products and in some cases have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of marketing of such products and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use.      The cost of human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies, and private organizations in the United States and other countries. In the United States, most states have enacted generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed. Federal and state governments continue to press efforts to reduce costs of Medicare and Medicaid programs, including restrictions on amounts agencies will reimburse for the use of products. In addition, the federal government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and is implementing a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home, and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on diagnosis rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Manufacturers must pay certain statutorily-prescribed  7      rebates on Medicaid purchases for reimbursement on prescription drugs under state Medicaid plans. The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 requires manufacturers to extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies, including the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, and Public Health Service entities and institutions.      In the United States, governmental cost-containment efforts have extended to the federally funded Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). All states participate in WIC and have sought and obtained rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program. Over the last five years, all of the states have conducted competitive bidding for infant formula contracts which require the use of specific infant formula products by the state WIC program. States participating in WIC are required to engage in competitive bidding or to use any other cost containment measure that yields savings equal to or greater than the savings generated by a competitive bidding system.      Governmental regulatory agencies require prescription drug manufacturers to pay fees. The FDA imposes substantial fees on various aspects of the approval, manufacture, and sale of proprietary prescription drugs.      Abbott expects debate to continue during 2001 at both the federal and the state level over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. Abbott believes that if legislation is enacted, it could have the effect of reducing prices, or reducing the rate of price increases, for medical products and services.      International operations are also subject to a significant degree of government regulation. Many countries, directly or indirectly through reimbursement limitations, control the selling price of most health care products. Furthermore, many developing countries limit the importation of raw materials and finished products. International regulations also are having an impact on United States regulations. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) provides the criteria for meeting the regulations for medical devices within the European Union. Abbott has made significant strides in gaining ISO 9000 and European Norm 46000 certification for facilities that manufacture devices for European markets. FDA regulations governing the manufacture of medical devices appear to encompass and exceed the ISO's approach to regulating medical devices. The FDA's adoption of the ISO's approach to regulation and other changes to the manner in which the FDA regulates medical devices will increase the cost of compliance with those regulations.      Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector. Health care providers have responded by instituting various cost reduction and containment measures.      It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above.      INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS          Abbott markets products in approximately 130 countries through affiliates and distributors. Most of the products discussed in the preceding sections of this report are also sold outside the United States. In addition, certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines to meet local regulatory requirements and marketing preferences are manufactured and marketed to customers outside the United States. International operations are subject to certain additional risks inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including price and currency exchange controls, changes in currency exchange rates, limitations on foreign participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action.  8            ITEM 2.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS          Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, including (as of January 31, 2001), 125 antitrust lawsuits and 2 investigations in connection with Abbott's pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals, 3 cases involving Abbott's patents for divalproex sodium, a drug that Abbott sells under the trademark Depakote®, 21 antitrust lawsuits and 2 investigations involving Abbott's patents for terazosin hydrochloride, a drug that Abbott sells under the trademark Hytrin®, 5 cases involving Abbott's alleged noncompliance with the United States Food and Drug Administration's Quality System Regulation at Abbott's Diagnostic Products division facilities in Lake County, Illinois, and 6 investigations regarding the marketing and pricing practices of Abbott with respect to certain Medicare and Medicaid reimbursable products.      As of January 31, 2001, 110 prescription pharmaceutical pricing antitrust cases were pending in federal court and 15 were pending in state courts. The prescription pharmaceutical pricing antitrust suits allege that various pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmaceutical wholesalers have conspired to fix prices for prescription pharmaceuticals and/or to discriminate in pricing to retail pharmacies by providing discounts to mail-order pharmacies, institutional pharmacies, and HMOs in violation of state and federal antitrust laws. The suits have been brought on behalf of individual consumers and retail pharmacies and name both Abbott and certain other pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmaceutical wholesalers and at least one mail-order pharmacy company as defendants. The cases seek treble damages, civil penalties, and injunctive and other relief. Abbott has filed or intends to file a response to each of the complaints denying all substantive allegations. The federal cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under the Multidistrict Litigation Rules as In re: Brand Name Prescription Drug Antitrust Litigation, MDL 997. The state cases are pending in the following state courts: Clarke County, Alabama; Monterey County, California; San Francisco County, California (5 cases); San Joaquin County, California; Santa Clara County, California; Prentiss County, Mississippi; Burleigh County, North Dakota; San Miguel County, New Mexico; Hughes County, South Dakota; Cocke County, Tennessee; and Marshall County, West Virginia. Abbott has settled the consumer lawsuit pending in Prentiss County, Mississippi and is awaiting a formal dismissal order. The investigations are being conducted by the Attorney General of Illinois and the Federal Trade Commission.      As of January 31, 2001, three cases were pending involving Abbott's patents for divalproex sodium, a drug that Abbott sells under the trademark Depakote®. On October 24, 1997, after having been notified that TorPharm, a division of Apotex, Inc. ("TorPharm") had applied to the Federal Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") for approval for a generic version of divalproex sodium, Abbott sued TorPharm in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging patent  10      infringement. TorPharm contends that its product does not infringe Abbott's patents and that, in any event, the patents are invalid and unenforceable. A trial had been scheduled for October 17, 2000, but has been postponed. A new trial date has been scheduled for October 16, 2001. On August 28, 1992, after having been notified that Alra Laboratories, Inc. ("Alra") had applied to the FDA for approval for a generic version of divalproex sodium, Abbott sued Alra in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging patent infringement. On October 20, 1997, the court granted Abbott's motion for summary judgment and found that Alra's product infringes Abbott's patents. Alra filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's ruling. That motion was granted in part and denied in part. On November 23, 1999, the court re-affirmed its prior rulings granting Abbott summary judgment. Alra has appealed. On March 9, 2000, after having been notified that Andrx Corporation had filed an abbreviated new drug patent application to market a generic version of divalproex sodium, Abbott filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Andrx Corporation, Andrx Pharmaceutical, and Andrx Pharmaceutical, L.L.C. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging patent infringement. On April 14, 2000, Abbott filed patent infringment lawsuits aginst these three Andrx companies in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The case in United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois was then transferred to United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida and consolidated with the case pending in that court. A trial is scheduled for November 2001.      As of January 31, 2001, 18 antitrust cases were pending in federal court and 3 were pending in state court in connection with the settlement of litigation by Abbott involving terazosin hydrochloride, a drug sold by Abbott under the trademark Hytrin®. Generally, each seeks actual damages, treble damages, and other relief. Each case alleges Abbott violated state or federal antitrust laws, and in some cases, unfair competition laws when it settled 2 cases involving Abbott's patents for terazosin hydrochloride. On March 31, 1998, Abbott and Zenith Laboratories, Inc. ("Zenith") reached an agreement that resolved the patent litigation and the litigation of other claims between the parties. In the settlement, Zenith acknowledged the validity of Abbott's terazosin hydrochloride patents and agreed to refrain from selling a generic version of terazosin hydrochloride until the expiration of one of Abbott's patents for terazosin hydrochloride (U.S. Patent No. 4,251,532). On April 1, 1998, Abbott and Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Geneva") reached an agreement under which Geneva would not market its Food and Drug Administration approved generic terazosin hydrochloride products until resolution of the pending patent litigation between the parties. Abbott agreed to make quarterly payments to Zenith and monthly payments to Geneva until the date on which they could enter the market for terazosin hydrochloride under their agreements. Under the agreements, both Zenith and Geneva would have been free to enter the market for terazosin hydrochloride in the United States if certain of Abbott's patents for terazosin hydrochloride were determined to be invalid and if another company legally entered the generic market in the United States. On August 12, 1999, Abbott and Geneva terminated their April 1, 1998 agreement, and Geneva returned to Abbott a portion of the payments held in escrow under the agreement. On August 13, 1999, Geneva entered the market with its product. The 18 federal court cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida under the Multidistrict Litigation Rules as In Re: Terazosin Hydrochloride, MDL No. 1317. The 3 state court cases:  Asher and New Utrecht Pharmacy v. Abbott Laboratories, Geneva Pharmaceuticals and Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;  Drug Mart Pharmacy Company Corp. v. Abbott Laboratories, Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and Lisanti v. Abbott Laboratories, Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. have been consolidated by and are pending in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. Abbott has filed or intends to file a response to each complaint denying all substantive allegations. The State of Florida, Office of the Attorney General, and the State of New York, Office of the Attorney General, are conducting the investigations.      As of January 31, 2001, 5 shareholder derivative suits were pending relating to Abbott's alleged noncompliance with the Food and Drug Administration's Quality System Regulation at Abbott's Diagnostic Products division facilities in Lake County, Illinois. (This matter is discussed in greater detail in  11      "Regulation" on page 7 and is incorporated herein by this reference.) These lawsuits name as defendants the members of Abbott's Board of Directors as of November 1999, certain other former directors and, nominally, Abbott, and claim that the directors breached their fiduciary duties by, among other things, (a) allowing the alleged regulatory noncompliance, (b) failing to publicly disclose the alleged regulatory noncompliance in supposed violation of federal securities law, (c) misusing or permitting the misuse of corporate information for the personal profit of corporate insiders in supposed violation of federal and state law, and (d) causing Abbott to pay $100 million to the federal government and withdraw certain medical diagnostics kits from the U.S. market. In each case, the plaintiffs request unspecified monetary damages to be paid to Abbott, that the directors indemnify Abbott for all fines, penalties or damages paid by Abbott in connection with the alleged regulatory noncompliance, reimbursement of their legal fees and costs, and various forms of other relief. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois consolidated into "In Re: Abbott Laboratories Derivative Shareholder Litigation" the four derivative lawsuits filed by Leonard Bronstein, the Carpenters Pension Fund of Arkansas and David Kaufman, Leo Farrell, and F. David Seinfeld. On November 9, 2000, these plaintiffs filed a second consolidated and amended verified complaint (the court having dismissed without prejudice their original consolidated complaint), generally alleging that the directors' breached their duty of diligence by failing to (i) prevent Abbott's alleged regulatory non-compliance or (ii) create a monitoring system to prevent and correct regulatory non-compliance. The second consolidated complaint seeks unspecified restitution and/or damages, including punitive and exemplary damages, injunctive relief, and reimbursement of their legal fees and costs. Abbott denies all of the substantive allegations in this lawsuit and will vigorously defend against it. Abbott has moved to dismiss the second consolidated complaint. The fifth shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed by Craig Heneghan and Marjory Motiaytis in the Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, Lake County, Illinois. On April 6, 2000, the Lake County Circuit Court granted Abbott's motion to stay the Heneghan/Motiaytis lawsuit until the shareholder derivative suits pending in federal court are decided.      Abbott has previously reported that fourteen other cases were pending that were related to Abbott's alleged noncompliance with the Food and Drug Administration's Quality System Regulation at Abbott's Diagnostic Products division facilities in Lake County, Illinois. Thirteen of these cases were consolidated by and pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois as "In re Abbott Laboratories Securities Litigation." On January 26, 2001, the court dismissed with prejudice the consolidated complaint and each of the lawsuits. The fourteenth case was filed by Lena Gallagher in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Illinois and purported to be a class action. On January 26, 2001, the court dismissed with prejudice this complaint. The plaintiffs may appeal these decisions.      Various state and federal agencies, including the United States Department of Justice and the California, Florida, Illinois, Nevada and Texas Attorneys General, are investigating the marketing and pricing practices of Abbott with respect to certain Medicare and Medicaid reimbursable products. These civil investigations seek to determine whether these practices violated any laws, including the Federal False Claims Act or constituted fraud in connection with the Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement paid to third parties.      While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims, proceedings, and investigations with certainty, management is of the opinion that their ultimate dispositions should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.      In addition to the claims and legal proceedings involving Abbott described above, the United States Department of Justice is investigating the marketing and pricing practices of TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. for leuprolide acetate depot suspension (a drug TAP markets as Lupron Depot®). This investigation seeks to determine whether these practices resulted in any violations of civil and/or criminal laws, including the Federal False Claims Act, the Anti-Kickback Act, and the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or fraud in connection with the Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement paid to third parties. The  12      Texas Attorney General is also investigating some of these practices. Abbott owns 50 percent of TAP. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings with certainty, management is of the opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott's financial position or ongoing cash flow and results of operations but that they could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's cash flow and results of operations for a particular period.

MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS      Principal Market       The principal market for Abbott's common shares is the New York Stock Exchange. Shares are also listed on the Chicago Stock Exchange and the Pacific Exchange and are traded on the Boston, Cincinnati, and Philadelphia Exchanges. Outside the United States, Abbott's shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Swiss Stock Exchange.         Market prices are as reported by the New York Stock Exchange composite transaction reporting system.  Shareholders       There were 101,272 shareholders of record of Abbott common shares as of December 31, 2000.  Dividends       Quarterly dividends of $.19 per share and $.17 per share were declared on common shares in 2000 and 1999, respectively.      ITEM 6.  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA         21            ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      Financial Review   Results of Operations   Sales       The following table details the components of sales growth by segment for the last three years:      (a)In 2000, management of the vascular medicine franchise was transferred from the Pharmaceutical Products Segment to the Hospital Products Segment. Percentage changes for 1999 and 1998 have been restated to reflect this transfer.  22      (b)In 2001, management of the FACT PLUS product franchise was transferred from the Diagnostic Products Segment to the Ross Products Segment. Percentage changes for 2000, 1999 and 1998 reflect this transfer.      Sales of new products in 2000 are estimated to be $939 million, led by the Pharmaceutical, Hospital and Diagnostic segments. Increases, as disclosed in Note 13, in adult nutritionals in all three years and in anti-infectives in 1999 were primarily due to unit increases. The decreases in anti-infectives for 2000 and 1998 were due primarily to unit decreases.  Operating Earnings       Gross profit margins (sales less cost of products sold, including distribution expenses) were 54.6 percent of net sales in 2000 and 1999, and 56.8 percent in 1998. Excluding the charges described in Note 15 relating to the FDA consent decree, the gross profit margin for 1999 would have been 55.8 percent. Gross profit margins in all three years were affected by unfavorable product mix, primarily pharmaceuticals, and the negative effect of the relatively stronger U.S. dollar. Gross profit margins in all years were also affected by productivity improvements, partially offset by higher project expenses for new products, higher manufacturing capacity costs for anticipated unit growth, and the effects of inflation and competitive pricing pressures in some product lines. In the U.S., states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children. There are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products. These rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the Ross and Pharmaceutical products segments.      In August 1999, Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. began shipments of generic HYTRIN in the United States, which has adversely impacted Abbott's HYTRIN sales. Sales of HYTRIN in the United States amounted to $141 million, $466 million, and $542 million in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.      As a result of the consent decree entered into with the U.S. government in 1999, as discussed in Note 15, Abbott is prohibited from manufacturing or distributing certain diagnostic products until Abbott ensures the processes in its Lake County, Ill., diagnostics manufacturing operations conform with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Quality System Regulation (QSR). The consent decree resulted in a charge of $168 million in the third quarter of 1999. Abbott estimates that 2000 sales were negatively impacted by approximately $250 million, and earnings per share were negatively impacted by approximately 10 cents per share. Under the terms of the amended consent decree, Abbott must ensure its diagnostics manufacturing operations are in conformance with the QSR by various dates through January 15, 2001. The FDA will determine Abbott's conformance with the QSR after an inspection of Abbott's facilities. If the FDA concludes that the operations are not in conformance with the QSR as of the date required, Abbott may be subject to additional costs.      Research and development expense was $1.4 billion in 2000 and represented 9.8 percent of net sales in 2000, compared to 9.1 percent of net sales in 1999, and 9.8 percent of net sales in 1998. The increase in research and development expenses in 2000 was concentrated primarily in the Pharmaceutical, Diagnostic and Hospital segments. Research and development expenditures continue to be concentrated on pharmaceutical and diagnostic products.      Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1.3 percent in 2000, net of the favorable effect of the relatively stronger U.S. dollar of 2.4 percent, compared to increases of 3.5 percent in 1999, and 2.4 percent in 1998. The net increases, exclusive of exchange impact, reflect inflation and additional selling and marketing support primarily in the International, Pharmaceutical and Hospital segments. In addition, 1999 and 1998 reflect litigation charges, and 1999 includes merger costs of approximately $16.2 million.      Abbott's income from TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. (TAP) joint venture in 2000 was adversely affected as a result of an increase in a litigation reserve related to the U.S. Department of Justice investigation of TAP's marketing and sales practices for LUPRON. While it is not feasible to predict the  23      outcome of these proceedings with certainty, management is of the opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott's financial position or ongoing cash flow and results of operations, but that they could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's cash flow and results of operations for a particular period.  Interest (Income) Expense, Net       Net interest expense decreased in 2000 and 1999 due to a lower level of borrowings and a higher level of investment securities. Net interest expense increased in 1998 due primarily to a higher level of borrowings as a result of business acquisitions.  Taxes on Earnings       The effective income tax rates were 27.0 percent in 2000 and 28.0 percent in 1999 and 1998. The tax rate for 2000 was reduced, in part, by the domestic dividend exclusion applicable to the increased earnings of TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. In addition, the tax rates for 1999 and 1998 were unfavorably impacted by the reduction in tax incentive grants for Puerto Rico operations.  Financial Condition   Cash Flow       Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to approximate or exceed Abbott's capital expenditures and cash dividends.  Debt and Capital       At December 31, 2000, Abbott's bond ratings were AAA by Standard & Poor's Corporation and Aa1 by Moody's Investors Service. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including unused domestic lines of credit of $1.5 billion, which support domestic commercial paper borrowing arrangements. As a result of the proposed acquisition of BASF's pharmaceutical business, Abbott's credit ratings are under review, and it is expected that the ratings may be adjusted to reflect the increased borrowings that will finance the acquisition. In addition, available lines of credit, which will support increased commercial paper borrowings, increased to $6.5 billion in February 2001.      Under a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in February 2001, Abbott may issue up to $3.5 billion of securities in the future. Of the $3.5 billion, Abbott may issue $268 million either in the form of debt securities or common shares without par value. The remaining $3.2 billion may be issued in the form of debt securities. Previously, under a registration statement filed with the SEC in 1999, Abbott may have issued $518 million of securities, which is now included in the $3.5 billion.      During the last three years, Abbott purchased 31,765,500 of its common shares at a cost of $1.3 billion, including 10.2 million shares of the 25 million shares authorized for purchase by Abbott's Board of Directors in June 2000.  Working Capital       At December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, working capital was $3.1 billion, $1.9 billion, and $624 million, respectively.  Capital Expenditures       Capital expenditures of $1.0 billion in 2000, $987 million in 1999, and $994 million in 1998 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing, research and development, and administrative  24      support facilities in all segments and for laboratory instruments and hospital equipment placed with customers. This level of capital expenditures is expected to continue, with an increased proportion dedicated to the Hospital, International and Diagnostic segments.  Legislative Issues       Abbott's primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulation. Abbott expects debate to continue at both the federal and state levels over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. If legislation is enacted, it could have the effect of reducing prices, or reducing the rate of price increases for medical products and services. International operations are also subject to a significant degree of government regulation. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, "Business."  Business Combinations and Divestiture       On December 15, 2000, Abbott and BASF A.G. reached an agreement through which Abbott will purchase the pharmaceutical business of BASF, subject to approval of government regulators. The purchase price is $6.9 billion. Abbott estimates that the acquisition, if completed, will result in purchase accounting charges of approximately $1.0 billion for in-process research and development in 2001, and will result in goodwill and intangibles of approximately $5.0 billion. The purchase will be financed by U.S. dollar and euro-based borrowings described under "Debt and Capital."      On November 19, 1999, Abbott completed a merger transaction with Perclose, Inc., which was accounted for as a pooling-of-interests transaction. Abbott issued approximately 15.1 million common shares to Perclose shareholders, and Perclose's outstanding stock options were converted into options to purchase approximately 2.9 million Abbott common shares. Merger-related charges of approximately $16.2 million are included in selling, general and administrative expenses for 1999. Abbott's consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been restated to include Perclose and are not significantly different than previously reported amounts.      In 1999, Abbott acquired certain assets of Glaxo Wellcome Inc.'s U.S. anesthesia business for approximately $217 million in cash. A substantial portion of the purchase price was allocated to intangible assets, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over 15 years. In 1998, Abbott acquired the common stock of International Murex Technologies Corporation, a manufacturer of medical diagnostic products, for approximately $234 million in cash. A substantial portion of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill, which is amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years. Had these acquisitions taken place on January 1 of the previous years, consolidated sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts.      In January 2000, Abbott sold its agricultural products business to Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd., resulting in a $139 million gain. Under the transaction, Sumitomo acquired research and development, sales, marketing, and support operations for Abbott's entire line of naturally occurring biopesticides, plant growth regulators and other products for agriculture, public health and forestry. Bulk active ingredient manufacturing rights were retained by Abbott. For the full year 1999, Abbott recorded approximately $102 million in sales from this business.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards       In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement requires the recognition of the fair value of derivatives as either assets or liabilities. Adoption of the provisions of this statement on January 1, 2001, will result in a transition credit to income of approximately $2 million in 2001.  25          The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF Issues No. 00-10, "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs," and No. 00-14, "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives," which address the classification of shipping and handling fees and costs and various sales incentives, and were effective for the fourth quarter of 2000. The adoption of the provisions of these EITF Issues did not have a material effect on Abbott's financial statements.      The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," as amended on June 26, 2000. SAB No. 101 provides the SEC staff's views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues, and was effective beginning in the fourth quarter of 2000. Adoption of the provisions of this SAB did not have a material effect on Abbott's financial statements.  Euro Conversion       On January 1, 1999, the European Economic and Monetary Union took effect and introduced the euro as the official single currency of the participating member countries. On that date, the currency exchange rates of the participating countries were fixed against the euro. There is a three-year transition to the euro, and at the end of 2001, the legacy currencies will be eliminated. Costs required to prepare for the euro are not material to Abbott's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The impact, if any, of the euro on Abbott's competitive position is unknown.      Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements          Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward-looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this Item 7, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Exhibit 99.1.      ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK      Financial Instruments and Risk Management (Unaudited)   Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments       Abbott does not currently use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its debt instruments and investment securities. As of December 31, 2000, and 1999, Abbott had $185 million and $855 million, respectively, of domestic commercial paper outstanding with an average interest rate of 6.5% and 5.8%, respectively, and with an average remaining life of three days and 13 days, respectively. The fair market value of long-term debt at December 31, 2000, and 1999, amounted to $1.3 billion, and consisted primarily of fixed rate (average of 6.1%) debt with maturities through 2023. As of December 31, 2000, and 1999, the fair market value of current and long-term investment securities maturing through 2023 amounted to $571 million and $734 million, respectively. Approximately 10 percent and 15 percent of these investments as of December 31, 2000, and 1999, respectively, have fixed interest rates (average of 6.9%), while the remaining investments have variable rates. A hypothetical 100-basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or market values. (A 100-basis point change is a reasonably possible near-term change in rates).  26       Market Price Sensitive Financial Instruments       Abbott maintains a portfolio of available-for-sale equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions. The market value of these investments was approximately $215 million and $282 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2000, and 1999. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease the fair value by approximately $43 million. (A 20 percent decrease is a reasonably possible near-term change in share prices).  Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments  Purchased U.S. Dollar Call Options       Abbott's foreign subsidiaries purchase U.S. dollar call options as a hedge of anticipated intercompany purchases by these foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency, primarily European currencies and Japanese yen, is not the U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2000, there were no such contracts outstanding and at December 31, 1999, Abbott held $85 million of these contracts.  Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts       Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third-party trade payables and receivables. The contracts are marked-to-market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being hedged. At December 31, 2000, and 1999, Abbott held $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, of such contracts which all mature in the next calendar year. The following table reflects the contracts outstanding at December 31, 2000, and 1999:     27            ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA             Page   Financial Statements:          Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income    29      Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows    30      Consolidated Balance Sheet    31      Consolidated Statement of Shareholders' Investment    33      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    34    Report of Independent Public Accountants    48    Management Report on Financial Statements    48    28           Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries     Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income  (dollars and shares in thousands except per share data)         The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.  29           Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries     Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows  (dollars in thousands)         The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.  30              Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries     Consolidated Balance Sheet  (dollars in thousands)         The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.  31     Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Consolidated Balance Sheet (dollars in thousands)      32           Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries     Consolidated Statement of Shareholders' Investment  (dollars in thousands except per share data)         The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.  33              Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements      Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies       NATURE OF BUSINESS AND CONCENTRATION OF RISK  Abbott's principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products and services. Due to the nature of its operations, Abbott is not subject to significant concentration risks relating to customers, products or geographic locations.      BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions. The accounts of foreign subsidiaries are consolidated as of November 30, due to the time needed to consolidate these subsidiaries. No events occurred related to these foreign subsidiaries in December 2000, 1999 and 1998 that materially affected the financial position or results of operations. Certain prior year amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows have been reclassified to conform with the 2000 presentation.      USE OF ESTIMATES  The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for litigation, income taxes, sales rebates, and inventory and accounts receivable exposures.      CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES  Cash equivalents consist of time deposits and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three months or less. Investments in marketable equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with any unrealized holding gains or losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Impairment losses are charged to income for other than temporary declines in fair value of equity securities. Investments in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity, as management has both the intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity, and are reported at cost, net of any unamortized premium or discount. Income relating to these securities is reported as a component of interest income.      INVENTORIES  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market. Cost includes material and conversion costs.      LONG-LIVED ASSETS  Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The following table shows estimated useful lives of property and equipment:     Classification    Expected Useful Lives     Buildings   10 to 50 years (average 29 years )   Equipment   3 to 20 years (average 11 years )        Intangible assets, primarily purchased intangible assets and goodwill resulting from business acquisitions, are amortized on a straight-line basis over up to 40 years. Accumulated amortization as of December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, was $334 million, $228 million, and $163 million, respectively.      Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based on projected undiscounted cash flows associated with the affected assets. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference. Fair value is determined based on market quotes, if available, or is based on valuation techniques.      PRODUCT LIABILITY  Provisions are made for the portions of probable losses that are not covered by product liability insurance.  34          TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS  For foreign operations in highly inflationary economies, translation gains and losses are included in net foreign exchange (gain) loss. For remaining foreign operations, translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).      REVENUE RECOGNITION  Revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment to customers. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales of product rights are recorded as revenue upon disposition of the rights. Revenue from license of product rights, or for performance of research or selling activities, is recorded over the periods earned.      RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  Internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Third-party research and development costs are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or as milestone results have been achieved.  Note 2  Supplemental Financial Information (dollars in thousands)      Note 3  Taxes on Earnings (dollars in thousands)       Deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts. U.S. income taxes are provided on those earnings of foreign subsidiaries and subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico under tax incentive grants, which are intended to be remitted to the parent company. Undistributed earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries as working capital and plant and equipment aggregated $2,432,433 at December 31, 2000. Deferred income taxes not provided on these earnings would be approximately $572,016.  35          Earnings before taxes, and the related provisions for taxes on earnings, were as follows:         Differences between the effective income tax rate and the U.S. statutory tax rate were as follows:         2000   1999   1998     Statutory tax rate   35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 %   Benefit of tax exemptions in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Costa Rica   (5.0 ) (5.2 ) (4.9 )   State taxes, net of federal benefit   1.2   1.4   1.0     Domestic dividend exclusion   (3.5 ) (3.2 ) (2.3 )   All other, net   (0.7 )    (0.8 )                  Effective tax rate   27.0 % 28.0 % 28.0 %                       As of December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, total deferred tax assets were $1,458,707, $1,364,867, and $1,286,341, respectively, and total deferred tax liabilities were $463,406, $441,404, and $487,207,  36      respectively. Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets were not significant. The temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:     Note 4  Investment Securities (dollars in thousands)       The following is a summary of investment securities at December 31:            Of the investment securities listed above, $590,678, $742,610, and $858,809 were held at December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively, by subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico under tax incentive grants expiring from 2002 through 2007. In addition, these subsidiaries held cash equivalents of $85,925, $11,900, and $74,900 at December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.  37     Note 5  Post-Employment Benefits (dollars in thousands)       Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution, and medical and dental plans.      Information for Abbott's major defined benefit plans and post-employment medical and dental benefit plans is as follows:     38       Note 5  Post-Employment Benefits (dollars in thousands) (Continued)       The projected benefit obligations for certain foreign defined benefit plans that do not have plan assets were $65,116, $63,904, and $62,719 at December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.      Assumptions used for major benefit plans as of December 31 include:         2000   1999   1998     Discount rate for determining obligations and interest cost   71/2 % 73/4 % 63/4 %   Expected aggregate average long-term change in compensation   5 % 5 % 5 %   Expected long-term rate of return on assets   91/2 % 91/2 % 91/2 %        A five percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits is assumed.      A one-percentage point increase/(decrease) in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase/(decrease) the accumulated post-employment benefit obligations as of December 31, 2000, by approximately $125,739/$(75,875), and the total of the service and interest cost components of net post-employment health care cost for the year then ended by approximately $16,347/$(10,122).      The Abbott Stock Retirement Plan is the principal defined contribution plan. Company contributions to this plan were approximately $86,000 in 2000, $76,000 in 1999, and $67,000 in 1998, equal to 7.33 percent of dividends declared, as provided under the plan.      Abbott provides certain other post-employment benefits, primarily salary continuation plans, to qualifying domestic employees, and accrues for the related cost over the service lives of the employees.  Note 6  Financial Instruments and Derivatives       Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. Such contracts are also used to hedge foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell foreign currencies, primarily European currencies and Japanese yen, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and other European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currencies hedged are primarily the U.S. dollar, European currencies and Japanese yen. At December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, Abbott held $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.6 billion, respectively, of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. The contracts outstanding at December 31, 2000, mature in 2001. These contracts are marked-to-market each month. The resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.      Abbott's foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar purchase U.S. dollar call options as a hedge of anticipated intercompany purchases. These contracts give Abbott the right, but not the requirement, to purchase U.S. dollars in exchange for foreign currencies, primarily European currencies and Japanese yen, at predetermined exchange rates. At December 31, 1999, and 1998, Abbott held $85 million and $406 million, respectively, of U.S. dollar call option contracts. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on contracts that qualify as hedges of anticipated purchases by foreign subsidiaries are recognized in the same period that the foreign currency exposure is recognized. Contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked-to-market each month, and the resulting gains or losses are reflected in income.      Net unrealized losses on foreign currency forward exchange contracts are included in other prepaid expenses and receivables, and net unrealized gains are included in other accrued liabilities. Gains and losses are classified as net foreign exchange (gain) loss. For U.S. dollar call options, net unrealized gains  39      and losses and unamortized premiums are included in other prepaid expenses and receivables. For U.S. dollar call options that do not qualify for hedge accounting, gains and losses are included as net foreign exchange (gain) loss. For U.S. dollar call options that qualify for hedge accounting treatment, gains and losses are included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold.      In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement requires the recognition of the fair value of derivatives as either assets or liabilities. Adoption of the provisions of this statement on January 1, 2001, will not have a material effect on the financial statements of Abbott. The transition credit that was recorded to income on January 1, 2001, was approximately $2 million.      The gross unrealized holding gains (losses) on current and long-term held-to-maturity investment securities totaled $1.3 million and $(21.4) million, respectively, at December 31, 2000; $1.1 million and $(29.9) million, respectively, at December 31, 1999; and $3.7 million and $(9.6) million, respectively, at December 31, 1998. The gross unrealized holding gains (losses) on available-for-sale equity securities totaled $80.3 million and $(34.0) million, respectively, at December 31, 2000; $49.3 million and $(4.7) million, respectively, at December 31, 1999; and $61.7 million and $(6.7) million, respectively, at December 31, 1998.      The carrying values and fair values of certain financial instruments as of December 31 are shown in the table below. The carrying values of all other financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values. Fair value is the quoted market price of the instrument held or the quoted market price of a similar instrument. The counterparties to financial instruments consist of select major international financial institutions. Abbott does not expect any losses from nonperformance by these counterparties.     Note 7  Incentive Stock Program       The 1996 Incentive Stock Program authorizes the granting of stock options, replacement stock options, stock appreciation rights, limited stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, performance units, and foreign qualified benefits. Stock options, replacement stock options, limited stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and foreign qualified benefits have been granted and are currently outstanding under this program and prior programs. The purchase price of shares under option must be at least equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, and the maximum term of an option is 10 years. Options granted in 2000, 1999 and 1998 vest equally over three or four years except for  40      replacement options, which generally vest in six months. Upon a change in control of Abbott, all outstanding stock options become fully exercisable, and all terms and conditions of all restricted stock awards are deemed satisfied.      At January 1, 2001, 37.0 million shares were reserved for future grants under the 1996 Program. Subsequent to year end, the Board of Directors granted approximately 18.5 million stock options from this reserve.            Abbott measures compensation cost using the intrinsic value-based method of accounting. Had compensation cost been determined using the fair market value-based accounting method, pro forma net income and earnings per share (EPS) amounts would have been as follows:     41         The weighted average fair value of an option granted in 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $10.60, $12.26 and $11.02, respectively. For purposes of fair market value disclosures, the fair market value of an option grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:     Note 8  Debt and Lines of Credit (dollars in thousands)       The following is a summary of long-term debt at December 31:         Payments required on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2000, are $250,172 in 2001, $1,059 in 2002, $200,059 in 2003, $59 in 2004, and $150,050 in 2005.      At December 31, 2000, Abbott had $1,505,000 of unused domestic lines of credit, which support domestic commercial paper borrowing arrangements. Related compensating balances, which are subject to withdrawal by Abbott at its option, and commitment fees are not material. Abbott's weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings was 5.9%, 5.7%, and 5.5% at December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.  Note 9  Equity Method Investments (dollars in millions)       Abbott's 50 percent owned joint venture, TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. (TAP), is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Abbott's share of TAP's income was $481, $390, and $266 in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. The investment in TAP was $491, $521, and $368 at December 31, 2000, 1999,  42      and 1998, respectively. Dividends received from TAP were $511, $237, and $209 in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Summarized financial information for TAP is as follows:            Undistributed earnings of investments accounted for under the equity method amounted to $467 as of December 31, 2000.  Note 10  Quarterly Results (Unaudited) (dollars in millions except per share data)      43     Note 11  Stock Purchase Rights       Common shares outstanding are subject to stock purchase rights. The rights, which are exercisable only under certain conditions, entitle the holder to purchase common shares at prices specified in the Rights Agreement. The rights were not exercisable at December 31, 2000.  Note 12  Business Combinations and Divestiture       On December 15, 2000, Abbott and BASF A.G. reached an agreement through which Abbott will purchase the pharmaceutical business of BASF, subject to approval of government regulators. The purchase price is $6.9 billion. Abbott estimates that the acquisition, if completed, will result in purchase accounting charges of approximately $1.0 billion for in-process research and development in 2001, and will result in goodwill and intangibles of approximately $5.0 billion. The purchase will be financed by U.S. dollar and euro-based borrowings.      On November 19, 1999, Abbott completed a merger transaction with Perclose, Inc., which was accounted for as a pooling-of-interests transaction. Abbott issued approximately 15.1 million common shares to Perclose shareholders, and Perclose's outstanding stock options were converted into options to purchase approximately 2.9 million Abbott common shares. Merger-related charges of approximately $16.2 million are included in selling, general and administrative expenses for 1999. Abbott's consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been restated to include Perclose and are not significantly different than previously reported amounts.      In 1999, Abbott acquired certain assets of Glaxo Wellcome Inc.'s U.S. anesthesia business for approximately $217 million in cash. A substantial portion of the purchase price was allocated to intangible assets, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over 15 years. In 1998, Abbott acquired the common stock of International Murex Technologies Corporation, a manufacturer of medical diagnostic products, for approximately $234 million in cash. A substantial portion of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill, which is amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years. Had these acquisitions taken place on January 1 of the previous years, consolidated sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts.      In January 2000, Abbott sold its agricultural products business to Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd., resulting in a $139 million gain. Under the transaction, Sumitomo acquired research and development, sales, marketing, and support operations for Abbott's entire line of naturally occurring biopesticides, plant growth regulators and other products for agriculture, public health and forestry. Bulk active ingredient manufacturing rights were retained by Abbott. For the full year 1999, Abbott recorded approximately $102 million in sales from this business.  44       Note 13  Segment and Geographic Area Information (dollars in millions)       REVENUE SEGMENTS  Abbott's principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products and services. Abbott's products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians' offices and government agencies throughout the world. Abbott's reportable segments are as follows:      PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS  U.S. sales of a broad line of pharmaceuticals.      DIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS  Worldwide sales of diagnostic systems for blood banks, hospitals, consumers, commercial laboratories and alternate-care testing sites.      HOSPITAL PRODUCTS  U.S. sales of intravenous and irrigation fluids and related administration equipment, drugs and drug-delivery systems, anesthetics, critical care products, and other medical specialty products for hospitals and alternate-care sites.      ROSS PRODUCTS  U.S. sales of a broad line of adult and pediatric nutritional products, pediatric pharmaceuticals and consumer products.      INTERNATIONAL  Non-U.S. sales of all of Abbott's pharmaceutical, hospital and nutritional products. Products sold by International are manufactured by domestic segments and by international manufacturing locations.      Abbott's underlying accounting records are maintained on a legal entity basis for government and public reporting requirements. Segment disclosures are on a performance basis consistent with internal management reporting. Intersegment transfers of inventory are recorded at standard cost and are not a measure of segment operating earnings. The cost of some corporate functions and the cost of certain employee benefits are sold to segments at predetermined rates which approximate cost. Remaining costs, if any, are not allocated to revenue segments. Effective January 1, 2001, certain intangibles and related amortization are excluded from performance measures by revenue segments. Segment information for 2000, 1999 and 1998 reflects this change. The following segment information has been prepared in accordance with the internal accounting policies of Abbott, as described above, and are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied to the consolidated financial statements.      (a)In 2000, management of the vascular medicine franchise was transferred from the Pharmaceutical segment to the Hospital segment. The above segment information for 1999 and 1998 has been restated to reflect this transfer. (b)In 2001, management of the FACT PLUS product franchise was transferred from the Diagnostics segment to the Ross segment. The above segment information reflects this transfer. (c)As of January 2001, certain intersegment royalties are no longer charged to the Hospital segment. Operating earnings for the Hospital segment reflect this change.  45      (d)Net sales and operating earnings were unfavorably affected by the relatively stronger U.S. dollar in each year presented.       (e)All years include intangibles amortization previously reported by reportable segments and 1999 includes charges of $168 relating to the FDA consent decree, as described in Note 15.       (f)Sales by country are based on the country that sold the product or service.       The classes of products that contributed at least 10 percent to consolidated net sales in at least one of the last three years were:     Note 14  Litigation and Environmental Matters       Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings including numerous antitrust suits and investigations in connection with the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals. These suits and investigations allege that various pharmaceutical manufacturers have conspired to fix prices for prescription  46      pharmaceuticals and/or to discriminate in pricing to retail pharmacies by providing discounts to mail-order pharmacies, institutional pharmacies and HMOs in violation of state and federal antitrust laws. The suits have been brought on behalf of individuals and retail pharmacies and name both Abbott and certain other pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmaceutical wholesalers and at least one mail-order pharmacy company as defendants. The cases seek treble damages, civil penalties, and injunctive and other relief. Abbott has filed or intends to file a response to each of the remaining complaints denying all substantive allegations.      In addition, there are several lawsuits and one investigation pending in connection with the sales of HYTRIN. These suits and the investigation allege that Abbott violated state or federal antitrust laws and, in some cases, unfair competition laws by signing separate agreements with Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Zenith Laboratories, Inc. Those agreements related to pending patent infringement lawsuits between Abbott and the two companies. Some of the suits also allege that Abbott violated various state or federal laws by filing frivolous patent infringement lawsuits to protect HYTRIN from generic competition. The cases seek treble damages, civil penalties and other relief. Abbott has filed or intends to file a response to each of the complaints denying all substantive allegations.      The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the marketing and sales practices of TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. (TAP) for LUPRON. In addition, various state and federal agencies are investigating the pricing practices of TAP with respect to LUPRON and/or Abbott with respect to certain other Medicare and Medicaid reimbursable products.      Abbott has also been identified as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a number of Company-owned locations.      Abbott expects that within the next year, legal proceedings will occur that may result in a change in the estimated reserves recorded by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims, proceedings, investigations and remediation activities with certainty, management is of the opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott's financial position, ongoing cash flows, or ongoing results of operations. But an adverse outcome in the U.S. Department of Justice's investigation of TAP could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's cash flows and results of operations for a particular period.  Note 15  U.S. Food and Drug Administration Consent Decree       In November 1999, Abbott reached agreement with the U.S. government to have a consent decree entered to settle issues involving Abbott's diagnostics manufacturing operations in Lake County, Ill. The decree, which was amended in December 2000, requires Abbott to ensure its diagnostics manufacturing processes in Lake County, Ill., conform with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Quality System Regulation (QSR). The decree allows for the continued manufacture and distribution of medically necessary diagnostic products made in Lake County, Ill. However, Abbott is prohibited from manufacturing or distributing certain diagnostic products until Abbott ensures the processes in its Lake County, Ill., diagnostics manufacturing operations conform with the QSR. The decree allows Abbott to export diagnostic products and components for sale and distribution outside the United States if they meet the export requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Under the terms of the amended consent decree, Abbott must ensure its diagnostics manufacturing operations are in conformance with the QSR by various dates through January 15, 2001. The FDA will determine Abbott's conformance with the QSR after an inspection of Abbott's facilities. If the FDA concludes that the operations are not in conformance with the QSR as of the date required, Abbott may be subject to additional costs.  47              Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries     Report of Independent Public Accountants      To the Shareholders of Abbott Laboratories:      We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Abbott Laboratories (an Illinois corporation) and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, and the related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, shareholders' investment, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of Abbott's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.      We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.      In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.     Chicago, Illinois January 15, 2001 Arthur Andersen LLP        Management Report on Financial Statements          Management has prepared, and is responsible for, Abbott's consolidated financial statements and related notes. They have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and necessarily include amounts based on judgments and estimates by management. All financial information in this annual report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements.      Abbott maintains internal accounting control systems and related policies and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and properly recorded, and that accounting records may be relied upon for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and other financial information. The design, monitoring and revision of internal accounting control systems involve, among other things, management's judgment with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of specific control measures. Abbott also maintains an internal auditing function that evaluates and formally reports on the adequacy and effectiveness of internal accounting controls, policies and procedures.      Abbott's consolidated financial statements have been audited by independent public accountants who have expressed their opinion with respect to the fairness of these statements.  Miles D.
