PROGRAM ACCOUNTING IS A METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED FOR DELIVERY UNDER PRODUCTION TYPE CONTRACTS WHERE PROFITABILITY IS REALIZED OVER MULTIPLE CONTRACTS AND YEARS. UNDER PROGRAM ACCOUNTING, INVENTORIABLE PRODUCTION COSTS (INCLUDING OVERHEAD), PROGRAM TOOLING COSTS AND WARRANTY COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED AND CHARGED TO REVENUE BY PROGRAM INSTEAD OF BY INDIVIDUAL UNITS OR CONTRACTS. A PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF UNITS (ACCOUNTING QUANTITY) OF A PRODUCT TO BE PRODUCED IN A CONTINUING, LONG-TERM PRODUCTION EFFORT FOR DELIVERY UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. TO ESTABLISH THE RELATIONSHIP OF REVENUE TO COST OF SALES, PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF (A) THE NUMBER OF UNITS TO BE PRODUCED AND SOLD IN A PROGRAM, (B) THE PERIOD OVER WHICH THE UNITS CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO BE PRODUCED, AND (C) THEIR EXPECTED SELLING PRICES, PRODUCTION COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING, AND WARRANTY COSTS FOR THE TOTAL PROGRAM. </FONT></P> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>THE RELIANCE ON ESTIMATES IN THE USE OF PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRES THE DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE COST-REVENUE RELATIONSHIP FOR THE DEFINED PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY. THE FACTORS THAT MUST BE ESTIMATED INCLUDE SELLING PRICE, LABOR AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS, MATERIAL COSTS, PROCURED PARTS AND MAJOR COMPONENT COSTS, AND OVERHEAD COSTS. TO MEET THIS REQUIREMENT THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A RIGOROUS ESTIMATING PROCESS THAT IS REVIEWED AND UPDATED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. CHANGES IN ESTIMATE ARE RECOGNIZED ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS. </FONT></P> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>UNDERLYING ALL ESTIMATES USED FOR PROGRAM ACCOUNTING IS THE ASSUMED MARKET AND THE CORRESPONDING PRODUCTION RATES. THE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY IS ESTABLISHED BASED UPON THE ASSUMED MARKET. THE TOTAL PROGRAM REVENUE IS DETERMINED BY ESTIMATING THE MODEL MIX AND SALES PRICE FOR ALL UNSOLD UNITS WITHIN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY ADDED TOGETHER WITH THE REVENUE FOR ALL UNDELIVERED UNITS UNDER CONTRACT. THE SALES PRICES FOR ALL UNDELIVERED UNITS WITHIN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY INCLUDE AN ESCALATION ADJUSTMENT THAT IS BASED ON PROJECTED ESCALATION RATES. COST ESTIMATES ARE BASED IN A LARGE PART ON HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE TRENDS, BUSINESS BASE AND OTHER ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS, AND INFORMATION PROVIDED BY SUPPLIERS. FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE PRODUCTION RATES, INTERNAL AND SUBCONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE TRENDS, ASSET UTILIZATION, ANTICIPATED LABOR AGREEMENTS, AND INFLATIONARY TRENDS. </FONT></P> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FOR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES WHEN A UNIT IS COMPLETED AND ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER. THE REVENUE RECOGNIZED IS THE PRICE NEGOTIATED WITH THE CUSTOMER INCLUDING SPECIAL FEATURES ADJUSTED BY AN ESCALATION FORMULA. THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGE FOR THE TOTAL REMAINING PROGRAM TO THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED FOR THE QUARTER. BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER UNIT PRODUCTION COSTS EXPERIENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW AIRPLANE PROGRAM (KNOWN AS THE LEARNING CURVE EFFECT), THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED FOR PRODUCTION OF THE EARLY UNITS IN THE PROGRAM WILL EXCEED THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES FOR THOSE UNITS.

IN THE EVENT THE COMPANY ACCEPTS AN AIRCRAFT UNDER A TRADE-IN AGREEMENT, THE AIRCRAFT PURCHASED BY THE COMPANY SERVES AS COLLATERAL TO OFFSET AMOUNTS PAID BY THE COMPANY TO THE CUSTOMER. </FONT></P> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>OBLIGATIONS RECORDED FROM TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT AGREEMENTS ARE MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROSS AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO CUSTOMERS AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL. THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL IS DETERMINED USING A PROCESS BASED ON THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT, ASSUMING THE MOST LIKELY MARKET PLACEMENT OF THE AIRCRAFT. THE FIRST STEP IN THIS PROCESS USES THE COMPANY&#146;S ASSESSMENT OF THE MARKET FOR EACH TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT, WHICH IN MOST INSTANCES BEGINS YEARS BEFORE THE RETURN OF THE AIRCRAFT. THERE ARE SEVERAL POSSIBLE MARKETS TO WHICH THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY PURSUES OPPORTUNITIES TO PLACE USED AIRCRAFT. THESE MARKETS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, (1) THE RESALE MARKET, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY INCLUDE THE COST OF LONG-TERM STORAGE, (2) THE LEASING MARKET, WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR REFURBISHMENT COSTS TO MEET THE LEASING CUSTOMER&#146;S REQUIREMENTS, OR (3) THE SCRAP MARKET. COLLATERAL VALUATION VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON WHICH MARKET THE COMPANY DETERMINES IS MOST LIKELY FOR EACH AIRCRAFT. ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, THE COMPANY UPDATES ITS VALUATION ANALYSIS BASED ON THE ACTUAL ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH PLACING EACH AIRCRAFT INTO A MARKET. THIS QUARTERLY COLLATERAL VALUATION PROCESS YIELDS RESULTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY LOWER THAN RESIDUAL VALUE ESTIMATES BY INDEPENDENT SOURCES AND TENDS TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT RESULTS UPON THE ACTUAL PLACEMENT OF THE AIRCRAFT. </FONT></P> <PAGE><P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=1>- 13 -</FONT></P> <HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>BASED ON THE BEST MARKET INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME, THE COMPANY DEEMED IT PROBABLE THAT IT WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO PERFORM ON TRADE-IN AGREEMENTS WITH GROSS AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO CUSTOMERS TOTALING $1,370 MILLION AND $1,340 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY APPLIES JUDGMENT BASED ON THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, USUALLY WHEN THE FEATURES OR UTILIZATION OF THE AIRCRAFT VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE MORE GENERIC AIRCRAFT ATTRIBUTES COVERED BY OUTSIDE PUBLICATIONS. </FONT></P> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2><U>IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND HELD FOR RE-LEASE</U><BR> THE COMPANY REVIEWS THESE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. AN ASSET UNDER OPERATING LEASE OR HELD FOR RE-LEASE IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW OVER THE REMAINING USEFUL LIFE IS LESS THAN THE BOOK VALUE. VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS ARE USED WHEN DETERMINING THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW. THESE ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE LEASE RATES, LEASE TERM(S), PERIODS IN WHICH THE ASSET MAY BE HELD IN PREPARATION FOR A FOLLOW-ON LEASE, MAINTENANCE COSTS, REMARKETING COSTS AND THE LIFE OF THE ASSET. THE DETERMINATION OF EXPECTED LEASE RATES IS GENERALLY BASED ON OUTSIDE PUBLICATIONS. THE COMPANY USES HISTORICAL INFORMATION AND CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS TO DETERMINE THE REMAINING ASSUMPTIONS. WHEN IMPAIRMENT IS INDICATED FOR AN ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS THE EXCESS OF CARRYING VALUE OVER FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT HAD THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS DEEMED IMPAIRED DURING 2002 BEEN 10% HIGHER OR LOWER AT THE TIME EACH SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT HAD BEEN TAKEN, THE IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE WOULD HAVE DECREASED OR INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION.

THE BALANCE IS AN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE BUT UNCONFIRMED LOSSES IN THE RECEIVABLE PORTFOLIO. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATES TO TWO COMPONENTS OF RECEIVABLES: (A) SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED RECEIVABLES THAT ARE EVALUATED INDIVIDUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT, AND (B) POOLS OF RECEIVABLES THAT ARE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT. </FONT></P> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>A SPECIFIC RECEIVABLE IS REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN, BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION AND EVENTS, IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT AMOUNTS DUE ACCORDING TO THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN ASSESSING UNCOLLECTIBILITY INCLUDE A CUSTOMER&#146;S EXTENDED DELINQUENCY, REQUESTS FOR RESTRUCTURING AND FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY. A SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT ALLOWANCE IS PROVIDED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RECEIVABLE AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED COLLATERAL. </FONT></P> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>THE COMPANY REVIEWS THE ADEQUACY OF THE GENERAL VALUATION ALLOWANCE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE REMAINING POOL OF RECEIVABLES BY ASSESSING BOTH THE COLLATERAL EXPOSURE AND THE APPLICABLE DEFAULT RATE. COLLATERAL EXPOSURE FOR A PARTICULAR RECEIVABLE IS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OVER THE APPLICABLE COLLATERAL VALUE OF THE RELATED ASSET. A RECEIVABLE WITH AN ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE IS CONSIDERED TO HAVE NO COLLATERAL EXPOSURE. THE APPLICABLE DEFAULT RATE IS DETERMINED USING TWO COMPONENTS: CUSTOMER CREDIT RATINGS AND WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING PORTFOLIO TERM. CREDIT RATINGS ARE IDENTIFIED FOR EACH CUSTOMER IN THE PORTFOLIO. CUSTOMER CREDIT RATINGS ARE UPDATED BASED ON CURRENT RATING AGENCY INFORMATION OR THE COMPANY&#146;S BEST ESTIMATES. </FONT></P> <PAGE><P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=1>- 14 -</FONT></P> <HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>FOR EACH CREDIT RATING CATEGORY, THE COLLATERAL EXPOSURE IS MULTIPLIED BY AN APPLICABLE HISTORICAL DEFAULT RATE, YIELDING A CREDIT-ADJUSTED COLLATERAL EXPOSURE. HISTORICAL DEFAULT RATES ARE PUBLISHED BY STANDARD &AMP; POOR&#146;S REFLECTING BOTH THE CUSTOMER CREDIT RATING AND THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING PORTFOLIO TERM. THE SUM OF THE CREDIT-ADJUSTED COLLATERAL EXPOSURES GENERATES AN INITIAL ESTIMATE OF THE GENERAL VALUATION ALLOWANCE. IN RECOGNITION OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE ULTIMATE LOSS EXPERIENCE AND RELATIVELY LONG DURATION OF THE PORTFOLIO, A RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE OUTCOMES OF THE PORTFOLIO&#146;S CREDIT-ADJUSTED COLLATERAL EXPOSURE IS CALCULATED BY VARYING THE APPLICABLE DEFAULT RATE BY APPROXIMATELY PLUS AND MINUS 15%. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RECORDED REPRESENTS THE BEST ESTIMATE WITHIN THE RESULTING RANGE OF CREDIT-ADJUSTED COLLATERAL EXPOSURE, FACTORING IN CONSIDERATIONS OF RISK OF INDIVIDUAL CREDITS, CURRENT AND PROJECTED ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, AND PRIOR LOSS EXPERIENCE. </FONT></P> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>THE RESULTING RANGE OF THE CREDIT-ADJUSTED COLLATERAL EXPOSURE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, WAS APPROXIMATELY $280 MILLION TO $355 MILLION.

THIS STATEMENT REQUIRES AN IMPAIRMENT-ONLY APPROACH TO ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL. BECAUSE THE COMPOSITION OF THE COMPANY HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO VARIOUS ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL CONSTITUTES A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY&#146;S LONG-TERM ASSETS. AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 142, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRE-TAX GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $2,410 MILLION DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002. </FONT></P> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>THE SFAS NO. 142 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT MODEL IS A TWO-STEP PROCESS. FIRST, IT REQUIRES A COMPARISON OF THE BOOK VALUE OF NET ASSETS TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED OPERATIONS THAT HAVE GOODWILL ASSIGNED TO THEM. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN BOOK VALUE, A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED TO COMPUTE THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT. IN THIS PROCESS, A FAIR VALUE FOR GOODWILL IS ESTIMATED, BASED IN PART ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OPERATIONS USED IN THE FIRST STEP, AND IS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE SHORTFALL OF THE FAIR VALUE BELOW CARRYING VALUE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. SFAS NO. 142 REQUIRES GOODWILL TO BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AT THE SAME TIME EVERY YEAR, AND WHEN AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE SUCH THAT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. THE COMPANY SELECTED APRIL 1 AS ITS ANNUAL TESTING DATE. </FONT></P> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUES OF THE RELATED OPERATIONS USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. THE FORECASTS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED ON THE COMPANY&#146;S BEST ESTIMATE OF FUTURE REVENUES AND OPERATING COSTS, BASED PRIMARILY ON EXISTING FIRM ORDERS, EXPECTED FUTURE ORDERS, CONTRACTS WITH SUPPLIERS, LABOR AGREEMENTS, AND GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, AND ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND APPROVAL BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. CHANGES IN THESE FORECASTS COULD CAUSE A PARTICULAR OPERATING GROUP TO EITHER PASS OR FAIL THE FIRST STEP IN THE SFAS NO. 142 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT MODEL, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT RECORDED. </FONT></P> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>THE CASH FLOW FORECASTS ARE ADJUSTED BY AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE DERIVED FROM THE COMPANY&#146;S MARKET CAPITALIZATION PLUS A SUITABLE CONTROL PREMIUM AT THE DATE OF EVALUATION. THEREFORE, CHANGES IN THE STOCK PRICE WILL ALSO AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT RECORDED. AT THE DATE OF THE PREVIOUS IMPAIRMENT, A 10% INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF BOEING COMMON STOCK WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RECORDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002 BY APPROXIMATELY $190 MILLION. A 10% DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF BOEING COMMON STOCK WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE BY APPROXIMATELY $160 MILLION. </FONT></P> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2><I>POSTRETIREMENT PLANS</I></FONT></P> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>THE COMPANY SPONSORS VARIOUS PENSION PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSIONS, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE, TO ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND QUALIFYING DEPENDENTS. THE LIABILITIES AND ANNUAL INCOME OR EXPENSE OF THE COMPANY&#146;S PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS ARE DETERMINED USING METHODOLOGIES THAT INVOLVE SEVERAL ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN, AND MEDICAL TREND (RATE OF GROWTH FOR MEDICAL COSTS). NOT ALL NET PERIODIC PENSION INCOME OR EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED IN NET EARNINGS IN THE YEAR INCURRED BECAUSE IT IS ALLOCATED TO PRODUCTION AS PRODUCT COSTS, AND A PORTION REMAINS IN INVENTORY AT THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD. </FONT></P> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>THE COMPANY USES A DISCOUNT RATE THAT IS BASED ON A POINT-IN-TIME ESTIMATE AS OF THE SEPTEMBER 30 MEASUREMENT DATE.

A 25 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE THE 2002 PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT LIABILITIES BY APPROXIMATELY $1,000 MILLION (3%) AND $230 MILLION (3%), RESPECTIVELY, AND DECREASE THE 2002 NET PERIODIC PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $16 MILLION AND $11 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN IS BASED ON A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO INCLUDING DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, FIXED INCOME, REAL ESTATE, PRIVATE EQUITIES AND UNCORRELATED ASSETS. PENSION INCOME OR EXPENSE IS ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN.

AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY HAS REDUCED ITS EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN BY 25 BASIS POINTS TO 9.0% BEGINNING IN 2003. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN IS BASED ON TARGET ASSET ALLOCATIONS OF 60% EQUITY WITH A RETURN OF 10.0%, 30% FIXED INCOME WITH A RETURN OF 6.8%, AND 10% OTHER (INCLUDING REAL ESTATE) WITH A RETURN OF 9.2%. CURRENT ALLOCATIONS ARE WITHIN 1 TO 3% OF EACH OF THE LONG-TERM TARGETS. THE DECLINE IN ASSET PERFORMANCE COUPLED WITH HISTORICALLY LOW INTEREST RATES (A KEY FACTOR WHEN ESTIMATING PLAN LIABILITIES), CAUSED THE COMPANY TO RECOGNIZE A SIGNIFICANT NON-CASH CHARGE TO EQUITY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002. THIS CHARGE, WHICH AMOUNTED TO A $5.7 BILLION INCREASE TO THE ACCRUED PENSION PLAN LIABILITY AND A $3.6 BILLION AFTER TAX DECREASE TO THE ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ACCOUNT WITHIN SHAREHOLDERS&#146; EQUITY, DID NOT IMPACT EARNINGS OR CASH FLOW, AND COULD REVERSE IN FUTURE PERIODS SHOULD EITHER INTEREST RATES INCREASE OR MARKET PERFORMANCE AND PLAN RETURNS IMPROVE.

THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS UNDERLYING LONG-TERM TRAFFIC GROWTH ARE SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH, BOTH IN DEVELOPED AND EMERGING COUNTRIES, AND POLITICAL STABILITY. DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY&#146;S COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES IS FURTHER INFLUENCED BY AIRLINE INDUSTRY PROFITABILITY, WORLD TRADE POLICIES, GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED UPON AIRPLANE OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, AND PRICE AND OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS. </FONT></P> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>AIRLINE INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT</FONT></P> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>COMMERCIAL AVIATION HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT BEGAN IN 2001 AND CONTINUED THROUGH 2002. IN ADDITION, THE INDUSTRY SUFFERED A TREMENDOUS SHOCK FROM THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. AIR TRAVEL IN MOST AREAS OF THE WORLD HAS NOT RECOVERED TO THE VOLUME CARRIED BY THE AIRLINES IN 2000, WHICH IS AFFECTING PROFITABILITY FOR MANY AIRLINES. U.S. FULL SERVICE AIRLINES HAVE SUFFERED THE GREATEST LOSSES. HOLIDAY TRAFFIC IN 2002 FOR THE U.S. AIRLINES SHOWED AN IMPROVEMENT AND MOST CARRIERS INDICATED BETTER FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER, THIS IMPROVEMENT WAS FOR ONLY A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND THE MAJOR U.S. FULL SERVICE AIRLINES REPORTED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FOR 2002. IN CONTRAST, LOW FARE AIRLINES IN THE U.S. AND IN EUROPE ARE REPORTING POSITIVE FINANCIAL RESULTS AND ARE GROWING. EUROPEAN NETWORK AIRLINES ARE EXPECTED TO SHOW BETTER RESULTS THAN THEIR U.S. COUNTERPARTS FOR THE FISCAL PERIOD ENDING IN MARCH OF 2003. TRAFFIC BETWEEN ASIA AND EUROPE HAS REBOUNDED TO PRE-SEPTEMBER 11 LEVELS. THIS TREND COMBINED WITH STRONGER TRAFFIC WITHIN THE REGION IS OFFSETTING THE SLOW GROWTH OVER THE PACIFIC PERMITTING MOST ASIAN AIRLINES TO SHOW PROFITS. </FONT></P> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>OUR TIMETABLE FOR INDUSTRY RECOVERY HAS BEEN DELAYED. WE PRESENTLY SEE 2003 TO BE THE YEAR OF RECOVERY FOR WORLD AIR TRAVEL; LATE 2003/EARLY 2004 TO BE THE YEAR OF AIRLINE PROFITABILITY RECOVERY; 2004 TO BE THE YEAR OF AIRPLANE ORDER RECOVERY; AND 2005 TO BE THE YEAR OF DELIVERY RECOVERY. THE MAJOR UNCERTAINTY THAT IS CURBING ECONOMIC GROWTH AND A STRONGER AND SOONER REBOUND IN THE INDUSTRY IS THE IRAQI SITUATION &#150; IN TERMS OF TIMING, SCALE OF MILITARY ENGAGEMENT, EFFECT ON OIL PRICES, AND CLARITY OF POLITICAL RESOLUTION. </FONT></P> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>THE COMPANY&#146;S 20-YEAR FORECAST OF THE AVERAGE LONG-TERM GROWTH RATE IN PASSENGER TRAFFIC IS 4.9% ANNUALLY, BASED ON PROJECTED AVERAGE WORLDWIDE ANNUAL ECONOMIC REAL GROWTH OF 2.9%. BASED ON GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH PROJECTIONS OVER THE LONG TERM, AND TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, INCREASING UTILIZATION LEVELS OF THE WORLDWIDE AIRPLANE FLEET AND REQUIREMENTS TO REPLACE OLDER AIRPLANES, THE COMPANY PROJECTED ALMOST A $5 TRILLION MARKET FOR NEW AIRPLANES AND SERVICES OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS. THIS IS A LONG-TERM FORECAST; HISTORICALLY, WHILE FACTORS SUCH AS THE GULF WAR AND TICKET CHARGES FOR SECURITY HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OVER THE SPAN OF SEVERAL YEARS, THEY HAVE NOT DRAMATICALLY AFFECTED THE LONGER TERM TRENDS IN THE WORLD ECONOMY, AND THEREFORE, THE COMPANY&#146;S MARKET OUTLOOK. </FONT></P> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>AIRLINE DEREGULATION</FONT></P> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>WORLDWIDE, THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED PROGRESSIVE DEREGULATION OF DOMESTIC MARKETS AND INCREASING LIBERALIZATION OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO VIRTUALLY ALL AIR TRAVEL TOOK PLACE WITHIN A FRAMEWORK OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. SINCE THEN, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, MOST NOTABLY THE UNITED STATES, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN AND THE COUNTRIES IN WESTERN EUROPE, HAVE ELIMINATED RESTRICTIVE REGULATIONS FOR DOMESTIC AIRLINE MARKETS AND PROMOTED A MORE OPEN-MARKET CLIMATE FOR INTERNATIONAL SERVICES. THESE TRENDS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE, BUT AT VARYING RATES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD. AT THE END OF THE NEXT DECADE, AN ESTIMATED TWO-THIRDS OF AIR TRAVEL WILL BE IN OPEN MARKETS. LIBERALIZATION OF GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, TOGETHER WITH INCREASED AIRPLANE RANGE CAPABILITIES, GIVES AIRLINES GREATER FREEDOM TO PURSUE OPTIMAL FLEET-MIX STRATEGIES. THIS INCREASED FLEXIBILITY ALLOWS THE AIRLINES TO ACCOMMODATE TRAFFIC GROWTH BY SELECTING THE BEST MIX OF FLIGHT FREQUENCIES AND AIRPLANE SIZE AND CAPABILITIES FOR THEIR ROUTE SYSTEMS. IN INTERCONTINENTAL MARKETS, MORE LIBERAL BILATERAL AIR SERVICE AGREEMENTS PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT STIMULUS TO OPENING NEW CITY-PAIR MARKETS, WHICH FAVOR INCREASED FLIGHT FREQUENCY OVER CAPACITY GROWTH. IN PARALLEL WITH REGULATORY LIBERALIZATION, IMPROVEMENTS IN AIRPLANE RANGE PERFORMANCE WILL CONTINUE TO ALLOW AIRLINES TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF DIRECT CITY-TO-CITY ROUTES, THUS REDUCING THE RELIANCE ON INDIRECT ROUTES THROUGH CENTRAL HUBS THAT REQUIRE LARGER CAPACITY AIRPLANES. </FONT></P> <PAGE><P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=1>- 30 -</FONT></P> <HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>INDUSTRY COMPETITIVENESS</FONT></P> <P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>THE COMPANY CURRENTLY FACES AGGRESSIVE INTERNATIONAL COMPETITORS THAT ARE SEEKING TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE. THIS COMPETITIVE FACTOR WAS DEMONSTRATED BY THE DECISION OF AIRBUS TO INTRODUCE THE A380, A PROPOSED AIRCRAFT WITH PASSENGER SEATING GREATER THAN THE 747, TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE AT THE UPPER END OF THE LARGE AIRPLANE MARKET. THIS MARKET ENVIRONMENT HAS RESULTED IN INTENSE PRESSURES ON PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS. THE COMPANY&#146;S FOCUS ON IMPROVING PROCESSES AND OTHER COST REDUCTION EFFORTS IS INTENDED TO ENHANCE ITS ABILITY TO PURSUE PRICING STRATEGIES THAT ENABLE THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN LEADERSHIP AT SATISFACTORY MARGINS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY&#146;S EXTENSIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES NETWORK FOR AIRLINES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN MAINTAINING HIGH CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.

COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND INCREASED LOWER-FARE TRAVEL HAVE COMBINED TO CAUSE A LONG-TERM DOWNWARD TREND IN PASSENGER REVENUE YIELDS WORLDWIDE (MEASURED IN REAL TERMS). MARKET LIBERALIZATION WITHIN EUROPE HAS ENABLED LOW-COST AIRLINES TO ENTER THE MARKET. THESE AIRLINES INCREASE THE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON AIRFARES, SIMILAR TO THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN THE UNITED STATES. AIRFARES BETWEEN ASIA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE AMONG THE LOWEST YIELD (AIRFARE DIVIDED BY REVENUE PASSENGER MILES) OF ANY IN THE WORLD. THESE FACTORS RESULT IN CONTINUED PRICE PRESSURE ON THE COMPANY&#146;S PRODUCTS.

U.S. MILITARY FORCE STRUCTURE IS SHRINKING, ITS PLATFORMS ARE AGING, AND THE TEMPO OF OPERATIONS AND ENGAGEMENTS WORLDWIDE REMAINS HIGH. THE UNITED STATES&#146; CURRENT MILITARY ACTIVITY DEMONSTRATES THE VALUE OF SYSTEMS SOLUTIONS THAT ALLOW ALL SYSTEMS TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER, TO OPERATE OVER LONGER RANGES, ARE UNMANNED AND PROVIDE THE ADVANTAGES OF PRECISION, PERSISTENCE AND SELECTIVE ENGAGEMENT.
