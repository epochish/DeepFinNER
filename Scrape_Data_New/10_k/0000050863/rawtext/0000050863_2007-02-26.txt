BUSINESS      Industry         We are the worlds largest semiconductor chip maker, based     on revenue. We develop advanced integrated digital technology     platforms and components, primarily integrated circuits, for the     computing and communications industries. Integrated circuits are     semiconductor chips etched with interconnected electronic     switches. Our goal is to be the preeminent provider of     semiconductor chips and platform solutions to the worldwide     digital economy. We offer products at various levels of     integration, allowing our customers flexibility to create     advanced computing and communications systems and products.         We believe that end users, original equipment manufacturers,     third-party vendors, and service providers of computing and     communications systems and devices want platform products. We     define a platform as a collection of technologies that are     designed to work together to provide a better end-user solution     than if the ingredients were used separately. Our platforms     consist of various products based on: standards and initiatives;     hardware and software that may include technologies such as     Hyper-Threading Technology (HT Technology),     Intel®     Virtualization Technology     (Intel®     VT), and     Intel®     Active Management Technology     (Intel®     AMT); and services. In developing our platforms, we may include     ingredients sold by other companies.         Intels products include chips, boards, and other     semiconductor products that are the building blocks integral to     computers, servers, handheld devices, and networking and     communications products. Our component-level products consist of     integrated circuits used to process information, including     microprocessors, chipsets, and flash memory.          We also believe that users of computing and communications     systems and devices want improved overall performance     and/or     improved energy-efficient performance. Improved overall     performance can include faster processing performance and other     improved capabilities such as multithreading and multitasking.     Performance can also be improved through enhanced connectivity,     security, manageability, utilization, reliability, ease of use,     and interoperability among devices. Improved energy-efficient     performance involves balancing the addition of these types of     improved performance factors with the power consumption of the     platform. Lower power consumption may reduce system heat output,     thereby providing power savings, and reducing the total cost of     ownership for the end user.         Our customers include:                       original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design     manufacturers (ODMs) who make computer systems, handheld     devices, and telecommunications and networking communications     equipment;                  PC and network communications products users (including     individuals, large and small businesses, and service providers)     who buy PC components and board-level products, as well as our     networking, communications, and storage products, through     distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the     world; and                  other manufacturers, including makers of a wide range of     industrial and communications equipment.

Products         Our products currently include microprocessors; chipsets;     motherboards; flash memory; wired and wireless connectivity     products; communications infrastructure components, including     network processors; and products for networked storage.        1    Table of Contents       A microprocessor is the central processing unit (CPU) of     a computer system. It processes system data and controls other     devices in the system, acting as the brains of the     computer. The following aspects of microprocessor design impact     overall platform performance:                   Multi-core processors. Multi-core processors contain     two or more processor cores, which enable improved multitasking     and energy-efficient performance. Our dual-core microprocessors     include the     Intel®     Coretm2     Duo,     Intel®     Coretm2     Extreme,     Intel®     Coretm Duo,     Intel®     Pentium® D,     Dual-Core     Intel®     Xeon®     processor family, and Dual-Core     Intel®     Itanium®     processors. Our quad-core microprocessors include the Quad-Core     Intel®     Xeon®,     Intel®     Coretm2     Quad, and     Intel®     Coretm2     Extreme quad-core processors.              Microarchitecture design of the CPU. Microprocessor     design architectures are commonly categorized by the number of     bits (the smallest unit of information processed on a computer)     that the processor can handle at one time. Currently,     microprocessors are designed to process 32 bits or 64 bits of     information at one time. Microprocessors with 64-bit processing     capability can address significantly more memory than 32-bit     microprocessors. The     Intel®     Coretm,     Intel®     Pentium®,     Intel®     Celeron®,     and     Intel®     Xeon®     branded products are based on our 32-bit architecture (IA-32),     while     Intel®     Itanium®     branded products are based on our     64-bit     architecture     (IA-64).     Another way to provide     64-bit     processing capability is for processors based on     32-bit     architecture to have 64-bit address extensions. The majority of     our microprocessors are equipped with     Intel®     64 architecture, which provides 64-bit address extensions,     supporting both 32-bit and 64-bit software applications.              Clock speed. Clock speed is the rate at which a     microprocessors internal logic operates and is a measure     of a microprocessors performance. Clock speed is measured     in units of hertz, or cycles processed per second. One megahertz     (MHz) equals one million cycles processed per second, and one     gigahertz (GHz) equals one billion cycles processed per second.              Speed of memory access. Cache is a memory that can     be located directly on the microprocessor, permitting quicker     access to frequently used data and instructions. Some of our     microprocessors have additional levels of     cachesecond-level (L2) cache and third-level (L3)     cacheto enable higher levels of performance.              Speed of communication between the CPU and the     chipset. A bus carries data between parts of the     system. A faster bus allows for faster data transfer into and     out of the processor, enabling increased performance.              Amount and type of memory storage. Memory storage is     measured in bytes (8 bits), with 1,024 bytes equaling a kilobyte     (KB), 1.049 million bytes equaling a megabyte (MB), and 1.074     billion bytes equaling a gigabyte (GB).           In addition to the performance factors discussed above, our     Intel®     Coretm     microarchitecture provides other enhanced features that can     increase performance or energy efficiency, including the     following:                    Feature       Performance Enhancement           Intel®     Advanced Smart Cache             Allows one core to utilize the     entire cache           Intel®     Intelligent Power Capability             Optimizes energy by managing the     runtime power consumption of each core           Intel®     Wide Dynamic Execution             Enables each core to complete up     to four full instructions simultaneously           Intel®     Smart Memory Access             Optimizes the use of available     data bandwidth from the memory subsystem and hides memory latency           Intel®     Advanced Digital Media Boost             Increases the execution speed for     instructions used widely in multimedia and graphics applications                   Other microprocessor capabilities can also enhance system     performance or user experience. For example, we offer     microprocessors with Intels HT Technology, which allows     each processor core to process two threads of instructions     simultaneously. This capability can provide benefits in one of     two ways: it helps to run multithreaded software,     which is designed to execute different parts of a program     simultaneously, or it helps to run multiple software programs     simultaneously in a multitasking environment. Other technologies     include Intel AMT, which helps information technology managers     diagnose, fix, and protect enabled systems that are plugged in     and connected to a network, even if a computer is turned off or     has a failed hard drive or operating system; and Intel VT, which     provides increased security and management capabilities through     the use of virtual partitions that isolate user environments,     for example, by enabling a platform to run multiple operating     systems and allowing for the system to isolate viruses from     applications within other partitions. To take advantage of these     features, a computer system must have a microprocessor that     supports: a chipset and BIOS (basic input/output system) that     use, and software that is optimized for, the technology.     Performance also will vary depending on the system hardware and     software used.         Microprocessors are also used in embedded designs such as     industrial equipment,     point-of-sale     systems, panel PCs, automotive information/entertainment     systems, and medical equipment.        2    Table of Contents       Our microprocessor sales generally have followed a seasonal     trend; however, there can be no assurance that this trend will     continue. Historically, our sales of microprocessors have been     higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of     the year. Consumer purchases of PCs have been higher in the     second half of the year, primarily due to     back-to-school     and holiday demand. In addition, purchases from businesses have     tended to be higher in the second half of the year.         The chipset operates as the PCs nervous     system, sending data between the microprocessor and input,     display, and storage devices, such as the keyboard, mouse,     monitor, hard drive, and CD or DVD drive. Chipsets perform     essential logic functions, such as balancing the performance of     the system and removing bottlenecks. Chipsets also extend the     graphics, audio, video, and other capabilities of many systems     based on our microprocessors. Finally, chipsets control the     access between the CPU and main memory. We offer chipsets     compatible with a variety of industry-accepted bus     specifications, such as the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP)     specification, the Peripheral Components Interconnect (PCI)     local bus specification, and the PCI Express* local bus     specification. PCI Express significantly increases the data     transfer rate of the original PCI specification, thereby     improving the graphics and input/output bandwidth and enabling     an improved multimedia experience. We believe that our customers     also want memory architecture alternatives, and as a result, we     offer chipsets supporting double data rate (DDR) and DDR2     (second-generation, faster DDR memory), dynamic random access     memory (DRAM), synchronous DRAM (SDRAM), and fully buffered dual     in-line memory module (FB-DIMM).         A motherboard is the principal board within a system. A     motherboard has connectors for attaching devices to the bus, and     typically contains the CPU, memory, and the chipset. We     currently offer motherboard products designed for our desktop,     server, and workstation platforms, thereby providing a more     complete range of solutions for our customers looking for     Intel®-based     solutions. We provide our OEM customers with the flexibility to     make purchases at the board or at the component level.     Flash memory is a specialized type of memory component     used to store user data and program code; it retains this     information even when the power is off, and provides faster     access to data than traditional hard drives. Flash memory has no     moving parts, unlike devices such as rapidly spinning hard     drives, allowing flash memory to be more tolerant of bumps and     shocks. A common measure of flash memory performance is the     density of the product. Density refers to the amount of     information the product is capable of storing. Flash memory is     based on either NOR or NAND architecture. NOR flash memory, with     its fast access or read capabilities, has     traditionally been used to store executable code. We offer NOR     flash memory products such as Intel     StrataFlash®     wireless memory for mobile phone designs. In addition to product     offerings for cellular customers, we offer NOR flash memory     products that meet the needs of other market segments, such as     the embedded market segment. The embedded market segment     includes set-top boxes, networking products, DVD players, DSL     and cable modems, and other devices. NAND flash memory is slower     in reading data but faster in writing data. We offer NAND flash     memory products that are designed primarily for memory cards,     digital audio players, and cellular phones. Our NAND flash     memory products are manufactured by IM Flash Technologies, LLC     (IMFT), a company we formed with Micron Technology, Inc. in     January 2006. For further discussion of our equity investment in     IMFT, see Note 17: Venture in Part II, Item 8 of     this Form     10-K.         We offer wired and wireless connectivity products based     on industry-standard technologies used to translate and transmit     data in packets across networks. We offer products for the     traditional local area network (LAN) environment, as well as for     the wireless LAN (WLAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), and     networked storage market segments. For the LAN and MAN market     segments, we offer products at multiple levels of integration to     provide a low-cost solution with increased speed and signal     transmission distance (commonly referred to as     reach). Gigabit Ethernet networks allow the     transmission of one billion individual bits of information per     second, and 10-Gigabit Ethernet networks transmit 10 billion     bits of information per second. By contrast, Fast Ethernet     networks transmit 100 million bits of information per second     (Mbps, or megabits per second). Our wireless connectivity     products are based on either the 802.11 or 802.16 industry     standard. The 802.11 communication standard refers to a family     of specifications commonly known as WiFi technology. These     specifications describe the bandwidth and frequency of the     over-the-air     interface between a wireless client and a base station, or     between two wireless clients. We also have developed and are     developing wireless connectivity products for both mobile and     fixed networks based on the 802.16 industry standard, commonly     known as WiMAX, which is short for Worldwide Interoperability     for Microwave Access. WiMAX is a standards-based wireless     technology providing high-speed,     last-mile     broadband connectivity that makes it possible to wirelessly     connect end users to networks, as well as networks to other     networks, up to several miles apart.     Communications infrastructure products include network     processors, communications boards, and optical transponders that     are basic building blocks for modular communications platforms.     These products include advanced, programmable processors used in     networking equipment to rapidly manage and direct data moving     across the Internet and corporate networks. Our modular     communications platforms are based on telecommunication industry     standards, such as Advanced Telecom Computing Architecture     (AdvancedTCA*) systems and carrier-grade servers, allowing for     communications and media services to be managed independently     from the network itself. Unlike proprietary systems platforms,     modular communications platforms are standards-based solutions     that offer network infrastructure builders flexible, low-cost,     low power consumption options for designing their networks. We     also offer embedded processors that can be used for modular     communications platform applications.        3    Table of Contents       Our network processor products offer low power consumption and     high-performance processing for a wide range of Internet devices.         We offer networked storage products that allow storage     resources to be added to either of the two most prevalent types     of networking technology: Ethernet or Fibre Channel.         We also have entered into agreements to manufacture and assemble     and test application and cellular baseband processors and other     products related to product lines that were divested in 2006.     These arrangements are expected to continue during a transition     period until the acquiring companies arrange for other     manufacturing resources. For further discussion of our     divestitures, see Note 14: Acquisitions and     Divestitures in Part II, Item 8 of this Form     10-K.         Our operating segments as of December 30, 2006 included the     Digital Enterprise Group, Mobility Group, Flash Memory Group,     Digital Home Group, Digital Health Group, and Channel Platforms     Group. Each operating segments major products and     platforms, including some key introductions, are discussed     below. For a discussion of our strategy, see     Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial     Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of     this Form     10-K.     Digital     Enterprise Group         The Digital Enterprise Group (DEG)s products are     incorporated into desktop computers, enterprise computing     servers, workstations, and the infrastructure for the Internet.     DEGs products include microprocessors and related chipsets     and motherboards designed for the desktop and enterprise     computing market segments; communications infrastructure     components such as network processors, communications boards,     and embedded processors; wired connectivity devices; and     products for network and server storage.         Net revenue for the DEG operating segment made up 56% of our     consolidated net revenue in 2006 (65% in 2005 and 72% in 2004).     Revenue from sales of microprocessors within the DEG operating     segment represented 41% of consolidated net revenue in 2006 (50%     in 2005 and 57% in 2004).

Manufacturing     and Assembly and Test         As of year-end 2006, 68% of our wafer manufacturing, including     microprocessor, chipset, NOR flash memory, and communications     silicon fabrication, was conducted within the U.S. at our     facilities in Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Massachusetts,     California, and     Colorado1.     Outside the U.S., 32% of our manufacturing was conducted at our     facilities in Ireland and Israel.         As of December 2006, we primarily manufactured our products in     the wafer fabrication facilities described below:                                       Wafer        Process              Products       Size       Technology       Locations      Microprocessors             300mm            65nm            Ireland, Arizona, Oregon           Microprocessors, chipsets, and     communications infrastructure             300mm            90nm            New Mexico, Ireland           NOR flash memory             200mm            65nm            California, Israel           NOR flash memory and     communications infrastructure             200mm            90nm            Israel, California           Chipsets, NOR flash memory, and     other products             200mm            130nm            New Mexico, Oregon,     Massachusetts,     Arizona, Ireland,     Colorado1       Chipsets and other products             200mm            180nm and above            Ireland, Israel                      1   Management placed for sale our Colorado fabrication facility.     For further discussion, see Note 11: Restructuring and     Asset Impairment Charges in Part II, Item 8 of this Form     10-K.          We expect to increase the capacity of certain facilities listed     above through additional investments in capital equipment. In     addition to our current facilities, we are building facilities     in Arizona and Israel that, in 2007 and 2008 respectively, are     expected to begin wafer fabrication for microprocessors on 300mm     wafers using 45-nanometer technology.         As of year-end 2006, the majority of our microprocessors were     manufactured on 300mm wafers using our 65-nanometer process     technology. In 2007, we expect to begin manufacturing     microprocessors on our 45-nanometer process technology, the next     generation of advanced high-volume production process technology     beyond our 65-nanometer process technology. As we move to each     succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology, we     incur significant     start-up     costs to prepare each factory for manufacturing. However,     continuing to advance our process technology provides benefits     that we believe justify these costs. These benefits can include     utilizing less space per transistor, which decreases the size of     the chip     and/or     enables us to increase the number of integrated features on each     chip; reducing heat output from each transistor; and improving     power efficiency. These advancements can result in higher     performing microprocessors, products that consume less power,     and/or     products that cost less to manufacture. To augment capacity in     the U.S. and internationally, we use third-party manufacturing     companies (foundries) to manufacture wafers for certain     components, including chipset, networking, and communications     products.         Our NAND flash memory products are manufactured by IMFT, a NAND     flash memory manufacturing company that we formed with Micron.     We currently purchase 49% of the manufactured output of IMFT.     See Note 17: Venture in Part II, Item 8 of this Form     10-K.         We primarily use subcontractors to manufacture board-level     products and systems, and purchase certain communications     networking products from external vendors, primarily in the     Asia-Pacific region. We also manufacture microprocessor- and     networking-related board-level products, primarily in Malaysia.        8    Table of Contents       Following the manufacturing process, the majority of our     components are subject to assembly and test. We perform a     substantial majority of our components assembly and test at     facilities in Malaysia, the Philippines, China, and Costa Rica.     We plan to continue investing in new assembly and test     technologies as well as increasing the capacity of our existing     facilities and building new facilities to keep pace with our     microprocessor, chipset, flash memory, and communications     technology improvements. In line with these plans, we plan to     build a new assembly and test facility in Vietnam, which is     expected to begin production in 2009. This facility will have     greater square footage than our current facilities, which will     enable us to take advantage of greater efficiencies of scale. To     augment capacity, we use subcontractors to perform assembly of     certain products, primarily flash memory, chipsets, and     networking and communications products. Assembly and test of     NAND flash memory products manufactured by IMFT is performed by     Micron and other external subcontractors.         Our performance expectations for business integrity; ethics; and     environmental, health, and safety compliance are the same,     regardless of whether our supplier and subcontractor operations     are based in the U.S. or elsewhere. Our employment practices are     consistent with, and we expect our suppliers and subcontractors     to abide by, local country law. In addition, we impose a minimum     employee age requirement regardless of local law.         We have thousands of suppliers, including subcontractors,     providing our various materials and service needs. We set     expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those     expectations with periodic assessments. We communicate those     expectations to our suppliers regularly and work with them to     implement improvements when necessary. We seek, where possible,     to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and     resources, but we may rely on a single or limited number of     suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single country. In those     cases, we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the     exposure that would result from a disruption in supply.         Our products typically are produced at multiple Intel facilities     at various sites around the world, or by subcontractors who have     multiple facilities. However, some products are produced in only     one Intel or subcontractor facility, and we seek to implement     actions and plans to reduce the exposure that would result from     a disruption at any such facility. On a worldwide basis, we     regularly evaluate our key infrastructure, systems, services,     and suppliers, both internally and externally, to seek to     identify significant vulnerabilities as well as areas of     potential business impact if a disruptive event were to occur.     Once vulnerability is identified, we assess the risks, and as we     consider it to be appropriate, we initiate actions intended to     reduce the risks and their potential impact. However, there can     be no assurance that we have identified all significant risks or     that we can mitigate all identified risks with reasonable     effort. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this     Form 10-K.         We maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of     property, casualty, and other risks. We place our insurance     coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions. The     policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result     in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance basis.     The types and amounts of insurance obtained vary from time to     time and from location to location, depending on availability,     cost, and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Our     worldwide risk and insurance programs are regularly evaluated to     seek to obtain the most favorable terms and conditions.     Research     and Development         We continue to be committed to investing in world-class     technology development, particularly in the area of the design     and manufacture of integrated circuits. Research and development     (R&D) expenditures in 2006 amounted to $5.9 billion ($5.1     billion in fiscal year 2005 and $4.8 billion in fiscal year     2004). The increase in R&D expenditures was primarily due to     share-based compensation effects of $487 million. See Note     3: Employee Equity Incentive Plans in Part II, Item 8 of     this Form     10-K.         Our R&D activities are directed toward developing     innovations that we believe will deliver the next generation of     products and platforms, which will in turn enable new form     factors and new usage models for businesses and consumers. We     are focusing our R&D efforts on advanced computing,     communications, and wireless technologies by developing new     microarchitectures, advancing our silicon manufacturing process     technology, delivering the next generation of microprocessors     and chipsets, improving our platform initiatives, and developing     software solutions and tools to support our technologies. In     line with these efforts, we plan to introduce a new     microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramp the     next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening     years. Our R&D efforts enable new levels of performance and     address areas such as scalability for multi-core architectures,     system manageability, energy efficiency, digital content     protection, and new communication capabilities. Our leadership     in silicon technology has enabled us to make Moores     Law a reality. Moores Law predicted that transistor     density on integrated circuits would double about every two     years. Our leadership in silicon technology helps to continue to     make Moores Law a reality while also bringing new     capabilities into silicon and producing new products and     platforms optimized for a wider variety of applications. We have     completed development of our 45-nanometer process technology,     and we expect to begin manufacturing products using our     45-nanometer process technology in the second half of 2007. In     the area of wireless communications, our initiatives focus on     delivering the technologies that will enable improved wireless     capabilities, including expanding and proliferating WiMAX     technologies and products.        9    Table of Contents         We do not expect that all of our research and product     development projects will result in products that are ultimately     released for sale. We may terminate research     and/or     product development before completion or decide not to     manufacture and sell a developed product for a variety of     reasons. For example, we may decide that a product might not be     sufficiently competitive in the relevant market segment, or for     technological or marketing reasons, we may decide to offer a     different product instead.         Our R&D model is based on a global organization that     emphasizes a collaborative approach in identifying and     developing new technologies, leading standards initiatives, and     influencing regulatory policy to accelerate the adoption of new     technologies. Our R&D initiatives are performed by various     business groups within the company, and we centrally manage key     cross-business group product initiatives to align and prioritize     our R&D activities across these groups. In addition, we may     augment our R&D initiatives by investing in companies that     are focused on the same areas as our research and development.     We also work with a worldwide network of academic and industry     researchers, scientists, and engineers in the computing and     communications fields. Our network of technology professionals     allows us, as well as others in our industry, to benefit from     development initiatives in a variety of areas, eventually     leading to innovative technologies for users. We believe that we     are well positioned in the technology industry to help drive     innovation, foster collaboration, and promote industry standards     that will yield innovative and improved technologies for users.         We have an agreement with Micron for joint development of NAND     flash memory technologies. Costs incurred by Intel and Micron     for process development are generally split evenly. As the owner     of the product designs, Intel assumes the cost for product     development and licenses certain product designs to Micron on a     royalty-bearing basis.         We perform a majority of our R&D in the U.S. We have been     increasing our product development outside the U.S. and have     activities at various locations, primarily within Israel,     Malaysia, India, China, and Russia. We also maintain R&D     facilities in the U.S. focused on developing and improving     manufacturing processes, as well as facilities in the U.S.,     Malaysia, and the Philippines dedicated to improvements in     assembly and test processes.     Employees         In September 2006, we announced a restructuring plan that     included expected headcount reductions, primarily through     workforce reductions, attrition, and targeted divestitures.     These actions have resulted in headcount reductions during 2006.     See Results of Operations within     Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial     Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of     this Form     10-K for     further details regarding our restructuring actions. As of     December 30, 2006, we had approximately 94,100 employees     worldwide, with more than 50% of these employees located in the     U.S. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 99,900     employees worldwide.     Sales and     Marketing         Most of our products are sold or licensed through sales offices     located near major concentrations of users, throughout the     Asia-Pacific, Americas, Europe, and Japan regions. Our business     relies on continued sales growth in both mature and emerging     markets.         Sales of our products are typically made via purchase orders     that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such     as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as     indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent     and copyright indemnities. From time to time, we may enter into     additional agreements with customers covering, for example,     changes from our standard terms and conditions, new product     development and marketing, private-label branding, and other     matters. Most of our sales are made using electronic and     web-based processes that allow the customer to review inventory     availability and track the progress of specific goods under     order. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes     ordered and other factors.         We sell our products to OEMs and ODMs. ODMs provide design     and/or     manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private-label     resellers. We also sell our products to industrial and retail     distributors. In certain instances, we have entered into supply     agreements to continue to manufacture and sell products within     divested business lines to acquiring companies during certain     transition periods. In 2006, Dell Inc. accounted for 19% of our     net revenue, and Hewlett-Packard Company accounted for 16% of     our net revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10%     of our net revenue. For information about revenue and operating     profit by operating segment, and revenue from unaffiliated     customers by geographic region/country, see Note 20:     Operating Segment and Geographic Information in Part II,     Item 8 of this Form     10-K and     Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial     Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of     this Form     10-K.        10    Table of Contents         Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products,     including those that compete with our products, and fill orders     for many customers. Most of our sales to distributors are made     under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold     merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of     unsold merchandise. We also utilize third-party sales     representatives who generally do not offer directly competitive     products but may carry complementary items manufactured by     others. Sales representatives do not maintain a product     inventory; instead, their customers place orders directly with     us or through distributors.         Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of     indirect customers who are systems builders and purchase Intel     microprocessors and other products from our distributors. We     have a boxed processor program that allows     distributors to sell Intel microprocessors in small quantities     to these systems-builder customers; boxed processors are also     made available in direct retail outlets.         Our corporate marketing focus is on multi-core microprocessors,     which include Intel Core 2 Duo, Intel Core 2 Extreme,     and Intel Core 2 Quad processors. These processors are at     the center of Intels most advanced platforms, which     include Intel Centrino mobile technology, Intel vPro technology,     and Intel Viiv technology. The Intel Core 2 Quad, Intel     Core 2 Extreme, Intel Core 2 Duo, Itanium, Intel Xeon,     Pentium, and Celeron trademarks make up our processor brands. We     promote brand awareness and generate demand through our own     direct marketing as well as co-marketing programs. Our direct     marketing activities include television, print and web-based     advertising, as well as press relations, consumer and trade     events, and industry and consumer communications. We market to     consumer and business audiences and focus on building awareness     and generating demand for increased performance, power     efficiency, and new capabilities.         Purchases by customers often allow them to participate in     cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the Intel     Inside®     program. Through the Intel Inside program, certain customers are     licensed to place Intel logos on computers containing our     microprocessors and our other technology, and to use our brands     in marketing activities. The program includes a market     development component that accrues funds based on purchases and     partially reimburses the OEMs for marketing activities for     products featuring Intel brands, subject to the OEMs meeting     defined criteria. This program broadens the reach of our brands     beyond the scope of our own direct advertising. In addition, it     provides us with the opportunity to do joint marketing with     certain customers.         Our products are typically shipped under terms that transfer     title to the customer, even in arrangements for which the     recognition of revenue on the sale is deferred. Our standard     terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is     due at a later date, generally 30 days after shipment, delivery,     or the customers use of the product. Our credit department     sets accounts receivable and shipping limits for individual     customers for the purpose of controlling credit risk to Intel     arising from outstanding account balances. We assess credit risk     through quantitative and qualitative analysis, and from this     analysis, we establish credit limits and determine whether we     will seek to use one or more credit support devices, such as     obtaining some form of third-party guaranty or standby letter of     credit, or obtaining credit insurance for all or a portion of     the account balance. Credit losses may still be incurred due to     bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay. See     Schedule IIValuation and Qualifying Accounts     in Part IV of this Form     10-K for     information about our allowance for doubtful receivables.     Backlog         We do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is     meaningful, as our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard     purchase orders for delivery of products. Only a small portion     of our orders are non-cancelable, and the dollar amount     associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant.     Competition         Our products compete primarily on the basis of performance,     features, quality, brand recognition, price, and availability.     Our ability to compete depends on our ability to provide     innovative products and worldwide support for our customers at     competitive prices, including providing improved     energy-efficient performance, enhanced security, reduced heat     output, manageability, and integrated solutions. In addition to     our various computing, networking, and communications products,     we offer platforms that incorporate various components, which     bring together a collection of technologies that we believe     create a better end-user solution than if the ingredients were     used separately.        11    Table of Contents         The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid advances in     technology and new product introductions. As unit volumes of a     particular product grow, production experience is accumulated     and costs typically decrease, further competition develops, and     as a result, prices decline. The life cycle of our products is     very short, sometimes less than a year. Our ability to compete     depends on our ability to improve our products and processes     faster than our competitors, anticipate changing customer     requirements, and develop and launch new products and platforms,     while reducing our average per unit costs. When we believe it is     appropriate, we will take various steps, including introducing     new products and platforms, discontinuing older products,     reducing prices, and offering rebates and other incentives, to     increase acceptance of our latest products and to be competitive     within each relevant market segment. Our products compete with     products developed for similar or rival architectures and with     products based on the same or rival standards. We cannot predict     which competing standards will become the prevailing standards     in the market segments in which we compete. See Risk     Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form     10-K.         Many companies compete with us in the various computing,     networking, and communications market segments, and are engaged     in the same basic business activities, including research and     development. Worldwide, these competitors range in size from     large established multinational companies with multiple product     lines to smaller companies and new entrants to the marketplace     that compete in specialized market segments. Some of our     competitors may have development agreements with other     companies, and in some cases our competitors may also be our     customers     and/or     suppliers. Product offerings may cross over into multiple     product categories, offering us new opportunities but also     resulting in more competition. It may be difficult for us to     compete in market segments where our competitors have     established products and brand recognition.         We believe that our network of manufacturing facilities and     assembly and test facilities gives us a competitive advantage.     This network enables us to have more direct control over our     processes, quality control, product cost, volume, timing of     production, and other factors. These facilities require     significant up-front capital spending, and many of our     competitors do not own such facilities because they cannot     afford to do so or because their business models involve the use     of third-party facilities for manufacturing and assembly and     test. These fabless semiconductor companies include     Broadcom Corporation, NVIDIA Corporation, QUALCOMM Incorporated,     and VIA Technologies, Inc. (VIA). Some of our competitors own     portions of such facilities through investment or joint-venture     arrangements with other companies. There is a group of     third-party manufacturing companies (foundries) and assembly and     test subcontractors that offers their services to companies     without owned facilities or companies needing additional     capacity. These foundries and subcontractors may also offer     intellectual property, design services, and other goods and     services to our competitors. Competitors who outsource their     manufacturing and assembly and test operations can significantly     reduce their capital expenditures.         We plan to continue to cultivate new businesses and work with     the computing and communications industries through standards     bodies, trade associations, OEMs, ODMs, and independent software     and operating system vendors to help align the industry to offer     products that take advantage of the latest market trends and     usage models. These efforts include helping to build out the     infrastructure for wireless network connectivity. We are also     working with these industries to develop software applications     and operating systems that take advantage of our platforms     through programs such as the     Intel®     Software Partner Program, which provides opportunities that help     companies develop, market, and sell solutions that take     advantage of the latest Intel platforms and technologies. We     frequently participate in industry initiatives designed to     discuss and agree upon technical specifications and other     aspects of technologies that could be adopted as standards by     standards-setting organizations. In addition, we work     collaboratively with other companies to protect digital content     and the consumer by developing content protection specifications     such as the Digital Transmission Content Protection (DTCP)     specification. DTCP defines a secure protocol for protecting     audio and video entertainment content from illegal copying,     intercepting, and tampering as it moves across digital     interfaces such as Universal Serial Bus (USB) and     IP-based     home networks. Our competitors may also participate in the same     initiatives and specification development. Our participation     does not ensure that any standards or specifications adopted by     these organizations will be consistent with our product     planning. We continuously evaluate our product offerings and the     timing of their introductions, taking into account factors such     as customer requirements and availability of infrastructure to     take advantage of product features, performance, and maturity of     application software for each type of product in the relevant     market segments.         Companies in the semiconductor industry often rely on the     ability to license patents from each other in order to compete     in todays markets. Many of our competitors have broad     cross-licenses or licenses with us, and under current case law,     some such licenses may permit these competitors to pass our     patent rights on to others. If one of these licensees becomes a     foundry, our competitors might be able to avoid our patent     rights in manufacturing competing products. In addition to     licensing our patents to competitors, we participate in some     industry organizations that are engaged in the development of     standards or specifications and may require us to license our     patents to other companies that adopt such industry standards or     specifications, even when such organizations do not adopt the     standards or specifications proposed by Intel. Any Intel patents     that may be subject to the licensing policies of such     organizations due to our participation in such initiatives might     not, in some situations, be available for us to enforce against     others who might be infringing those patents. See Risk     Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form     10-K.        12    Table of Contents         We continue to be largely dependent on the success of our     microprocessor business. Our ability to compete depends on our     ability to deliver new microprocessor products with improved     overall performance     and/or     improved energy-efficient performance at competitive prices.     Many of our competitors, including Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.     (AMD), our primary microprocessor competitor, market     software-compatible products that compete with our processors.     We also face competition from companies offering rival     microarchitecture designs, such as Cell Broadband Engine     Architecture developed jointly by International Business     Machines Corporation (IBM), Sony Corporation, and Toshiba     Corporation. Our desktop processors compete with products     offered by AMD, IBM, and VIA, among others. Our mobile     microprocessor products compete with products offered by AMD,     IBM, Transmeta Corporation, and VIA, among others. Our server     processors compete with software-compatible products offered by     AMD and with products based on rival architectures, including     the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) offered by IBM and the     Scalable Processor Architecture (SPARC*) offered by Sun     Microsystems, Inc.         Our chipsets compete in the various market segments against     different types of chipsets that support either our     microprocessor products or rival microprocessor products.     Competing chipsets are produced by companies such as ATI     Technologies, Inc. (recently acquired by AMD), NVIDIA, Silicon     Integrated Systems Corporation (SIS), and VIA. We also compete     with companies offering graphics components and other     special-purpose products used in the desktop, mobile, and server     market segments. One aspect of our business model is to     incorporate improved performance and advanced properties into     our microprocessors and chipsets, the demand for which may     increasingly be affected by competition from companies, such as     NVIDIA, whose business models are based on incorporating     improved performance into dedicated chipsets and other     components, such as graphics controllers.         Our NOR and NAND flash memory products currently compete with     the products of other companies, such as Hynix Semiconductor     Inc., Micron, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Spansion Inc.,     STMicroelectronics NV, and Toshiba.         We offer products designed for wired and wireless connectivity;     for the communications infrastructure, including network     processors; and for networked storage. These products currently     compete against offerings from companies such as Applied Micro     Circuits Corporation, AMD, Broadcom, Freescale Semiconductor,     Inc., IBM, OpNext, Inc., Sun Microsystems, and VIA.         We also offer platforms for the desktop, mobile, and server     market segments that integrate components that enable targeted     usage models. We believe that our platform offerings give us a     competitive advantage. Our platforms are designed to meet the     specific needs of end users and are optimized to deliver     increased security and manageability, energy-efficient     performance, and other innovative solutions embedded into our     microprocessors. With AMDs acquisition of ATI     Technologies, we anticipate increased platform competition in     various market segments.     Acquisitions     and Strategic Investments         During 2006, the company did not complete any acquisitions     qualifying as business combinations. In 2006, Intel formed IMFT,     a NAND flash memory manufacturing company, with Micron. Intel     invested $1.3 billion in return for a 49% interest. See     Note 17: Venture in Part II, Item 8 of this Form     10-K. Also     during 2006, Intel paid $600 million for an investment in     Clearwire Corporation. Clearwire builds and operates     next-generation wireless broadband networks. See Note 7:     Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form     10-K.     Intellectual     Property and Licensing         Intellectual property rights that apply to our various products     and services include patents, copyrights, trade secrets,     trademarks, and maskwork rights. We maintain an active program     to protect our investment in technology by attempting to ensure     respect for our intellectual property rights. The extent of the     legal protection given to different types of intellectual     property rights varies under different countries legal     systems. We intend to license our intellectual property rights     where we can obtain adequate consideration. See     Competition in Part I, Item 1 of this Form     10-K;     Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 of this     Form 10-K;     and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of     this Form     10-K.        13    Table of Contents       We have filed and obtained a number of patents in the U.S. and     abroad. While our patents are an important element of our     success, our business as a whole is not materially dependent on     any one patent. We and other companies in the computing,     telecommunications, and related high-technology fields typically     apply for and receive, in the aggregate, tens of thousands of     overlapping patents annually in the U.S. and other countries. We     believe that the duration of the applicable patents we are     granted is adequate relative to the expected lives of our     products. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product     development, our products are often obsolete before the patents     related to them expire, and sometimes are obsolete before the     patents related to them are even granted. As we expand our     product offerings into new industries, such as consumer     electronics, we also seek to extend our patent development     efforts to patent such product offerings. Established     competitors in existing and new industries, as well as companies     that purchase and enforce patents and other intellectual     property, may already have patents covering similar products.     There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents     covering our own products, or that we will be able to obtain     licenses from such companies on favorable terms or at all.         The large majority of the software we distribute, including     software embedded in our component and system-level products, is     entitled to copyright protection.         To distinguish Intel products from our competitors     products, we have obtained certain trademarks and trade names     for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising     programs with certain customers to promote our brands and to     identify products containing genuine Intel components.         We also protect certain details about our processes, products,     and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the     information that we believe provides us with a competitive     advantage. We have ongoing programs designed to maintain the     confidentiality of such information.     Compliance     with Environmental, Health, and Safety Regulations         Intel is committed to achieving high standards of environmental     quality and product safety, and strives to provide a safe and     healthy workplace for our employees, contractors, and the     communities in which we do business. We have environmental,     health, and safety (EHS) policies and expectations that apply to     our global operations. Each of Intels worldwide production     facilities is registered to the International Organization for     Standardization (ISO) 14001 environmental management system     standard. Intels internal EHS auditing program addresses     not only compliance but also business risk and management     systems. We focus on minimizing and properly managing hazardous     materials used in our facilities and products. We monitor     regulatory and resource trends and set company-wide short- and     long-term performance targets for key resources and emissions.     These targets address several parameters, including energy and     water use, climate change, waste recycling, and emissions. For     example, we continue to take action to achieve our global energy     reduction goal by investing in energy conservation projects in     our factories and working with suppliers of manufacturing tools     to improve energy efficiency. Intel also is focused on     developing innovative solutions to improve the energy efficiency     of our products and those of our customers. Intel has taken a     holistic approach to power management, addressing the challenge     at all levels, including the silicon, package, circuit,     micro/macro architecture, platform, and software levels.         The production of Intel products requires the use of hazardous     materials that are subject to a broad array of EHS laws and     regulations. Intel actively monitors the materials used in the     production of our products. Intel has specific restrictions on     the content of certain hazardous materials in our products, as     well as those of our suppliers and outsourced manufacturers and     subcontractors. Intel continues to make efforts to reduce     hazardous materials in our products to position us to meet     various environmental restrictions on product content throughout     the world. As Intel continues to advance process technology, the     materials, technologies, and products themselves become     increasingly complex. Our evaluations of materials for use in     R&D and production take into account EHS considerations.     Compliance with these complex laws and regulations, as well as     internal voluntary programs, is integrated into Intels     design for EHS programs.         Intel is committed to the protection of human rights and the     environment throughout its supply chain. Intel expects suppliers     to understand and fully comply with all EHS and related laws and     regulations. In addition, suppliers are expected to abide by     Intels policies, such as its Corporate Business Principles     and the Electronics Industry Code of Conduct; maintain     progressive employment practices; and comply with other     applicable laws including, at a minimum, those covering     non-discrimination in the terms and conditions of employment,     child labor, minimum wages, employee benefits, and work hours.        14    Table of Contents   Executive     Officers of the Registrant         The following sets forth certain information with regard to the     executive officers of Intel as of February 23, 2007 (ages are as     of December 30, 2006):         Craig R.

RISK FACTORS     Fluctuations     in demand for our products may adversely affect our financial     results and are difficult to forecast.       If demand for our products fluctuates, our revenue and gross     margin could be adversely affected. Important factors that could     cause demand for our products to fluctuate include:                       competitive pressures from companies that have competing     products, chip architectures, and manufacturing technologies     including product offerings, marketing programs, and pricing     pressures;                  changes in customer product needs;                  changes in the level of customers component inventory;                  changes in business and economic conditions, including a     downturn in the semiconductor industry;                  strategic actions taken by our competitors; and/or                  market acceptance of our products.           If demand for our products is reduced, our manufacturing     and/or     assembly and test capacity could be under-utilized, and we may     be required to record an impairment on our long-lived assets     including facilities and equipment, as well as intangible     assets, which would increase our expenses. In addition, factory     planning decisions may shorten the useful lives of long-lived     assets including facilities and equipment and cause us to     accelerate depreciation. In the long term, if demand for our     products increases, we may not be able to add manufacturing     and/or     assembly and test capacity fast enough to meet market demand.     These changes in demand for our products, and changes in our     customers product needs, could have a variety of negative     effects on our competitive position and our financial results,     and, in certain cases, may reduce our revenue, increase our     costs, lower our gross margin percentage, or require us to     recognize impairments of our assets. In addition, if demand for     our products is reduced or we fail to accurately forecast     demand, we could be required to write down inventory, which     would have a negative impact on our gross margin.     The     semiconductor industry and our operations are characterized by a     high percentage of costs that are fixed or otherwise difficult     to reduce in the short term, and by product demand that is     highly variable and subject to significant downturns that may     adversely affect our business, results of operations, and     financial condition.       The semiconductor industry and our operations are characterized     by high costs, such as those related to facility construction     and equipment, research and development, and employment and     training of a highly skilled workforce, that are either fixed or     difficult to reduce in the short term. At the same time, demand     for our products is highly variable and there have been     downturns, often in connection with maturing product cycles as     well as downturns in general economic market conditions. These     downturns have been characterized by reduced product demand,     manufacturing overcapacity, high inventory levels, and lower     average selling prices. The combination of these factors may     cause our revenue, gross margin, cash flow, and profitability to     vary significantly in both the short and long term.     We     operate in intensely competitive industries, and our failure to     respond quickly to technological developments and incorporate     new features into our products could have an adverse effect on     our ability to compete.       We operate in intensely competitive industries that experience     rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards,     changes in customer requirements, and frequent new product     introductions and improvements. If we are unable to respond     quickly and successfully to these developments, we may lose our     competitive position, and our products or technologies may     become uncompetitive or obsolete. To compete successfully, we     must maintain a successful R&D effort, develop new products     and production processes, and improve our existing products and     processes at the same pace or ahead of our competitors. We may     not be able to successfully develop and market these new     products, the products we invest in and develop may not be well     received by customers, and products developed and new     technologies offered by others may affect the demand for our     products. These types of events could have a variety of negative     effects on our competitive position and our financial results,     such as reducing our revenue, increasing our costs, lowering our     gross margin percentage, and requiring us to recognize     impairments of our assets.     Fluctuations     in the mix of products sold may adversely affect our financial     results.       Because of the wide price differences among mobile, desktop, and     server microprocessors, the mix and types of performance     capabilities of microprocessors sold affect the average selling     price of our products and have a substantial impact on our     revenue. Our financial results also depend in part on the mix of     other products we sell, such as chipsets, flash memory, and     other semiconductor products. In addition, more recently     introduced products tend to have higher associated costs because     of initial overall development costs and higher     start-up     costs. Fluctuations in the mix and types of our products may     also affect the extent to which we are able to recover our fixed     costs and investments that are associated with a particular     product, and as a result can negatively impact our financial     results.        16    Table of Contents     Our     global operations subject us to risks that may negatively affect     our results of operations and financial condition.       We have sales offices, research and development, manufacturing,     and assembly and test facilities in many countries, and as a     result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business     globally. Our global operations may be subject to risks that may     limit our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design,     develop, or sell products in particular countries, which could     in turn have an adverse effect on our results of operations and     financial condition, including:                       security concerns, such as armed conflict and civil or military     unrest, crime, political instability, and terrorist activity;                  health concerns;                  natural disasters;                  inefficient and limited infrastructure and disruptions, such as     large-scale outages or interruptions of service from utilities     or telecommunications providers and supply chain interruptions;                  differing employment practices and labor issues;                  local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal     standards and practices;                  regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between     jurisdictions; and/or                  restrictions on our operations by governments seeking to support     local industries, nationalization of our operations, and     restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings.           In addition, although most of our products are priced and paid     for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of     expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing     expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs     reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of     currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in     exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls,     could negatively impact our business operating results and     financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased     expenses. In addition, changes in tariff and import regulations     and to U.S. and     non-U.S.     monetary policies may also negatively impact our revenue in     those affected countries. Varying tax rates in different     jurisdictions could negatively impact our overall tax rate.     Failure     to meet our production targets, resulting in undersupply or     oversupply of products, may adversely impact our business and     results of operations.       Production of integrated circuits is a complex process.     Disruptions in this process can result from difficulties in our     development and implementation of new processes, errors, and     interruptions in the processes; defects in materials; and     disruptions in our supply of materials or resourcesall of     which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields.     Furthermore, we may not be successful or efficient in developing     or implementing new production processes. The occurrence of any     of the foregoing may result in our failure to increase     production as desired, resulting in higher costs or substantial     decreases in yields, which could impact our ability to produce     sufficient volume to meet specific product demand. Furthermore,     the unavailability or reduced availability of certain products     could make it more difficult to implement our platform strategy.     We may also experience increases in yields. A substantial     increase in yields could result in higher inventory levels and     the possibility of resulting excess capacity charges as we slow     production to reduce inventory levels. The occurrence of any of     these events could adversely impact our business and results of     operations.     We may     have difficulties obtaining the resources or products we need     for manufacturing or assembling our products or operating other     aspects of our business, which could adversely affect our     ability to meet demand for our products and may increase our     costs.       We have thousands of suppliers providing various materials that     we use in production of our products and other aspects of our     business, and we seek, where possible, to have several sources     of supply for all of these materials. However, we may rely on a     single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a     single country, for these materials. The inability of such     suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials     or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or     could make it more difficult for us to implement our platform     strategy. In addition, production could be disrupted by the     unavailability of the resources used in production, such as     water, silicon, electricity, and gases. The unavailability or     reduced availability of the materials or resources we use in our     business may require us to reduce production of products or may     require us to incur additional costs in order to obtain an     adequate supply of these materials or resources. The occurrence     of any of these events could adversely impact our business and     results of operations.     Costs     related to product defects and errata may have an adverse impact     on our results of operations and business.       Costs associated with unexpected product defects and errata     (deviations from published specifications) include, for example,     the costs of:                       writing down the value of inventory of defective products;                  disposing of defective products that cannot be fixed;                  recalling defective products that have been shipped to customers;                  providing product replacements for or modifications to defective     products; and/or                  defending against litigation related to defective products.           These costs could be substantial and may therefore increase our     expenses and adversely affect our gross margin. In addition, our     reputation with our customers or end users of our products could     be damaged as a result of such product defects and errata, and     the demand for our products could be reduced. These factors     could negatively impact our financial results and the prospects     for our business.        17    Table of Contents   We may     be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual     property rights, which could adversely affect our     business.       From time to time, third parties may assert against us or our     customers alleged patent, copyright, trademark, and other     intellectual property rights to technologies that are important     to our business. We may be subject to intellectual property     infringement claims from certain individuals and companies who     have acquired patent portfolios for the sole purpose of     asserting such claims against other companies. Any claims that     our products or processes infringe the intellectual property     rights of others, regardless of the merit or resolution of such     claims, could cause us to incur significant costs in responding     to, defending, and resolving such claims, and may divert the     efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel     away from our business. As a result of such intellectual     property infringement claims, we could be required or otherwise     decide it is appropriate to:                       pay third-party infringement claims;                  discontinue manufacturing, using, or selling particular products     subject to infringement claims;                  discontinue using the technology or processes subject to     infringement claims;                  develop other technology not subject to infringement claims,     which could be time-consuming and costly or may not be possible;     and/or                  license technology from the third party claiming infringement,     which license may not be available on commercially reasonable     terms.           The occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in     unexpected expenses or require us to recognize an impairment of     our assets, which would reduce the value of our assets and     increase expenses. In addition, if we alter or discontinue our     production of affected items, our revenue could be negatively     impacted.     We may     be subject to litigation proceedings that could adversely affect     our business.       In addition to the litigation risks mentioned above, we may be     subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving     stockholder, consumer, antitrust, and other issues. As described     in Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 of this Form     10-K, we are     currently engaged in a number of litigation matters. Litigation     is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings     could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary     damages or, in cases for which injunctive relief is sought, an     injunction prohibiting Intel from manufacturing or selling one     or more products. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there     exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on business     and results of operations for the period in which the ruling     occurred or future periods.     We may     not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property     rights, which may harm our ability to compete and adversely     affect our business.       Our ability to enforce our patents, copyrights, software     licenses, and other intellectual property is subject to general     litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the     enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various     countries. When we seek to enforce our rights, we are often     subject to claims that the intellectual property right is     invalid, is otherwise not enforceable, or is licensed to the     party against whom we are asserting a claim. In addition, our     assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the     other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property     rights of its own against us, which may adversely impact our     business in the manner discussed above. If we are not ultimately     successful in defending ourselves against these claims in     litigation, we may not be able to sell a particular product or     family of products, due to an injunction, or we may have to pay     material amounts of damages, which could in turn negatively     affect our results of operations. In addition, governments may     adopt regulations or courts may render decisions requiring     compulsory licensing of intellectual property to others, or     governments may require that products meet specified standards     that serve to favor local companies. Our inability to enforce     our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may     negatively impact our competitive position and our business.     Our     licenses with other companies and our participation in industry     initiatives may allow other companies, including competitors, to     use our patent rights.       Companies in the semiconductor industry often rely on the     ability to license patents from each other in order to compete.     Many of our competitors have broad licenses or cross-licenses     with us, and under current case law, some of these licenses may     permit these competitors to pass our patent rights on to others.     If one of these licensees becomes a foundry, our competitors     might be able to avoid our patent rights in manufacturing     competing products. In addition, our participation in industry     initiatives may require us to license our patents to other     companies that adopt certain industry standards or     specifications, even when such organizations do not adopt     standards or specifications proposed by us. As a result, our     patents implicated by our participation in industry initiatives     might not be available for us to enforce against others who     might otherwise be deemed to be infringing those patents, our     costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may     increase, and the value of our intellectual property may be     impaired.        18    Table of Contents     Changes     in our decisions with regard to our announced restructuring and     efficiency project, and other factors, could affect our results     of operations and financial condition.       Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially     from our expectations with regard to our announced restructuring     include:                       timing and execution of plans and programs that may be subject     to local labor law requirements, including consultation with     appropriate works councils;                  assumptions related to severance and post-retirement costs;                  future acquisitions, dispositions, or investments;                  new business initiatives and changes in product roadmap,     development, and manufacturing;                  changes in employment levels and turnover rates;                  assumptions related to product demand and the business     environment; and/or                  assumptions related to the fair value of certain property, plant     and equipment.       In     order to compete, we must attract, retain, and motivate key     employees, and our failure to do so could have an adverse effect     on our results of operations.       In order to compete, we must attract, retain, and motivate     executives and other key employees, including those in     managerial, technical, sales, marketing, and support positions.     Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists,     engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are     critical to our business, and competition for experienced     employees in the semiconductor industry can be intense. To help     attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use     share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and     non-vested share units (restricted stock units). If the value of     such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the     performance of the price of our common stock     and/or if     our other share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed     as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain, and     motivate employees could be adversely impacted, which could     negatively affect our results of operations.     Our     results of operations could vary as a result of the methods,     estimates, and judgments we use in applying our accounting     policies.       The methods, estimates, and judgments we use in applying our     accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of     operations (see Critical Accounting Estimates in     Part II, Item 7 of this Form     10-K). Such     methods, estimates, and judgments are, by their nature, subject     to substantial risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and     factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods,     estimates, and judgments. Changes in those methods, estimates,     and judgments could significantly affect our results of     operations. In particular, the calculation of share-based     compensation expense under Statement of Financial Accounting     Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based     Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)), requires us to use valuation     methodologies (which were not developed for use in valuing     employee stock options and restricted stock units) and a number     of assumptions, estimates, and conclusions regarding matters     such as expected forfeitures, expected volatility of our share     price, the expected dividend rate with respect to our common     stock, and the exercise behavior of our employees. Furthermore,     there are no means, under applicable accounting principles, to     compare and adjust our expense if and when we learn about     additional information that may affect the estimates that we     previously made, with the exception of changes in expected     forfeitures of share-based awards. Factors may arise over time     that lead us to change our estimates and assumptions with     respect to future share-based compensation arrangements,     resulting in variability in our share-based compensation expense     over time. Changes in forecasted share-based compensation     expense could impact our gross margin percentage; research and     development expenses; marketing, general and administrative     expenses; and our tax rate.     Our     failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and     regulations worldwide could adversely impact our business and     results of operations.       The manufacture and assembly and testing of our products require     the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array     of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Our     failure to comply with any of these applicable laws or     regulations could result in:                       regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities;                  suspension of production;                  alteration of our fabrication and assembly and test processes;     and/or                  curtailment of our operations or sales.           In addition, our failure to properly manage the use,     transportation, emission, discharge, storage, recycling, or     disposal of hazardous materials could subject us to increased     costs or future liabilities. Existing and future environmental     laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution     abatement or remediation equipment, modify our product designs,     or incur other expenses associated with such laws and     regulations. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use     in our operations may be subject to regulation under existing or     future environmental laws and regulations that may restrict our     use of certain materials in our manufacturing, assembly and test     processes, or products. Any of these consequences could     adversely impact our business and results of operations by     increasing our expenses     and/or     requiring us to alter our manufacturing and assembly and test     processes.        19    Table of Contents   Changes     in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our     results of operations. Our     future effective tax rates may be adversely affected by a number     of factors including:                            the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned     and taxed;                  the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various     tax authorities;                  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and     liabilities;                  adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax     returns;                  increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including     write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and     impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;                  changes in available tax credits;                  changes in share-based compensation expense;                  changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and     changes in generally accepted accounting principles; and/or                  the repatriation of     non-U.S.     earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S.     taxes.           Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could     adversely impact net income for future periods. In addition, the     U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities     regularly examine our income tax returns. The IRS has proposed     adjustments or issued formal assessments related to amounts     reflected on certain of our tax returns as a tax benefit for our     export sales. See Note 19: Contingencies in Part II,     Item 8 of this Form     10-K. Our     results of operations could be adversely impacted if these     assessments or any other assessments resulting from the     examination of our income tax returns by the IRS or other taxing     authorities are not resolved in our favor.     We     invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a     return on our investments.       We make investments in companies around the world to further our     strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives.     Such investments include investments in equity securities of     public companies and investments in non-marketable equity     securities of private companies, which range from early-stage     companies that are often still defining their strategic     direction to more mature companies whose products or     technologies may directly support an Intel product or     initiative. The success of these companies is dependent on     product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency,     and other key business success factors. The private companies in     which we invest may fail because they may not be able to secure     additional funding, obtain favorable investment terms for future     financings, or take advantage of liquidity events such as     initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. If any of     these private companies fail, we could lose all or part of our     investment in that company. If we determine that an     other-than-temporary     decline in the fair value exists for the equity securities of     the public and private companies in which we invest, we write     down the investment to its fair value and recognize the related     write-down as an investment loss. Furthermore, when the     strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved, or if     the investment or business diverges from our strategic     objectives, we may decide to dispose of the investment. Our     investments in non-marketable equity securities of private     companies are not liquid, and we may not be able to dispose of     these investments on favorable terms or at all. The occurrence     of any of these events could negatively affect our results of     operations.      ITEM     1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS          Not applicable.      ITEM     2. PROPERTIES          At December 30, 2006, our major facilities consisted of:                                          (Square Feet in Millions)        United States       Other Countries       Total      Owned     facilities1                 27.9               13.2               41.1      Leased     facilities2                 2.2               3.4               5.6                                                Total facilities            30.1           16.6           46.7                                                            1   Leases on portions of the land used for these facilities     expire at varying dates through 2062.      2   These leases expire at varying dates through 2021 and     generally include renewals at our option.         20    Table of Contents       Our principal executive offices are located in the U.S. The     majority of our wafer fabrication and research and development     activities are also located within the U.S. Outside the U.S., we     have wafer fabrication at our facilities in Ireland and Israel.     The majority of our assembly and test facilities are located     overseas, specifically in Malaysia, the Philippines, China, and     Costa Rica. In addition, we have sales and marketing offices     located worldwide. These facilities are generally located near     major concentrations of users. We also plan to build a new     assembly and test facility in Vietnam, which is expected to     begin production in 2009. This facility will have more square     footage than our current assembly and test facilities, which     will enable us to take advantage of greater efficiencies of     scale.         With the exception of our fabrication facility in Colorado,     which we have placed for sale (see Note 11:     Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges in Part II,     Item 8 of this Form     10-K), we     believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate     for our present purposes and that the productive capacity in     such facilities is substantially being utilized or we have plans     to utilize it.         We do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment. For     information on net property, plant and equipment by country, see     Note 20: Operating Segment and Geographic     Information in Part II, Item 8 of this Form     10-K.      ITEM     3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS            A.    Tax     Matters           In connection with the regular examination of Intels tax     returns for the years 1999 through 2005, the IRS formally     assessed, in 2005 and 2006, certain adjustments to the amounts     reflected by Intel on those returns as a tax benefit for its     export sales. The company does not agree with these adjustments     and has appealed the assessments. If the IRS prevails in its     position, Intels federal income tax due for 1999 through     2005 would increase by approximately $2.2 billion, plus     interest. In addition, the IRS will likely make a similar claim     for 2006, and if the IRS prevails, income tax due for 2006 would     increase by approximately $200 million, plus interest.         Although the final resolution of the adjustments is uncertain,     based on currently available information, management believes     that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse     effect on the companys financial position, cash flows, or     overall trends in results of operations. There is the     possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of     operations for the period in which the matter is ultimately     resolved, if it is resolved unfavorably, or in the period in     which an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably     estimable.           B.    Litigation           Intel currently is a party to various legal proceedings,     including those noted below. While management presently believes     that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and     in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our     financial position, cash flows, or overall trends in results of     operations, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and     unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could     include monetary damages or, in cases for which injunctive     relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting Intel from selling     one or more products. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there     exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the     business or results of operations for the period in which the     ruling occurs or future periods.     Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and AMD International     Sales & Service, Ltd. v. Intel Corporation   and Intel Kabushiki Kaisha, and Related Consumer Class     Actions and Government Investigations         In June 2005, AMD filed a complaint in the United States     District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that Intel     and Intels Japanese subsidiary engaged in various actions     in violation of the Sherman Act and the California Business and     Professions Code, including providing secret and discriminatory     discounts and rebates and intentionally interfering with     prospective business advantages of AMD. AMDs complaint     seeks unspecified treble damages, punitive damages, an     injunction, and attorneys fees and costs. Subsequently,     AMDs Japanese subsidiary also filed suits in the Tokyo     High Court and the Tokyo District Court against Intels     Japanese subsidiary, asserting violations of Japans     Antimonopoly Law and alleging damages of approximately $55     million, plus various other costs and fees. At least 78 separate     class actions, generally repeating AMDs allegations and     asserting various consumer injuries, including that consumers in     various states have been injured by paying higher prices for     Intel microprocessors, have been filed in the U.S. District     Courts for the Northern District of California, Southern     District of California, and the District of Delaware, as well as     in various California, Kansas, and Tennessee state courts. All     the federal class actions have been consolidated by the     Multidistrict Litigation Panel to the District of Delaware. All     California class actions have been consolidated to the Superior     Court of California in Santa Clara County. Intel disputes     AMDs claims and the     class-action     claims, and intends to defend the lawsuits vigorously.        21    Table of Contents         Intel is also subject to certain antitrust regulatory inquiries.     In 2001, the European Commission commenced an investigation     regarding claims by AMD that Intel used unfair business     practices to persuade clients to buy Intel microprocessors. In     June 2005, Intel received an inquiry from the Korea Fair Trade     Commission requesting documents from Intels Korean     subsidiary related to marketing and rebate programs that Intel     entered into with Korean PC manufacturers. Intel is cooperating     with these agencies in their investigations and expects that     these matters will be acceptably resolved.     Barbaras Sales, et al. v. Intel Corporation, Gateway     Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company and HPDirect, Inc.   Third Judicial Circuit Court, Madison County, Illinois         In June 2002, various plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the Third     Judicial Circuit Court, Madison County, Illinois, against Intel,     Gateway Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, and HPDirect, Inc.     alleging that the defendants advertisements and statements     misled the public by suppressing and concealing the alleged     material fact that systems containing Intel Pentium 4     processors are less powerful and slower than systems containing     Intel®     Pentium® III     processors and a competitors microprocessors. In July     2004, the court certified against Intel an Illinois-only class     of certain end-use purchasers of certain Pentium 4     processors or computers containing such microprocessors. In     January 2005, the Circuit Court granted a motion filed jointly     by the plaintiffs and Intel that stayed the proceedings in the     trial court pending discretionary appellate review of the     Circuit Courts class certification order. In July 2006,     the Illinois Appellate Court, Fifth District, vacated the     Circuit Courts class certification order, and remanded the     case to the Circuit Court with instructions to reconsider its     class certification ruling. In August 2006, the Illinois Supreme     Court agreed to review the Appellate Courts decision, and     that review is pending. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages,     and attorneys fees and costs. The company disputes the     plaintiffs claims and intends to defend the lawsuit     vigorously.     AmberWave Systems Corporation v. Intel Corporation   United States District Court for the District of Delaware         Beginning in May 2005, Intel and AmberWave Systems Corporation     filed a series of lawsuits against each other that were     consolidated into actions in the United States District Court     for the District of Delaware. AmberWave claimed that certain     Intel semiconductor manufacturing processes infringed six     AmberWave patents related to semiconductor fabrication.     AmberWave sought damages, treble damages for alleged willful     infringement, an injunction, and attorneys fees. Intel     disputed AmberWaves allegations and defended the lawsuits     vigorously. In 2007, Intel and AmberWave entered into a license     agreement under which, among other terms, Intel agreed to make     certain payments to AmberWave, and AmberWave agreed to license     AmberWaves patent portfolio to Intel. The parties agreed     to jointly dismiss the actions with prejudice.     Transmeta Corporation v. Intel Corporation   United States District Court for the District of Delaware         In October 2006, Transmeta Corporation filed a lawsuit in the     United States District Court for the District of Delaware.     Transmeta alleges that Intels P6, Pentium 4,     Pentium M, Intel Core, and Intel Core 2 processors     infringe 10 Transmeta patents alleged to cover computer     architecture and power-efficiency technologies. In December     2006, Transmeta filed an amended complaint alleging that     Intels processors infringe an eleventh Transmeta patent.     Intel filed counterclaims against Transmeta alleging that     Transmetas Crusoe, Efficeon, and Efficeon 2 families     of microprocessors infringe seven Intel patents. Transmeta seeks     damages, treble damages, an injunction, and attorneys     fees. Intel disputes Transmetas allegations of     infringement and intends to defend the lawsuits vigorously.            ITEM     4.

Additional information concerning dividends may be found in the     following sections of this Form     10-K:     Selected Financial Data in Part II, Item 6 and     Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and     Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity     in Part II, Item 8.         In each quarter during 2006, we paid a cash dividend of $0.10     per common share, for a total of $0.40 for the year ($0.08 each     quarter during 2005 for a total of $0.32 for the year). We have     paid a cash dividend in each of the past 57 quarters. In January     2007, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.1125     per common share for the first quarter of 2007. The dividend is     payable on March 1, 2007 to stockholders of record on February     7, 2007.         As of February 16, 2007, there were approximately 195,000     registered holders of record of Intels common stock. A     substantially greater number of holders of Intel common stock     are street name or beneficial holders, whose shares     are held of record by banks, brokers, and other financial     institutions.

MANAGEMENTS     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS           We begin Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial     Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) by discussing     Intels overall strategy and the strategy for our major     operating segments to give the reader an overview of the goals     of our business and the direction in which our business and     products are moving. The Strategy section is     followed by a discussion of the Critical Accounting     Estimates that we believe are important to understanding     the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported     financial results. We then discuss our Results of     Operations beginning with an Overview,     followed by a comparison of 2006 to 2005, and 2005 to 2004.     Following the analysis of our results, we provide an analysis of     changes in our balance sheets and cash flows, and discuss our     financial condition in the section entitled Liquidity and     Capital Resources followed by a discussion of our     Contractual Obligations, Off-Balance-Sheet     Arrangements, and Equity Incentive Plans. We     then conclude this MD&A with our Business     Outlook section, discussing our outlook for 2007.         This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the other     sections of this Form     10-K,     including Part I, Item 1: Business; Part II,     Item 6: Selected Financial Data; and Part II,     Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.     The various sections of this MD&A contain a number of     forward-looking statements. Words such as expects,     goals, plans, believes,     continues, may, and variations of such     words and similar expressions are intended to identify such     forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that     refer to projections of our future financial performance, our     anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, and other     characterizations of future events or circumstances are     forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on our     current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties     and risk factors described throughout this filing and     particularly in the Business Outlook section (see     also Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form     10-K). Our     actual results may differ materially, and these forward-looking     statements do not reflect the potential impact of any     divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business     combinations that had not been completed as of February 21, 2007.     Strategy         Our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips     and platform solutions to the worldwide digital economy. As part     of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market     segment, we use our core competencies in the design and     manufacture of integrated circuits, as well as our financial     resources, global presence, and brand recognition.         Our strategy focuses on taking customer needs into account in     developing the next generation of products and platforms that     will enable new form factors and new usage models for businesses     and consumers. We believe that end users, OEMs, third-party     vendors, and service providers of computing and communications     systems and devices want platform products. We define a platform     as a collection of technologies that are designed to work     together to provide a better end-user solution than if the     ingredients were used separately. Our platforms consist of     various products based on standards and initiatives; hardware     and software that may include technologies such as HT     Technology, Intel VT, and Intel AMT; and services. In developing     our platforms, we may include ingredients sold by other     companies. The success of our strategy to offer platform     solutions is dependent on our ability to select and incorporate     ingredients that customers value, and to market the platforms     effectively. We have a tiered brand strategy that addresses our     customer needs within various market price points.         We also believe that users of computing and communications     systems and devices want improved overall performance     and/or     improved energy-efficient performance. Improved overall     performance can include faster processing performance and other     improved capabilities such as multithreading and multitasking.     Performance can also be improved through enhanced connectivity,     security, manageability, utilization, reliability, ease of use,     and interoperability among devices. Improved energy-efficient     performance involves balancing the addition of these types of     improved performance factors with the power consumption of the     platform. Lower power consumption may reduce system heat output,     provide power savings, and reduce the total cost of ownership     for the end user. It is our goal to incorporate these     improvements in our various products and platforms to meet     end-user demands. In line with these efforts, we are focusing on     further development of multi-core microprocessors. Multi-core     microprocessors contain two or more processor cores, which     enable improved multitasking and energy-efficient performance.     Our strategy for developing processors with improved performance     is to synchronize the introduction of new microarchitecture with     improvements in silicon process technology. We plan to introduce     a new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramp     the next generation of silicon process technology in the     intervening years. This coordinated schedule allows us to     develop and introduce new products based on a common     microarchitecture quickly, without waiting for the next     generation of silicon process technology.        26    Table of Contents     MANAGEMENTS     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS (Continued)          We make equity investments in companies around the world to     further our strategic objectives and support our key business     initiatives, including investments through our Intel Capital     program.

Flash     Memory Group         The strategy for the Flash Memory Group is to provide advanced     flash memory products for cellular phones, memory cards, digital     audio players, and embedded form factors. We offer a broad range     of memory densities, leading-edge packaging technology, and     high-performance functionality. In support of our strategy, we     offer NOR flash memory products such as Intel StrataFlash     wireless memory for advanced mobile phone designs. In addition     to product offerings for cellular customers, we offer NOR flash     memory products that meet the needs of other market segments,     such as the embedded market segment. The embedded market segment     includes set-top boxes, networking products, DVD players, DSL     and cable modems, and other devices. With the formation of IMFT,     a NAND flash memory manufacturing company, with Micron in     January 2006, we have been selling products manufactured by IMFT     that are currently being used in memory cards, digital audio     players, and cellular phones.         We offer a variety of stacked memory products, including     products based on our NOR flash, as well as our NOR flash plus     RAM and/or     NAND flash, which in some instances we purchase from third-party     vendors. Stacking of memory products refers to packaging several     memory chips together.         In the second quarter of 2006, we announced changes to the     organizational structure within the Flash Memory Group operating     segment, designed to consolidate NOR manufacturing, research and     development, and product support into the Flash Memory Group.     These organizational changes were designed to give the Flash     Memory Group more flexibility by giving it greater control over     its own cost structure and allowing for better management of     product development and manufacturing. These changes do not     change the revenue or costs attributed to the Flash Memory Group     operating segment.        28    Table of Contents     MANAGEMENTS     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS (Continued)    Digital     Home Group         The strategy for the Digital Home Group is to design and deliver     products and platforms for consumer products such as PCs,     digital TVs, and networked media devices that meet the demands     of consumers through a variety of linked digital devices within     the home for the enjoyment of digital media and other content.

Critical     Accounting Estimates         The methods, estimates, and judgments we use in applying our     accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we     report in our financial statements, which we discuss under the     heading Results of Operations following this section     of our MD&A. Some of our accounting policies require us to     make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of     the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently     uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include the     valuation of non-marketable equity securities, which impacts net     gains (losses) on equity securities when we record impairments;     the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income     tax assets and liabilities, which impact our tax provision; the     assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which     primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we     record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation; the     valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin; and the     valuation and recognition of share-based compensation, which     impact gross margin, research and development expenses, and     marketing, general and administrative expenses. Below, we     discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and     judgments involved. We also have other policies that we consider     key accounting policies, such as those for revenue recognition,     including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors;     however, these policies typically do not require us to make     estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.     Non-Marketable     Equity Securities         We typically invest in non-marketable equity securities of     private companies, which range from early-stage companies that     are often still defining their strategic direction to more     mature companies whose products or technologies may directly     support an Intel product or initiative. At December 30, 2006,     the carrying value of our portfolio of strategic investments in     non-marketable equity securities, excluding equity derivatives,     totaled $2.8 billion ($561 million at December 31, 2005), which     includes our investments in IMFT and Clearwire.        29    Table of Contents     MANAGEMENTS     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS (Continued)          Investments in non-marketable equity securities are inherently     risky, and a number of these companies are likely to fail. Their     success is dependent on product development, market acceptance,     operational efficiency, and other key business success factors.     In addition, depending on their future prospects and market     conditions, they may not be able to raise additional funds when     needed or they may receive lower valuations, with less favorable     investment terms than in previous financings, and the     investments would likely become impaired.         We review our investments quarterly for indicators of     impairment; however, for non-marketable equity securities, the     impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify     events or circumstances that would likely have a significant     adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. The     indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances     include (a) the investees revenue and earnings trends     relative to predefined milestones and overall business     prospects; (b) the technological feasibility of the     investees products and technologies; (c) the general     market conditions in the investees industry or geographic     area, including adverse regulatory or economic changes; (d)     factors related to the investees ability to remain in     business, such as the investees liquidity, debt ratios,     and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and (e)     the investees receipt of additional funding at a lower     valuation.         Investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are     subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is     other than temporarily impaired, in which case the investment is     written down to its impaired value and a new cost basis is     established. When an investee is not considered viable from a     financial or technological point of view, we write off the     investment, since we consider the estimated fair value to be     nominal. If an investee obtains additional funding at a     valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round     of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does     not appear imminent, we presume that the investment is other     than temporarily impaired, unless specific facts and     circumstances indicate otherwise. Impairments of investments in     our portfolio of non-marketable equity securities were $79     million in 2006 ($103 million in 2005 and $115 million in 2004).     Over the past 12 quarters, impairments of investments in our     portfolio of non-marketable equity securities have ranged     between $10 million and $41 million per quarter.     Income     Taxes         We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining     income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These     estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits,     tax benefits, and deductions, such as the tax benefit for export     sales, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and     liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of     recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial     statement purposes. Significant changes to these estimates may     result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a     subsequent period.         We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover     our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must     increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation     allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will     not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that a substantial     majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated     balance sheets will ultimately be recovered. However, should     there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax     assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which     we determined that the recovery was not probable.         In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves     dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax     regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit     issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our     estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional tax     payments are probable. If we ultimately determine that payment     of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and     recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine     that the liability is no longer necessary. This may occur for a     variety of reasons, such as the expiration of the statute of     limitations on a particular tax return or the signing of a final     settlement agreement with the relative tax authority. We record     an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in     which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than     we expect the ultimate assessment to be.         In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)     issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for     Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of SFAS No.     109. The provisions are effective beginning in the first     quarter of 2007. See Note 2: Accounting Policies in     Part II, Item 8 of this Form     10-K for     further discussion.        30    Table of Contents     MANAGEMENTS     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS (Continued)    Long-Lived     Assets         We assess long-lived assets for impairment when events or     changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the     assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. Factors     that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment     review include significant under-performance of a business or     product line in relation to expectations, significant negative     industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned     changes in our use of the assets. Recoverability of assets that     will continue to be used in our operations is measured by     comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to our     estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash     flows. If an asset groupings carrying value is not     recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the     asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is     measured by the difference between the asset groupings     carrying amount and its fair value.         Impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of     assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent     cash flows. Due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable     nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make     subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows     that can be related to specific asset groupings. In addition, as     we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory     planning decisions, we must make subjective judgments regarding     the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific     semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements.     When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter     than we had originally estimated, and there are sufficient cash     flows to support the carrying value of the assets, we accelerate     the rate of depreciation charges in order to fully depreciate     the assets over their new shorter useful lives. Impairments and     accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets were approximately     $335 million during 2006 (approximately $20 million in 2005 and     $50 million in 2004). The amount in 2006 included $317 million     of asset impairment charges related to our communications and     application processor business. For further discussion on these     asset impairment charges, see Note 11: Restructuring and     Asset Impairment Charges in Part II, Item 8 of this Form     10-K.     Inventory         The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or     excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable     quality. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory     requires us to estimate the future demand for our products.     During the second quarter of 2006, we completed a demand     forecast accuracy analysis. As a result, the demand horizon now     includes additional weeks of the demand forecast period for     certain products, compared to prior years, and continues to     include a review of product-specific facts and circumstances.     This change did not have a significant impact on gross margin in     2006. The demand forecast is also a direct input in the     development of our short-term manufacturing plans, to help     enable consistency between inventory valuation and build     decisions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in     the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer     base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products,     consumer confidence, and customer acceptance of our products as     well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the     product cost. If our demand forecast for specific products is     greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing     output accordingly, or if we fail to accurately forecast the     demand, we could be required to write down additional inventory,     which would have a negative impact on our gross margin.     Share-Based     Compensation         In the first quarter of 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R), which     requires the measurement at fair value and recognition of     compensation expense for all share-based payment awards. Total     share-based compensation during 2006 was $1.4 billion.     Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the     fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase     shares under stock purchase plans at the date of grant requires     judgment. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to     estimate the fair value of these share-based awards consistent     with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Option pricing models,     including the Black-Scholes model, also require the use of input     assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life,     expected dividend rate, and expected risk-free rate of return.     The assumptions for expected volatility and expected life are     the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date     fair value. The expected dividend rate and expected risk-free     rate of return are not significant to the calculation of fair     value.        31    Table of Contents     MANAGEMENTS     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS (Continued)          We use implied volatility based on options freely traded in the     open market, as we believe implied volatility is more reflective     of market conditions and a better indicator of expected     volatility than historical volatility. In determining the     appropriateness of implied volatility, we considered: the volume     of market activity of freely traded options, and determined that     there was sufficient market activity; the ability to reasonably     match the input variables of options freely traded to those of     options granted by the company, such as the date of grant and     the exercise price, and determined that the input assumptions     were comparable; and the length of term of freely traded options     used to derive implied volatility, which is generally one to two     years, and determined that the length of term was sufficient. We     use the simplified calculation of expected life described in the     SECs Staff Accounting Bulletin 107, due to changes in the     vesting terms and contractual life of current option grants     compared to our historical grants. If we determined that another     method used to estimate expected volatility or expected life was     more reasonable than our current methods, or if another method     for calculating these input assumptions was prescribed by     authoritative guidance, the fair value calculated for     share-based awards could change significantly. Higher volatility     and longer expected lives result in an increase to share-based     compensation determined at the date of grant. The effect that     changes in the volatility and the expected life would have on     the weighted average fair value of grants and the increase in     total fair value during 2006 was as follows:                                              2006                 Weighted Average            Increase in Total                  Fair Value Per            Fair     Value1                  Share           (In Millions)               As reported                 $         5.21                          Hypothetical:                                            Increase expected volatility by 5     percentage     points2             $       5.92               $         36          Increase expected life by 1 year                 $       5.68               $       24                      1   Amounts represent the hypothetical increase in the total fair     value determined at the date of grant, which would be amortized     over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures.      2   For example, an increase from 27% reported volatility for     2006 to a hypothetical 32% volatility.          In addition, SFAS No. 123(R) requires us to develop an estimate     of the number of share-based awards that will be forfeited due     to employee turnover. Quarterly changes in the estimated     forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported     share-based compensation, as the cumulative effect of adjusting     the rate for all expense amortization after January 1, 2006 is     recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. We     estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a quarterly review     of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee     turnover. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the     previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that     will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the     financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than     the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made     that will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the     financial statements. These adjustments affect our gross margin;     research and development expenses; and marketing, general and     administrative expenses. The effect of forfeiture adjustments in     2006 was insignificant. Cumulative adjustments are recorded to     the extent that the related expense is recognized in the     financial statements, beginning with implementation in the first     quarter of 2006. Therefore, we expect the potential impact from     cumulative forfeiture adjustments to increase in future periods.     The expense that we recognize in future periods could also     differ significantly from the current period     and/or our     forecasts due to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates.     Results     of Operations     Overview         Fiscal year 2006 was a challenging year driven by a strong     competitive environment. Lower microprocessor average selling     prices significantly impacted our revenue and gross margin. Our     gross margin toward the end of the year was also impacted by     higher unit costs resulting from the ramp of dual-core     microprocessors and charges from the under-utilization of our     90-nanometer facilities. Factory under-utilization charges are     expected to continue to impact our gross margin during the first     quarter of 2007, and     start-up     costs associated with our 45-nanometer process technology are     expected to impact our gross margin during the first half of     2007. We continued to see a mix shift in microprocessor revenue     from desktop to mobile and ended the year with fourth-quarter     mobile microprocessor revenue surpassing desktop microprocessor     revenue for the first time. Results for 2006 included     share-based compensation charges of $1.4 billion, gains on     divestitures of $612 million, and restructuring and asset     impairment charges of $555 million.        32    Table of Contents     MANAGEMENTS     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS (Continued)        Our spending is trending lower going into 2007 as a result of     our ongoing program to improve operational efficiency and reduce     ongoing costs across the company. Through ongoing attrition,     divestitures, and employee terminations, we ended the year with     our employee headcount at 94,100, down from 102,500 at mid-year,     and expect our headcount to continue to decline to 92,000 by the     middle of 2007. We recognized $238 million in restructuring     charges related to employee severance and benefit arrangements.     In addition, we have taken actions to focus on our core     businesses and have completed three divestitures. We recognized     $103 million in tool impairments associated with one of the     divestitures. In addition, we have placed for sale a fabrication     facility in Colorado that resulted in an impairment charge of     $214 million. Overall, our ongoing program to improve     operational efficiency and results is expected to generate cost     savings of $2 billion in 2007, and $3 billion in 2008,     of which an estimated $600 million in gross annual savings     is a result of current-year restructuring charges related to     employee severance and benefit arrangements. A portion of the     overall cost savings, such as better utilization of assets,     reduced spending, and organizational efficiencies, will not     result in restructuring charges.         Outstanding new products, leadership in manufacturing     technology, comprehensive cost savings, and disciplined     execution have built a foundation for 2007. We continue to drive     technology advancements, and in 2006 we ramped our     65-nanometer     process technology, introduced the Intel Core microarchitecture,     and ended the year with dual-core microprocessors accounting for     over half of our fourth-quarter shipments. Additionally, in the     fourth quarter, we began shipping quad-core microprocessors.     Looking forward to 2007, we expect to launch our next generation     of Intel Centrino mobile technology later in the first half of     2007, and microprocessors using     45-nanometer     process technology are scheduled for production in the second     half of 2007.         From a financial condition perspective, we ended the year with     $8.9 billion in cash and short-term investments, and returned     $4.6 billion to stockholders through stock repurchases and     $2.3 billion as dividends in 2006.         The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements     of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods     indicated:                                                                                              2006           2005           2004                             % of                        % of                        % of           (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)        Dollars           Revenue           Dollars           Revenue           Dollars           Revenue          Net revenue        $   35,382               100.0   %       $   38,826               100.0   %       $   34,209               100.0   %      Cost of sales                     17,164                   48.5       %               15,777                   40.6       %               14,463                   42.3       %                                                                                                            Gross margin            18,218               51.5   %           23,049               59.4   %           19,746               57.7   %                                                                                                            Research and development                     5,873                   16.6       %               5,145                   13.3       %               4,778                   14.0       %      Marketing, general and     administrative                     6,096                   17.2       %               5,688                   14.7       %               4,659                   13.6       %      Restructuring and asset impairment     charges                     555                   1.6       %                                                                                  Amortization of     acquisition-related intangibles and costs                     42                   0.1       %               126                   0.3       %               179                   0.5       %                                                                                                            Operating income            5,652               16.0   %           12,090               31.1   %           10,130               29.6   %      Gains (losses) on equity     securities, net                     214                   0.6       %               (45       )               (0.1       )%               (2       )                         Interest and other, net                     1,202                   3.4       %               565                   1.5       %               289                   0.9       %                                                                                                            Income before taxes            7,068               20.0   %           12,610               32.5   %           10,417               30.5   %      Provision for taxes                     2,024                   5.7       %               3,946                   10.2       %               2,901                   8.5       %                                                                                                            Net income        $   5,044               14.3   %       $   8,664               22.3   %       $   7,516               22.0   %                                                                                                            Diluted earnings per common     share        $   0.86                           $   1.40                           $   1.16                                                                                                                                       33    Table of Contents     MANAGEMENTS     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS (Continued)        Effective January 1, 2006, the company adopted the provisions of     SFAS No. 123(R), which is discussed in Note 2: Accounting     Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form     10-K.

Substantially all of the decrease was due to     significantly lower average selling prices of microprocessors.     Fiscal year 2006 was a     52-week     fiscal year in contrast to fiscal year 2005, which was a     53-week     fiscal year.         Revenue in the Asia-Pacific region decreased 10% and revenue in     the Europe region decreased 20% compared to 2005. These     decreases were slightly offset by revenue in Japan, which     increased slightly compared to 2005. Revenue in the Americas     region was approximately flat compared to 2005. Mature and     emerging markets both declined in 2006 compared to 2005. The     decrease within mature markets occurred in the Europe and     Asia-Pacific regions, and a substantial majority of the decrease     within the emerging markets occurred in the Europe and     Asia-Pacific regions.         Our overall gross margin dollars for 2006 were $18.2 billion, a     decrease of $4.8 billion, or 21%, compared to 2005. Our overall     gross margin percentage decreased to 51.5% in 2006 from 59.4% in     2005. The gross margin percentage for the Digital Enterprise     Group and the Mobility Group were both lower in 2006 compared to     2005. A mix shift of our total revenue to the Mobility Group,     which has a higher gross margin percentage, slightly offset     these decreases to the overall gross margin. A substantial     majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2006 and 2005     was derived from the sale of microprocessors. The 2006 gross     margin included the impact of $349 million of share-based     compensation, which we began recognizing in 2006. The 2005 gross     margin was affected by a litigation settlement agreement with     MicroUnity, Inc. in which we recorded a $140 million charge to     cost of sales, of which $110 million was allocated to the     Digital Enterprise Group and $30 million was allocated to the     Mobility Group. See Business Outlook later in this     section for a discussion of gross margin expectations.         Our net revenue for 2005 was $38.8 billion, an increase of $4.6     billion, or 13.5%, compared to 2004. This increase was primarily     due to higher revenue from sales of mobile microprocessors and     higher chipset revenue. Fiscal year 2005 was a     53-week     fiscal year in contrast to fiscal year 2004, which was a     52-week     fiscal year.        34    Table of Contents     MANAGEMENTS     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS (Continued)          In 2005, the Asia-Pacific regions revenue was     approximately 50% of our total revenue, and it was our fastest     growing region, increasing 26% compared to 2004 and reflecting     the movement of more of our customers PC supply chains to     Asia. This movement in the supply chain negatively affected our     sales in the Americas region, which decreased 5% compared to     2004. Japan revenue increased 19% and Europe revenue increased     6% during 2005 compared to 2004. We saw growth in both mature     and emerging markets in 2005 compared to 2004.         Overall gross margin dollars for 2005 were $23.0 billion, an     increase of $3.3 billion, or 17%, compared to 2004. Our overall     gross margin percentage increased to 59.4% in 2005 from 57.7% in     2004. The overall gross margin percentage was positively     affected by a mix shift of our total revenue to the Mobility     Group, which has a higher gross margin percentage. The gross     margin percentages for the Digital Enterprise Group and Flash     Memory Group were higher and the gross margin percentage for the     Mobility Group was lower in 2005 compared to 2004. A substantial     majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2005 and 2004     was derived from the sale of microprocessors. As a result of a     litigation settlement agreement with MicroUnity, we recorded a     $140 million charge to cost of sales in 2005, of which $110     million was allocated to the Digital Enterprise Group and $30     million was allocated to the Mobility Group. The 2004 gross     margin was affected by a litigation settlement with Intergraph     Corporation in which we recorded a $162 million charge to cost     of sales, of which $120 million was allocated to the Digital     Enterprise Group and $42 million was allocated to the Mobility     Group.     Digital     Enterprise Group         The revenue and operating income for the Digital Enterprise     Group (DEG) for the three years ended December 30, 2006 were as     follows:                                                   (In Millions)        2006           2005           2004               Microprocessor revenue                 $       14,606               $       19,412               $       19,426          Chipset, motherboard, and other     revenue                     5,270                   5,725                   5,352                                                                Net revenue        $   19,876           $   25,137           $   24,778          Operating income        $   4,267           $   9,020           $   8,856                  Net revenue for the DEG operating segment decreased     significantly, by $5.3 billion, or 21%, in 2006 compared to     2005. The decline in net revenue was mostly due to a significant     decline in microprocessor revenue, and to a lesser extent, a     decline in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue. The     significant decline in microprocessor revenue was due to lower     average selling prices and unit sales of desktop     microprocessors. Enterprise microprocessor revenue increased in     2006. The decline in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was     due equally to lower chipset revenue and motherboard revenue.     Microprocessors within DEG include microprocessors designed for     the desktop and enterprise computing market segments, previously     included within the former Intel Architecture business operating     segment, as well as embedded microprocessors. Revenue from     network processors, which are based on our Intel XScale     technology, is included in chipset, motherboard, and other     revenue above.         Operating income decreased significantly by $4.8 billion, or     53%, in 2006 compared to 2005. Substantially all of the decrease     was due to the revenue decline. Higher microprocessor unit     costs, along with $210 million of higher factory     under-utilization charges, were offset by approximately $540     million of lower     start-up     costs. Unit costs were higher in 2006 compared to 2005 due     primarily to a mix shift to dual-core microprocessors. Results     for 2005 included a charge related to a settlement agreement     with MicroUnity.         For 2005, revenue for the DEG operating segment was     approximately flat compared to 2004. Revenue from sales of     microprocessors was approximately flat, with slightly higher     unit sales being offset by slightly lower average selling     prices. Revenue from sales of server microprocessors in 2005 was     negatively affected by the highly competitive server market.     Chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was higher, primarily     due to higher average selling prices of chipsets.         Operating income was also approximately flat, at $9.0 billion in     2005 compared to $8.9 billion in 2004. The operating income for     DEG was positively affected by lower microprocessor unit costs     and higher chipset revenue. These improvements were offset by     approximately $380 million of higher     start-up     costs in 2005, primarily related to our 65-nanometer process     technology. Products based on our     65-nanometer     process technology began shipping in the fourth quarter of 2005.     Although revenue was flat, operating expenses increased in 2005,     which negatively affected operating income. Both periods were     negatively affected by litigation settlement agreements. Results     for 2005 included a charge related to a settlement agreement     with MicroUnity, and results for 2004 included a charge related     to a settlement agreement with Intergraph.        35    Table of Contents     MANAGEMENTS     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS (Continued)      Mobility     Group         The revenue and operating income for the Mobility Group (MG) for     the three years ended December 30, 2006 were as follows:                                                   (In Millions)        2006           2005           2004               Microprocessor revenue                 $       9,212               $       8,704               $       5,667          Chipset and other revenue                     3,097                   2,427                   1,314                                                                Net revenue        $   12,309           $   11,131           $   6,981          Operating income        $   4,993           $   5,334           $   2,832                  Net revenue for the MG operating segment increased by $1.2     billion, or 11%, in 2006 compared to 2005. Microprocessor     revenue increased by $508 million, or 6%, in 2006 compared to     2005, while chipsets and other revenue increased by $670     million, or 28%, in 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in     microprocessor revenue was due to higher unit sales, largely     offset by lower average selling prices. The majority of the     increase in chipset and other revenue was due to higher revenue     from sales of chipsets, and to a lesser extent, higher revenue     from sales of wireless connectivity products. Sales of these     products increased primarily due to the Intel Centrino Duo     mobile technology platform. Revenue from application and     cellular baseband processors is included in chipset and     other revenue above. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we     divested certain assets of the business line that included     application and cellular baseband processors used in handheld     devices. See Note 14: Acquisitions and Divestitures     in Part II, Item 8 of this Form     10-K.         Operating income decreased by $341 million, or 6%, in 2006     compared to 2005. The decline was primarily caused by higher     operating expenses. The effects of higher revenue were offset by     higher unit costs for microprocessors.     Start-up     costs were approximately $170 million lower in 2006 compared to     2005.         For 2005, revenue for the MG operating segment increased by     $4.15 billion, or 59%, compared to 2004. This increase was     primarily due to significantly higher revenue from sales of     microprocessors, which increased $3.0 billion, or 54%, in 2005     compared to 2004, reflecting the continued growth in the     notebook market segment. Increased use of microprocessors     designed specifically for mobile platforms in notebook computers     also contributed to the higher revenue. The higher revenue from     sales of microprocessors was due to significantly higher unit     sales, partially offset by lower average selling prices,     primarily due to higher unit sales of the Celeron M processor,     our value mobile processor. Revenue from sales of chipsets and     wireless connectivity products also increased significantly in     2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to the success of Intel     Centrino mobile technology.         Operating income increased to $5.3 billion in 2005 from $2.8     billion in 2004. The significant increase in operating income     was primarily due to higher revenue. In addition, operating     expenses for the MG operating segment did not increase as fast     as revenue, and microprocessor unit costs were lower. These     increases in operating income were partially offset by     approximately $170 million of higher     start-up     costs in 2005, primarily related to our 65-nanometer process     technology.     Flash     Memory Group         The revenue and operating loss for the Flash Memory Group (FMG)     for the three years ended December 30, 2006 were as follows:                                                   (In Millions)        2006           2005           2004               Net Revenue        $   2,163           $   2,278           $   2,285          Operating income     (loss)        $   (555   )       $   (154   )       $   (149   )              Net revenue for the FMG operating segment decreased by $115     million, or 5%, in 2006 compared to 2005. This decrease was     primarily due to lower average selling prices, partially offset     by higher royalty receipts. In 2006, we began shipping NAND     flash memory products manufactured by IMFT. Operating loss     increased to $555 million in 2006, from $154 million in 2005.     The increase was primarily due to higher costs related to our     new NAND flash memory business. Lower revenue for our NOR flash     business was offset by lower unit costs and lower     start-up     costs.        36    Table of Contents     MANAGEMENTS     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS (Continued)          For 2005, revenue for the FMG operating segment remained     approximately flat at $2.3 billion compared to 2004. Revenue was     positively affected by higher unit sales and negatively affected     by lower average selling prices. Operating loss remained     approximately flat in 2005 at $154 million, compared to $149     million in 2004. The operating loss was positively affected by     lower unit costs and negatively affected by higher operating     expenses.     Share-Based     Compensation         Share-based compensation totaled $1.4 billion in 2006, compared     to zero in 2005 and 2004. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) under the     modified prospective transition method, effective beginning in     the first quarter of 2006. Prior to adoption of SFAS No. 123(R),     we accounted for our equity incentive plans under the intrinsic     value recognition and measurement principles of Accounting     Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for     Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25) and related     interpretations. Accordingly, no share-based compensation, other     than insignificant amounts of acquisition-related share-based     compensation, was recognized in net income.         As of December 30, 2006, unrecognized share-based compensation     costs and the weighted average period over which the costs are     expected to be recognized were as follows:                                        Unrecognized                          Share-Based            Weighted              Compensation            Average              Costs           Period           Stock options                 $       1.1 billion            1.1 years            Restricted stock units                 $        380 million           1.8 years            Stock purchase plan                 $       19 million           1 month                   Share-based compensation charges are included in the all     other category for segment reporting purposes.     Operating     Expenses         Operating expenses for the three years ended December 30, 2006     were as follows:                                                   (In Millions)        2006           2005           2004               Research and development     (includes share-based     compensation of $487 million in 2006 and zero in 2005 and 2004)                 $       5,873               $        5,145               $        4,778          Marketing, general and     administrative     (includes share-based     compensation of $539 million in 2006 and zero in 2005 and 2004)                 $        6,096               $       5,688               $       4,659          Restructuring and asset     impairment charges            $       555               $                      $                 Amortization of     acquisition-related intangibles and costs            $       42               $       126               $       179              Research and Development. Research and development     spending increased $728 million, or 14%, in 2006 compared to     2005, and increased $367 million, or 8%, in 2005 compared to     2004. The increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to     share-based compensation of $487 million, and to a lesser     extent, higher development costs driven by our next-generation     45-nanometer manufacturing process technology. Lower     profit-dependent compensation expenses partially offset these     increases. The increase in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily     due to higher headcount and profit-dependent compensation     expenses, partially offset by lower expenses related to     development for our 65-nanometer manufacturing process     technology. Fiscal year 2005 included 53 weeks.     Marketing, General and Administrative. Marketing,     general and administrative expenses increased $408 million, or     7%, in 2006 compared to 2005, and increased $1.0 billion, or     22%, in 2005 compared to 2004. The increase in 2006 compared to     2005 was primarily due to share-based compensation of $539     million, and to a lesser extent, higher headcount. Partially     offsetting these increases were lower marketing program spending     and lower profit-dependent compensation expenses. The increase     in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to higher marketing     program spending, higher headcount, and higher profit-dependent     compensation expenses as well as the extra work week.        37    Table of Contents     MANAGEMENTS     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS (Continued)          Research and development along with marketing, general and     administrative expenses were 34% of net revenue in 2006 and 28%     of net revenue in 2005 and 2004.     Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges. We are     undertaking a restructuring plan designed to improve operational     efficiency and financial results. In the third quarter of 2006,     management approved several actions related to this plan that     were recommended by the companys structure and efficiency     task force. A portion of these activities involves cost savings     or other actions that do not result in restructuring charges,     such as better utilization of assets, reduced spending, and     organizational efficiencies. The efficiency program includes     headcount targets for various groups within the company, and we     expect these targets to be met through ongoing employee     attrition, divestitures, and employee terminations.         During 2006, we incurred $238 million of restructuring charges     related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for     approximately 4,800 employees, of which approximately 4,100     employees had left the company as of December 30, 2006. A     substantial majority of these employee terminations occurred     within marketing, manufacturing, information technology, and     human resources. Additionally, we completed the divestiture of     the assets of three businesses in 2006 concurrently with the     ongoing execution of the efficiency program. See Note 14:     Acquisitions and Divestitures in Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     for further details. In connection with the divestiture of     certain assets of the communications and application processor     business, we recorded impairment charges of $103 million related     to the write-down of manufacturing tools to their fair value,     less the cost to dispose of the assets. The fair value was     determined using a market-based valuation technique. In     addition, as a result of both this divestiture and a subsequent     assessment of our worldwide manufacturing capacity operations,     management placed for sale its fabrication facility in Colorado     Springs, Colorado. This plan resulted in an impairment charge of     $214 million to write down to fair value the land, building, and     equipment asset grouping that has been principally used to     support the communications and application processor business.     The fair market value of the asset grouping was determined using     various valuation techniques.         The following table summarizes the restructuring and asset     impairment activity for 2006:                                                          Employee Severance                                   (In Millions)        and Benefit           Asset Impairment           Total               Accrued restructuring balance     as of December 31, 2005        $              $              $             Additional accruals                     238                   317                   555          Adjustments                                                                     Cash payments                     (190       )                                  (190       )      Non-cash settlements                                        (317       )               (317       )                                                            Accrued restructuring balance     as of December 30, 2006        $   48           $               $   48                                                                        The restructuring and asset impairment charges above have been     reflected separately as restructuring and asset impairment     charges on the consolidated statements of income. The     restructuring accrual balance relates to severance benefits that     are expected to be paid within the next 12 months. As such, the     restructuring accrual is recorded as a current liability within     accrued compensation and benefits on the consolidated balance     sheets. No restructuring charges were incurred in 2005 or 2004.     We expect to record additional employee severance and benefit     charges of approximately $50 million in the first quarter of     2007. In addition, we may incur charges in the future under this     restructuring for facility-related or other exit activities.         We estimate that the current-year employee severance and benefit     charges will result in gross annual savings of approximately     $600 million. We expect these savings to be realized in     approximately equal amounts within cost of sales; research and     development; and marketing, general and administrative expenses.     See Note 11: Restructuring and Asset Impairment     Charges in Part II, Item 8 of this Form     10-K. See     also the risks described in Risk Factors in Part I,     Item 1A of this Form     10-K.     Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles and     Costs. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles     and costs was $42 million in 2006 ($126 million in 2005 and $179     million in 2004). The decreased amortization each year compared     to the previous year was primarily due to a portion of the     intangibles related to prior acquisitions becoming fully     amortized.        38    Table of Contents     MANAGEMENTS     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS (Continued)      Gains     (losses) on Equity Securities, Interest and Other, and Provision     for Taxes         Gains (losses) on equity securities, net; interest and other,     net; and provision for taxes for the three years ended December     30, 2006 were as follows:                                                   (In Millions)        2006           2005           2004               Gains on equity securities                 $       293               $       163               $       115          Impairment charges                     (79       )               (208       )               (117       )                                                            Gains (losses) on equity     securities, net        $   214           $   (45   )       $   (2   )                                                            Interest and other,     net        $   1,202           $   565           $   289          Provision for taxes        $   (2,024   )       $   (3,946   )       $   (2,901   )               During 2006, the gains on equity securities of $293 million     included the gain of $103 million on the sale of a portion of     our investment in Micron, which was sold for $275 million.     During 2005, impairment charges of $208 million included a $105     million impairment charge on our investment in Micron. The     impairment was principally based on our assessment during the     second quarter of 2005 of Microns financial results and     the fact that the market price of Microns stock had been     below our cost basis for an extended period of time, as well as     the competitive pricing environment for DRAM products. During     2004, the net losses on equity securities of $2 million included     impairments of $117 million, primarily on non-marketable     equity securities.         Interest and other, net increased to $1.2 billion in 2006     compared to $565 million in 2005, reflecting net gains of $612     million for three completed divestitures (see Note 14:     Acquisitions and Divestitures in Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K)     and higher interest income as a result of higher interest rates,     partially offset by lower cash balances. Interest and other, net     increased to $565 million in 2005 compared to $289 million in     2004, reflecting higher interest income as a result of higher     interest rates. Interest and other, net for 2004 also included     approximately $60 million of gains associated with terminating     financing arrangements for manufacturing facilities and     equipment in Ireland.         Our effective income tax rate was 28.6% in 2006 (31.3% in 2005     and 27.8% in 2004). The rate decreased in 2006 compared to 2005     primarily due to a higher percentage of our profits being     derived from lower tax jurisdictions. In addition, the rate for     2005 included an increase to the tax provision of approximately     $265 million as a result of the decision to repatriate     non-U.S.     earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Partially     offsetting the decrease in the effective tax rate was the impact     of share-based compensation. The phasing out of the tax benefit     for export sales only slightly increased the effective tax rate     compared to the prior year, given the decrease in income before     taxes. Our effective income tax rate was higher in 2005 compared     to 2004, due to the decision to repatriate     non-U.S.     earnings, which were partially offset by the reversal of     previously accrued items. The tax rate for 2004 included a     $195 million reduction to the tax provision, primarily from     additional benefits for export sales along with state tax     benefits for divestitures, as well as the reversal of previously     accrued taxes, primarily related to the closing of a state     income tax audit.     Liquidity     and Capital Resources         Our financial condition remains strong. Cash, short-term     investments, fixed income debt instruments included in trading     assets, and debt at the end of each period were as follows:                                              December 30,            December 31,           (Dollars In Millions)        2006           2005               Cash, short-term investments, and     fixed-income debt instruments included in trading assets                 $       9,552               $       12,409          Short-term and long-term debt                 $       2,028               $       2,419          Debt as % of stockholders     equity                     5.5       %               6.7       %             39    Table of Contents     MANAGEMENTS     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS (Continued)        In summary, our cash flows were as follows:                                                   (In Millions)        2006           2005           2004               Net cash provided by operating     activities                 $       10,620               $       14,823               $       13,119          Net cash used for investing     activities                     (4,907       )               (6,362       )               (5,032       )      Net cash used for financing     activities                     (6,439       )               (9,544       )               (7,651       )                                                            Net increase (decrease) in cash     and cash equivalents        $   (726   )       $   (1,083   )       $   436                                                                    Operating     Activities         Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for     certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.     For 2006 compared to 2005, the largest contributing factors to     the decrease in cash provided by operating activities were due     to lower net income, lower net maturities of trading assets, and     changes in the amount of estimated tax payments, partially     offset by a decrease in accounts receivable balances. Fiscal     year 2006 included share-based compensation charges of     approximately $1.4 billion. For 2005 compared to 2004, the     majority of the increase in cash provided by operating     activities was from higher net maturities of trading assets and     higher net income, partially offset by an increase in accounts     receivable balances.         Inventories as of December 30, 2006 increased compared to     December 31, 2005, as we continued to ramp new, higher cost     products, primarily related to microprocessors on our     65-nanometer process technology and associated chipsets on our     90-nanometer process technology. Accounts receivable as of     December 30, 2006 decreased compared to December 31,     2005, primarily driven by lower revenue and higher cash     collections. For 2006 and 2005, our two largest customers     accounted for 35% of net revenue, with one of these customers     accounting for 19% of revenue and another customer accounting     for 16%. Additionally, these two largest customers accounted for     52% of net accounts receivable at December 30, 2006 (42% at     December 31, 2005).     Investing     Activities         Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures     and payments for investments acquired, partially offset by     proceeds from investment maturities and sales. The decrease in     cash used in investing activities in 2006 compared to 2005 was     primarily due to higher net maturities and sales of     available-for-sale     investments. We also received $752 million for the sale of three     completed divestitures (see Note 14: Acquisitions and     Divestitures in Part II, Item 8 of this Form     10-K).     Additionally, during 2006 we sold a portion of our investment in     Micron for $275 million. Partially offsetting these impacts, we     paid $600 million in cash for our equity investment in Clearwire     and $615 million in cash for our equity investment in IMFT. In     addition to the $615 million paid in cash, our initial     investment in IMFT of $1.2 billion included the issuance of $581     million in notes (reflected as a financing activity). In     addition, we made a capital contribution of $128 million to     IMFT. Other investing activities for 2006 included the purchase     of intellectual property assets from Micron, concurrent with the     formation of IMFT, for $230 million. For 2005 compared to 2004,     the higher cash used in investing activities resulted from     capital spending, primarily driven by investments in     65-nanometer production equipment.     Financing     Activities         Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and     retirement of common stock and payment of dividends to     stockholders. The lower cash used in financing activities in     2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to a decrease in     repurchases and retirement of common stock, partially offset by     additions to long-term debt in 2005 of $1.7 billion. For     2006, we repurchased 226 million shares of common stock for $4.6     billion compared to 418 million shares for $10.6 billion in     2005. At December 30, 2006, $17.3 billion remained available for     repurchase under existing repurchase authorizations. Our     dividend payments were $2.3 billion in 2006, which is higher     than the $2.0 billion paid in 2005, due to an increase from     $0.08 to $0.10 in cash dividends per common share effective for     the first quarter of 2006. On January 18, 2007, our Board of     Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.1125 per common share     effective the first quarter of 2007. Additional financing     activities for 2006 included proceeds from the sale of shares     pursuant to employee equity incentive plans of $1.0 billion     ($1.2 billion during 2005). For 2005 compared to 2004, the     higher cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an     increase in repurchases and retirements of common stock,     partially offset by cash received from the issuance of long-term     debt.        40    Table of Contents     MANAGEMENTS     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS (Continued)      Liquidity         During 2006, our level of cash declined, as our cash provided by     operations was less than our cash used for investing and     financing activities. Cash generated by operations is used as     our primary source of liquidity. Another potential source of     liquidity is authorized borrowings, including commercial paper,     of $3.0 billion. There were no borrowings under our commercial     paper program during 2006. We also have an automatic shelf     registration on file with the SEC pursuant to which we may offer     an indeterminate amount of debt, equity, and other securities.         We believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet     business requirements for the next 12 months, including capital     expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide     manufacturing and assembly and test capacity, working capital     requirements, the dividend program, potential stock repurchases,     potential future acquisitions or strategic investments, and cash     payments associated with our structure and efficiency program.     Contractual     Obligations         The following table summarizes our significant contractual     obligations at December 30, 2006:                                                                                  Payments Due by Period                             Less than                                    More than           (In Millions)        Total           1 year           13 years           35 years           5 years               Operating lease obligations                 $       384               $       114               $       138               $       57               $       75          Capital purchase     obligations1                   3,276                   3,152                   124                                                Other purchase obligations and     commitments2                 1,778                   1,122                   520                   136                             Long-term debt     obligations3                 3,377                   66                   132                   282                   2,897          Other long-term     liabilities3                 1,041                   71                   330                   214                   426                                                                                                Total4        $   9,856           $   4,525           $   1,244           $   689           $   3,398                                                                                                            1   Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the     construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They     were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance     sheet as of December 30, 2006, as we had not yet received the     related goods or taken title to the property. Capital purchase     obligations increased from $2.7 billion at December 31, 2005 to     $3.3 billion at December 30, 2006, primarily due to purchase     obligations for capital equipment related to our next-generation     45-nanometer     process technology.      2   Other purchase obligations and commitments include agreements     to purchase raw materials or other goods as well as payments due     under various types of licenses and non-contingent funding     obligations. Funding obligations include, for example,     agreements to fund various projects with other companies.      3   Amounts represent total anticipated cash payments, including     anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on the     consolidated balance sheets and the short-term portion of the     obligation. Any future settlement of convertible debt would     reduce anticipated interest     and/or     principal payments. Amounts exclude fair value adjustments such     as discounts or premiums that affect the amount recorded on the     consolidated balance sheets.      4   Total does not include contractual obligations already     recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as current     liabilities (except for the short-term portion of the long-term     debt and other long-term liabilities) or certain purchase     obligations, which are discussed below.          Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services     generally include agreements that are enforceable and legally     binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms,     including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed,     minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate     timing of the transaction. The table above also includes     agreements to purchase raw materials that have cancellation     provisions requiring little or no payment. The amounts under     such contracts are included in the table above because     management believes that cancellation of these contracts is     unlikely and expects to make future cash payments according to     the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials.     For other obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts     included in the table above were limited to the non-cancelable     portion of the agreement terms, and/or the minimum cancellation     fee.        41    Table of Contents     MANAGEMENTS     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS (Continued)        We have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw     materials or other goods that specify minimum prices, and     quantities that are based on a percentage of the total available     market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing     requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and     our future purchasing requirements, obligations under these     agreements are not included in the table above. We estimate our     obligation under these agreements as of December 30, 2006 to be     approximately as follows: less than one year$175 million;     one to three years$600 million; three to five     years$400 million; more than five yearszero. Our     purchase orders for other products are based on our current     manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within     short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders     represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding     agreements.         Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement     of certain milestones are not included in the table above. These     obligations include milestone-based co-marketing agreements,     contingent funding obligations, and milestone-based equity     investment funding. These arrangements are not considered     contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third     party. As of December 30, 2006, assuming that all future     milestones are met, additional required payments would be     approximately $254 million.         For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number     of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is     net of the statutory withholding requirements that are paid by     Intel on behalf of its employees. The obligation to pay the     relative taxing authority is not included in the table above, as     the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition,     the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part     on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.         The expected timing of payments of the obligations above are     estimates based on current information. Timing of payments and     actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of     receipt of goods or services, or changes to     agreed-upon     amounts for some obligations. Amounts disclosed as contingent or     milestone-based obligations are dependent on the achievement of     the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and     can vary significantly.         We currently have a contractual obligation to purchase the     output of IMFT in proportion to our investment in IMFT, which is     currently 49%. See Note 17: Venture in Part II, Item     8 of this Form     10-K.     Additionally, we have entered into various contractual     commitments in relation to our investment in IMFT. Some of these     commitments are with Micron, and some are directly with IMFT.     The following are the significant contractual commitments:                       Subject to certain conditions, Intel and Micron each agreed to     contribute approximately an additional $1.4 billion in the three     years following the initial capital contributions, of which we     have contributed $128 million as of December 30, 2006. Of the     remaining obligation of $1.3 billion, we contributed $258     million in January 2007. This amount has been included in the     table above under other purchase obligations and     commitments.                  As part of our agreement with Micron related to IMFT, we may     enter into agreements to make additional capital contributions     for new fabrication facilities, and in November 2006, we     announced our intention to form a new venture with Micron to add     an additional NAND flash memory fabrication facility in     Singapore.                  We also have several agreements with Micron related to     intellectual property rights, and research and development     funding related to NAND flash manufacturing and IMFT.       Off-Balance-Sheet     Arrangements         As of December 30, 2006, we did not have any significant     off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii)     of SEC Regulation     S-K.     Employee     Equity Incentive Plans         Our equity incentive programs are broad-based, long-term     retention programs that are intended to attract and retain     talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests.     In May 2006, stockholders approved the 2006 Equity Incentive     Plan (the 2006 Plan). The 2006 Plan replaced the 2004 Equity     Incentive Plan, which was terminated early. Under the 2006 Plan,     175 million shares of common stock were made available for     issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee     directors through June 2008, of which a maximum of 80 million     shares can be awarded as restricted stock or restricted stock     units. Additionally, in May 2006, stockholders approved the 2006     Stock Purchase Plan. Under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan, 240     million shares of common stock were made available for issuance     through August 2011. The 1976 Stock Participation Plan and all     remaining shares available for issuance thereunder were     cancelled as of the plans expiration in August 2006.        42    Table of Contents     MANAGEMENTS     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS (Continued)        Our goal has been to keep the potential incremental dilution     related to our equity incentive plans to a long-term average of     less than 2% annually. The dilution percentage is calculated     using the equity-based awards granted during the period, net of     awards cancelled due to employees leaving the company and     expired stock options, divided by the total outstanding shares     at the beginning of the year. For purposes of this disclosure,     equity-based awards include stock option grants and restricted     stock unit grants, but exclude rights granted under the stock     purchase plan and awards assumed in connection with acquisitions.         Equity-based awards granted to employees, including officers,     and non-employee directors from 2002 through 2006 are summarized     as follows:                                                                           (Shares in Millions)        2006           2005           2004           2003           2002               Total equity-based awards granted                     82                   119                   115                   110                   174          Less: equity-based awards cancelled                     (67       )               (38       )               (32       )               (40       )               (44       )      Net equity-based awards granted                     15                   81                   83                   70                   130          Dilution %net equity-based     awards granted as % of outstanding     shares1                 0.2       %               1.3       %               1.3       %               1.1       %               1.9       %      Equity-based awards granted to     listed     officers2     as % of total equity-based awards granted                     1.6       %               1.4       %               1.1       %               2.4       %               1.7       %      Equity-based awards granted to     listed     officers2     as % of outstanding     shares1                 <0.1       %               <0.1       %               <0.1       %               <0.1       %               <0.1       %      Cumulative equity-based awards     held by listed     officers2     as % of total equity-based awards outstanding                     1.9       %               1.9       %               2.1       %               2.1       %               2.1       %      Share-based     compensation3     recognized for listed     officers2     as a % of total share-based compensation     recognized3                 1.4       %                                                                                              1   Outstanding shares as of the beginning of each period.      2   For all years presented, excluding 2004, listed     officers includes our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief     Financial Officer, and the three other most highly compensated     executive officers serving at the end of the years presented.     For 2004, listed officers also includes an officer     who retired in January 2005.      3   Includes amounts recognized in the financial statements for     stock options and restricted stock units according to the     provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), which was adopted in the first     quarter of 2006.          In accordance with a policy established by the Compensation     Committee of the Board of Directors, total equity-based awards     granted to the listed officers may not exceed 5% of total     equity-based awards granted in any year. During 2006,     equity-based awards granted to listed officers amounted to 1.6%     of the grants made to all employees. All equity-based awards to     executive officers are determined by the Compensation Committee.     All members of the Compensation Committee are independent     directors, as defined in the applicable rules for issuers traded     on The NASDAQ Global Select Market*.         For additional information regarding equity incentive plans and     the activity for the past three years, see Note 3:     Employee Equity Incentive Plans in Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K.     Information regarding our equity incentive plans should be read     in conjunction with the information appearing under the heading     Compensation Discussion and Analysis and     Proposal 3: Approval of Amendment and Extension of the     2006 Equity Incentive Plan in our 2007 Proxy Statement,     which is incorporated by reference into this Form     10-K.     Business     Outlook         Our future results of operations and the other forward-looking     statements contained in this Form     10-K,     including this MD&A, involve a number of risks and     uncertaintiesin particular, the statements regarding our     goals and strategies, new product introductions, plans to     cultivate new businesses, future economic conditions, revenue,     pricing, gross margin and costs, capital spending, depreciation     and amortization, research and development expenses, potential     impairment of investments, the tax rate, and pending tax and     legal proceedings. Our future results of operations may also be     affected by the amount, type, and valuation of the share-based     awards granted as well as the amount of awards cancelled due to     employees leaving the company and the timing of award exercises     by employees. We are in the midst of a structure and efficiency     program which may result in several actions that could have an     impact on expense levels and gross margin. In addition to the     various important factors discussed above, a number of other     important factors could cause actual results to differ     materially from our expectations. See the risks described in     Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form     10-K.        43    Table of Contents     MANAGEMENTS     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS (Continued)        Our financial results are substantially dependent on sales of     microprocessors. Revenue is partly a function of the mix of     types and performance capabilities of microprocessors sold, as     well as the mix of chipsets, flash memory, and other     semiconductor products sold, all of which are difficult to     forecast. Because of the wide price differences among mobile,     desktop, and server microprocessors, the mix of types and     performance levels of microprocessors sold affects the average     selling price that we will realize and has a large impact on our     revenue and gross margin. Revenue is affected by the timing of     new Intel product introductions and the demand for and market     acceptance of our products, as well as actions taken by our     competitors, including new product offerings, marketing     programs, and pricing pressures, and our reaction to such     actions. Microprocessor revenue is also dependent on the     availability of other parts of the platform, including chipsets,     motherboards, operating system software, and application     software. Revenue is also subject to demand fluctuations and the     impact of economic conditions in various geographic regions.         Our gross margin expectation for 2007 is 50% plus or minus a few     points. The 50% midpoint is slightly lower compared to our 2006     gross margin of 51.5%, primarily due to expected higher     start-up     costs for microprocessors and chipsets, partially offset by     lower unit costs on microprocessors. The gross margin percentage     could vary significantly from expectations based on changes in     revenue levels; product mix and pricing; capacity utilization;     changes in unit costs; excess or obsolete inventory;     manufacturing yields; the timing and execution of the     manufacturing ramp and associated costs, including     start-up     costs; and impairments of long-lived assets, including     manufacturing, assembly and test, and intangible assets.         We have continued to expand our semiconductor manufacturing and     assembly and test capacity over the last few years, and we     continue to plan capacity based on our overall strategy and the     acceptance of our products in specific market segments. We     currently expect that capital spending in 2007 will be     approximately $5.5 billion, plus or minus $200 million, compared     to $5.8 billion in 2006. Capital spending is expected to be     lower in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to continued     efficiency efforts, partially offset by higher spending on     capital equipment, related to our next-generation, 45-nanometer     process technology. This capital-spending plan is dependent on     expectations regarding production efficiencies and delivery     times of various machinery and equipment, and construction     schedules. If the demand for our products does not grow and     continue to move toward higher performance products in the     various market segments, revenue and gross margin would be     adversely affected, manufacturing     and/or     assembly and test capacity would be under-utilized, and the rate     of capital spending could be reduced. We could be required to     record an impairment of our manufacturing or assembly and test     equipment     and/or     facilities, or factory planning decisions may cause us to record     accelerated depreciation. In addition, if demand for our     products is reduced or we fail to accurately forecast demand, we     could be required to write down inventory, which would have a     negative impact on our gross margin. However, in the long term,     revenue and gross margin may also be affected if we do not add     capacity fast enough to meet market demand.         Depreciation for 2007 is expected to be approximately $4.8     billion, plus or minus $100 million, compared to $4.7 billion in     2006.         Spending on research and development, plus marketing, general     and administrative expenses (total spending) in 2007 is expected     to be approximately $10.7 billion. The expectation for total     spending in 2007 is significantly lower than our 2006 spending     of $12.0 billion. We continue to focus on controlling our total     spending through cost-saving actions. Expenses, particularly     certain marketing and compensation expenses, vary depending on     the level of demand for our products, the level of revenue and     profits, and impairments of long-lived assets. Research and     development spending in 2007 is expected to be approximately     $5.4 billion.         The tax rate for 2007 is expected to be approximately 30%. The     estimated effective tax rate is based on tax law in effect at     December 30, 2006 and current expected income. The tax rate may     also be affected by the closing of acquisitions or divestitures;     the jurisdiction in which profits are determined to be earned     and taxed; changes in estimates of credits, benefits, and     deductions; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits     with various tax authorities; and the ability to realize     deferred tax assets.         We believe that we have the product offerings, facilities,     personnel, and competitive and financial resources for continued     business success, but future revenue, costs, gross margin, and     profits are all influenced by a number of factors, including     those discussed above, all of which are inherently difficult to     forecast.        44    Table of Contents     MANAGEMENTS     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS (Continued)    Status of     Business Outlook         We expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to     time, meet privately with investors, investment analysts, the     media, and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking     statements contained in the Business Outlook section     and elsewhere in this Form     10-K,     including any such statements that are incorporated by reference     in this Form     10-K. At the     same time, we will keep this Form     10-K and our     most current business outlook publicly available on our Investor     Relations Web site at www.intc.com. The public can     continue to rely on the business outlook published on the Web     site as representing our current expectations on matters     covered, unless we publish a notice stating otherwise. The     statements in the Business Outlook and other     forward-looking statements in this Form     10-K are     subject to revision during the course of the year in our     quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times.         From the close of business on March 2, 2007 until our quarterly     earnings release is published, presently scheduled for April 17,     2007, we will observe a quiet period. During the     quiet period, the Business Outlook and other     forward-looking statements first published in our Form     8-K filed on     January 16, 2007, as reiterated or updated as applicable, in     this Form     10-K, should     be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet     period only and not subject to update. During the quiet period,     our representatives will not comment on the business outlook or     our financial results or expectations. The exact timing and     duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we     utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion.        45    Table of Contents      ITEM     7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET     RISK          We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in     currency exchange rates, interest rates, and marketable equity     security prices. We use derivative financial instruments     primarily to mitigate these risks and as part of our strategic     investment program. All of the potential changes noted below are     based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial     positions at December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005. Actual     results may differ materially.     Currency     Exchange Rates         We generally hedge currency risks of     non-U.S.-dollar-denominated     investments in debt securities with offsetting currency     borrowings, currency forward contracts, or currency interest     rate swaps. Gains and losses on these     non-U.S.-currency     investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses     and gains on the related hedging instruments, resulting in     negligible net exposure.         A substantial majority of our revenue, expense, and capital     purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However,     we do incur certain operating costs in other currencies. To     protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future     cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates, we have     established balance sheet and forecasted transaction risk     management programs. Currency forward contracts and currency     options are generally utilized in these hedging programs. Our     hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate,     the impact of currency exchange rate movements. We considered     the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined     that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange     rates of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near     term. Such adverse changes, after taking into account hedges and     offsetting positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact     on income before taxes of less than $30 million at the end of     2006 and 2005.     Interest     Rates         The primary objective of our investments in debt securities is     to preserve principal while maximizing yields. To achieve this     objective, the returns on our investments in fixed-rate debt are     generally based on the three-month LIBOR, or, if longer term,     are generally swapped into U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR-based     returns. In addition to fixed-rate debt investments, in 2005 we     issued debt. See Note 6: Borrowings in Part II, Item     8 of this Form     10-K for     additional information. We considered the historical volatility     of the interest rates experienced in prior years and the     duration of our investment portfolio and debt issuances, and     determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse     change of 80 basis points (0.80%), approximately 15% of the rate     at December 30, 2006 (18% of the rate at December 31, 2005),     could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 0.80%     decrease in interest rates, after taking into account hedges and     offsetting positions, would have resulted in a decrease in the     fair value of our net investment position of approximately $50     million as of December 30, 2006 and $10 million as of December     31, 2005. The increase in exposure to an adverse fair value     change from December 31, 2005 to December 30, 2006 was primarily     driven by a decrease in the price of our common stock, which     increased the sensitivity of the fair value of our convertible     debt to adverse changes in interest rates.     Equity     Security Prices         We have a portfolio of strategic equity investments that     includes marketable strategic equity securities and derivative     equity instruments such as warrants and options, as well as     non-marketable equity investments. We invest in companies that     develop software, hardware, or services supporting our     technologies. Our current investment focus areas include helping     to enable mobile wireless devices, advance the digital home,     provide access to premium digital content, enhance the digital     enterprise, advance high-performance communications     infrastructures, and develop the next generation of silicon     production technologies. Our focus areas tend to develop and     change over time due to rapid advancements in technology.         Our total marketable portfolio includes marketable strategic     equity securities as well as marketable equity securities     classified as trading assets. To the extent that our marketable     portfolio of investments continues to have strategic value, we     typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market     exposure. For securities that we no longer consider strategic,     we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors in our decision     on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and     appropriate to hedge the equity market risk. We may or may not     enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the market risks     of our investments in strategic equity derivatives, including     warrants.         The marketable equity securities included in trading assets, as     well as certain equity derivatives, are held to generate returns     that generally offset changes in liabilities related to the     equity market risk of certain deferred compensation     arrangements. The gains and losses from changes in fair value of     these equity securities are generally offset by the gains and     losses on the related liabilities, resulting in a net exposure     of less than $10 million as of both December 30, 2006 and     December 31, 2005, assuming a reasonably possible decline in     market prices of approximately 10% in the near term.        46    Table of Contents       As of December 30, 2006, the fair value of our portfolio of     marketable strategic equity investments and equity derivative     instruments, including hedging positions, was $427 million     ($574 million as of December 31, 2005). To assess the     market price sensitivity of these equity securities, we analyzed     the historical movements over the past several years of     high-technology stock indices that we considered appropriate.     However, our marketable strategic equity portfolio is     substantially concentrated in one company as of     December 30, 2006, which will affect the portfolios     price volatility. We currently have an investment in Micron with     a fair value of $236 million at December 30, 2006, or     55% of the total marketable strategic equity portfolio value     including equity derivative instruments. During 2006, we sold a     portion of our investment in Micron. Based on the analysis of     the high-technology stock indices and the historical volatility     of Microns stock, we estimated that it was reasonably     possible that the prices of the stocks in our marketable     strategic equity portfolio could experience a loss of 30% in the     near term (40% as of December 31, 2005). This estimate is not     necessarily indicative of future performance, and actual results     may differ materially.         Assuming a loss of 30% in market prices, and after reflecting     the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, our marketable     strategic equity portfolio could decrease in value by     approximately $134 million, based on the value of the portfolio     as of December 30, 2006 (a decrease in value of approximately     $245 million, based on the value of the portfolio as of December     31, 2005 using an assumed loss of 40%).         Our strategic investments in non-marketable equity securities     are affected by many of the same factors that could result in an     adverse movement of equity market prices, although the impact     cannot be directly quantified. Such a movement and the     underlying economic conditions would negatively affect the     prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise     additional capital, and the likelihood of our being able to     realize our investments through liquidity events such as initial     public offerings, mergers, or private sales. These types of     investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no     assurance that any specific company will grow or become     successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our     investment. At December 30, 2006, our strategic investments in     non-marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of $2.8     billion ($561 million as of December 31, 2005). The carrying     amount of these investments approximated fair value as of     December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005. As of December 30,     2006, our non-marketable equity securities portfolio was     concentrated in two companies: IMFT and Clearwire. IMFT is a     manufacturer of NAND flash memory, with a carrying amount of     $1.3 billion, or 46% of the total value of the non-marketable     equity securities portfolio at December 30, 2006. See Note     17: Venture in Part II, Item 8 of this Form     10-K. The     terms of our investment in IMFT contain contractual conditions     that restrict our ability to sell the investment. Clearwire     builds and operates next-generation wireless broadband networks.

1:     Basis of Presentation         Intel Corporation has a 52- or     53-week     fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal     year 2006, a     52-week     year, ended on December 30, 2006. Fiscal year 2005, a     53-week     year, ended on December 31, 2005. Fiscal year 2004 was a     52-week year     that ended on December 25, 2004. The next     53-week year     will end on December 31, 2011.         The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of     Intel and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts     and transactions have been eliminated. The company uses the     equity method to account for equity investments in instances in     which the company owns common stock or similar interests (as     described by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue     No. 02-14, Whether an Investor Should Apply the     Equity Method of Accounting to Investments Other Than Common     Stock) and has the ability to exercise significant     influence, but not control, over the investee.         The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for Intel and its     significant subsidiaries; therefore, there is no translation     adjustment recorded through accumulated other comprehensive     income (loss). Monetary accounts denominated in     non-U.S.     currencies, such as cash or payables to vendors, have been     remeasured to the U.S. dollar.     Note 2:     Accounting Policies     Use of     Estimates         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.     generally accepted accounting principles requires management to     make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in     the financial statements and accompanying notes. The accounting     estimates that require managements most significant,     difficult, and subjective judgments include the valuation of     non-marketable equity securities; the recognition and     measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and     liabilities; the assessment of recoverability of long-lived     assets; the valuation of inventory; and the valuation and     recognition of share-based compensation. The actual results     experienced by the company may differ from managements     estimates. Certain amounts reported in previous periods have     been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.     Cash     and Cash Equivalents         The company considers all highly liquid debt securities with     insignificant interest rate risk and with original maturities     from the date of purchase of approximately three months or less     as cash and cash equivalents.     Trading     Assets         Investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair     value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value     recognized currently in earnings. The companys trading     asset investments include:                   Marketable debt securities when the interest rate or     foreign exchange rate risk is hedged at inception by a related     derivative. The gains or losses of these investments arising     from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency     market fluctuations, offset by losses or gains on the related     derivative instruments, are included in interest and other, net.              Equity securities offsetting deferred compensation when     the investments seek to offset changes in liabilities related to     equity and other market risks of certain deferred compensation     arrangements. The gains or losses from changes in fair value of     these equity securities are offset by losses or gains on the     related liabilities and are included in interest and other, net.              Marketable equity securities when the company deems the     investments not to be strategic in nature at the time of     original classification, and has the ability and intent to     mitigate equity market risk through the sale or the use of     derivative instruments. For these marketable equity securities,     gains or losses from changes in fair value, primarily offset by     losses or gains on related derivative instruments, are included     in gains (losses) on equity securities, net.          53    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)        Debt     Instrument Investments         Debt instruments with original maturities at the date of     purchase greater than approximately three months and remaining     maturities less than one year are classified as short-term     investments. Debt instruments with remaining maturities greater     than one year are classified as other long-term investments.     Available-for-Sale     Investments         Investments designated as     available-for-sale     are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses,     net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income     (loss). The cost of securities sold is based on the specific     identification method. The companys     available-for-sale     investments include:                   Marketable debt securities when the interest rate and     foreign currency risks are not hedged at inception of the     investment. These debt securities are held to generate a return     commensurate with three-month LIBOR. The interest income and     realized gains and losses on the sale of these securities are     recorded in interest and other, net.              Marketable equity securities when the investments are     considered strategic in nature at the time of original     classification. The company acquires these equity investments     for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. To the     extent that these investments continue to have strategic value,     the company typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate     the inherent equity market risks through hedging activities. The     realized gains or losses on the sale or exchange of marketable     equity securities are recorded in gains (losses) on equity     securities, net.       Non-Marketable     Investments         Non-marketable equity securities are accounted for at historical     cost or, if Intel has the ability to exercise significant     influence, but not control, over the investee, using the equity     method of accounting. Intels proportionate share of     investee income or loss are accounted for under the equity     method. Other equity method adjustments, as well as gains or     losses on the sale or exchange of these investments, are     recorded in interest and other, net. Gains or losses on the sale     or exchange of non-marketable equity securities, which are not     subject to the equity method of accounting, are recorded in     gains (losses) on equity securities, net. Non-marketable equity     securities are included in other long-term assets. Certain other     non-marketable investments, such as cost basis loan     participation notes, are accounted for at amortized cost and are     classified as short-term investments and other long-term     investments.     Other-Than-Temporary     Impairment         All of the companys     available-for-sale     investments, non-marketable equity securities, and other     investments are subject to a periodic impairment review.     Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair     value is judged to be     other-than-temporary,     for the following investments:                   Marketable equity securities when the resulting fair     value is significantly below cost basis     and/or has     lasted for an extended period of time. The evaluation that Intel     uses to determine whether a marketable equity security is     impaired is based on the specific facts and circumstances     present at the time of assessment, which include the     consideration of general market conditions, the duration and     extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and the     companys intent and ability to hold the investment for a     sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in value. The     company also considers specific adverse conditions related to     the financial health of and business outlook for the investee,     including industry and sector performance, changes in     technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and     changes in the investees credit rating.              Non-marketable investments when events or circumstances     are identified that would likely have a significant adverse     effect on the fair value of the investment. The indicators that     Intel uses to identify those events and circumstances include     (a) the investees revenue and earning trends relative to     predefined milestones and overall business prospects; (b) the     technological feasibility of the investees products and     technologies; (c) the general market conditions in the     investees industry or geographic area, including adverse     regulatory or economic changes; (d) factors related to the     investees ability to remain in business, such as the     investees liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which     the investee is using its cash; and (e) the investees     receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. If an     investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than     Intels carrying amount or a new round of equity funding is     required to stay in operation, and the new round of equity does     not appear imminent, it is presumed that the investment is other     than temporarily impaired, unless specific facts and     circumstances indicate otherwise.          54    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                      Marketable debt securities when a significant decline in     the issuers credit quality is likely to have a significant     adverse effect on the fair value of the investment.           Investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are     subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is     other than temporarily impaired, in which case the investment is     written down to its impaired value and a new cost basis is     established. For investments in non-marketable equity securities     that are not considered viable from a financial or technological     point of view, the entire investment is written down, since the     estimated fair value is considered to be nominal. Impairment     charges are recorded in gains (losses) on equity securities, net     for equity investments or in interest and other, net for debt     security investments.     Fair     Values of Financial Instruments         The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value     due to the short period of time to maturity. Fair values of     short-term investments, trading assets, long-term investments,     marketable strategic equity securities, certain non-marketable     investments, short-term debt, long-term debt, swaps, currency     forward contracts, currency options, equity options, and     warrants are based on quoted market prices or pricing models     using current market data when available. Debt securities are     generally valued using discounted cash flows in a yield-curve     model based on LIBOR. Equity options and warrants are priced     using option pricing models. The companys financial     instruments are recorded at fair value or amounts that     approximate fair value except for cost basis loan participation     notes and debt. Estimated fair values are managements     estimates; however, when there is no readily available market     data, the estimated fair values may not necessarily represent     the amounts that could be realized in a current transaction, and     these fair values could change significantly.         For certain non-marketable investments, such as non-marketable     equity securities, management believes that the carrying value     of the portfolio approximated the fair value at December 30,     2006 and December 31, 2005. For the companys cost basis     loan participation notes, the fair value exceeds the carrying     value by approximately $55 million as of December 30,     2006. Management believes that the carrying value of the cost     basis loan participation notes approximated fair value as of     December 31, 2005. These fair value estimates take into     account the movements of the equity and venture capital markets     as well as changes in the interest rate environment, and other     economic variables.         The carrying value of the companys long-term debt was $1.8     billion, and management believes that the fair value was     approximately $1.7 billion as of December 30, 2006.     Management believes that the carrying value of the     companys long-term debt approximated fair value as of     December 31, 2005. These fair value estimates take into     consideration credit rating changes, equity price movements,     interest rate changes, and other economic variables.     Derivative     Financial Instruments         The companys primary objective for holding derivative     financial instruments is to manage currency, interest rate, and     certain equity market risks. The companys derivative     financial instruments are recorded at fair value and are     included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other     accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities. Derivative     instruments recorded as assets totaled $117 million at     December 30, 2006 ($87 million at December 31, 2005).     Derivative instruments recorded as liabilities totaled     $62 million at December 30, 2006 ($65 million at     December 31, 2005). The companys accounting policies     for these instruments are based on whether they meet the     criteria for designation as cash flow or fair value hedges. A     hedge of the exposure to variability in the future cash flows of     an asset or a liability, or of a forecasted transaction, is     referred to as a cash flow hedge. A designated hedge of the     exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or a liability, or     of an unrecognized firm commitment, is referred to as a fair     value hedge. The criteria for designating a derivative as a     hedge include the assessment of the instruments     effectiveness in risk reduction, matching of the derivative     instrument to its underlying transaction, and the probability of     occurrence of the underlying transaction. Gains and losses from     changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as     hedges for accounting purposes are recognized within the same     line item on the consolidated statements of income as the     underlying item, and generally offset changes in fair values of     related assets or liabilities.         As part of its strategic investment program, the company also     acquires equity derivative instruments, such as warrants and     equity conversion rights associated with debt instruments, which     are not designated as hedging instruments. The gains or losses     from changes in fair values of these equity instrument     derivatives are recognized in gains (losses) on equity     securities, net.        55    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)          Through the use of derivative financial instruments, the company     manages the following risks:     Currency     Risk         The company transacts business in various currencies other than     the U.S. dollar and has established balance sheet and     forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect     against fluctuations in fair value and volatility of future cash     flows caused by changes in exchange rates. The forecasted     transaction risk management program includes anticipated     transactions such as operating costs and capital purchases.     These programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the     impact of currency exchange movements. The companys     currency risk management programs include:                   Currency derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting     designation which utilize currency forward contracts and     currency options to hedge exposures to the variability in the     U.S.-dollar     equivalent of anticipated     non-U.S.-dollar-denominated     cash flows. The maturity of these instruments will generally     occur within 12 months. For these derivatives, the after-tax     gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge is reported     as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)     in stockholders equity and is reclassified into earnings     in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction     affects earnings, and within the same line item on the     consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged     transaction.              Currency derivatives with fair value hedge accounting     designation which utilize currency forward contracts and     currency options to hedge the fair value exposure of recognized     foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities, or     previously unrecognized firm commitments. For fair value hedges,     gains or losses are recognized in earnings to offset fair value     changes in the hedged transaction. As of December 30, 2006 and     December 31, 2005, the company did not have any derivatives     designated as foreign currency fair value hedges.              Currency derivatives without hedge accounting designation     which utilize currency forward contracts or currency     interest rate swaps to economically hedge the functional     currency equivalent cash flows of recognized monetary assets,     including     non-U.S.-dollar-denominated     debt securities and recognized monetary assets and liabilities.     The maturity of these instruments will generally occur within 12     months, except for derivatives associated with certain long-term     equity-related investments that will generally mature within     five years. Changes in the     U.S.-dollar     equivalent cash flows of the underlying assets and liabilities     are approximately offset by the changes in fair values of the     related derivatives. Net gains or losses are recorded within the     line item on the consolidated statements of income that is most     closely associated with the economic underlying, primarily in     interest and other, net, except for equity-related gains or     losses, which are primarily recorded in gains (losses) on equity     securities, net.       Interest     Rate Risk         The companys primary objective for holding investments in     debt securities is to preserve principal while maximizing     yields. The returns on the companys investments in     fixed-rate debt securities with durations longer than three     months are generally swapped into U.S. dollar three-month     LIBOR-based returns. The companys interest rate risk     management programs include:                   Interest rate derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting     designation which utilize interest rate swap agreements to     modify the interest characteristics of some of the     companys investments. For these derivatives, the after-tax     gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge is reported     as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)     and is reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods     in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and within the     same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the     impact of the hedged transaction.              Interest rate derivatives with fair value hedge accounting     designation which utilize interest rate swap agreements to     hedge the fair values of debt instruments. The gains or losses     from the changes in fair value of these instruments, as well as     the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged long-term     debt, are recognized in interest expense. At December 30, 2006     and December 31, 2005, the company did not have any interest     rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges.              Interest rate derivatives without hedge accounting     designation which utilize interest rate swaps and currency     interest rate swaps in economic hedging transactions, including     hedges of     non-U.S.-dollar-denominated     debt securities classified as trading assets. The floating     interest rates on the swaps are reset on a monthly, quarterly,     or semiannual basis. Changes in fair value of the debt     securities classified as trading assets are generally offset by     changes in fair value of the related derivatives, resulting in a     negligible net impact that is recorded in interest and other,     net.          56    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)      Equity     Market Risk         The company may elect to mitigate equity risk using the     following equity market risk management programs:                   Equity derivatives with hedge accounting designation     which utilize equity options, swaps, or forward contracts to     hedge the equity market risk of marketable equity securities,     when these investments are not considered to have strategic     value. These derivatives are generally designated as fair value     hedges. The gains or losses from the change in fair value of     these equity derivatives, as well as the offsetting change in     the fair value of the underlying hedged equity securities, are     recognized currently in gains (losses) on equity securities,     net. As of December 30, 2006, the company did not have any     equity derivatives designated as fair value hedges.              Equity derivatives without hedge accounting designation     which utilize equity derivatives, such as warrants, options,     or other equity derivatives. Changes in the fair value of such     derivatives are recognized in gains (losses) on equity     securities, net. Certain equity securities within the trading     asset portfolio are maintained to generate returns that seek to     offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risk     of certain deferred compensation arrangements, and gains and     losses are recorded in interest and other, net.       Measurement     of Effectiveness                   Effectiveness for forwards is generally measured by     comparing the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedge     contract with the cumulative change in the present value of the     forecasted cash flows of the hedged item. For currency forward     contracts used in cash flow hedging strategies related to     long-term capital purchases, forward points are excluded and     effectiveness is measured using spot rates to value both the     hedge contract and the hedged item.              Effectiveness for currency options and equity options with     hedge accounting designation is generally measured by     comparing the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedge     contract with the cumulative change in the fair value of an     option instrument representing the hedged risks in the hedged     item for cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, time value is     excluded and effectiveness is measured based on spot rates to     value both the hedge contract and the hedged item.              Effectiveness for interest rate swaps is generally     measured by comparing the change in fair value of the hedged     item with the change in fair value of the interest rate swap.           Any ineffective portion of the hedges, as well as amounts     excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, are recognized     currently in earnings in interest and other, net.         If a cash flow hedge were discontinued because it was no longer     probable that the original hedged transaction would occur as     anticipated, the unrealized gain or loss on the related     derivative would be reclassified into earnings. Subsequent gains     or losses on the related derivative instrument would be     recognized in income in each period until the instrument     matures, is terminated, is re-designated as a qualified hedge,     or is sold. For all periods presented, the portion of hedging     instruments gains or losses excluded from the assessment     of effectiveness and the ineffective portions of hedges had an     insignificant impact on earnings for both cash flow and fair     value hedges.     Securities     Lending         From time to time, the company enters into securities lending     agreements with financial institutions, generally to facilitate     hedging and certain investment transactions. Selected securities     may be loaned, secured by collateral in the form of cash or     securities. The loaned securities continue to be carried as     investment assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Cash     collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding     liability. For lending agreements collateralized by securities,     the collateral is not recorded as an asset or a liability,     unless the collateral is repledged.        57    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)      Inventories         Inventory cost is computed on a currently adjusted standard     basis (which approximates actual cost on an average or     first-in,     first-out basis). The valuation of inventory requires the     company to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as     inventory that is not of saleable quality. The determination of     obsolete or excess inventory requires the company to estimate     the future demand for its products. Inventory in excess of     saleable amounts is not valued, and the remaining inventory is     valued at the lower of cost or market. During the second quarter     of 2006, the company completed a demand forecast accuracy     analysis. As a result, the demand horizon now includes     additional weeks of the demand forecast period for certain     products, compared to prior years, and continues to include a     review of product-specific facts and circumstances. This change     did not have a significant impact on gross margin in 2006.     Inventories at fiscal year-ends were as follows:                                       (In Millions)        2006           2005               Raw materials                 $       608               $       409          Work in process                     2,044                   1,662          Finished goods                     1,662                   1,055                                                Total inventories        $   4,314           $   3,126                                                    Property,     Plant and Equipment         Property, plant and equipment, net at fiscal year-ends was as     follows:                                       (In Millions)        2006           2005               Land and buildings                 $       14,544               $       13,938          Machinery and equipment                     29,829                   27,297          Construction in progress                     2,711                   2,897                                                           47,084               44,132          Less: accumulated depreciation                     (29,482       )               (27,021       )                                            Total property, plant and     equipment, net        $   17,602           $   17,111                                                        Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is     computed for financial reporting purposes principally using the     straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:     machinery and equipment, 2 to 4 years; buildings, 4 to 40 years.     Reviews are regularly performed if facts and circumstances exist     that indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be     recoverable or that the useful life is shorter than originally     estimated. The company assesses the recoverability of its assets     held for use by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash     flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over     their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts.     Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying     amount over the fair value of those assets. If assets are     determined to be recoverable, but the useful lives are shorter     than originally estimated, the net book value of the assets is     depreciated over the newly determined remaining useful lives.     See Note 11: Restructuring and Asset Impairment     Charges for further discussion of asset impairment charges     recorded in 2006.         Property, plant and equipment is identified as held for sale     when it meets the held for sale criteria of Statement of     Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting     for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. The     company ceases recording depreciation on assets that are     classified as held for sale.         The company capitalizes interest on borrowings during the active     construction period of major capital projects. Capitalized     interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and is     amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets.        58    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)      Goodwill         Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of an acquisition     exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible     and intangible assets acquired. The company performs an annual     impairment review for each reporting unit using a fair value     approach. Reporting units may be operating segments as a whole     or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred     to as a component. In determining the carrying value of the     reporting unit, an allocation of the companys     manufacturing and assembly and test assets must be made because     of the interchangeable nature of the companys     manufacturing and assembly and test capacity. This allocation is     based on each reporting units relative percentage     utilization of the manufacturing and assembly and test assets.     For further discussion of goodwill, see Note 15:     Goodwill.     Identified     Intangible Assets         Intellectual property assets primarily represent rights acquired     under technology licenses and are generally amortized on a     straight-line basis over periods ranging from 2 to 17 years.     Acquisition-related developed technology is amortized on a     straight-line basis over periods ranging from 4 to 6 years.     Other intangible assets include acquisition-related customer     lists and     workforce-in-place,     which are amortized on a straight-line basis, and customer     supply agreements, which are amortized based on product volume.     Other intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from     2 to 6 years. All identified intangible assets are classified     within other long-term assets on the consolidated balance     sheets. In the quarter following the period in which identified     intangible assets become fully amortized, the fully amortized     balances are removed from the gross asset and accumulated     amortization amounts. For further discussion of identified     intangible assets, see Note 16: Identified Intangible     Assets.         The company performs a quarterly review of its identified     intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances exist     which indicate that the useful life is shorter than originally     estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be     recoverable. If such facts and circumstances do exist, the     company assesses the recoverability of identified intangible     assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows     associated with the related asset or group of assets over their     remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts.     Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying     amount over the fair value of those assets.     Product     Warranty         The company generally sells products with a limited warranty of     product quality and a limited indemnification of customers     against intellectual property infringement claims related to the     companys products. The company accrues for known warranty     and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be     reasonably estimated, and accrues for estimated incurred but     unidentified issues based on historical activity. The accrual     and the related expense for known issues were not significant     during the periods presented. Due to product testing and the     short time typically between product shipment and the detection     and correction of product failures, and considering the     historical rate of payments on indemnification claims, the     accrual and related expense for estimated incurred but     unidentified issues were not significant during the periods     presented.     Revenue     Recognition         The company recognizes net revenue when the earnings process is     complete, as evidenced by an agreement with the customer,     transfer of title, and acceptance, if applicable, as well as     fixed pricing and probable collectibility. Pricing allowances,     including discounts based on contractual arrangements with     customers, are recorded when revenue is recognized as a     reduction to both accounts receivable and revenue. Because of     frequent sales price reductions and rapid technology     obsolescence in the industry, sales made to distributors under     agreements allowing price protection     and/or right     of return are deferred until the distributors sell the     merchandise. Shipping charges billed to customers are included     in net revenue, and the related shipping costs are included in     cost of sales.        59    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)      Advertising         Cooperative advertising programs reimburse customers for     marketing activities for certain of the companys products,     subject to defined criteria. Cooperative advertising obligations     are accrued and the costs are recorded at the same time the     related revenue is recognized. Cooperative advertising costs are     recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the     extent that an advertising benefit separate from the revenue     transaction can be identified and the cash paid does not exceed     the fair value of that advertising benefit received. Any excess     of cash paid over the fair value of the advertising benefit     received is recorded as a reduction in revenue. All other     advertising costs are recorded as marketing, general and     administrative expense as incurred. Advertising expense was $2.3     billion in 2006 ($2.6 billion in 2005 and $2.1 billion in 2004).     Employee     Equity Incentive Plans         The company has employee equity incentive plans, which are     described more fully in Note 3: Employee Equity Incentive     Plans. Effective January 1, 2006, the company adopted the     provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based     Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)). SFAS No. 123(R) requires     employee equity awards to be accounted for under the fair value     method. Accordingly, share-based compensation is measured at the     grant date, based on the fair value of the award. Prior to     January 1, 2006, the company accounted for awards granted under     its equity incentive plans using the intrinsic value method     prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,     Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No.     25), and related interpretations, and provided the required pro     forma disclosures prescribed by SFAS No. 123, Accounting     for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123), as amended.     The exercise price of options is equal to the market price of     Intel common stock (defined as the average of the high and low     trading prices reported by The NASDAQ Global Select Market*) on     the date of grant. Additionally, the stock purchase plan was     deemed non-compensatory under APB No. 25. Accordingly, no     share-based compensation, other than insignificant amounts of     acquisition-related compensation, was recognized on the     consolidated financial statements prior to 2006.         Under the modified prospective method of adoption for SFAS No.     123(R), the compensation cost recognized by the company     beginning in 2006 includes (a) compensation cost for all equity     incentive awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of     January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in     accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (b)     compensation cost for all equity incentive awards granted     subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair     value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.     123(R). The company uses the straight-line attribution method to     recognize share-based compensation costs over the service period     of the award. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or     expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of     restricted stock units, deferred tax assets for options and     restricted stock units with multiple vesting dates are     eliminated for each vesting period on a     first-in,     first-out basis as if each vesting period was a separate award.     To calculate the excess tax benefits available as of the date of     adoption for use in offsetting future tax shortfalls, the     company followed the alternative transition method discussed in     Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position No.     123(R)-3.     Recent     Accounting Pronouncements         In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair     Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). The purpose of SFAS No.     157 is to define fair value, establish a framework for measuring     fair value, and enhance disclosures about fair value     measurements. The measurement and disclosure requirements are     effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of     fiscal year 2008. The company is currently evaluating the impact     that SFAS No. 157 will have on its consolidated financial     statements.         In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The     Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial     Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits     companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and     certain other items at fair value. The standard requires that     unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value     option has been elected be reported in earnings. SFAS     No. 159 is effective for the company beginning in the first     quarter of fiscal year 2008, although earlier adoption is     permitted. The company is currently evaluating the impact that     SFAS No. 159 will have on its consolidated financial     statements.        60    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)            In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,     Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan     interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). The     interpretation contains a two-step approach to recognizing and     measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance     with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The     first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by     determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that     it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained     on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation     processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit     as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being     realized upon ultimate settlement. The company is still     assessing the impacts of the adoption of FIN 48. Based on a     preliminary analysis, management believes that adoption will     result in recording an increase to retained earnings of between     $150 million and $300 million in the first quarter of     2007. However, the final analysis will be completed in the first     quarter of 2007.         In June 2006, the FASB ratified the EITF consensus on EITF Issue     No. 06-2,     Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits     Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43 (EITF     06-2). EITF     06-2     requires companies to accrue the cost of such compensated     absences over the requisite service period. The company     currently accrues the cost of compensated absences for     sabbatical programs when the eligible employee completes the     requisite service period, which is seven years of service. The     company is required to apply the provisions of EITF     06-2 at the     beginning of fiscal year 2007. EITF     06-2 allows     for adoption through retrospective application to all prior     periods or through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained     earnings. The company intends to adopt     EITF 06-2     through a cumulative-effect adjustment and estimates that the     adoption will result in an additional liability of approximately     $275 million and a reduction to retained earnings of     approximately $175 million in the first quarter of 2007.     Note 3:     Employee Equity Incentive Plans         In May 2006, stockholders approved the 2006 Equity Incentive     Plan (the 2006 Plan). Under the 2006 Plan, 175 million     shares of common stock were made available for issuance as     equity awards to employees and non-employee directors through     June 2008, of which a maximum of 80 million shares can be     awarded as non-vested shares (restricted stock) or non-vested     share units (restricted stock units). The 2006 Plan allows for     time-based, performance-based, and market-based vesting for     equity incentive awards. The 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the     2004 Plan) was terminated upon stockholder approval of the 2006     Plan. Shares previously authorized for issuance under the 2004     Plan are no longer available for future grants, although options     previously granted under the 2004 Plan remain outstanding. As of     December 30, 2006, 162 million shares remain available for     future grant under the 2006 Plan. Intel may assume the equity     incentive plans and the outstanding equity awards of certain     acquired companies. Once assumed, Intel does not grant     additional stock under these plans.         The company began issuing restricted stock units in the second     quarter of 2006. Shares are issued on the date the restricted     stock units vest. The majority of shares issued are net of the     statutory withholding requirements that are paid by Intel on     behalf of its employees. As a result, the actual number of     shares issued will be less than the number of restricted stock     units granted. Prior to vesting, restricted stock units do not     have dividend equivalent rights, do not have voting rights, and     the shares underlying the restricted stock units are not     considered issued and outstanding.         Awards granted to employees in 2006 under the companys     equity incentive plans generally vest over 4 years and expire 7     years from the date of grant. Awards granted to key officers,     senior-level employees, and key employees may have delayed     vesting beginning 3 to 6 years from the date of grant and     expire 7 to 10 years from the date of grant.         In May 2006, stockholders approved the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan     under which eligible employees may purchase shares of     Intels common stock at 85% of the market price at     specific, predetermined dates. Under the 2006 Stock Purchase     Plan, 240 million shares of common stock were made available for     issuance through August 2011. The 1976 Stock Participation Plan     and all remaining shares available for issuance thereunder were     cancelled as of the plans expiration in August 2006.        61    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)        Share-Based     Compensation         Effective January 1, 2006, the company adopted the provisions of     SFAS No. 123(R), as discussed in Note 2: Accounting     Policies. The following table summarizes the effects of     share-based compensation resulting from the application of SFAS     No. 123(R):                                                   (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)        2006           2005           2004               Cost of sales                 $       349               $                      $                 Research and development                     487                                                Marketing, general and     administrative                     539                                                                                                      Share-based compensation     effects in income before taxes            1,375                                                Income taxes                     (388       )                                                                                                  Net share-based compensation     effects in net income        $   987           $              $                                                                   Share-based compensation     effects on basic earnings per common share        $   0.17           $              $                                                                   Share-based compensation     effects on diluted earnings per common share        $   0.17           $              $                                                                   Share-based compensation     effects on cash flow from operations        $   (123   )       $              $                                                                   Share-based compensation     effects on cash flow from financing activities        $   123           $              $                                                                           In accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), the company adjusts     share-based compensation on a quarterly basis for changes to the     estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on a review     of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee     turnover. The effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all     expense amortization after January 1, 2006 is recognized in the     period the forfeiture estimate is changed. The effect of     forfeiture adjustments in 2006 was insignificant.         The total share-based compensation cost capitalized as part of     inventory as of December 30, 2006 was $72 million. The amount     that the company would have capitalized to inventory as of     December 31, 2005, if it had applied the provisions of SFAS No.     123(R) retrospectively, was $66 million.

In 2005, the company reevaluated the assumptions used to     estimate the value of options granted under the companys     equity incentive plans and rights to acquire stock granted under     the companys stock purchase plan. Beginning in 2005, the     company based the expected volatility on implied volatility, as     management determined that implied volatility is more reflective     of market conditions and a better indicator of expected     volatility than historical volatility. Additionally, beginning     in 2005, the company based the expected life of options granted     on the simplified calculation of expected life, described in the     U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting     Bulletin 107, due to changes in the vesting terms and     contractual life of current option grants compared to the     companys historical grants. No adjustments to the 2004     input assumptions were made.         Share-based compensation related to restricted stock unit awards     is calculated based on the market price of Intel common stock on     the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends     expected to be paid on Intel common stock prior to vesting of     the restricted stock unit. The weighted average estimated values     of restricted stock unit grants, as well as the weighted average     assumptions that were used in calculating the fair value during     2006, were based on estimates at the date of grant, as follows:                                  2006               Estimated values                 $       18.70          Risk-free interest rate                     4.9       %      Dividend yield                     2.0       %          Stock     Option Awards         Options outstanding that have vested and are expected to vest as     of December 30, 2006 are as follows:                                                                                              Weighted                                                      Average                                          Weighted            Remaining                              Number of            Average            Contractual            Aggregate Intrinsic                  Shares            Exercise            Term            Value1                  (In Millions)           Price           (In Years)           (In Millions)               Vested                     567.6               $       28.66                   4.0               $       272          Expected to vest                     248.4               $       23.50                   5.9                   90                                                                                Total            816.0           $   27.09               4.5           $   362                      1   These amounts represent the difference between the exercise     price and $20.25, the closing price of Intel stock on December     29, 2006, as reported on The NASDAQ Global Select Market*, for     all     in-the-money     options outstanding.         63    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)            Options outstanding that are expected to vest are net of     estimated future option forfeitures in accordance with the     provisions of SFAS No. 123(R).

The first purchase     under the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan occurred in the first quarter     of 2007. As of December 30, 2006, there was $19 million of     unrecognized compensation costs related to rights to acquire     stock under the companys stock purchase plan. The     unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over     a weighted average period of one month.     Note 4:     Earnings Per Share         The computation of the companys basic and diluted earnings     per common share is as follows:                                                   (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)        2006           2005           2004               Net income        $   5,044           $   8,664           $   7,516          Weighted average common shares     outstanding            5,797               6,106               6,400          Dilutive effect of employee equity     incentive plans                     32                   70                   94          Dilutive effect of convertible debt                     51                   2                                                                                   Weighted average common shares     outstanding, assuming dilution            5,880               6,178               6,494                                                                Basic earnings per common     share        $   0.87           $   1.42           $   1.17                                                                Diluted earnings per common     share        $   0.86           $   1.40           $   1.16                                                                        Basic earnings per common share is computed using net income and     the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during     the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed using     net income and the weighted average number of common shares     outstanding, assuming dilution. Weighted average common shares     outstanding, assuming dilution includes potentially dilutive     common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially     dilutive common shares include the assumed exercise of stock     options, assumed vesting of restricted stock units, and assumed     issuance of stock under the stock purchase plan using the     treasury stock method, as well as the assumed conversion of debt     using the if-converted method.        65    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)            For 2006, 693 million of the companys outstanding stock     options (372 million in 2005 and 357 million in 2004) were     excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common     share because the exercise prices of these stock options were     greater than or equal to the average market value of the common     shares. These options could be included in the calculation in     the future if the average market value of the common shares     increases and is greater than the exercise price of these     options.     Note 5:     Common Stock Repurchase Program         The company has an ongoing authorization, as amended in November     2005, from the Board of Directors to repurchase up to     $25 billion in shares of Intels common stock in open     market or negotiated transactions. During 2006, the company     repurchased 226 million shares of common stock at a cost of $4.6     billion (418 million shares at a cost of $10.6 billion during     2005 and 301 million shares at a cost of $7.5 billion     during 2004). Since the program began in 1990, the company has     repurchased and retired 2.8 billion shares at a cost of     approximately $57 billion. As of December 30, 2006, $17.3     billion remained available for repurchase under the existing     repurchase authorization.     Note 6:     Borrowings     Short-Term     Debt         Short-term debt included non-interest-bearing drafts payable of     $178 million and the current portion of long-term debt of $2     million as of December 30, 2006 (drafts payable of $295 million     and the current portion of long-term debt of $18 million as of     December 31, 2005). The company also has the ability to borrow     under the companys commercial paper program, which has a     pre-authorized limit of $3.0 billion. During 2006, there     were no borrowings under the companys commercial paper     program, and maximum borrowings reached $150 million during     2005. No commercial paper was outstanding as of December 30,     2006 or December 31, 2005. The companys commercial paper     was rated     A-1+ by     Standard & Poors and     P-1 by     Moodys at December 30, 2006.

The debentures are initially convertible, subject to certain     conditions, into shares of the companys common stock at a     conversion rate of 31.7162 shares of common stock per $1,000     principal amount of debentures, representing an initial     effective conversion price of approximately $31.53 per     share of common stock. Holders may surrender the debentures for     conversion at any time. The conversion rate will be subject to     adjustment for certain events outlined in the indenture     governing the debentures, but will not be adjusted for accrued     interest. In addition, the conversion rate will increase for a     holder who elects to convert the debentures in connection with     certain share exchanges, mergers, or consolidations involving     Intel, as described in the indenture governing the debentures.     The debentures, which pay a fixed rate of interest semiannually,     have a contingent interest component that will require the     company to pay interest based on certain thresholds and for     certain events commencing on December 15, 2010, as outlined in     the indenture. The maximum amount of contingent interest that     will accrue is 0.40% per year. The fair value of the related     embedded derivative was not significant at December 30, 2006 or     December 31, 2005.        66    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)            The company may settle any conversion or repurchase of the     debentures in cash or stock at the companys option. On or     after December 15, 2012, the company may redeem all or part     of the debentures for the principal amount plus any accrued and     unpaid interest if the closing price of the companys     common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then     in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive     trading-day     period prior to the date on which the company provides notice of     redemption. If certain events occur in the future, the indenture     provides that each holder of the debentures may, for a     pre-defined period of time, require the company to repurchase     the holders debentures for the principal amount plus any     accrued and unpaid interest. The debentures are subordinated in     right of payment to the companys existing and future     senior debt and to the other liabilities of the companys     subsidiaries. The company concluded that the debentures are not     conventional convertible debt instruments and that the embedded     stock conversion option qualifies as a derivative under SFAS No.     133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging     Activities. In addition, in accordance with EITF     00-19,     Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed     to, and Potentially Settled in, a Companys Own     Stock, the company has concluded that the embedded     conversion option would be classified in stockholders     equity if it were a freestanding instrument. As such, the     embedded conversion option is not accounted for separately as a     derivative.         The company has Euro borrowings, which were made in connection     with the financing of manufacturing facilities and equipment in     Ireland. The company has invested the proceeds in     Euro-denominated loan participation notes of similar maturity to     reduce currency and interest rate exposures. During 2006, the     company retired approximately $300 million of the Euro     borrowings (approximately $280 million during 2005) prior to     their maturity dates through the simultaneous settlement of an     equivalent amount of investments in loan participation notes.         The company has guaranteed repayment of principal and interest     on bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the     City of Chandler, Arizona (the Arizona bonds), which constitute     an unsecured general obligation of the company. The aggregate     principal amount, including the premium, of the Arizona bonds     issued in 2005 is $160 million due 2035, and the bonds bear     interest at a fixed rate of 4.375% until 2010. The Arizona bonds     are subject to mandatory tender on November 30, 2010, at which     time, at the companys option, the bonds can be re-marketed     as either fixed-rate bonds for a period of a specified duration     or as variable-rate bonds until their final maturity on December     1, 2035.         At December 30, 2006, aggregate debt maturities were as follows:     2007$2 million; 2008$2 million; 2009$2     million; 2010$160 million; 2011$2 million; and     thereafter$1,682 million.

Net losses on the related derivatives were $22     million in 2006 (gains of $52 million in 2005 and losses of $77     million in 2004). Certain equity securities within the trading     asset portfolio are maintained to generate returns that seek to     offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risk     of certain deferred compensation arrangements. These deferred     compensation liabilities were $416 million in 2006 ($316 million     in 2005), and are included in other accrued liabilities on the     consolidated balance sheets. Net gains for the period on equity     securities offsetting deferred compensation arrangements still     held at the reporting date were $45 million in 2006 ($15 million     in 2005 and $29 million in 2004).        67    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)        Available-for-Sale     Investments     Available-for-sale

The aggregate of individual unrealized investment losses that     had been outstanding for 12 months or more were not significant     as of December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005. Management does     not believe that any of the unrealized losses represented an     other-than-temporary     impairment based on its evaluation of available evidence as of     December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005.         The company sold     available-for-sale     securities for proceeds of approximately $2.0 billion in 2006.

The company realized gains     on third-party merger transactions of $79 million during 2006.     The recognized impairment losses on     available-for-sale     investments as well as gross realized losses on sales were     insignificant during 2006.        68    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)            The company sold available-for sale securities for proceeds of     approximately $1.7 billion in 2005 and $1.1 billion in 2004. The     gross realized gains on these sales totaled $96 million in 2005     and $52 million in 2004. The company recognized impairment     losses on     available-for-sale     investments of $105 million in 2005 and $2 million in 2004. The     impairment in 2005 represented an impairment charge of $105     million on the companys investment in Micron reflecting     the difference between the cost basis of the investment and the     price of Microns stock at the end of the second quarter of     2005. The gross realized losses on sales, and gains on     third-party merger transactions, were insignificant during 2005     and 2004.         The amortized cost and estimated fair value of     available-for-sale     and loan participation investments in debt securities at     December 30, 2006, by contractual maturity, were as follows:                                                          Estimated           (In Millions)        Cost           Fair Value               Due in 1 year or less                 $       8,134               $       8,149          Due in 12 years                     1,744                   1,756          Due in 25 years                     900                   926          Due after 5 years                     96                   107          Securities not due at a single     maturity date                     1,790                   1,793                                                Total        $   12,664           $   12,731                                                        Securities not due at a single maturity date include     asset-backed securities and money market fund deposits.     Non-Marketable     Equity Securities         Non-marketable equity securities consist of both equity method     and cost basis investments. At December 30, 2006, the carrying     values of equity method and cost basis investments were $2.0     billion and $733 million, respectively. During 2006, the     companys non-marketable investments primarily consisted of     its investments in IM Flash Technologies, LLC (IMFT) and     Clearwire Corporation, which were both accounted for under the     equity method. At December 31, 2005, the carrying values of     equity method and cost basis investments were $59 million     and $502 million, respectively. The company recognized     impairment losses on non-marketable equity securities of     $79 million in 2006 ($103 million in 2005 and $115 million     in 2004).         During 2006, Intel and Micron formed IMFT, a NAND flash memory     manufacturing company, and invested $1.3 billion. See Note     17: Venture for further information.         During 2006, Intel paid $600 million in cash for an investment     in Clearwire. Clearwire builds and operates next-generation     wireless broadband networks. Intels total investment in     Clearwire is $613 million as of December 30, 2006, which     includes a previous investment. This investment is part of     Intels strategy to support the development and deployment     of WiMAX networks. Intels investment in Clearwire is     classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated     balance sheet. Intel accounts for its investment in Clearwire,     which represents an ownership interest of approximately 27%,     using the equity method of accounting; and its proportionate     share of loss will continue to be recorded on a one-quarter lag     within interest and other, net on the consolidated statements of     income. At the date of acquisition, the carrying value of     Intels investment in Clearwire exceeded its share of the     book value of Clearwires assets by $261 million (split     between equity method goodwill and the excess of fair value over     book value), of which $52 million is being amortized with a     weighted average remaining life of approximately 19 years. The     remaining basis difference represents equity method goodwill and     our share of the excess of fair value over book value of     Clearwires assets having indefinite useful lives. In     accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other     Intangible Assets, and APB Opinion No. 18, The     Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common     Stock (APB No. 18), this equity method goodwill is     not being amortized. Intel regularly reviews the carrying value     of the investment for impairment in accordance with APB No. 18.     During 2006, there were no impairment charges related to the     companys investment in Clearwire.        69    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)      Note 8:     Concentrations of Credit Risk         Financial instruments that potentially subject the company to     concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments     in debt securities, derivative financial instruments, and trade     receivables.         Intel generally places its investments with high-credit-quality     counterparties and, by policy, limits the amount of credit     exposure to any one counterparty based on Intels analysis     of that counterpartys relative credit standing.     Investments in debt securities with original maturities of     greater than six months consist primarily of A and A2 or better     rated financial instruments and counterparties. Investments with     original maturities of up to six months consist primarily of     A-1 and     P-1 or     better rated financial instruments and counterparties.     Government regulations imposed on investment alternatives of     Intels     non-U.S.     subsidiaries, or the absence of A and A2 rated counterparties in     certain countries, result in some minor exceptions, which are     reviewed and approved annually by the Finance Committee of the     Board of Directors. Credit rating criteria for derivative     instruments are similar to those for investments. The amounts     subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are     generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which a     counterpartys obligations exceed the obligations of Intel     with that counterparty. At December 30, 2006, the total credit     exposure to any single counterparty did not exceed $350 million.     Intels practice is to obtain and secure available     collateral from counterparties against obligations, including     securities lending transactions, whenever Intel deems     appropriate.         A substantial majority of the companys trade receivables     are derived from sales to original equipment manufacturers and     original design manufacturers of computer systems, handheld     devices, and networking and communications equipment. The     company also has accounts receivable derived from sales to     industrial and retail distributors. The companys two     largest customers accounted for 35% of net revenue for 2006,     2005, and 2004. At December 30, 2006, the two largest customers     accounted for 52% of net accounts receivable (42% of net     accounts receivable at December 31, 2005). Management believes     that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not     represent a significant credit risk based on cash flow     forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection     experience.         The company has adopted credit policies and standards intended     to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. Management     believes that credit risks are moderated by the financial     stability of the companys end customers and diverse     geographic sales areas. To assess the credit risk of     counterparties, a quantitative and qualitative analysis is     performed. From this analysis, credit limits are established and     a determination is made as to whether one or more credit support     devices, such as obtaining some form of third-party guarantee or     standby letter of credit, or obtaining credit insurance, for all     or a portion of the account balance is necessary.

See Note 14: Acquisitions and     Divestitures for further information.         During 2004, the company recognized $60 million of gains in     other, net associated with terminating financing arrangements     for manufacturing facilities and equipment in Ireland (see     Note 6: Borrowings). Gains associated with     terminating similar financing arrangements recognized in 2006     and 2005 were insignificant.        70    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)        Note 10:     Comprehensive Income         The components of comprehensive income and related tax effects     were as follows:                                                   (In Millions)        2006           2005           2004          Net income                 $       5,044               $       8,664               $       7,516          Change in net unrealized holding     gain on investments, net of tax of $(33), $(60), and $(17) in     2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively                     61                   101                   31          Less: adjustment for net gain on     investments included in net income, net of tax of $27, $22, and     $15 in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively                     (48       )               (38       )               (29       )      Change in net unrealized holding     gain or loss on derivatives, net of tax of $(22), $25, and $(34)     in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively                     37                   (42       )               63          Less: adjustment for amortization     of net gain or loss on derivatives included in net income, net     of tax of $(3), $22, and $4 in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively                     6                   (38       )               (8       )      Minimum pension liability, net of     tax of $6 in 2006 and $5 in 2005                     (30       )               (8       )               (1       )                                                            Total comprehensive     income        $   5,070           $   8,639           $   7,572                                                                        The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),     net of tax, were as follows:                                       (In Millions)        2006           2005          Accumulated net unrealized holding     gain on     available-for-sale     investments                 $       113               $       100          Accumulated net unrealized holding     gain on derivatives                     80                   37          Accumulated minimum pension     liability                                        (10       )      Accumulated net prior service costs                     (16       )                         Accumulated net actuarial losses                     (232       )                         Accumulated transition obligation                     (2       )                                                               Total accumulated other     comprehensive income (loss)        $   (57   )       $   127                                                        The adjustment for initially applying SFAS No. 158,     Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and     Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements     No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158), net of tax,     was recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)     for $210 million as of December 30, 2006. See Note 13:     Retirement Benefit Plans.         The estimated net prior service cost, actuarial loss, and     transition obligation for the defined benefit plan that will be     amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)     into net periodic benefit cost during fiscal year 2007 is $4     million, $16 million, and zero, respectively.         For 2006, $6 million of net deferred holding losses on     derivatives were reclassified from accumulated other     comprehensive income (loss) to cost of sales and operating     expense related to the companys     non-U.S.-currency     capital purchase and operating cost hedging programs (gains of     $38 million in 2005 and gains of $8 million in 2004). The     company estimates that less than $35 million of net derivative     gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)     will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months.     For all periods presented, the portion of hedging     instruments gains or losses excluded from the assessment     of effectiveness and the ineffective portions of hedges had an     insignificant impact on earnings for both cash flow and fair     value hedges. Additionally, for all periods presented, there was     no significant impact on results of operations from discontinued     cash flow hedges as a result of forecasted transactions that did     not occur.        71    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)      Note 11:     Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges         Intel is undertaking a restructuring plan designed to improve     operational efficiency and financial results. In the third     quarter of 2006, management approved several actions related to     this plan that were recommended by the companys structure     and efficiency task force. A portion of these activities     involves cost savings or other actions that do not result in     restructuring charges, such as better utilization of assets,     reduced spending, and organizational efficiencies. The     efficiency program includes headcount targets for various groups     within the company, and we expect these targets to be met     through ongoing employee attrition, divestitures, and employee     terminations as detailed below.         During 2006, Intel incurred restructuring charges related to     employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately     4,800 employees. A substantial majority of these employee     terminations occurred within marketing, manufacturing,     information technology, and human resources. Additionally, Intel     completed the divestiture of the assets of three businesses in     2006 concurrently with the ongoing execution of the efficiency     program. See Note 14: Acquisitions and Divestitures     for further details. In connection with the divestiture of     certain assets of the communications and application processor     business, the company recorded impairment charges of $103     million related to the write-down of manufacturing tools to     their fair value, less the cost to dispose of the assets. The     fair value was determined using a market-based valuation     technique. In addition, as a result of both this divestiture and     a subsequent assessment of Intels worldwide manufacturing     capacity operations, management placed for sale its fabrication     facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. This plan resulted in an     impairment charge of $214 million to write down to fair value     the land, building, and equipment asset grouping that has been     principally used to support the communications and application     processor business. The fair value of the asset grouping was     determined using various valuation techniques.         The following table summarizes the restructuring and asset     impairment activity for 2006:                                                          Employee Severance                                   (In Millions)        and Benefits           Asset Impairment           Total          Accrued restructuring balance     as of December 31, 2005        $                $                $               Additional accruals                     238                   317                   555          Adjustments                                                                     Cash payments                     (190       )                                  (190       )      Non-cash settlements                                        (317       )               (317       )                                                            Accrued restructuring balance     as of December 30, 2006        $   48           $               $   48                                                                        The restructuring and asset impairment charges above have been     reflected separately as restructuring and asset impairment     charges on the consolidated statements of income. All amounts     have been recorded within the all other category for     segment reporting purposes, as segment managers are not held     accountable for restructuring charges, and the segment-level     evaluation within the companys budget and planning process     does not include restructuring charges. The remaining accrual as     of December 30, 2006 is related to severance benefits that are     expected to be paid within the next 12 months. As such, the     restructuring accrual is recorded as a current liability within     accrued compensation and benefits on the consolidated balance     sheets. In addition, Intel may incur charges in the future under     this restructuring for employee severance and benefit     arrangements, and facility-related or other exit activities.        72    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)        Note 12:     Provision for Taxes         Income before taxes and the provision for taxes consisted of the     following:                                                   (Dollars in Millions)        2006           2005           2004          Income before taxes:                                                            U.S.                  $       4,532               $       10,397               $       7,422          Non-U.S.                      2,536                   2,213                   2,995                                                                Total income before     taxes        $   7,068           $   12,610           $   10,417                                                                Provision for taxes:                                                            Current:                                                            Federal                 $       1,997               $       3,546               $       2,787          State                     15                   289                   (69       )      Non-U.S.                      337                   524                   390                                                                               2,349                   4,359                   3,108                                                                Deferred:                                                            Federal                     (305       )               (360       )               (128       )      Other                     (20       )               (53       )               (79       )                                                                           (325       )               (413       )               (207       )                                                            Total provision for     taxes        $   2,024           $   3,946           $   2,901                                                                Effective tax rate            28.6   %           31.3   %           27.8   %                                                                    The difference between the tax provision at the statutory     federal income tax rate and the tax provision attributable to     income before income taxes was as follows:                                                   (In Percentages)        2006           2005           2004          Statutory federal income tax rate                     35.0       %               35.0       %               35.0       %      Increase (reduction) in rate     resulting from:                                                            State taxes, net of federal     benefits                     0.8                   1.3                   (0.4       )      Non-U.S.     income taxed at different rates                     (4.3       )               (2.0       )               (2.5       )      Export sales benefit                     (2.1       )               (2.8       )               (4.8       )      Repatriation of prior years     permanently reinvested earnings                                        1.8                             Share-based compensation                     0.7                                                Other                     (1.5       )               (2.0       )               0.5                                                                Income tax rate            28.6   %           31.3   %           27.8   %                                                                    During 2006, the tax benefit realized for the tax deduction from     option exercises and other awards totaled $139 million. The tax     benefit from employee equity incentive plans was $351 million     for 2005 and $344 million for 2004.         The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Act) created a     temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate     accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85%     dividends-received deduction for certain dividends from     controlled     non-U.S.     corporations. During 2005, the companys Chief Executive     Officer and Board of Directors approved a domestic reinvestment     plan, under which the company repatriated $6.2 billion in     earnings outside the U.S. pursuant to the Jobs Act. The company     recorded additional tax expense in 2005 of approximately $265     million ($0.04 per common share, assuming dilution) related to     this decision to repatriate     non-U.S.     earnings.        73    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)            During 2004, in connection with preparing and filing its 2003     federal tax return and preparing its state tax returns, the     company reduced its 2004 tax provision by $195 million. This     reduction in the 2004 tax provision was primarily driven by tax     benefits for export sales and state tax benefits for     divestitures that exceeded the amounts originally estimated in     connection with the 2003 provision. Also during 2004, the     company reversed previously accrued taxes related primarily to     the closing of a state income tax audit that reduced the tax     provision for 2004 by $62 million.         The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has formally assessed     certain adjustments to the amounts reflected by the company in     its tax returns as a tax benefit for export sales for the years     1999 through 2005. See Note 19: Contingencies for a     discussion of these matters.         Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary     differences between the carrying amount of assets and     liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for     income tax purposes. Significant components of the     companys deferred tax assets and liabilities at fiscal     year-ends were as follows:                                       (In Millions)        2006           2005               Deferred tax assets                                       Accrued compensation and other     benefits                 $       284               $       212          Accrued advertising                                        170          Deferred income                     217                   241          Share-based compensation                     385                             Inventory valuation                     268                   251          Impairment losses on equity     investments                     89                   93          State credits and net operating     losses                     115                   107          Intercompany profit in inventory                     133                   105          Unremitted earnings of     non-U.S.     subsidiaries                     54                   161          Other, net                     272                   273                                                               1,817                   1,613          Valuation allowance                     (87       )               (86       )                                            Total deferred tax     assets        $   1,730           $   1,527                                                Deferred tax     liabilities                                       Depreciation                 $       (530       )           $       (806       )      Accrued advertising                     (66       )                         Unrealized gains on investments                     (149       )               (123       )      Other, net                     (111       )               (117       )                                            Total deferred tax     liabilities        $   (856   )       $   (1,046   )                                            Net deferred tax     assets        $   874           $   481                                                Reported as:                                       Current deferred tax assets                 $       997               $       1,149          Current deferred tax     liabilities1                 (8       )                         Non-current deferred tax     assets2                 150                   35          Non-current deferred tax     liabilities                     (265       )               (703       )                                            Net deferred taxes        $   874           $   481                                                            1   Included in the other accrued liabilities line item on the     consolidated balance sheets.      2   Included in the other long-term assets line item on the     consolidated balance sheets.         74    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)          The company had state tax credits of $138 million at December     30, 2006 that will expire between 2009 and 2020. The net     deferred tax asset valuation allowance was $87 million at     December 30, 2006, relatively flat compared to $86 million at     December 31, 2005. The valuation allowance is based on     managements assessments that it is more likely than not     that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized in the     foreseeable future. The valuation allowance is composed of     unrealized state capital loss carry forwards and unrealized     state credit carry forwards of $79 million, and operating loss     of non-U.S.     subsidiaries of $8 million.         During 2004, the company reclassified $445 million from deferred     tax liabilities to common stock and capital stock in excess of     par value. The balance sheet reclassification represented the     tax benefit attributable to certain prior-year stock option     exercises by     non-U.S. employees     and had no impact on the accompanying statement of cash flows.         As of December 30, 2006, U.S. income taxes were not provided for     on a cumulative total of approximately $4.9 billion of     undistributed earnings for certain     non-U.S.     subsidiaries. Determination of the amount of unrecognized     deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to     investments in these     non-U.S.     subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration is not     practicable. The company currently intends to reinvest these     earnings in operations outside the U.S.     Note 13:     Retirement Benefit Plans     Profit     Sharing Plans         The company provides tax-qualified profit sharing retirement     plans for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees,     and retirees in the U.S. and certain other countries. The plans     are designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds     for retirement on a tax-deferred basis and provide for annual     discretionary employer contributions. Amounts to be contributed     to the U.S. Profit Sharing Plan are determined by the Chief     Executive Officer of the company under delegation of authority     from the Board of Directors, pursuant to the terms of the     U.S. Profit Sharing Plan. As of December 30, 2006,     approximately 80% of the assets of the U.S. Profit Sharing Plan     had been allocated to domestic and international equities index     funds, and approximately 20% had been allocated to a     fixed-income fund. All assets are managed by external investment     managers, consistent with the plans investment policy.         For the benefit of eligible U.S. employees, the company also     provides a non-tax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation     plan for certain highly compensated employees. This plan is     designed to permit certain discretionary employer contributions     and to permit employee deferral of a portion of salaries in     excess of certain tax limits and deferral of bonuses. This plan     is unfunded.         The company expensed $313 million for the qualified and     non-qualified U.S. profit sharing retirement plans in 2006 ($355     million in 2005 and $323 million in 2004). The company funded     $303 million for the 2006 contribution to the     U.S. qualified Profit Sharing Plan and $11 million for the     supplemental deferred compensation plan for certain highly     compensated employees.         Contributions made by the company to the U.S. Profit Sharing     Plan on behalf of the employees vest based on the     employees years of service. Vesting begins after three     years of service in 20% annual increments until the employee is     100% vested after seven years, or earlier if the employee     reaches age 60.        75    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)      Pension     and Postretirement Benefit Plans         Effective for fiscal year 2006, the company adopted the     provisions of SFAS No. 158. SFAS No. 158 requires that the     funded status of defined-benefit postretirement plans be     recognized on the companys consolidated balance sheets,     and changes in the funded status be reflected in comprehensive     income. SFAS No. 158 also requires the measurement date of the     plans funded status to be the same as the companys     fiscal year-end. Although the measurement date provision was not     required to be adopted until fiscal year 2008, the company     early-adopted this provision for fiscal year 2006. The     measurement date for all     non-U.S.     plans was the companys fiscal year-end, and the     measurement date for the U.S. plan was November. Therefore, the     change in measurement date had an insignificant impact on the     projected benefit obligation and accumulated other comprehensive     income (loss). The incremental effect of applying SFAS No. 158     on individual line items on the consolidated balance sheet as of     December 30, 2006 was as follows:                                                          Before                        After                  Application of                        Application of           (In Millions)        SFAS No. 158           Adjustments           SFAS No. 158               Deferred tax assets                 $       933               $       64               $       997          Other long-term assets                 $       4,213               $       (9       )           $       4,204          Accrued compensation and benefits                 $       1,950               $       (306       )           $       1,644          Other long-term liabilities                 $       418               $       571               $       989          Accumulated other comprehensive     income (loss)                 $       153               $       (210       )           $       (57       )          U.S. Pension Benefits. The company provides a     tax-qualified defined-benefit pension plan for the benefit of     eligible employees and retirees in the U.S. The plan provides     for a minimum pension benefit that is determined by a     participants years of service and final average     compensation (taking into account the participants social     security wage base), reduced by the participants balance     in the Profit Sharing Plan. If the pension benefit exceeds the     participants balance in the Profit Sharing Plan, the     participant will receive a combination of pension and profit     sharing amounts equal to the pension benefit. However, the     participant will receive only the benefit from the Profit     Sharing Plan if that benefit is greater than the value of the     pension benefit. If the company does not continue to contribute     to, or significantly reduces contributions to, the Profit     Sharing Plan, the U.S. defined-benefit plan projected benefit     obligation could increase significantly. The U.S.     defined-benefit plan projected benefit obligation for prior     years has been adjusted to remove the effects of estimated     assumed future profit sharing contributions and return on     investments. This change did not significantly impact results of     operations; however, the beginning benefit obligation for 2005     was adjusted by $80 million.         In 2005, the company received a favorable determination letter     from the IRS approving an amendment to the U.S. defined-benefit     plan that was filed during 2004. Effective for the plan year     ended 2005, the amendment allows for a portion of the     supplemental deferred compensation plan liability, for certain     highly compensated employees, to be included with the U.S.     defined-benefit plan under Section 415 of the Internal Revenue     Code. The amendment increased the projected benefit obligation     and accumulated benefit obligation by approximately $199     million. In 2005, the company funded the U.S. defined-benefit     plan related to this amendment in accordance with applicable     funding laws.     Non-U.S.     Pension Benefits. The company also provides     defined-benefit pension plans in certain other countries.     Consistent with the requirements of local law, the company     deposits funds for certain of these plans with insurance     companies, third-party trustees, or into government-managed     accounts,     and/or     accrues for the unfunded portion of the obligation. The     assumptions used in calculating the obligation for the     non-U.S.     plans depend on the local economic environment.     Postretirement Medical Benefits. Upon retirement,     eligible U.S. employees are credited with a defined dollar     amount based on years of service. These credits can be used to     pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase coverage in an     Intel-sponsored medical plan. If the available credits are not     sufficient to pay the entire cost of the coverage, the remaining     cost is the responsibility of the retiree.     Funding Policy. The companys practice is to     fund the various pension plans in amounts at least sufficient to     meet the minimum requirements of U.S. federal laws and     regulations or applicable local laws and regulations. The assets     of the various plans are invested in corporate equities,     corporate debt securities, government securities, and other     institutional arrangements. The portfolio of each plan depends     on plan design and applicable local laws. Depending on the     design of the plan, local customs, and market circumstances, the     liabilities of a plan may exceed qualified plan assets. The     company accrues for all such liabilities.        76    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)      Benefit     Obligation and

Weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine costs     for the plans were as follows:                                                                                                              Post-                      Non-        retirement              U.S. Pension        U.S. Pension        Medical              Benefits       Benefits       Benefits             2006       2005       2006       2005       2006       2005           Discount rate                     5.4       %               5.6       %               5.4       %               5.9       %               5.6       %               5.6       %      Expected return on plan assets                     5.6       %               8.0       %               6.0       %               6.3       %                                            Rate of compensation increase                     5.0       %               5.0       %               4.2       %               3.5       %                                                    For the U.S. plan, the discount rate was developed by     calculating the benefit payment streams by year to determine     when benefit payments will be due. The benefit payment streams     were then matched by year to U.S. Treasury zero coupon strips to     match the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments.     The company adjusted the zero coupon rate by a historical credit     risk spread, and discounted it back to the measurement date to     determine the appropriate discount rate. For the     non-U.S.     plans, the discount rate was developed by analyzing long-term     bond rates and matching the bond maturity with the average     duration of the pension liabilities. Several factors are     considered in developing the asset return assumptions for the     U.S. and     non-U.S.     plans. The company analyzed rates of return relevant to the     country where each plan is in effect and the investments     applicable to the plan; expectations of future returns; local     actuarial projections; and the projected rates of return from     investment managers. The expected long-term rate of return shown     for the     non-U.S.     plan assets is weighted to reflect each countrys relative     portion of the     non-U.S.     plan assets.     Net     Periodic Benefit Cost         The net periodic benefit cost for the plans included the     following components:                                                                                                                                              Non-U.S.     Pension            Postretirement                  U.S. Pension Benefits           Benefits           Medical Benefits          (In Millions)        2006           2005           2004           2006           2005           2004           2006           2005           2004          Service cost                 $       4               $       4               $       4               $       51               $       31               $       29               $       12               $       11               $       15          Interest cost                     13                   2                   2                   27                   18                   16                   10                   10                   11          Expected return on plan assets                     (12       )               (3       )               (2       )               (15       )               (18       )               (14       )                                                               Amortization of prior service cost                                                           1                                                                            4                   4                   4          Recognized net actuarial loss                                                                                                                                                                             1                                                                                                                                                                Net periodic benefit     cost        $   5           $   3           $   5           $   63           $   31           $   31           $   26           $   25           $   31                                                                                                                                                                       79    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)      U.S.     Plan Assets         In general, the investment strategy followed for U.S. plan     assets is designed to assure that the pension assets are     available to pay benefits as they come due and minimize market     risk. When deemed appropriate, a portion of the fund may be     invested in futures contracts for the purpose of acting as a     temporary substitute for an investment in a particular equity     security. The fund does not engage in speculative futures     transactions. The expected long-term rate of return for the U.S.     plan assets is 5.6%.         The asset allocation for the companys U.S. Pension Plan at     the end of fiscal years 2006 and 2005, and the target allocation     rate for 2007, by asset category, are as follows:                                                            Percentage of Plan Assets      Asset Category        Target Allocation       2006       2005      Equity securities               10%20%                14.0%              15.0%           Debt securities               80%90%                86.0%              85.0%               Non-U.S.     Plan Assets         The non-U.S.     plans investments are managed by insurance companies,     third-party trustees, or pension funds consistent with     regulations or market practice of the country where the assets     are invested. The investment manager makes investment decisions     within the guidelines set by Intel or local regulations.     Performance is evaluated by comparing the actual rate of return     to the return on other similar assets. Investments that are     managed by qualified insurance companies or pension funds under     standard contracts follow local regulations, and Intel is not     actively involved in the investment strategy. In general, the     investment strategy followed is designed to accumulate a     diversified portfolio among markets, asset classes, or     individual securities in order to reduce market risk and assure     that the pension assets are available to pay benefits as they     come due. The average expected long-term rate of return for the     non-U.S.     plan assets is 6.0%.         The asset allocation for the companys     non-U.S.     plans, excluding assets managed by qualified insurance     companies, at the end of fiscal years 2006 and 2005, and the     target allocation rate for 2007, by asset category, are as     follows:                                                            Percentage of Plan Assets      Asset Category        Target Allocation       2006       2005      Equity securities               68.0%                68.0%              67.0%           Debt securities               8.0%                8.0%              21.0%           Other               24.0%                24.0%              12.0%                   Investment assets that are managed by qualified insurance     companies are invested as part of the insurance companies     general fund. Intel does not have control over the target     allocation of these investments. These investments made up 31%     of total     non-U.S.     plan assets in 2006 (30% in 2005).     Funding     Expectations         No contributions are required during 2007 under applicable law     for the U.S. Pension Plan. The company intends to make voluntary     contributions so that assets are not less than the accumulated     benefit obligation at the end of the year. Expected funding for     the     non-U.S. plans     during 2007 is approximately $58 million. Employer contributions     to the postretirement medical benefits plan are expected to be     approximately $10 million during 2007.     Estimated     Future Benefit Payments         The total benefits to be paid from the U.S. and     non-U.S.     pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are not     expected to exceed $90 million in any year through 2016.        80    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)      Note 14:     Acquisitions and Divestitures     Business     Combinations         Consideration for acquisitions that qualify as business     combinations includes the cash paid and the value of any options     assumed, less any cash acquired, and excludes contingent     employee compensation payable in cash and any debt assumed.     During 2006, the company did not complete any acquisitions     qualifying as business combinations. During 2005, the company     completed three acquisitions qualifying as business combinations     in exchange for aggregate net cash consideration of $177     million, plus certain liabilities. Most of this consideration     was allocated to goodwill and related to businesses within the     all other category for segment reporting purposes.     During 2004, the company completed one acquisition qualifying as     a business combination in exchange for net cash consideration of     approximately $33 million, plus certain liabilities. The     operating results since the date of acquisition of the     businesses acquired are included in the segment that completed     the acquisition.     Development-Stage     Operations         An acquisition of a development-stage operation does not qualify     as a business combination under SFAS No. 141, Business     Combinations, and purchase consideration for such an     acquisition is not allocated to goodwill.     Workforce-in-place     related to an acquisition of a development-stage operation     qualifies as an identified intangible asset.         During 2006 and 2004, the company did not complete any     development-stage operation acquisitions. During 2005, the     company acquired a development-stage operation in exchange for     total net cash consideration of $19 million, most of which was     allocated to workforce-in-place. The operating results of this     acquisition since the date of acquisition are included in the     segment completing the acquisition, for segment reporting     purposes.     Divestitures         During 2006, the company completed three divestitures.         In September 2006, the company completed the divestiture of its     media and signaling business and associated assets that were     included in the Digital Enterprise Group operating segment. The     company received $75 million in cash consideration. Intel also     entered into a transition service agreement whereby Intel is     providing operational support and manufacturing to the acquiring     company for a limited time. By the completion of the transition     service agreement, approximately 375 employees of Intels     media and signaling business are expected to become employees of     the acquiring company. As a result of this divestiture, the     company recorded a reduction of goodwill for $4 million.     Additionally, a net gain of $52 million was recorded within     interest and other, net.         In September 2006, the company completed the divestiture of     certain product lines and associated assets of its optical     networking components business that were included in the Digital     Enterprise Group operating segment. Consideration for the     divestiture was $115 million, including $86 million in cash, and     shares of the acquiring company with an estimated value of $29     million. Approximately 55 employees of Intels optical     networking components business became employees of the acquiring     company during the term of the transition service agreement. As     a result of this divestiture, the company recorded a reduction     of goodwill of $6 million. Additionally, a net gain of $77     million was recorded within interest and other, net.         In November 2006, the company completed the divestiture of     certain assets of the communications and application processor     business to Marvell Technology Group, Ltd. for a cash purchase     price of $600 million, plus the assumption of certain     liabilities. The operating results associated with the divested     assets of the communications and application processor business     were included in the Mobility Group operating segment. Intel and     Marvell also entered into an agreement whereby Intel is     providing certain manufacturing and transition services to     Marvell. Approximately 1,300 employees of Intels     communications and application processor business involved in a     variety of functions, including engineering, product testing and     validation, operations, and marketing became employees of     Marvell. As a result of this divestiture, the company recorded a     reduction of goodwill of $2 million. Additionally, a net gain of     $483 million was recorded within interest and other, net.        81    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)      Note 15:     Goodwill         Goodwill activity attributed to operating segments for the years     ended December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 was as follows:                                                                                             Intel            Intel            Digital                                                      Communications            Architecture            Enterprise                                               (In Millions)        Group           Business           Group           Mobility Group           All Other           Total               December 25, 2004        $   3,186           $   533           $              $              $              $   3,719          Transfer                     (3,186       )               (533       )               3,403                   258                   58                             Additions                                                                                                 165                   165          Other                                                           (3       )               (8       )                                  (11       )                                                                                                            December 31, 2005        $              $              $   3,400           $   250           $   223           $   3,873          Divestitures                                                           (10       )               (2       )                                  (12       )                                                                                                            December 30, 2006        $              $              $   3,390           $   248           $   223           $   3,861                                                                                                                       During 2006, the company completed three divestitures, which     resulted in a reduction of $12 million in goodwill. See     Note 14: Acquisitions and Divestitures for further     details.         During 2005, the company completed three acquisitions for total     purchase consideration, net of cash acquired, of $177 million,     plus liabilities assumed, which resulted in goodwill of $165     million. The operating results of the acquired companies have     been reported in the all other category from the     date of acquisition.         During the first quarter of 2005, the company reorganized its     business groups to bring all major product groups in line with     the companys strategy to design and deliver technology     platforms. Due to this reorganization of the companys     business groups during the first quarter of 2005, goodwill was     allocated to the new reporting units based on the estimated fair     value of each business group within its original reporting unit     relative to the estimated fair value of that reporting unit. In     the fourth quarter of 2005, the company added the Flash Memory     Group (FMG). As the flash products group was a separate     reporting unit in the Mobility Group, with no goodwill assigned,     the transfer of the flash products group to FMG did not change     the goodwill recorded within the operating segments. The     majority of the all other category goodwill is     included in the Digital Home Group operating segment, which is     also a reporting unit.         During 2006, 2005, and 2004, the company concluded that goodwill     was not impaired.

Additionally, during 2006, there were $300 million in additions     to other intangible assets with a weighted average life of four     years.        82    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)          Identified intangible assets consisted of the following as of     December 31, 2005:                                                                      Accumulated                       (In Millions)        Gross Assets           Amortization           Net               Intellectual property assets                 $       976               $       (382       )           $       594          Acquisition-related developed     technology                     300                   (275       )               25          Other intangible assets                     112                   (77       )               35                                                                Total identified intangible     assets        $   1,388           $   (734   )       $   654                                                                        During 2005, the company acquired intellectual property assets     for $209 million with a weighted average life of nine years. The     majority of the intellectual property assets acquired     represented the value of assets capitalized as a result of a     settlement agreement with MicroUnity, Inc. Pursuant to the     agreement, Intel agreed to pay MicroUnity a total of $300     million, of which $140 million was charged to cost of sales, in     exchange for a technology license. The charge to cost of sales     related to the portion of the license attributable to certain     product sales through the third quarter of 2005. The remaining     $160 million represented the value of the intellectual property     assets capitalized and is being amortized over the assets     remaining useful lives.         All of the companys identified intangible assets are     subject to amortization. Amortization of intellectual property     assets was $178 million in 2006 ($123 million in 2005 and     $120 million in 2004). The amortization of an intellectual     property asset is generally included in cost of sales on the     consolidated statements of income. Amortization of     acquisition-related developed technology was $20 million     for 2006 ($86 million for 2005 and $122 million for     2004) and is included in amortization of acquisition-related     intangibles and costs on the consolidated statements of income.     Amortization of other intangible assets was $59 million in 2006     ($32 million in 2005 and $28 million in 2004). The     amortization of other intangible assets is recorded as either     amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs or as     a reduction of revenue on the consolidated statements of income.         Based on identified intangible assets recorded at December 30,     2006, and assuming no subsequent impairment of the underlying     assets, the annual amortization expense for each period is     expected to be as follows:                                                                           (In Millions)        2007           2008           2009           2010           2011               Intellectual property assets                 $       152               $       142               $       115               $       103               $       52          Acquisition-related developed     technology                 $       1               $       1               $                      $                      $                 Other intangible assets                 $       80               $       85               $       111               $                      $                     Note 17:     Venture         During January 2006, Micron and Intel formed IMFT, a company     that manufactures NAND flash memory products for Micron and     Intel. Initial production from IMFT began in early 2006.         As part of the initial capital contribution to IMFT, Intel paid     $615 million in cash and issued $581 million in     non-interest-bearing notes in exchange for a 49% interest.     During 2006, Intel paid the entire balance of $581 million     toward the non-interest-bearing notes, which has been reflected     as a financing activity on the consolidated statement of cash     flows. At inception, in exchange for a 51% interest, Micron     contributed assets valued at $995 million and $250 million in     cash. Intel is currently committed to purchasing 49% of     IMFTs production output and production-related services.     During 2006, the purchased products and services from IMFT were     approximately $300 million and the related payable as of     December 30, 2006 was not significant.         IMFT is governed by a Board of Managers, with Intel and Micron     initially appointing an equal number of managers to the Board of     Managers. The number of managers appointed by each party adjusts     depending on the parties ownership interests in IMFT. IMFT     will operate until 2015, but is subject to prior termination     under certain terms and conditions.        83    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)          Subject to certain conditions, Intel and Micron each agreed to     contribute an additional $1.4 billion in the three years     following the initial capital contributions, of which Intel had     contributed $128 million as of December 30, 2006. In January     2007, Intel made an additional capital contribution to IMFT of     $258 million.         IMFT is a variable interest entity as defined by FASB     Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable     Interest Entities (revised December 2003)an interpretation     of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46(R)), because all positive and     negative variances in IMFTs cost structure are passed on     to Intel and Micron through their purchase agreement with IMFT.     Micron and Intel are considered related parties under the     provisions of FIN 46(R), and Intel has determined that Intel is     not the primary beneficiary of IMFT. Intel accounts for its     interest in IMFT using the equity method of accounting.     Intels proportionate share of income or losses from its     investment in IMFT is recorded in interest and other, net.     Intels maximum exposure to loss as a result of its     involvement with IMFT is $1.3 billion as of December 30,     2006, which represents Intels investment. Intels     investment in IMFT is classified within other long-term assets     on the consolidated balance sheet.         Concurrent with the formation of IMFT, Intel paid Micron $270     million for product designs developed by Micron as well as     certain other intellectual property. Intel owns the rights with     respect to all product designs and licensed the designs to     Micron. Micron paid Intel $40 million to license these     initial product designs and will pay additional royalties on new     product designs. Intel recorded its net investment in this     technology of $230 million as an identified intangible asset,     which is included in the intellectual property asset     classification. The identified intangible asset will be     amortized into cost of sales over its expected five-year life.     Costs incurred by Intel and Micron for product and process     development related to IMFT are generally split evenly between     Intel and Micron and are classified as research and development     on the consolidated statements of income.         Intel has entered into a long-term supply agreement with Apple     Inc. to supply a portion of the NAND flash memory output that     Intel will purchase from IMFT through December 31, 2010. In     January 2006, Apple pre-paid a refundable $250 million to Intel     that will be applied to purchases of NAND flash memory by Apple     beginning in 2008. Intel has classified the $250 million as     other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.     Note 18:     Commitments         The company leases a portion of its capital equipment and     certain of its facilities under operating leases that expire at     various dates through 2021. Additionally, the company leases     portions of its land that expire at various dates through 2062.     Rental expense was $160 million in 2006 ($150 million in     2005 and $136 million in 2004). Minimum rental commitments under     all non-cancelable leases with an initial term in excess of one     year are payable as follows: 2007$114 million;     2008$80 million; 2009$58 million;     2010$33 million; 2011$24 million; 2012 and     beyond$75 million. Commitments for construction or     purchase of property, plant and equipment increased from $2.7     billion at December 31, 2005 to $3.3 billion at December 30,     2006, primarily due to purchase obligations for capital     equipment related to our next-generation 45-nanometer process     technology. Other purchase obligations and commitments as of     December 30, 2006 totaled $1.8 billion. Other purchase     obligations and commitments include agreements to purchase raw     material or other goods as well as payments due under various     types of licenses and non-contingent funding obligations.     Funding obligations include, for example, agreements to fund     various projects with other companies. In addition, the company     has various contractual commitments related to the IMFT venture     with Micron (see Note 17: Venture).     Note 19:     Contingencies     Tax     Matters         In connection with the regular examination of Intels tax     returns for the years 1999 through 2005, the IRS formally     assessed, in 2005 and 2006, certain adjustments to the amounts     reflected by Intel on those returns as a tax benefit for its     export sales. The company does not agree with these adjustments     and has appealed the assessments. If the IRS prevails in its     position, Intels federal income tax due for 1999 through     2005 would increase by approximately $2.2 billion, plus     interest. In addition, the IRS will likely make a similar claim     for 2006, and if the IRS prevails, income tax due for 2006 would     increase by approximately $200 million, plus interest.        84    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)          Although the final resolution of the adjustments is uncertain,     based on currently available information, management believes     that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse     effect on the companys financial position, cash flows, or     overall trends in results of operations. There is the     possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of     operations for the period in which the matter is ultimately     resolved, if it is resolved unfavorably, or in the period in     which an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably     estimable.     Legal     Proceedings         Intel currently is a party to various legal proceedings,     including those noted below. While management presently believes     that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and     in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the     companys financial position, cash flows, or overall trends     in results of operations, litigation is subject to inherent     uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An     unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases     for which injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting     Intel from selling one or more products. Were an unfavorable     ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a material     adverse impact on the business or results of operations for the     period in which the ruling occurs or future periods.         In June 2005, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) filed a     complaint in the United States District Court for the District     of Delaware alleging that Intel and Intels Japanese     subsidiary engaged in various actions in violation of the     Sherman Act and the California Business and Professions Code,     including providing secret and discriminatory discounts and     rebates and intentionally interfering with prospective business     advantages of AMD. AMDs complaint seeks unspecified treble     damages, punitive damages, an injunction, and attorneys     fees and costs. Subsequently, AMDs Japanese subsidiary     also filed suits in the Tokyo High Court and the Tokyo District     Court against Intels Japanese subsidiary, asserting     violations of Japans Antimonopoly Law and alleging damages     of approximately $55 million, plus various other costs and fees.     At least 78 separate class actions, generally repeating     AMDs allegations and asserting various consumer injuries,     including that consumers in various states have been injured by     paying higher prices for Intel microprocessors, have been filed     in the U.S. District Courts for the Northern District of     California, Southern District of California, and the District of     Delaware, as well as in various California, Kansas, and     Tennessee state courts. All the federal class actions have been     consolidated by the Multidistrict Litigation Panel to the     District of Delaware. All California class actions have been     consolidated to the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara     County. Intel disputes AMDs claims and the     class-action     claims, and intends to defend the lawsuits vigorously.         Intel is also subject to certain antitrust regulatory inquiries.     In 2001, the European Commission commenced an investigation     regarding claims by AMD that Intel used unfair business     practices to persuade clients to buy Intel microprocessors. In     June 2005, Intel received an inquiry from the Korea Fair Trade     Commission requesting documents from Intels Korean     subsidiary related to marketing and rebate programs that Intel     entered into with Korean PC manufacturers. Intel is cooperating     with these agencies in their investigations and expects that     these matters will be acceptably resolved.         In June 2002, various plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the Third     Judicial Circuit Court, Madison County, Illinois, against Intel,     Gateway Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, and HPDirect, Inc.     alleging that the defendants advertisements and statements     misled the public by suppressing and concealing the alleged     material fact that systems containing Intel Pentium 4     processors are less powerful and slower than systems containing     Intel Pentium     III     processors and a competitors microprocessors. In July     2004, the court certified against Intel an Illinois-only class     of certain end-use purchasers of certain Pentium 4     processors or computers containing such microprocessors. In     January 2005, the Circuit Court granted a motion filed jointly     by the plaintiffs and Intel that stayed the proceedings in the     trial court pending discretionary appellate review of the     Circuit Courts class certification order. In July 2006,     the Illinois Appellate Court, Fifth District, vacated the     Circuit Courts class certification order and remanded the     case to the Circuit Court with instructions to reconsider its     class certification ruling. In August 2006, the Illinois Supreme     Court agreed to review the Appellate Courts decision, and     that review is pending. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages     and attorneys fees and costs. The company disputes the     plaintiffs claims and intends to defend the lawsuit     vigorously.         Beginning in May 2005, Intel and AmberWave Systems Corporation     filed a series of lawsuits against each other that were     consolidated into actions in the United States District Court     for the District of Delaware. AmberWave claimed that certain     Intel semiconductor manufacturing processes infringed six     AmberWave patents related to semiconductor fabrication.     AmberWave sought damages, treble damages for alleged willful     infringement, an injunction, and attorneys fees. Intel     disputed AmberWaves allegations and defended the lawsuits     vigorously. In 2007, Intel and AmberWave entered into a license     agreement under which, among other terms, Intel agreed to make     certain payments to AmberWave, and AmberWave agreed to license     AmberWaves patent portfolio to Intel. The parties agreed     to jointly dismiss the actions with prejudice.        85    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)          In October 2006, Transmeta Corporation filed a lawsuit in the     United States District Court for the District of Delaware.     Transmeta alleges that Intels P6, Pentium 4, Pentium M,     Intel Core, and Intel Core 2 processors infringe 10 Transmeta     patents alleged to cover computer architecture and     power-efficiency technologies. In December 2006, Transmeta filed     an amended complaint alleging that Intels processors     infringe an eleventh Transmeta patent. Intel filed counterclaims     against Transmeta alleging that Transmetas Crusoe,     Efficeon, and Efficeon 2 families of microprocessors infringe     seven Intel patents. Transmeta seeks damages, treble damages, an     injunction, and attorneys fees. Intel disputes     Transmetas allegations of infringement and intends to     defend the lawsuits vigorously.     Note 20:     Operating Segment and Geographic Information         The companys operating segments included the Digital     Enterprise Group, Mobility Group, Flash Memory Group, Digital     Home Group, Digital Health Group, and Channel Platforms Group as     of December 30, 2006. Prior-period amounts have been adjusted     retrospectively to reflect reorganizations.         The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), as defined by SFAS     No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and     Related Information (SFAS No. 131), is the companys     President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The CODM allocates     resources to and assesses the performance of each operating     segment using information about its revenue and operating income     (loss) before interest and taxes.         The company reports the financial results of the following     operating segments:                   Digital Enterprise Group. Includes microprocessors     and related chipsets and motherboards designed for the desktop     and enterprise computing market segments; communications     infrastructure components such as network processors,     communications boards, and embedded processors; wired     connectivity devices; and products for network and server     storage.              Mobility Group. Includes microprocessors and related     chipsets designed for the notebook computing market segment; and     wireless connectivity products. The operating results associated     with the divested assets of the communications and application     processor business were included in the Mobility Group operating     segment through the date of the divestiture.              Flash Memory Group. Includes NOR flash memory     products designed for cellular phones and embedded form factors;     and NAND flash memory products manufactured by IMFT that are     designed for memory cards, digital audio players, and cellular     phones.           The Flash Memory Group, Digital Home Group, Digital Health     Group, and Channel Platforms Group operating segments do not     meet the quantitative thresholds for reportable segments as     defined by SFAS No. 131. However, the Flash Memory Group is     reported separately, as management believes that this     information is useful to the reader. The Digital Home Group,     Digital Health Group, and Channel Platforms Group operating     segments are included within the all other category.         The company has sales and marketing, manufacturing, finance, and     administration groups. Expenses of these groups are generally     allocated to the operating segments and are included in the     operating results reported below. Revenue for the all     other category primarily relates to microprocessors and     related chipsets sold by the Digital Home Group. In addition to     the operating results for the Digital Home Group, Digital Health     Group, and Channel Platforms Group operating segments, the     all other category includes certain corporate-level     operating expenses, including a portion of profit-dependent     bonus and other expenses not allocated to the operating     segments; results of operations of seed businesses that support     the companys initiatives; acquisition-related costs,     including amortization and impairment of acquisition-related     intangibles and goodwill; charges for purchased in-process     research and development; share-based compensation charges; and     amounts included within restructuring and asset impairment     charges on the consolidated statements of income.         With the exception of goodwill, the company does not identify or     allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the CODM evaluate     operating segments using discrete asset information. Operating     segments do not record inter-segment revenue, and, accordingly,     there is none to be reported. The company does not allocate     interest and other income, interest expense, or taxes to     operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income to     evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment     may benefit other segments. Except as discussed above, the     accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for     the company as a whole.        86    Table of Contents     INTEL     CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)          Operating segment net revenue and operating income (loss) for     the three years ended December 30, 2006 were as follows:                                                   (In Millions)        2006           2005           2004               Net revenue                                                       Digital Enterprise     Group                                                       Microprocessor revenue                 $       14,606               $       19,412               $       19,426          Chipset, motherboard, and other     revenue                     5,270                   5,725                   5,352                                                                           19,876               25,137               24,778          Mobility Group                                                       Microprocessor revenue                     9,212                   8,704                   5,667          Chipset and other revenue                     3,097                   2,427                   1,314                                                                           12,309               11,131               6,981          Flash Memory Group            2,163               2,278               2,285          All other            1,034               280               165                                                                Total net revenue        $   35,382           $   38,826           $   34,209                                                                Operating income     (loss)                                                       Digital Enterprise Group                 $       4,267               $       9,020               $       8,856          Mobility Group                     4,993                   5,334                   2,832          Flash Memory Group                     (555       )               (154       )               (149       )      All other                     (3,053       )               (2,110       )               (1,409       )                                                            Total operating     income        $   5,652           $   12,090           $   10,130                                                                        In 2006, 2005, and 2004, one customer accounted for 19% of the     companys net revenue and another customer accounted for     16%. The majority of the revenue from these customers was from     the sale of microprocessors, chipsets, and other components by     the Digital Enterprise Group and Mobility Group operating     segments.

Our audits also     included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at     Part IV, Item 15. These financial statements and schedule are     the responsibility of the companys management. Our     responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial     statements and schedule based on our audits.         We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the     Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those     standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain     reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are     free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a     test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in     the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the     accounting principles used and significant estimates made by     management, as well as evaluating the overall financial     statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a     reasonable basis for our opinion.         In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above     present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated     financial position of Intel Corporation at December 30, 2006 and     December 31, 2005, and the consolidated results of its     operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the     period ended December 30, 2006, in conformity with U.S.     generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion,     the related financial statement schedule, when considered in     relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,     presents fairly in all material respects the information set     forth therein.         We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the     Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the     effectiveness of Intel Corporations internal control over     financial reporting as of December 30, 2006, based on criteria     established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued     by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway     Commission and our report dated February 20, 2007 expressed     an unqualified opinion thereon.         As discussed in Notes 2 and 13 to the consolidated financial     statements, on January 1, 2006, the company adopted Statement of     Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),     Share-Based Payment and during 2006, the     company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.     158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit     Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB     Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R).         /s/ Ernst & Young LLP         San Jose, California       February 20, 2007        89    Table of Contents   REPORT OF     ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING     FIRM     The Board of Directors and Stockholders, Intel     Corporation         We have audited managements assessment, included in the     accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over     Financial Reporting, that Intel Corporation maintained effective     internal control over financial reporting as of December 30,     2006, based on criteria established in Internal     ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of     Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO     criteria). Intel Corporations management is responsible     for maintaining effective internal control over financial     reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of     internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is     to express an opinion on managements assessment and an     opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal     control over financial reporting based on our audit.         We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the     Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those     standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain     reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control     over financial reporting was maintained in all material     respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of     internal control over financial reporting, evaluating     managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design     and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing     such other procedures as we considered necessary in the     circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable     basis for our opinion.         A companys internal control over financial reporting is a     process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the     reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of     financial statements for external purposes in accordance with     generally accepted accounting principles. A companys     internal control over financial reporting includes those     policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of     records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly     reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the     company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are     recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial     statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting     principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company     are being made only in accordance with authorizations of     management and directors of the company; and (3) provide     reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of     unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the     companys assets that could have a material effect on the     financial statements.         Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over     financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.     Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future     periods are subject to the risk that controls may become     inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree     of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.         In our opinion, managements assessment that Intel     Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial     reporting as of December 30, 2006, is fairly stated, in all     material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our     opinion, Intel Corporation maintained, in all material respects,     effective internal control over financial reporting as of     December 30, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.         We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the     Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the     2006 consolidated financial statements of Intel Corporation and     our report dated February 20, 2007 expressed an unqualified     opinion thereon.         /s/ Ernst & Young LLP         San Jose, California       February 20, 2007        90    Table of Contents      INTEL     CORPORATION     FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY QUARTER (UNAUDITED)                                                              2006 For Quarter     Ended1                                                       (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)        December 30           September 30           July 1           April 1          Net revenue                 $       9,694               $       8,739               $       8,009               $       8,940          Gross margin                 $       4,810               $       4,294               $       4,171               $       4,943          Net income                 $       1,501               $       1,301               $       885               $       1,357          Basic earnings per share                 $       0.26               $       0.23               $       0.15               $       0.23          Diluted earnings per share                 $       0.26               $       0.22               $       0.15               $       0.23          Dividends per share                                                                            Declared                 $                      $       0.20               $                      $       0.20          Paid                 $       0.10               $       0.10               $       0.10               $       0.10          Market price range common     stock2                                                                        High                 $       22.33               $       20.77               $       20.11               $       26.47          Low                 $       20.08               $       17.10               $       16.86               $       19.46                                                                     2005 For Quarter Ended                                                       (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)        December 31           October 1           July 2           April 2               Net revenue                 $       10,201               $       9,960               $       9,231               $       9,434          Gross margin                 $       6,300               $       5,948               $       5,203               $       5,598          Net income                 $       2,453               $       1,995               $       2,038               $       2,178          Basic earnings per share                 $       0.41               $       0.33               $       0.33               $       0.35          Diluted earnings per share                 $       0.40               $       0.32               $       0.33               $       0.35          Dividends per share                                                                            Declared                 $                      $       0.16               $                      $       0.16          Paid                 $       0.08               $       0.08               $       0.08               $       0.08          Market price range common     stock2                                                                        High                 $       27.43               $       28.71               $       27.70               $       25.11          Low                 $       22.65               $       23.83               $       22.12               $       21.99                     1   The company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) in     fiscal year 2006.

CHANGES     IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND     FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE           Not applicable.      ITEM     9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES          Attached as exhibits to this Form     10-K are     certifications of Intels Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and     Chief Financial Officer (CFO), which are required in accordance     with Rule     13a-14 of     the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange     Act). This Controls and Procedures section includes     information concerning the controls and controls evaluation     referred to in the certifications. Part II, Item 8 of this Form     10-K sets     forth the report of Ernst & Young LLP, our independent     registered public accounting firm, regarding its audit of     Intels internal control over financial reporting and of     managements assessment of internal control over financial     reporting set forth below in this section. This section should     be read in conjunction with the certifications and the Ernst     & Young report for a more complete understanding of the     topics presented.     Evaluation     of Disclosure Controls and Procedures         We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design     and operation of our disclosure controls and     procedures (Disclosure Controls) as of the end of the     period covered by this Form     10-K. The     controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with     the participation of management, including our CEO and CFO.     Disclosure Controls are controls and procedures designed to     reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in     our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Form     10-K, is     recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time     periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure     Controls are also designed to reasonably assure that such     information is accumulated and communicated to our management,     including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely     decisions regarding required disclosure. Our quarterly     evaluation of Disclosure Controls includes an evaluation of some     components of our internal control over financial reporting, and     internal control over financial reporting is also separately     evaluated on an annual basis for purposes of providing the     management report, which is set forth below.         The evaluation of our Disclosure Controls included a review of     the controls objectives and design, the companys     implementation of the controls, and their effect on the     information generated for use in this Form     10-K. In the     course of the controls evaluation, we reviewed identified data     errors, control problems, or acts of fraud, and sought to     confirm that appropriate corrective actions, including process     improvements, were being undertaken. This type of evaluation is     performed on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions of     management, including the CEO and CFO, concerning the     effectiveness of the Disclosure Controls can be reported in our     periodic reports on Form     10-Q and     Form 10-K.     Many of the components of our Disclosure Controls are also     evaluated on an ongoing basis by our Internal Audit Department     and by other personnel in our Finance and Enterprise Services     organization. The overall goals of these various evaluation     activities are to monitor our Disclosure Controls, and to modify     them as necessary. Our intent is to maintain the Disclosure     Controls as dynamic systems that change as conditions warrant.         Based on the controls evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded     that, as of the end of the period covered by this Form     10-K, our     Disclosure Controls were effective to provide reasonable     assurance that information required to be disclosed in our     Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and     reported within the time periods specified by the SEC, and that     material information related to Intel and its consolidated     subsidiaries is made known to management, including the CEO and     CFO, particularly during the period when our periodic reports     are being prepared.     Management     Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting         Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining     adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide     reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial     reporting and the preparation of financial statements for     external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted     accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting     includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the     maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and     fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets     of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that     transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of     financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted     accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the     company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of     management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide     reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of     unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the     companys assets that could have a material effect on the     financial statements.        92    Table of Contents       Management assessed our internal control over financial     reporting as of December 30, 2006, the end of our fiscal year.     Management based its assessment on criteria established in     Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the     Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway     Commission. Managements assessment included evaluation of     elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key     financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting     policies, and our overall control environment. This assessment     is supported by testing and monitoring performed by both our     Internal Audit organization and our Finance and Enterprise     Services organization.         Based on our assessment, management has concluded that our     internal control over financial reporting was effective as of     the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance     regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the     preparation of financial statements for external reporting     purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting     principles. We reviewed the results of managements     assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.     In addition, on a quarterly basis we evaluate any changes to our     internal control over financial reporting to determine if     material changes occurred.         Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst &     Young LLP, audited managements assessment and     independently assessed the effectiveness of the companys     internal control over financial reporting. Ernst & Young has     issued an attestation report concurring with managements     assessment, which is included at the end of Part II, Item 8 of     this Form     10-K.     Inherent     Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls         The companys management, including the CEO and CFO, does     not expect that our Disclosure Controls or our internal control     over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and     all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and     operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance     that the control systems objectives will be met. The     design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are     resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be     considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the     inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of     controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due     to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and     instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been     detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that     judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns     can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also     be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by     collusion of two or more people, or by management override of     the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in     part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future     events, and there can be no assurance that any design will     succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future     conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls     effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time,     controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions     or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or     procedures.      ITEM     9B.
