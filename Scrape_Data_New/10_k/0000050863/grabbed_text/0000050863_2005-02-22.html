IN ADDITION TO THE VARIOUS IMPORTANT FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE, A NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS. DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH IMPACTS OUR REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, IS AFFECTED BY BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY TRENDS AND THE DEVELOPMENT AND TIMING OF INTRODUCTION OF COMPELLING SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND OPERATING SYSTEMS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FEATURES OF OUR PRODUCTS. DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS ALSO AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN CUSTOMER ORDER PATTERNS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF INVENTORY MAINTAINED BY OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE TIMING OF CUSTOMER PURCHASES. INTEL OPERATES IN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES, AND OUR REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN COULD BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS SUCH AS COMPETING CHIP ARCHITECTURES AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES, COMPETING SOFTWARE-COMPATIBLE MICROPROCESSORS, PRICING PRESSURES, ACTIONS TAKEN BY OUR COMPETITORS AND OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS, AS WELL AS MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR NEW PRODUCTS IN SPECIFIC MARKET SEGMENTS, THE AVAILABILITY OF SUFFICIENT INVENTORY TO MEET DEMAND AND THE AVAILABILITY OF EXTERNALLY PURCHASED COMPONENTS OR MATERIALS. OUR FUTURE REVENUE IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON CONTINUING TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT, INCLUDING DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING NEW PROCESSES AND STRATEGIC PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THE TIMING OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, SUSTAINING AND GROWING NEW BUSINESSES, AND INTEGRATING AND OPERATING ANY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. OUR RESULTS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY ADVERSE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA (DEVIATIONS FROM PUBLISHED SPECIFICATIONS), AND BY LITIGATION OR REGULATORY MATTERS INVOLVING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR STOCKHOLDER, CONSUMER, ANTITRUST AND OTHER ISSUES. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:0PX;MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PX"><FONT SIZE="1">&NBSP;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:0PX;MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PX; TEXT-INDENT:4%"><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2">WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE PRODUCT OFFERINGS, FACILITIES, PERSONNEL, AND COMPETITIVE AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR CONTINUED BUSINESS SUCCESS, BUT FUTURE REVENUE, COSTS, GROSS MARGINS AND PROFITS ARE ALL INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THOSE DISCUSSED ABOVE, ALL OF WHICH ARE INHERENTLY DIFFICULT TO FORECAST. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:0PX;MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PX"><FONT SIZE="1">&NBSP;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:0PX;MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PX"><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2"><B>STATUS OF BUSINESS OUTLOOK AND RELATED RISK FACTOR STATEMENTS </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:0PX;MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PX"><FONT SIZE="1">&NBSP;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:0PX;MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PX; TEXT-INDENT:4%"><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2">WE EXPECT THAT OUR CORPORATE REPRESENTATIVES WILL FROM TIME TO TIME MEET PRIVATELY WITH INVESTORS, INVESTMENT ANALYSTS, THE MEDIA AND OTHERS, AND MAY REITERATE THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THE &#147;BUSINESS OUTLOOK&#148; SECTION AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM&NBSP;10-K, INCLUDING ANY SUCH STATEMENTS THAT ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS FORM 10-K.

HOWEVER, OUR MARKETABLE PORTFOLIO IS SUBSTANTIALLY CONCENTRATED IN TWO COMPANIES, WHICH WILL AFFECT THE MARKETABLE PORTFOLIO&#146;S PRICE VOLATILITY. WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN INVESTMENT IN MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC. WITH A FAIR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION, OR 60% OF THE TOTAL MARKETABLE PORTFOLIO VALUE INCLUDING EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AT DECEMBER 25, 2004. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE AN INVESTMENT IN ELPIDA MEMORY, INC. WITH A FAIR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $212 MILLION, OR 32% OF THE TOTAL MARKETABLE PORTFOLIO VALUE INCLUDING EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AT DECEMBER 25, 2004. PRIOR TO ELPIDA&#146;S PUBLIC OFFERING, THIS INVESTMENT WAS INCLUDED IN OUR NON-MARKETABLE PORTFOLIO AND THEREFORE EXCLUDED FROM OUR 2003 MARKET PRICE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS. THE INVESTMENTS IN MICRON AND ELPIDA ARE PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY OF DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY (DRAM) PRODUCTS. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE HIGH-TECHNOLOGY STOCK INDICES AND THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF MICRON&#146;S AND ELPIDA&#146;S STOCK AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2004, WE ESTIMATED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE PRICES OF THE STOCKS IN OUR PORTFOLIO COULD EXPERIENCE A LOSS OF 45% IN THE NEAR TERM (55% AS OF THE END OF 2003). </FONT></P> <P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:0PX;MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PX"><FONT SIZE="1">&NBSP;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:0PX;MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PX; TEXT-INDENT:4%"><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2">ASSUMING A LOSS OF 45% IN MARKET PRICES, AND AFTER REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, OUR PORTFOLIO COULD DECREASE IN VALUE BY APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION, BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2004. ASSUMING A LOSS OF 55% IN MARKET PRICES, AND AFTER REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, OUR PORTFOLIO COULD DECREASE IN VALUE BY APPROXIMATELY $290 MILLION, BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2003. THE ASSUMED LOSS PERCENTAGE USED IN 2004 IS LOWER THAN THE ASSUMED LOSS PERCENTAGE USED IN 2003 DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES IN THE CONCENTRATION OF INVESTMENTS DURING EACH YEAR. THIS ESTIMATE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AND ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:0PX;MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PX"><FONT SIZE="1">&NBSP;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:0PX;MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PX; TEXT-INDENT:4%"><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2"><I>NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES.</I>&NBSP;&NBSP;OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES WOULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY AN ADVERSE MOVEMENT OF EQUITY MARKET PRICES, ALTHOUGH THE IMPACT CANNOT BE DIRECTLY QUANTIFIED. SUCH A MOVEMENT AND THE RELATED UNDERLYING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANIES WE INVEST IN, THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF OUR BEING ABLE TO REALIZE OUR INVESTMENTS THROUGH LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH AS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS AND PRIVATE SALES. THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS INVOLVE A GREAT DEAL OF RISK, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SPECIFIC COMPANY WILL GROW OR BECOME SUCCESSFUL; CONSEQUENTLY, WE COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF OUR INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 25, 2004, OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES HAD A CARRYING AMOUNT OF $507 MILLION. NO INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT IN OUR NON-MARKETABLE PORTFOLIO WAS SIGNIFICANT AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2004. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:0PX;MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PX"><FONT SIZE="1">&NBSP;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:0PX;MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PX" ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2">44 </FONT></P> <P STYLE='PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:ALWAYS'> <HR SIZE="3" COLOR="#999999" WIDTH="100%" ALIGN="CENTER"> <H5 ALIGN="LEFT"><A HREF="#TOC">TABLE OF CONTENTS</A></H5> <P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:0PX;MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PX"><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2"><B> <A NAME="TOC47937_11"></A>ITEM 8.&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;
