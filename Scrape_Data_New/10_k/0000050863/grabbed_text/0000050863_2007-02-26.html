TO PROTECT AGAINST REDUCTIONS IN VALUE AND THE VOLATILITY OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED BALANCE SHEET AND FORECASTED TRANSACTION RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND CURRENCY OPTIONS ARE GENERALLY UTILIZED IN THESE HEDGING PROGRAMS. OUR HEDGING PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ALWAYS ENTIRELY ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS. WE CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL TRENDS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND DETERMINED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT ADVERSE CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES OF 20% FOR ALL CURRENCIES COULD BE EXPERIENCED IN THE NEAR TERM. SUCH ADVERSE CHANGES, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON INCOME BEFORE TAXES OF LESS THAN $30 MILLION AT THE END OF 2006 AND 2005. </DIV> <DIV STYLE="MARGIN-TOP: 9PT; FONT-SIZE: 1PT">&NBSP;</DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT; FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL, HELVETICA; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF"> <B><FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY: 'TIMES NEW ROMAN', TIMES">INTEREST RATES</FONT></B> </DIV> <DIV STYLE="MARGIN-TOP: 9PT; FONT-SIZE: 1PT">&NBSP;</DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT; FONT-FAMILY: 'TIMES NEW ROMAN', TIMES; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF"> THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES IS TO PRESERVE PRINCIPAL WHILE MAXIMIZING YIELDS. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, THE RETURNS ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN FIXED-RATE DEBT ARE GENERALLY BASED ON THE THREE-MONTH LIBOR, OR, IF LONGER TERM, ARE GENERALLY SWAPPED INTO U.S. DOLLAR THREE-MONTH LIBOR-BASED RETURNS. IN ADDITION TO FIXED-RATE DEBT INVESTMENTS, IN 2005 WE ISSUED DEBT. SEE &#147;NOTE 6: BORROWINGS&#148; IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM <FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE: NOWRAP">10-K</FONT> FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. WE CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF THE INTEREST RATES EXPERIENCED IN PRIOR YEARS AND THE DURATION OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DEBT ISSUANCES, AND DETERMINED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT AN ADVERSE CHANGE OF 80 BASIS POINTS (0.80%), APPROXIMATELY 15% OF THE RATE AT DECEMBER 30, 2006 (18% OF THE RATE AT DECEMBER 31, 2005), COULD BE EXPERIENCED IN THE NEAR TERM. A HYPOTHETICAL 0.80% DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET INVESTMENT POSITION OF APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2006 AND $10 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005. THE INCREASE IN EXPOSURE TO AN ADVERSE FAIR VALUE CHANGE FROM DECEMBER 31, 2005 TO DECEMBER 30, 2006 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WHICH INCREASED THE SENSITIVITY OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR CONVERTIBLE DEBT TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. </DIV> <DIV STYLE="MARGIN-TOP: 9PT; FONT-SIZE: 1PT">&NBSP;</DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT; FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL, HELVETICA; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF"> <B><FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY: 'TIMES NEW ROMAN', TIMES">EQUITY SECURITY PRICES</FONT></B> </DIV> <DIV STYLE="MARGIN-TOP: 9PT; FONT-SIZE: 1PT">&NBSP;</DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT; FONT-FAMILY: 'TIMES NEW ROMAN', TIMES; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF"> WE HAVE A PORTFOLIO OF STRATEGIC EQUITY INVESTMENTS THAT INCLUDES MARKETABLE STRATEGIC EQUITY SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVE EQUITY INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS WARRANTS AND OPTIONS, AS WELL AS NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

TO ASSESS THE MARKET PRICE SENSITIVITY OF THESE EQUITY SECURITIES, WE ANALYZED THE HISTORICAL MOVEMENTS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS OF HIGH-TECHNOLOGY STOCK INDICES THAT WE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE. HOWEVER, OUR MARKETABLE STRATEGIC EQUITY PORTFOLIO IS SUBSTANTIALLY CONCENTRATED IN ONE COMPANY AS OF DECEMBER&#160;30, 2006, WHICH WILL AFFECT THE PORTFOLIO&#146;S PRICE VOLATILITY. WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN INVESTMENT IN MICRON WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $236&#160;MILLION AT DECEMBER&#160;30, 2006, OR 55% OF THE TOTAL MARKETABLE STRATEGIC EQUITY PORTFOLIO VALUE INCLUDING EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. DURING 2006, WE SOLD A PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT IN MICRON. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE HIGH-TECHNOLOGY STOCK INDICES AND THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF MICRON&#146;S STOCK, WE ESTIMATED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE PRICES OF THE STOCKS IN OUR MARKETABLE STRATEGIC EQUITY PORTFOLIO COULD EXPERIENCE A LOSS OF 30% IN THE NEAR TERM (40% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005).

SUCH A MOVEMENT AND THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANIES WE INVEST IN, THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF OUR BEING ABLE TO REALIZE OUR INVESTMENTS THROUGH LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH AS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS, OR PRIVATE SALES. THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS INVOLVE A GREAT DEAL OF RISK, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SPECIFIC COMPANY WILL GROW OR BECOME SUCCESSFUL; CONSEQUENTLY, WE COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF OUR INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 30, 2006, OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES HAD A CARRYING AMOUNT OF $2.8 BILLION ($561 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005). THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE INVESTMENTS APPROXIMATED FAIR VALUE AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2006 AND DECEMBER 31, 2005. AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2006, OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES PORTFOLIO WAS CONCENTRATED IN TWO COMPANIES: IMFT AND CLEARWIRE.
