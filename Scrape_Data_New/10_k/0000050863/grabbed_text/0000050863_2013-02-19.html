THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE FROM DECEMBER&NBSP;31, 2011 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE INCLUSION OF $6.2 BILLION OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES ISSUED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012. A HYPOTHETICAL DECREASE IN BENCHMARK INTEREST RATES OF UP TO 1.0%, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INVESTMENT HEDGES, WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER&NBSP;29, 2012 (AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER&NBSP;31, 2011). THE FLUCTUATIONS IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND INDEBTEDNESS REFLECT ONLY THE DIRECT IMPACT OF THE CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES.

THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS INVOLVE A GREAT DEAL OF RISK, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SPECIFIC COMPANY WILL GROW OR BECOME SUCCESSFUL; CONSEQUENTLY, WE COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF OUR INVESTMENT.
