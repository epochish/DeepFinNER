THE INVESTMENT IN MICRON IS PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY OF DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY (DRAM) PRODUCTS. WE ANALYZED THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF MICRON&#146;S STOCK, AND IF THE STOCK BEHAVES WITH THE SAME PRICE VOLATILITY THAT IT HAS IN THE PAST, WE COULD EXPERIENCE A 60% LOSS.
