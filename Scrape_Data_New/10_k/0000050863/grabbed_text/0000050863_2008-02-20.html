OUR HEDGING PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ALWAYS ENTIRELY ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS (SEE &#147;RISK FACTORS&#148; IN PART II, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K). WE CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL TRENDS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND DETERMINED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT A WEIGHTED AVERAGE ADVERSE CHANGE OF 15% IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COULD BE EXPERIENCED IN THE NEAR TERM.

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS IS TO PRESERVE PRINCIPAL WHILE MAXIMIZING YIELDS. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, THE RETURNS ON ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON THREE-MONTH LIBOR, OR, IF THE MATURITIES ARE LONGER THAN THREE MONTHS, THE RETURNS ARE GENERALLY SWAPPED INTO U.S.&#160;DOLLAR THREE-MONTH LIBOR-BASED RETURNS. WE CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF THE INTEREST RATES EXPERIENCED IN PRIOR YEARS AND THE DURATION OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DEBT ISSUANCES, AND DETERMINED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT AN ADVERSE CHANGE OF 80&#160;BASIS POINTS (0.80%), APPROXIMATELY 17% OF THE RATE AT DECEMBER&#160;29, 2007 (15% OF THE RATE AT DECEMBER&#160;30, 2006), COULD BE EXPERIENCED IN THE NEAR TERM. A HYPOTHETICAL 0.80% DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET INVESTMENT POSITION OF APPROXIMATELY $65&#160;MILLION AS OF DECEMBER&#160;29, 2007 AND $50&#160;MILLION AS OF DECEMBER&#160;30, 2006.

FOR OUR INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLICLY TRADED FOR ONLY A LIMITED TIME, WE ANALYZED THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY OF THE RELATED COMPANY BASED ON FREELY TRADED OPTIONS. OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT IS EXCLUDED FROM OUR ANALYSIS, AS THE CARRYING VALUE DOES NOT FLUCTUATE BASED ON MARKET PRICE CHANGES. THEREFORE, THE POTENTIAL FAIR VALUE DECLINE WOULD NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, UNLESS AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT WAS DEEMED NECESSARY. BASED ON OUR SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, WE ESTIMATED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE PRICES OF THE STOCKS OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES COULD EXPERIENCE A LOSS OF 55% IN THE NEAR TERM (30% AS OF DECEMBER&#160;30, 2006). ASSUMING A LOSS OF 55% IN MARKET PRICES, AND AFTER REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS COULD DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $565&#160;MILLION, BASED ON THE VALUE AS OF DECEMBER&#160;29, 2007 (A DECREASE IN VALUE OF $134&#160;MILLION, BASED ON THE VALUE AS OF DECEMBER&#160;30, 2006 USING AN ASSUMED LOSS OF 30%). THIS ESTIMATE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AND ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY. THE INCREASE IN EXPOSURE FROM DECEMBER&#160;30, 2006 TO DECEMBER&#160;29, 2007 IS DUE TO OUR PURCHASE OF VMWARE DURING 2007, ITS STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY, AND THE WEIGHT OF OUR INVESTMENT IN VMWARE IN RELATION TO OUR TOTAL MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES. </DIV> <DIV STYLE="MARGIN-TOP: 9PT; FONT-SIZE: 1PT">&NBSP;</DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT; FONT-FAMILY: 'TIMES NEW ROMAN', TIMES; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF"> MANY OF THE SAME FACTORS THAT COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE MOVEMENT OF EQUITY MARKET PRICES AFFECT OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT QUANTIFY THE IMPACT DIRECTLY. SUCH A MOVEMENT AND THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANIES WE INVEST IN, THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF OUR BEING ABLE TO REALIZE VALUE IN OUR INVESTMENTS THROUGH LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH AS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS, AND PRIVATE SALES. THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS INVOLVE A GREAT DEAL OF RISK, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SPECIFIC COMPANY WILL GROW OR BECOME SUCCESSFUL; CONSEQUENTLY, WE COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF OUR INVESTMENT. OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, EXCLUDING INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD, HAD A CARRYING AMOUNT OF $805&#160;MILLION AS OF DECEMBER&#160;29, 2007 ($733&#160;MILLION AS OF DECEMBER&#160;30, 2006). THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE INVESTMENTS APPROXIMATED FAIR VALUE AS OF DECEMBER&#160;29, 2007 AND DECEMBER&#160;30, 2006. AS OF DECEMBER&#160;29, 2007, THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS WAS $2.6&#160;BILLION ($2.0&#160;BILLION AS OF DECEMBER&#160;30, 2006)&#160;AND CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF OUR INVESTMENT IN IMFT OF $2.2&#160;BILLION ($1.3&#160;BILLION AS OF DECEMBER&#160;30, 2006). </DIV> <P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; FONT-FAMILY: 'TIMES NEW ROMAN', TIMES; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF"> <BR> 45 </DIV><!-- END PAGE WIDTH --> <!-- PAGEBREAK --> <P><HR NOSHADE><P> <H5 ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:ALWAYS"><A HREF="#TOCPAGE">TABLE OF CONTENTS</A></H5><P> <DIV STYLE="WIDTH: 92%; MARGIN-LEFT: 4%"><!-- BEGIN PAGE WIDTH --> <TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; FONT-FAMILY: ARIAL, HELVETICA; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF"> <TR> <TD WIDTH="8%"></TD> <TD WIDTH="92%"></TD> </TR> <TR VALIGN="TOP"> <TD> <B><FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY: 'TIMES NEW ROMAN', TIMES">ITEM&#160;8.&#160;</FONT></B> </TD> <TD> <A NAME='113'></A><B><FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY: 'TIMES NEW ROMAN', TIMES">
