THE IMPAIRMENT WAS PRINCIPALLY BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005 OF MICRON&#146;S FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THE FACT THAT THE MARKET PRICE OF MICRON&#146;S STOCK HAD BEEN BELOW OUR COST BASIS FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, AS WELL AS THE COMPETITIVE PRICING ENVIRONMENT FOR DRAM PRODUCTS. THE INVESTMENT IN MICRON IS PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY OF DRAM PRODUCTS. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE HIGH-TECHNOLOGY STOCK INDICES AND THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF MICRON&#146;S STOCK, WE ESTIMATED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE PRICES OF THE STOCKS IN OUR MARKETABLE STRATEGIC EQUITY PORTFOLIO COULD EXPERIENCE A LOSS OF 40% IN THE NEAR TERM (45% AS OF THE END OF 2004). THE ASSUMED LOSS PERCENTAGE USED IN 2005 WAS LOWER THAN THE ASSUMED LOSS PERCENTAGE IN 2004 DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES IN THE CONCENTRATIONS OF INVESTMENTS AT THE END OF EACH YEAR.
