BUSINESS       General          Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries have     approximately 119,200 employees worldwide engaged in the     research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range     of products in the health care field. Johnson &     Johnson is a holding company, which has more than 250 operating     companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the     world. Johnson & Johnsons primary focus has been     on products related to human health and well-being.     Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New     Jersey in 1887.         The Companys structure is based on the principle of     decentralized management. The Executive Committee of     Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group     responsible for the operations and allocation of the resources     of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the     activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices     and Diagnostics business segments. Each subsidiary within the     business segments is, with some exceptions, managed by citizens     of the country where it is located.      Segments     of Business          Johnson & Johnsons operating companies are     organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical     and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. Additional information     required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the     narrative and tabular (but not the graphic) descriptions of     segments and operating results under the captions     Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of     Operations and Financial Condition on pages 36     through 47 and Note 11 Segments of Business and     Geographic Areas under Notes to Consolidated     Financial Statements on page 59 of the Annual Report,     filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.     Consumer         The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in     the baby care, skin care, oral care, wound care and     womens health care fields, as well as nutritional and     over-the-counter pharmaceutical products. Major brands include     AVEENO®     skin care products;     BAND-AID®     Brand Adhesive Bandages;     CAREFREE®     Pantiliners; CLEAN &     CLEAR®     teen skin care products;     JOHNSONS®     Baby and Adult lines of products;     LISTERINE®     oral care products;     MOTRIN®     IB ibuprofen products;     NEUTROGENA®     skin and hair care products;     RoC®     skin care products;     PEPCID®     AC Acid Controller from Johnson &     Johnson  Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co.;     REMBRANDT®     Brand of oral care products;     SPLENDA®     No Calorie Sweetener;     STAYFREE®     sanitary protection products;     SUDAFED®     cold, flu and allergy products; the broad family of     TYLENOL®     acetaminophen products and Vendôme skin care product lines.     These products are marketed principally to the general public     and sold both to wholesalers and directly to independent and     chain retail outlets throughout the world.     Pharmaceutical         The Pharmaceutical segment includes products in the following     therapeutic areas: anti-infective, antipsychotic,     cardiovascular, contraceptive, dermatology, gastrointestinal,     hematology, immunology, neurology, oncology, pain management,     urology and virology. These products are distributed directly to     retailers, wholesalers and health care professionals for     prescription use by the general public. Key products in the     Pharmaceutical segment include:     RISPERDAL®     oral (risperidone),  a medication that treats the symptoms of     schizophrenia, bipolar mania and irritability associated with     autistic behavior in indicated patients,     RISPERDAL®     CONSTA®     (risperidone), a long-acting injectable, and     INVEGATM     (paliperdone) Extended-Release tablets, for the treatment of     schizophrenia;     REMICADE®     (infliximab), a biologic approved for the treatment of     Crohns disease, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis,     psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and use in the     treatment of rheumatoid arthritis;     PROCRIT®     (Epoetin alfa, sold outside the U.S. as     EPREX®),     a     biotechnology-derived     product that stimulates red blood cell production;     TOPAMAX®     (topiramate), approved for adjunctive and monotherapy use in     epilepsy, as well as for the prophylactic treatment of migranes;     LEVAQUIN®     (levofloxacin) and     FLOXIN®     (ofloxacin), both in the anti-infective field;     ACIPHEX®/PARIET®,     a proton pump inhibitor co-marketed with Eisai Inc.     DURAGESIC®/Fentanyl     Transdermal (fentanyl transdermal system, sold outside the U.S.     as     DUROGESIC®),     a treatment for chronic pain that offers a novel delivery     system;     CONCERTA®     (methylphenidate HCl), a product for the treatment of attention     deficit hyperactivity disorder; and ORTHO     EVRA®      Table of Contents       (norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol transdermal system), the first     contraceptive patch approved by the U.S. Food and Drug     Administration (FDA).     Medical     Devices and Diagnostics         The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment includes a broad     range of products distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and     retailers, used principally in the professional fields by     physicians, nurses, therapists, hospitals, diagnostic     laboratories and clinics. These products include Cordis     circulatory disease management products; DePuys     orthopaedic joint reconstruction and spinal care products;     Ethicons wound care and womens health products;     Ethicon Endo-Surgerys minimally invasive surgical     products; LifeScans blood glucose monitoring and insulin     delivery products; Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics professional     diagnostic products and Vision Cares disposable contact     lenses. Distribution to these health care professional markets     is done both directly and through surgical supply and other     dealers.      Geographic     Areas          The international business of Johnson & Johnson is     conducted by subsidiaries located in 56 countries outside the     United States, which are selling products in virtually all     countries throughout the world. The products made and sold in     the international business include many of those described above     under  Segments of Business      Consumer,  Pharmaceutical and      Medical Devices and Diagnostics.     However, the principal markets, products and methods of     distribution in the international business vary with the country     and the culture. The products sold in international business     include not only those developed in the United States, but also     those developed by subsidiaries abroad.         Investments and activities in some countries outside the United     States are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S.     activities because the investment and commercial climate is     influenced by restrictive economic policies and political     uncertainties.      Raw     Materials          Raw materials essential to Johnson & Johnsons     operating companies businesses are generally readily     available from multiple sources.      Patents     and Trademarks          Johnson & Johnson and its operating companies have made a     practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and     processes where possible. They own or are licensed under a     number of patents relating to its products and manufacturing     processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material     importance to Johnson & Johnson in the operation of its     businesses. Sales of the Companys two largest products,     RISPERDAL®     and     REMICADE®,     accounted for approximately 6% and 5% of Johnson &     Johnsons total revenues, respectively, for fiscal 2007.     Accordingly, the patents related to these products are believed     to be material to Johnson & Johnson as a whole.         During 2004 through 2006,     DURAGESIC®/Fentanyl     Transdermal (fentanyl transdermal system) lost its basic patent     protection and is subject to generic competition in the United     States and certain international markets, and the basic patents     covering     EPREX®     (Epoetin alfa) have expired and increased biosimilar competition     in international markets is expected.     DURAGESIC®/Fentanyl     Transdermal sales declined by 10.1% to $1.2 billion in 2007     as compared to 2006, due to the impact of generic competition.     Combined sales of     DURAGESIC®/Fentanyl     Transdermal and     EPREX®     accounted for approximately 4% of Johnson &     Johnsons worldwide sales in 2007. The material patents     that expired in 2007 or will expire in 2008 are related to     RISPERDAL®,     which expired in the United States in December 2007, and     TOPAMAX®,     which is scheduled to expire in the United States in September     2008. The Company has received a pediatric extension for     RISPERDAL®     oral from the FDA, which grants market exclusivity in the United     States through June 2008. The Company is on target to file for a     pediatric extension for     TOPAMAX®,     which, if obtained from the FDA, would grant market exclusivity     in the United States until March 2009.        2    Table of Contents       Johnson & Johnsons operating companies have made a     practice of selling their products under trademarks and of     obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available     means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the     United States and other countries where such products are     marketed. Johnson & Johnson considers these trademarks in     the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of     its businesses.      Seasonality          Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of     seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth     quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects     increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and     research and development activity.      Competition          In all of their product lines, Johnson & Johnsons     operating companies compete with companies both large and small,     located throughout the world. Competition is strong in all     product lines without regard to the number and size of the     competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving     the development and the improvement of new and existing products     and processes, is particularly significant. The development of     new and improved products is important to Johnson &     Johnsons success in all areas of its businesses. This also     includes protecting the Companys portfolio of intellectual     property. The competitive environment requires substantial     investments in continuing research and multiple sales forces. In     addition, the development and maintenance of customer acceptance     of the products of Johnson & Johnsons consumer     businesses involves significant expenditures for advertising and     promotion.      Research     and Development          Research activities represent a significant part of Johnson     & Johnsons subsidiaries businesses. Major     research facilities are located not only in the United States     but also in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France,     Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United     Kingdom. The costs of worldwide Company-sponsored research     activities relating to the development of new products,     improvement of existing products, technical support of products     and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection     of consumers and patients, excluding in-process research and     development charges, amounted to $7,680 million,     $7,125 million and $6,462 million for fiscal years     2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These costs are charged     directly to income in the year in which incurred.      Environment          Johnson & Johnsons operating companies are subject to     a variety of federal, state and local environmental protection     measures. Johnson & Johnson believes that its operations     comply in all material respects with applicable environmental     laws and regulations. Johnson & Johnsons compliance     with these requirements did not during the past year, and is not     expected to, have a material effect upon its capital     expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.      Regulation          Most of Johnson & Johnsons businesses are subject to     varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in     which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward     increasingly stringent regulation. In the United States, the     drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been     subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies,     primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing,     advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of     broad regulatory powers by the FDA continues to result in     increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required     for FDA clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding     increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends     are also evident in major markets outside of the United States.         The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a     subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental     agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the United     States, attention has been focused on drug prices and profits     and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for     particular drugs or recommend, use or purchase particular     medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the     market        3    Table of Contents       place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical     device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization     and the quality and costs of health care. In the United States,     implementation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement     and Modernization Act of 2003 and the Deficit Reduction Act of     2005 may cause uncertainty in reimbursement levels in certain     product segments.         The regulatory agencies under whose purview Johnson &     Johnsons operating companies operate have administrative     powers that may subject those companies to such actions as     product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other     civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, Johnson &     Johnsons operating companies may deem it advisable to     initiate product recalls.         In addition, business practices in the health care industry have     come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United     States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and     resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of     significant civil and criminal penalties.

CHANGES     IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND     FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE           Not applicable.           Item 9A.       CONTROLS     AND PROCEDURES       Disclosure Controls and Procedures.  At the end     of the period covered by this report, the Company evaluated the     effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure     controls and procedures. The Companys disclosure controls     and procedures are designed to ensure that information required     to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or     submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,     summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in     the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and     procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures     designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by     the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the     Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the     Companys management, including its principal executive and     principal financial officers, or persons performing similar     functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding     required disclosure. William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief     Executive Officer, and Dominic J. Caruso, Chief Financial     Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on     this evaluation, Messrs. Weldon and Caruso concluded that,     as of the end of the period covered by this report, the     Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective.     Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over     Financial Reporting.  Under Section 404 of the     Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the     effectiveness of the Companys internal control over     financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and     report, based on that assessment, whether the Companys     internal control over financial reporting is effective.         Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and     maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.     The Companys internal control over financial reporting is     designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability     of the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of     financial statements in accordance with generally accepted     accounting principles.         Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well     designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control     over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide     only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement     preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements.     Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to     future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become     inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree     of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.         The Companys management has assessed the effectiveness of     the Companys internal control over financial reporting as     of December 30, 2007. In making this assessment, the     Company used the criteria established by the Committee of     Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in     Internal Control-Integrated Framework. These     criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk     assessment, control activities, information and communication,     and monitoring. The Companys assessment included extensive     documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating     effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting.         Based on the Companys processes and assessment, as     described above, management has concluded that, as of     December 30, 2007, the Companys internal control over     financial reporting was effective.         The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over     financial reporting as of December 30, 2007 has been     audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered     public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears     in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting     Firm on page 75 of the Annual Report, which is     incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 to     this Report on     Form 10-K.
