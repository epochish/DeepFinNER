BUSINESS  General       Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries have approximately 122,200 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. Johnson & Johnson has more than 250 operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. Johnson & Johnsons primary focus has been on products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887.        The Companys structure is based on the principle of decentralized management. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics business segments. Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with some exceptions, managed by citizens of the country where it is located.   Segments of Business       Johnson & Johnson is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular (but not the graphic) descriptions of segments and operating results under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition on pages 38 through 49 and Note 11 Segments of Business and Geographic Areas under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 61 of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.   Consumer       The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby and kids care, skin care, oral care, wound care and womens health care fields, as well as nutritional and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products. Major brands include AVEENO® skin care products; BAND-AID® Brand Adhesive Bandages; CAREFREE® Pantiliners; CLEAN & CLEAR® teen skin care products; JOHNSONS® Baby and Adult lines of products; MOTRIN® IB ibuprofen products; NEUTROGENA® skin and hair care products; RoC® skin care products; PEPCID® AC Acid Controller from Johnson & Johnson  Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co.; REMBRANDT® Brand of oral care products; SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener; STAYFREE® sanitary protection products; and the broad family of TYLENOL® acetaminophen products. These products are marketed principally to the general public and sold both to wholesalers and directly to independent and chain retail outlets throughout the world.        In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. comprising products related to self-medications for oral care, upper-respiratory health, tobacco dependence, gastrointestinal health, skin care, eye care and hair growth. Major brands of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. include LISTERINE® oral care products, the NICORETTE® line of smoking cessation treatments, and SUDAFED® cold, flu and allergy products.   Pharmaceutical       The Pharmaceutical segment includes products in the following therapeutic areas: anti-fungal, anti-infective, cardiovascular, contraceptive, dermatology, gastrointestinal, hematology, immunology, neurology, oncology, pain management, psychotropic (central nervous system), urology and virology. These products are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers and health care professionals for prescription use by the general public. Key products in the Pharmaceutical segment include: RISPERDAL® (risperidone) and RISPERDAL® CONSTA® (risperidone long-acting injection), for treatment of the symptoms of schizophrenia; PROCRIT® (Epoetin alfa, sold outside the U.S. as EPREX®), a biotechnology-derived product that stimulates red blood cell production; REMICADE® (infliximab), a monoclonal antibody therapy indicated to treat the symptoms of Crohns disease, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, chronic severe plaque psoriasis and use in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis; TOPAMAX® (topiramate), an anti-epileptic and migraine prevention treatment; LEVAQUIN® (levofloxacin) and FLOXIN® (ofloxacin), both in the anti-infective field; DURAGESIC®/Fentanyl        Transdermal (fentanyl transdermal system, sold outside the U.S. as DUROGESIC®), a treatment for chronic pain that offers a novel delivery system; ORTHO EVRA® (norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol transdermal system), the first contraceptive patch approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN® LO (norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol), a low dose oral contraceptive; CONCERTA® (methylphenidate HCl) a product for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; and NATRECOR® (nesiritide), a product for the treatment of patients with acutely decompensated congestive heart failure who have dyspnea at rest or with minimal activity.    Medical Devices and Diagnostics       The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment includes a broad range of products distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, therapists, hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and clinics. These products include Cordis circulatory disease management products; DePuys orthopaedic joint reconstruction and spinal care products; Ethicons wound care and womens health products; Ethicon Endo-Surgerys minimally invasive surgical products; LifeScans blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery products; Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics professional diagnostic products and Vision Cares disposable contact lenses. Distribution to these health care professional markets is done both directly and through surgical supply and other dealers.   Geographic Areas       The international business of Johnson & Johnson is conducted by subsidiaries located in 56 countries outside the United States, which are selling products in virtually all countries throughout the world. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under Business  Consumer,  Pharmaceutical and  Medical Devices and Diagnostics. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include not only those which were developed in the United States, but also those which were developed by subsidiaries abroad.        Investments and activities in some countries outside the United States are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate is influenced by restrictive economic policies and political uncertainties.   Raw Materials       Raw materials essential to Johnson & Johnsons operating companies businesses are generally readily available from multiple sources.   Patents and Trademarks       Johnson & Johnson has made a practice of obtaining patent protection on its products and processes where possible. Johnson & Johnson owns or is licensed under a number of patents relating to its products and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of its business. Sales of the Companys two largest products, RISPERDAL®/RISPERDAL® CONSTA® and PROCRIT®/EPREX®, accounted for approximately 8% and 6% of Johnson & Johnsons total revenues, respectively, for fiscal 2006. Accordingly, the patents related to these products are believed to be material to Johnson & Johnson as a whole.        During 2004, 2005 and 2006, DURAGESIC®/Fentanyl Transdermal (fentanyl transdermal system) lost its basic patent protection and is subject to generic competition in the United States and certain international markets and EPREX® (Epoetin alfa) lost its basic patent protection and is subject to generic competition in international markets. DURAGESIC®/Fentanyl Transdermal sales declined by 18.3% to $1.3 billion in 2006 as compared to 2005, due to the impact of generic competition. Regarding EPREX®, generic competition will be limited in the near term due to the lack of approved generic compounds. Combined sales of DURAGESIC®/Fentanyl Transdermal and EPREX® accounted for approximately 5% of Johnson & Johnsons worldwide sales in 2006. The only material patents scheduled to expire within the next two years are related to  2       RISPERDAL®, which is scheduled to expire in the United States in December 2007, and TOPAMAX®, which is scheduled to expire in the United States in September 2008. The Company has submitted data to the FDA in order to obtain a pediatric extension for RISPERDAL®, which, if approved, would grant exclusivity in the United States through June 2008. The TOPAMAX® patent also carries the possibility of a pediatric extension in the United States, which, if obtained, would grant exclusivity in the United States until March 2009.         Johnson & Johnson has made a practice of selling its products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. Johnson & Johnsons trademarks are protected by registration in the United States and other countries where its products are marketed. Johnson & Johnson considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its business.   Seasonality       Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research grants.   Competition       In all of their product lines, Johnson & Johnson companies compete with companies both large and small, located throughout the world. Competition is strong in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and improved products is important to Johnson & Johnsons success in all areas of its business. This competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and multiple sales forces. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer acceptance of the products of Johnson & Johnsons consumer businesses involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.   Research and Development       Research activities represent a significant part of Johnson & Johnsons business. Major research facilities are located not only in the United States but also in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom. The costs of worldwide Company-sponsored research activities relating to the development of new products, improvement of existing products, technical support of products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of consumers and patients, excluding in-process research and development charges, amounted to $7,125 million, $6,462 million and $5,344 million for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These costs are charged directly to income in the year in which incurred.   Environment       Johnson & Johnson companies are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental protection measures. Johnson & Johnson believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Johnson & Johnsons compliance with these requirements did not, during the past year, and is not expected to, have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.   Regulation       Most of Johnson & Johnsons business is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In the United States, the drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the FDA continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA clearance of new drugs and devices  3       and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the United States.         The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the United States, attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care. In the United States, implementation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 may cause uncertainty in reimbursement levels in certain product segments.        The regulatory agencies under whose purview Johnson & Johnson companies operate have administrative powers that may subject those companies to such actions as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, Johnson & Johnsons operating companies may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls.        In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.

PROPERTIES       Johnson & Johnson and its worldwide subsidiaries operate 148 manufacturing facilities occupying approximately 22.6 million square feet of floor space.  4            The manufacturing facilities are used by the industry segments of Johnson & Johnsons business approximately as follows:                     Square Feet   Segment  (in thousands)          Consumer           8,410       Pharmaceutical           6,743       Medical Devices and Diagnostics           7,417                    Worldwide Total           22,570                       Within the United States, 7 facilities are used by the Consumer segment, 14 by the Pharmaceutical segment and 42 by the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment. Johnson & Johnsons manufacturing operations outside the United States are often conducted in facilities that serve more than one segment of the business.        The locations of the manufacturing facilities by major geographic areas of the world are as follows:                             Number       of  Square Feet   Geographic Area  Facilities  (in thousands)            United States           63       7,448       Europe           37       8,667       Western Hemisphere, excluding U.S.A.           16       3,026       Africa, Asia and Pacific           32       3,429                           Worldwide Total           148       22,570                              In addition to the manufacturing facilities discussed above, Johnson & Johnson maintains numerous office and warehouse facilities throughout the world. Research facilities are also discussed in Item 1 under Business  Research.        Johnson & Johnson generally seeks to own its manufacturing facilities, although some, principally in locations abroad, are leased. Office and warehouse facilities are often leased.        Johnson & Johnsons properties are maintained in good operating condition and repair and are well utilized.        For information regarding lease obligations, see Note 4 Rental Expense and Lease Commitments under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 57 of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K. Segment information on additions to property, plant and equipment is contained in Note 11 Segments of Business and Geographic Areas under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 61 of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.   Item 3.     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS       The information set forth in Note 18 Legal Proceedings under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 69 through 74 of the Annual Report is incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.        The Company or its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state laws, in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and future remediation. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings, in the opinion of the Company, such proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the Company.  5       Item 4.

Item 9.  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS     ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE         Not applicable.  8              Item 9A.       CONTROLS AND     PROCEDURES         Disclosure Controls and Procedures. At the end of the period covered by this report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dominic J. Caruso, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Weldon and Caruso concluded that, as of the date of their evaluation, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective.        Internal Control. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is included in this Report on Form 10-K in this Item 9A. During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2006, there were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.        Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective.        Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.        Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.        The Companys management has assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The Companys assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting.        On December 20, 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. Due to the close proximity of the completion date of the acquisition to the date of managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting, management excluded the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting.        The total assets of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc., which were primarily intangible assets and goodwill, represented 26% of the Companys total assets for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006.  9            The operating results of the Consumer Healthcare business acquired from Pfizer Inc. on December 20, 2006 will be reported in the Companys financial statements beginning in 2007, as 2006 results subsequent to the acquisition date were not significant.        Based on the Companys processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2006, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective.        Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on page 77 of the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.
