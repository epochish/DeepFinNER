BUSINESS       General          Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries have     approximately 115,500 employees worldwide engaged in the     research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range     of products in the health care field. Johnson &     Johnson is a holding company, which has more than 250 operating     companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the     world. Johnson & Johnsons primary focus has been     on products related to human health and well-being.     Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New     Jersey in 1887.         The Companys structure is based on the principle of     decentralized management. The Executive Committee of     Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group     responsible for the operations and allocation of the resources     of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the     activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices     and Diagnostics business segments. Each subsidiary within the     business segments is, with some exceptions, managed by citizens     of the country where it is located.      Segments     of Business          Johnson & Johnsons operating companies are     organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical     and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. Additional information     required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the     narrative and tabular (but not the graphic) descriptions of     segments and operating results under the captions     Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of     Operations and Financial Condition on pages 26     through 35 and Note 18 Segments of Business and     Geographic Areas under Notes to Consolidated     Financial Statements on page 55 of the Annual Report,     filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.     Consumer         The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in     the baby care, skin care, oral care, wound care and womens     health care fields, as well as nutritional and over-the-counter     pharmaceutical products, and wellness and prevention platforms.     The Baby Care franchise includes the     JOHNSONS®      Baby line of products. Major brands in the Skin Care franchise     include the     AVEENO®;      CLEAN &     CLEAR®;      JOHNSONS®      Adult;     NEUTROGENA®;      RoC®;      LUBRIDERM®;      Dabao; and Vendôme product lines. The Oral Care franchise     includes the     LISTERINE®      and     REACH®      oral care lines of products. The Wound Care franchise includes     BAND-AID®      brand adhesive bandages and     PURELL®      instant hand sanitizer products. Major brands in the     Womens Health franchise are the     CAREFREE®      Pantiliners;     STAYFREE®      sanitary protection products; and Vania Expansion products. The     nutritional and over-the-counter lines include     SPLENDA®,      No Calorie Sweetener;  the broad family of     TYLENOL®      acetaminophen products;     SUDAFED®      cold, flu and allergy products;     ZYRTEC®      allergy products;     MOTRIN®      IB ibuprofen products; and     PEPCID®      AC Acid Controller from Johnson & Johnson  Merck     Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co. These products are marketed to the     general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors     throughout the world.     Pharmaceutical         The Pharmaceutical segment includes products in the following     therapeutic areas: anti-infective, antipsychotic,     cardiovascular, contraceptive, dermatology, gastrointestinal,     hematology, immunology, neurology, oncology, pain management,     urology and virology. These products are distributed directly to     retailers, wholesalers and health care professionals for     prescription use. Key products in the Pharmaceutical segment     include:     REMICADE®      (infliximab), a biologic approved for the treatment of a number     of immune mediated inflammatory diseases;     PROCRIT®      (Epoetin alfa, sold outside the U.S. as     EPREX®),      a     biotechnology-derived     product that stimulates red blood cell production;     LEVAQUIN®      (levofloxacin) in the anti-infective field;     RISPERDAL®      CONSTA®      (risperidone), a long-acting injectable for the treatment of     schizophrenia;     CONCERTA®      (methylphenidate HCl), a product for the treatment of attention     deficit hyperactivity disorder;     ACIPHEX®/PARIET®,      a proton pump inhibitor co-marketed with Eisai Inc.;     DURAGESIC®/Fentanyl      Transdermal (fentanyl transdermal system, sold outside the U.S.     as     DUROGESIC®),      a treatment for chronic pain that offers a novel delivery     system;     VELCADE®      (bortezomib), a product for the treatment for multiple myeloma;     PREZISTA®      (darunavir) for the treatment of HIV/AIDS patients; and     INVEGA®      (paliperidone), a once-daily atypical antipsychotic.       Table of Contents      Medical     Devices and Diagnostics         The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment includes a broad     range of products distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and     retailers, used principally in the professional fields by     physicians, nurses, therapists, hospitals, diagnostic     laboratories and clinics. These products include Cordis     circulatory disease management products; DePuys     orthopaedic joint reconstruction, spinal care and sports     medicine products; Ethicons surgical care, aesthetics and     womens health products; Ethicon Endo-Surgerys     minimally invasive surgical products; LifeScans blood     glucose monitoring and insulin delivery products; Ortho-Clinical     Diagnostics professional diagnostic products; and     Vistakons disposable contact lenses. Distribution to these     health care professional markets is done both directly and     through surgical supply and other dealers.      Geographic     Areas          The international business of Johnson & Johnson is     conducted by subsidiaries located in 59 countries outside the     United States, which are selling products in virtually all     countries throughout the world. The products made and sold in     the international business include many of those described above     under  Segments of Business      Consumer,  Pharmaceutical and      Medical Devices and Diagnostics.     However, the principal markets, products and methods of     distribution in the international business vary with the country     and the culture. The products sold in international business     include not only those developed in the United States, but also     those developed by subsidiaries abroad.         Investments and activities in some countries outside the United     States are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S.     activities because the investment and commercial climate is     influenced by restrictive economic policies and political     uncertainties.      Raw     Materials          Raw materials essential to Johnson & Johnsons     operating companies businesses are generally readily     available from multiple sources.      Patents     and Trademarks          Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries have made a practice     of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes     where possible. They own or are licensed under a number of     patents relating to their products and manufacturing processes,     which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance     to Johnson & Johnson in the operation of its businesses.     Sales of the Companys largest product,     REMICADE®      (infliximab), accounted for approximately 7% of Johnson &     Johnsons total revenues for fiscal 2009. Accordingly, the     patents related to this product are believed to be material to     Johnson & Johnson.         During 2007 through 2009,     RISPERDAL®      (risperidone) oral and     TOPAMAX®      (topiramate) lost basic patent protection and market exclusivity     and became subject to generic competition in the United States     and international markets.     RISPERDAL®      oral sales declined by 57.7% and 37.8% in 2009 and 2008,     respectively.     TOPAMAX®      lost market exclusivity in March 2009 and sales declined by     57.9% as compared to 2008. The next significant patent scheduled     to expire on December 20, 2010 is for     LEVAQUIN®      (levofloxacin), which accounted for 2.5% of the Companys     2009 sales. A pediatric extension for     LEVAQUIN®      was granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration     (FDA), which extends market exclusivity in the     United States through June 20, 2011.         Johnson & Johnsons operating companies have made a     practice of selling their products under trademarks and of     obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available     means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the     United States and other countries where such products are     marketed. Johnson & Johnson considers these trademarks in     the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of     its businesses.      Seasonality          Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of     seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth     quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects     increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and     research and development activity.         2    Table of Contents       Competition          In all of their product lines, Johnson & Johnsons     operating companies compete with companies both large and small,     and both local and global, located throughout the world.     Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the     number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition     in research, involving the development and the improvement of     new and existing products and processes, is particularly     significant. The development of new and innovative products is     important to Johnson & Johnsons success in all areas     of its business. This also includes protecting the     Companys portfolio of intellectual property. The     competitive environment requires substantial investments in     continuing research and in maintaining sales forces. In     addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for     the Companys consumer products involves significant     expenditures for advertising and promotion.      Research     and Development          Research activities represent a significant part of Johnson     & Johnsons subsidiaries businesses. Major     research facilities are located not only in the United States,     but also in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany,     India, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United     Kingdom. The costs of worldwide Company-sponsored research     activities relating to the development of new products,     improvement of existing products, technical support of products     and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection     of consumers and patients (excluding purchased in-process     research and development charges for fiscal 2008 and 2007),     amounted to $7.0 billion, $7.6 billion and     $7.7 billion for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007,     respectively. These costs are charged directly to expense, or     directly against income, in the year in which incurred.      Environment          Johnson & Johnsons operating companies are subject to     a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection     measures. Johnson & Johnson believes that its operations     comply in all material respects with applicable environmental     laws and regulations. Johnson & Johnsons compliance     with these requirements did not during the past year, and is not     expected to, have a material effect upon its capital     expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.      Regulation          Most of Johnson & Johnsons businesses are subject to     varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in     which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward     increasingly stringent regulation. In the United States, the     drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been     subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies,     primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing,     advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of     broad regulatory powers by the FDA continues to result in     increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required     for FDA clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding     increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends     are also evident in major markets outside of the United States.         The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a     subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental     agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the United     States, attention has been focused on drug prices and profits     and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for     particular drugs or recommend, use or purchase particular     medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the     market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and     medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device     utilization and the quality and costs of health care.         The regulatory agencies under whose purview Johnson &     Johnsons operating companies operate have administrative     powers that may subject those companies to such actions as     product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other     civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, Johnson &     Johnsons operating companies may deem it advisable to     initiate product recalls.         In addition, business practices in the health care industry have     come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United     States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and     resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of     significant civil and criminal penalties.         3    Table of Contents            Available     Information           The Companys main corporate Web site address is     www.jnj.com.

CHANGES     IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND     FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE           Not applicable.           Item 9A.     CONTROLS     AND PROCEDURES       Disclosure Controls and Procedures.  At the end     of the period covered by this report, the Company evaluated the     effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure     controls and procedures. The Companys disclosure controls     and procedures are designed to ensure that information required     to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or     submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,     summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the     SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures     include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to     ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company     in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act     is accumulated and communicated to the Companys     management, including its principal executive and principal     financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as     appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required     disclosure. William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief Executive     Officer, and Dominic J. Caruso, Chief Financial Officer,     reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this     evaluation, Messrs. Weldon and Caruso concluded that, as of     the end of the period covered by this report, the Companys     disclosure controls and procedures were effective.     Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial     Reporting.  Under Section 404 of the     Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the     effectiveness of the Companys internal control over     financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and     report, based on that assessment, whether the Companys     internal control over financial reporting is effective.         Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and     maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.     The Companys internal control over financial reporting is     designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability     of the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of     external financial statements in accordance with generally     accepted accounting principles.         Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well     designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control     over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide     only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement     preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements.     Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to     future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become     inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree     of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.         The Companys management has assessed the effectiveness of     the Companys internal control over financial reporting as     of January 3, 2010. In making this assessment, the Company     used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring     Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in     Internal Control-Integrated Framework. These     criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk     assessment, control activities, information and communication,     and monitoring. The Companys assessment included extensive     documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating     effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting.         Based on the Companys processes and assessment, as     described above, management has concluded that, as of     January 3, 2010, the Companys internal control over     financial reporting was effective.         The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over     financial reporting as of January 3, 2010 has been audited     by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public     accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears in the     Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting     Firm on page 64 of the Annual Report, which is     incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 to     this Report on     Form 10-K.     Changes in Internal Control Over Financial     Reporting.  During the fiscal quarter ended     January 3, 2010, there were no changes in the     Companys internal control over financial reporting     identified in connection with the evaluation of such referred to     above in this Item 9A that have materially affected, or are     reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys     internal control over financial reporting.
