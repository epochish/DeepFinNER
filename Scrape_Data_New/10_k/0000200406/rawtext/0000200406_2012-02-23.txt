BUSINESS  General  Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 117,900 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. Johnson & Johnson is a holding company, which has more than 250 operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. Johnson & Johnsons primary focus has been on products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887.  The Companys structure is based on the principle of decentralized management. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics business segments. In line with the principle of decentralized management, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans, as well as the day-to-day operations of those companies, and each subsidiary within the business segments is, with some exceptions, managed by citizens of the country where it is located.  Segments of Business  Johnson & Johnsons operating companies are organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular (but not the graphic) descriptions of segments and operating results under the captions Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition on pages 26 through 36 and Note 18 Segments of Business and Geographic Areas under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 56 of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.  Consumer  The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, skin care, oral care, wound care and womens health fields, as well as nutritional and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products, and wellness and prevention platforms. The Baby Care franchise includes the JOHNSONS® Baby line of products. Major brands in the Skin Care franchise include the AVEENO®; CLEAN & CLEAR®; JOHNSONS® Adult; NEUTROGENA®; RoC®; LUBRIDERM®; DABAO; and VENDÔME product lines. The Oral Care franchise includes the LISTERINE® and REACH® oral care lines of products. The Wound Care franchise includes BAND-AID® brand adhesive bandages and NEOSPORIN® First Aid products. Major brands in the Womens Health franchise are the CAREFREE® Pantiliners; o.b.® tampons and STAYFREE® sanitary protection products. The nutritional and over-the-counter lines include SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener; the broad family of TYLENOL® acetaminophen products; SUDAFED® cold, flu and allergy products; ZYRTEC® allergy products; MOTRIN® IB ibuprofen products; and PEPCID® AC Acid Controller. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world.  Pharmaceutical  The Pharmaceutical segment includes products in the following areas: anti-infective, antipsychotic, contraceptive, dermatology, gastrointestinal, hematology, immunology, infectious diseases, neurology, oncology, pain management, thrombosis and vaccines. These products are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers and health care professionals for prescription use. Key products in the Pharmaceutical segment include:    Table of Contents  REMICADE® (infliximab), a treatment for a number of immune mediated inflammatory diseases; STELARA® (ustekinumab), a treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis; SIMPONI® (golimumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis; VELCADE® (bortezomib), a treatment for multiple myeloma; ZYTIGA® (abiraterone acetate), a treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; PREZISTA® (darunavir), INTELENCE® (etravirine) and EDURANT® (rilpivirine), treatments for HIV/AIDS; INCIVO® (telaprevir), for the treatment of hepatitis C; NUCYNTA® (tapentadol), a treatment for moderate to severe acute pain; INVEGA® SUSTENNA® (paliperidone palmitate), for the acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults; RISPERDAL® CONSTA® (risperidone), a treatment for the management of Bipolar I Disorder and schizophrenia; XARELTO® (rivaroxaban), a treatment for the prevention of thrombosis following total hip or knee replacement surgery and for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation; PROCRIT® (Epoetin alfa, sold outside the U.S. as EPREX®), to stimulate red blood cell production; LEVAQUIN® (levofloxacin), for the treatment of bacterial infections; CONCERTA® (methylphenidate HCl), a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; ACIPHEX®/PARIET®, a proton pump inhibitor co-marketed with Eisai Inc.; and DURAGESIC®/Fentanyl Transdermal (fentanyl transdermal system, sold outside the U.S. as DUROGESIC®), a treatment for chronic pain that offers a novel delivery system.  Medical Devices and Diagnostics  The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment includes a broad range of products distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, therapists, hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and clinics. These products include Cardiovascular Cares electrophysiology and circulatory disease management products; DePuys orthopaedic joint reconstruction, spinal care, neurological and sports medicine products; Diabetes Cares blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery products; Ethicons surgical care, aesthetics and womens health products; Ethicon Endo-Surgerys minimally invasive surgical products and advanced sterilization products; Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics professional diagnostic products; and Vision Cares disposable contact lenses. Distribution to these health care professional markets is done both directly and through surgical supply and other distributors.  Geographic Areas  The business of Johnson & Johnson is conducted by more than 250 operating companies located in 60 countries, including the United States, which sell products in virtually all countries throughout the world. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under Segments of BusinessConsumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include not only those developed in the United States, but also those developed by subsidiaries abroad.  Investments and activities in some countries outside the United States are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by restrictive economic policies and political uncertainties.   Raw Materials  Raw materials essential to the business of Johnson & Johnsons operating companies are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company. Patents and Trademarks  Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own or are licensed under a number of patents relating to their products and    2    Table of Contents  manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to Johnson & Johnson in the operation of its businesses. Sales of the Companys largest product, REMICADE® (infliximab), accounted for 8.4% of Johnson & Johnsons total revenues for fiscal 2011. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to Johnson & Johnson.  In June of 2011, LEVAQUIN® lost market exclusivity and became subject to generic competition in the United States. Sales of LEVAQUIN® declined 54.1% in 2011 as compared to 2010.  Johnson & Johnsons operating companies have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the United States and other countries where such products are marketed. Johnson & Johnson considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.  Seasonality  Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity.  Competition  In all of their product lines, Johnson & Johnsons operating companies compete with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products is important to the Companys success in all areas of its business. This also includes protecting the Companys portfolio of intellectual property. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and in maintaining sales forces. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Companys consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.  Research and Development  Research activities represent a significant part of Johnson & Johnsons subsidiaries businesses. Research and development expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, improving existing products, as well as demonstrating product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. Worldwide costs of research and development activities amounted to $7.5 billion, $6.8 billion and $7.0 billion for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Major research facilities are located not only in the United States, but also in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom.  Environment  Johnson & Johnsons operating companies are subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Companys compliance with these requirements did not during the past year, and is not expected to, have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.  Regulation  Most of Johnson & Johnsons businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In    3    Table of Contents  the United States, the drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the United States.  The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the United States, attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care.  The regulatory agencies under whose purview Johnson & Johnsons operating companies operate have administrative powers that may subject those companies to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, Johnson & Johnsons operating companies may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls.  In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  Some important factors that could cause the Companys actual results to differ from the Companys expectations in any forward-looking statements in this Report are set forth in Exhibit 99 to this Report on Form 10-K.      Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS  Not applicable.      Item 2. PROPERTIES Johnson & Johnsons subsidiaries operate 139 manufacturing facilities occupying approximately 21.8 million square feet of floor space.    4    Table of Contents The manufacturing facilities are used by the industry segments of Johnson & Johnsons business approximately as follows:             Segment    Square Feet(in thousands)     Consumer      7,216      Pharmaceutical      7,606      Medical Devices and Diagnostics      6,955                   Worldwide Total      21,777                  Within the United States, 8 facilities are used by the Consumer segment, 10 by the Pharmaceutical segment and 34 by the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment. The Companys manufacturing operations outside the United States are often conducted in facilities that serve more than one business segment.  The locations of the manufacturing facilities by major geographic areas of the world are as follows:                Geographic Area    Number ofFacilities      Square Feet(in thousands)     United States      52         6,537      Europe      37         8,137      Western Hemisphere, excluding U.S.      17         3,455      Africa, Asia and Pacific      33         3,648                              Worldwide Total      139         21,777                             In addition to the manufacturing facilities discussed above, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries maintain numerous office and warehouse facilities throughout the world. Research facilities are also discussed in Item 1 under BusinessResearch and Development.  Johnson & Johnsons subsidiaries generally seek to own their manufacturing facilities, although some, principally in locations abroad, are leased. Office and warehouse facilities are often leased.  The Company is committed to maintaining all of its properties in good operating condition and repair, and the facilities are well utilized.  During the first fiscal quarter of 2011, a consent decree was signed with the FDA, which requires McNEIL-PPC, Inc. to take enhanced measures to remediate certain facilities it operates. McNEIL-PPC voluntarily shut down its Fort Washington, Pennsylvania facility in April 2010. This facility will remain shut down until rebuilding is complete, a third-party consultant certifies that its operations will be in compliance with applicable law, and the FDA concurs with the third-party certification. A discussion of this matter can be found under the heading Government ProceedingsMcNeil Consumer Healthcare in Note 21 Legal Proceedings under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 63 of the Annual Report, which is filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K. For information regarding lease obligations, see Note 16 Rental Expense and Lease Commitments under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 54 of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K. Segment information on additions to property, plant and equipment is contained in Note 18 Segments of Business and Geographic Areas under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 56 of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.    5    Table of Contents   Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  The information set forth in Note 21 Legal Proceedings under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 58 through 67 of the Annual Report is incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.  In addition, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are from time to time party to government investigations, inspections or other proceedings relating to environmental matters, including their compliance with applicable environmental laws. In connection with a routine inspection of a subsidiarys manufacturing facility, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (the Department) has alleged violation of regulations dealing with the handling of certain wastes. The Company believes that adequate defenses to those allegations exist and is presently in discussions with the Department regarding the validity of such allegations. Although the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any proceeding that may be brought regarding these matters, the Company expects that this matter will be resolved without significant penalties or other adverse impact to the Company.

At the end of the period covered by this report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dominic J. Caruso, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Weldon and Caruso concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective.    8    Table of Contents Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  The Companys management has assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2012. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The Companys assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting.  Based on the Companys processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of January 1, 2012, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective.  The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2012 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on page 68 of the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the fiscal quarter ended January 1, 2012, there were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
