BUSINESS        General          Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries have     approximately 114,000 employees worldwide engaged in the     research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range     of products in the health care field. Johnson &     Johnson is a holding company, which has more than 250 operating     companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the     world. Johnson & Johnsons primary focus has been     on products related to human health and well-being.     Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New     Jersey in 1887.         The Companys structure is based on the principle of     decentralized management. The Executive Committee of     Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group     responsible for the operations and allocation of the resources     of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the     activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices     and Diagnostics business segments. Each subsidiary within the     business segments is, with some exceptions, managed by citizens     of the country where it is located.      Segments     of Business          Johnson & Johnsons operating companies are     organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical     and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. Additional information     required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the     narrative and tabular (but not the graphic) descriptions of     segments and operating results under the captions     Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of     Operations and Financial Condition on pages 30 through 40     and Note 18 Segments of Business and Geographic     Areas under Notes to Consolidated Financial     Statements on page 61 of the Annual Report, filed as     Exhibit 13 to this Report on     Form 10-K.     Consumer         The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in     the baby care, skin care, oral care, wound care and womens     health care fields, as well as nutritional and     over-the-counter     pharmaceutical products, and wellness and prevention platforms.     The Baby Care franchise includes the     JOHNSONS®      Baby line of products. Major brands in the Skin Care franchise     include the     AVEENO®;      CLEAN &     CLEAR®;      JOHNSONS®      Adult;     NEUTROGENA®;      RoC®;      LUBRIDERM®;      DABAOtm;      and Vendôme product lines.

The Wound Care franchise includes     BAND-AID®      brand adhesive bandages and     Neosporin®      First Aid products.

The nutritional and     over-the-counter     lines include     SPLENDA®,      No Calorie Sweetener; the broad family of     TYLENOL®      acetaminophen products;     SUDAFED®      cold, flu and allergy products;     ZYRTEC®      allergy products;     MOTRIN®      IB ibuprofen products; and     PEPCID®      AC Acid Controller from Johnson & Johnson  Merck     Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co. These products are marketed to the     general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors     throughout the world.     Pharmaceutical         The Pharmaceutical segment includes products in the following     areas: anti-infective, antipsychotic, contraceptive,     dermatology, gastrointestinal, hematology, immunology,     neurology, oncology, pain management and virology. These     products are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers and     health care professionals for prescription use. Key products in     the Pharmaceutical segment include:     REMICADE®      (infliximab), a treatment for a number of immune mediated     inflammatory diseases;     STELARA®      (ustekinumab), a treatment for moderate to severe plaque     psoriasis;     SIMPONI®      (golimumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe     rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing     spondylitis;     VELCADE®      (bortezomib), a treatment for multiple myeloma;     PREZISTA®      (darunavir) and     INTELENCE®      (etravirine), treatments for HIV/AIDS;     NUCYNTA®      (tapentadol), a treatment for moderate to severe acute pain;     INVEGA®      SUSTENNAtm      (paliperidone palmitate), for the acute and maintenance     treatment of schizophrenia in adults;     RISPERDAL®      CONSTA®      (risperidone), a treatment for the management of Bipolar I     Disorder and schizophrenia;     PROCRIT®      (Epoetin alfa, sold outside the U.S. as     EPREX®),      to stimulate red blood cell production;     LEVAQUIN®      (levofloxacin) for the treatment of bacterial infections;     CONCERTA®      (methylphenidate HCl), a treatment for attention deficit     hyperactivity disorder;                 ACIPHEX®/PARIET®,      a proton pump inhibitor co-marketed with Eisai Inc.;     DURAGESIC®/Fentanyl      Transdermal (fentanyl transdermal system, sold outside the     U.S. as     DUROGESIC®),      a treatment for chronic pain that offers a novel delivery system.     Medical     Devices and Diagnostics         The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment includes a broad     range of products distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and     retailers, used principally in the professional fields by     physicians, nurses, therapists, hospitals, diagnostic     laboratories and clinics. These products include Biosense     Websters electrophysiology products; Cordis     circulatory disease management products; DePuys     orthopaedic joint reconstruction, spinal care, neurological and     sports medicine products; Ethicons surgical care,     aesthetics and womens health products; Ethicon     Endo-Surgerys minimally invasive surgical products and     advanced sterilization products; LifeScans blood glucose     monitoring and insulin delivery products; Ortho-Clinical     Diagnostics professional diagnostic products; and     Vistakons disposable contact lenses. Distribution to these     health care professional markets is done both directly and     through surgical supply and other dealers.      Geographic     Areas          The business of Johnson & Johnson is conducted by more     than 250 operating companies located in 60 countries,     including the United States, which are selling products in     virtually all countries throughout the world. The products made     and sold in the international business include many of those     described above under  Segments of     Business  Consumer,      Pharmaceutical and      Medical Devices and Diagnostics.     However, the principal markets, products and methods of     distribution in the international business vary with the country     and the culture. The products sold in international business     include not only those developed in the United States, but also     those developed by subsidiaries abroad.         Investments and activities in some countries outside the United     States are subject to higher risks than comparable     U.S. activities because the investment and commercial     climate is influenced by restrictive economic policies and     political uncertainties.      Raw     Materials          Raw materials essential to Johnson & Johnsons     operating companies businesses are generally readily     available from multiple sources.      Patents     and Trademarks          Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries have made a     practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and     processes where possible. They own or are licensed under a     number of patents relating to their products and manufacturing     processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material     importance to Johnson & Johnson in the operation of     its businesses. Sales of the Companys largest product,     REMICADE®      (infliximab), accounted for approximately 7% of     Johnson & Johnsons total revenues for fiscal     2010. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are     believed to be material to Johnson & Johnson.         In March of 2009,     TOPAMAX®      (topiramate) lost basic patent protection and market exclusivity     and became subject to generic competition in the United States     and later in the year in international markets. Sales of     TOPAMAX®      declined by 53.3% and 57.9% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The     next significant patent that will expire is for     LEVAQUIN®      (levofloxacin), which accounted for approximately 2% of the     Companys 2010 sales. A pediatric extension for     LEVAQUIN®      was granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration     (FDA), which extends market exclusivity in the     United States through June 20, 2011.         Johnson & Johnsons operating companies have made     a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of     obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available     means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the     United States and other countries where such products are     marketed. Johnson & Johnson considers these trademarks     in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation     of its businesses.         2            Seasonality          Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of     seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth     quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects     increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and     research and development activity.      Competition          In all of their product lines, Johnson &     Johnsons operating companies compete with companies both     local and global, located throughout the world. Competition     exists in all product lines without regard to the number and     size of the competing companies involved. Competition in     research, involving the development and the improvement of new     and existing products and processes, is particularly     significant. The development of new and innovative products is     important to Johnson & Johnsons success in all     areas of its business. This also includes protecting the     Companys portfolio of intellectual property. The     competitive environment requires substantial investments in     continuing research and in maintaining sales forces. In     addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for     the Companys consumer products involves significant     expenditures for advertising and promotion.      Research     and Development          Research activities represent a significant part of     Johnson & Johnsons subsidiaries     businesses. Major research facilities are located not only in     the United States, but also in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China,     France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands,     Singapore and the United Kingdom. The costs of worldwide     Company-sponsored research activities relating to the     development of new products, improvement of existing products,     technical support of products and compliance with governmental     regulations for the protection of consumers and patients     (excluding purchased in-process research and development charges     for fiscal 2008), amounted to $6.8 billion,     $7.0 billion and $7.6 billion for fiscal years 2010,     2009 and 2008, respectively. These costs are charged directly to     expense, or directly against income, in the year in which     incurred.      Environment          Johnson & Johnsons operating companies are     subject to a variety of U.S. and international     environmental protection measures. Johnson & Johnson     believes that its operations comply in all material respects     with applicable environmental laws and regulations.     Johnson & Johnsons compliance with these     requirements did not during the past year, and is not expected     to, have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash     flows, earnings or competitive position.      Regulation          Most of Johnson & Johnsons businesses are     subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the     countries in which operations are conducted, and the general     trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In the United     States, the drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries     have long been subject to regulation by various federal and     state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy,     manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The     exercise of broad regulatory powers by the FDA continues to     result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation     required for FDA clearance of new drugs and devices and a     corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction.     Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the     United States.         The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a     subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental     agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the United     States, attention has been focused on drug prices and profits     and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for     particular drugs or recommend, use or purchase particular     medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the     market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and     medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device     utilization and the quality and costs of health care.         The regulatory agencies under whose purview Johnson &     Johnsons operating companies operate have administrative     powers that may subject those companies to such actions as     product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other     civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, Johnson &     Johnsons operating companies may deem it advisable to     initiate product recalls.         3             In addition, business practices in the health care industry have     come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United     States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and     resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of     significant civil and criminal penalties.

Research facilities are also discussed in Item 1 under     Business  Research and Development.         Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries generally seek     to own their manufacturing facilities, although some,     principally in locations abroad, are leased. Office and     warehouse facilities are often leased.         Johnson & Johnson is committed to maintaining all of     its properties in good operating condition and repair, and the     facilities are well utilized.         Production at McNeil Consumer Healthcares     Fort Washington, Pennsylvania facility was suspended in the     second quarter of 2010. Alternate supplies of products are     planned to be available in the latter half of 2011. McNeil     Consumer Healthcare submitted its Comprehensive Action Plan     (CAP) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on     July 15, 2010, which encompasses, among other items,     training, resources and capital investments in quality and     manufacturing systems across the McNeil organization. The     Company continues to communicate with the FDA on remediation     actions and is on schedule with the commitments made in the CAP.         For information regarding lease obligations, see Note 16     Rental Expense and Lease Commitments under     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on     page 59 of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to     this Report on     Form 10-K.

LEGAL     PROCEEDINGS           The information set forth in Note 21 Legal     Proceedings under Notes to Consolidated Financial     Statements on pages 64 through 71 of the Annual Report is     incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 to     this Report on     Form 10-K.         The Company or its subsidiaries are parties to a number of     proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental     Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as     Superfund, and comparable state laws, in which the primary     relief sought is the cost of past and future remediation. While     it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these     proceedings, in the opinion of the Company, such proceedings     would not have a material adverse effect on the results of     operations, cash flows or financial position of the Company.

Item 9.     CHANGES     IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND     FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE           Not applicable.           Item 9A.     CONTROLS     AND PROCEDURES       Disclosure Controls and Procedures.  At the end     of the period covered by this report, the Company evaluated the     effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure     controls and procedures. The Companys disclosure controls     and procedures are designed to ensure that information required     to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or     submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,     summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the     SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures     include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to     ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company     in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act     is accumulated and communicated to the Companys     management, including its principal executive and principal     financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as     appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required     disclosure. William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief Executive     Officer, and Dominic J. Caruso, Chief Financial Officer,     reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this     evaluation, Messrs. Weldon and Caruso concluded that, as of     the end of the period covered by this report, the Companys     disclosure controls and procedures were effective.     Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial     Reporting.  Under Section 404 of the     Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the     effectiveness of the Companys internal control over     financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and     report, based on that assessment, whether the Companys     internal control over financial reporting is effective.         Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and     maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.     The Companys internal control over financial reporting is     designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability     of the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of     external financial statements in accordance with generally     accepted accounting principles.         Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well     designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control     over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide     only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement     preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements.     Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to     future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become     inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree     of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.         8             The Companys management has assessed the effectiveness of     the Companys internal control over financial reporting as     of January 2, 2011. In making this assessment, the Company     used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring     Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in     Internal Control-Integrated Framework. These     criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk     assessment, control activities, information and communication,     and monitoring. The Companys assessment included extensive     documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating     effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting.         Based on the Companys processes and assessment, as     described above, management has concluded that, as of     January 2, 2011, the Companys internal control over     financial reporting was effective.         The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over     financial reporting as of January 2, 2011 has been audited     by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public     accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears in the     Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting     Firm on page 72 of the Annual Report, which is     incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 to     this Report on     Form 10-K.     Changes in Internal Control Over Financial     Reporting.  During the fiscal quarter ended     January 2, 2011, there were no changes in the     Companys internal control over financial reporting     identified in connection with the evaluation required under     Rules 13a-15     and 15d-15     under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are     reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys     internal control over financial reporting.
