Johnson & Johnson is a holding company, which has more than 265 operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. The Company’s primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887.The Company’s structure is based on the principle of decentralized management. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices (previously referred to as Medical Devices and Diagnostics) business segments. Within the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans, as well as the day-to-day operations of those companies, and each subsidiary within the business segments is, with some exceptions, managed by citizens of the country where it is located. Segments of BusinessThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” and Note 18 “Segments of Business and Geographic Areas” under “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.ConsumerThe Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, skin care, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. Baby Care includes the JOHNSON’S® Baby line of products. Oral Care includes the LISTERINE® product line. Major brands in Skin Care include the AVEENO®; CLEAN & CLEAR®; DABAOTM; JOHNSON’S® Adult; LE PETITE MARSEILLAIS®; LUBRIDERM®; NEUTROGENA®; and RoC® product lines. Over-the-counter medicines include the broad family of TYLENOL® acetaminophen products; SUDAFED® cold, flu and allergy products;  BENADRYL® and ZYRTEC® allergy products; MOTRIN® IB ibuprofen products; and the PEPCID® line of heartburn products. Major brands in Women’s Health outside of North America are STAYFREE® and CAREFREE® sanitary pad and o.b.® tampon brands. Wound Care brands include the BAND-AID® Brand Adhesive Bandages and NEOSPORIN® First Aid product lines. The principal nutritional line is SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world.PharmaceuticalThe Pharmaceutical segment is focused on five therapeutic areas, including immunology (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and pulmonary diseases), infectious diseases (e.g., HIV, hepatitis, respiratory infections, tuberculosis and vaccines), neuroscience (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, mood disorders, schizophrenia and pain), oncology (e.g., prostate cancer, multiple myeloma, hematologic malignancies and lung cancer), and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (e.g., thrombosis and diabetes).  Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. Key products in the Pharmaceutical segment include:  REMICADE® (infliximab), a treatment for a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases; SIMPONI® (golimumab), a subcutaneous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis and moderately active to severely active ulcerative colitis;  SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab) an intravenous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis; STELARA® (ustekinumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis; INCIVO® (telaprevir), for the treatment of hepatitis C; OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD®(simeprevir), for combination treatment of chronic hepatitis C in adult patients; PREZISTA® (darunavir), a treatment for HIV/AIDS; EDURANT® (rilpivirine), for the treatment of HIV; CONCERTA® (methylphenidate HCl) extended-release tablets CII, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; INVEGA® (paliperidone) extended-release tablets, for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder; INVEGA SUSTENNA®/XEPLION® (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in adults; RISPERDAL CONSTA® (risperidone long-acting injection), for the treatment of schizophrenia and the maintenance treatment of Bipolar I Disorder in adults; VELCADE® (bortezomib), a treatment for multiple myeloma; ZYTIGA® (abiraterone acetate), a treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib), an oral, once-daily therapy approved for use in treating certain B-cell malignancies, or blood 1Table of Contentscancers; PROCRIT® (epoetin alfa, sold outside the U.S. as EPREX®), to stimulate red blood cell production; XARELTO®  (rivaroxaban), an oral anticoagulant for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, for the treatment of DVT and PE, and for the reduction in the risk of recurrence of DVT and PE; and INVOKANA® (canagliflozin), for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. Many of these products were developed in collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies.Medical DevicesThe Medical Devices (previously referred to as Medical Devices and Diagnostics) segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgical care, specialty surgery, cardiovascular care, diagnostics, diabetes care, and vision care markets, which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, and clinics. These include orthopaedic, trauma and neurological products; general surgery, biosurgical and energy products; products to treat cardiovascular disease; infection prevention products; diagnostics products; blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery products; and disposable contact lenses. The Company completed the divestiture of its Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business in June 2014. Geographic AreasThe business of Johnson & Johnson is conducted by more than 265 operating companies located in 60 countries, including the U.S., which conduct business in virtually all countries throughout the world. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under “- Segments of Business - Consumer,” “- Pharmaceutical” and “- Medical Devices.” However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include not only those developed in the United States, but also those developed by subsidiaries abroad.Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.Raw MaterialsRaw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources.  Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company.  PatentsThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own or are licensed under a number of patents relating to their products and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. Sales of the Company’s largest product, REMICADE® (infliximab), accounted for approximately 9.2% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2014. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company.There are two sets of patents related to REMICADE® (infliximab). The first set of patents is co-owned by Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, and NYU Langone Medical Center (NYU). Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to NYU's interests in the patents. Patents have been granted in the United States, certain countries in the European Union (certain of these patents have been extended by Supplementary Patent Certificates), and Australia. In the United States, the latest patent expires in September 2018. The patent expired in Canada in March 2012. In certain countries in Europe the patent was extended to February 2015 (Germany, Spain, United Kingdom, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands). In Australia, the patent expires in August 2015. In the United States, the patent expiring in 2018 is subject to reexamination proceedings instituted by a third party. Those proceedings are on-going.The second set of patents related to REMICADE® was granted to the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology in the United Kingdom in Europe, Canada, Australia and the United States. Janssen Biotech, Inc. has licenses (exclusive for human anti-TNF antibodies and semi-exclusive for non-human anti-TNF antibodies) to these patents that expire in 2017 outside of the United States and 2018 in the United States.  The validity of these patents has been challenged. Certain claims have been invalidated and others are under review in various patent offices around the world and are also subject to litigation in Canada. The Company does not expect that any additional extensions will be available for the patents related to REMICADE®. Loss of exclusivity will likely result in a reduction in sales as biosimilar versions of REMICADE® are introduced to the market.  2Table of ContentsFor legal matters regarding the patents related to REMICADE® , see Note 21 “Legal Proceedings” under “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K, under the heading “Intellectual Property - Pharmaceutical - REMICADE® Related Cases”.In addition to competing in the immunology market with REMICADE®, the Company is currently marketing STELARA® (ustekinumab), SIMPONI® (golimumab) and SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab), next generation immunology products with remaining patent lives of up to nine years.TrademarksThe Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the United States and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.SeasonalityWorldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity.CompetitionIn all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. This also includes protecting the Company’s portfolio of intellectual property. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.Research and DevelopmentResearch activities represent a significant part of the Company’s businesses. Research and development expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, improving existing products, as well as demonstrating product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. Worldwide costs of research and development activities amounted to $8.5 billion, $8.2 billion and $7.7 billion for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  Major research facilities are located not only in the United States, but also in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. EnvironmentThe Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company’s compliance with these requirements did not during the past year, and is not expected to, have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.RegulationMost of the Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In the U.S., the drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and  documentation required for FDA clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S.The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to 3Table of Contentsdrug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally.Following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in June 2012 upholding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "ACA"), there has been an increase in the pace of regulatory issuances by those U.S. government agencies designated to carry out the extensive requirements of the ACA.  These have both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of the ACA will ultimately affect the industry.The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls.In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's products, and which are subject to lengthy regulatory approvals.Available InformationThe Company’s main corporate website address is www.jnj.com.

Investors should realize that if known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. Item 1B.UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNot applicable.4Table of ContentsItem 2.PROPERTIESThe Company's subsidiaries operate 134 manufacturing facilities occupying approximately 21.5 million square feet of floor space.  The manufacturing facilities are used by the industry segments of the Company’s business approximately as follows:Within the United States, eight facilities are used by the Consumer segment, eight by the Pharmaceutical segment and 26 by the Medical Devices segment. The Company’s manufacturing operations outside the United States are often conducted in facilities that serve more than one business segment.  In 2014, the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business resulted in the sale of eight manufacturing facilities, seven in the United States and one in Europe.The locations of the manufacturing facilities by major geographic areas of the world are as follows:In addition to the manufacturing facilities discussed above, the Company maintains numerous office and warehouse facilities throughout the world. Research facilities are also discussed in Item 1 under “Business — Research and Development.”The Company's subsidiaries generally seek to own their manufacturing facilities, although some, principally in non-U.S. locations, are leased. Office and warehouse facilities are often leased.The Company is committed to maintaining all of its properties in good operating condition and repair, and the facilities are well utilized.McNEIL-PPC, Inc. continues to operate under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the FDA, which governs certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations (the “Consent Decree”).  The Consent Decree requires McNEIL-PPC to remediate the facilities it operates in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, and Las Piedras, Puerto Rico. The Fort Washington facility, which was voluntarily shut down in April 2010, will remain shut down until a third-party current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) expert certifies that its operations are in compliance with applicable law, and the FDA concurs with the third-party certification. Many products previously made in Fort Washington have been transferred to other manufacturing sites and successfully reintroduced to the market. The Lancaster and Las Piedras facilities continue to manufacture and distribute drugs with third-party oversight. Third-party oversight will cease once the FDA has determined that the facilities appear to be in compliance with applicable law. Each facility operating under the Consent Decree is subject to a five-year audit period by a third-party cGMP expert after the facility has been deemed by the FDA to be in apparent compliance with applicable law.  McNeil has successfully completed all requirements contained in the Consent Decree Workplan for the Lancaster and Las Piedras manufacturing sites and has completed the steps required for third-party certification of the Fort Washington plant. In February 2015, the third-party cGMP expert submitted written certification to the FDA for all three manufacturing sites. The timeline for completion of any FDA inspection is within the FDA's discretion. A discussion of legal proceedings related to this matter can be found under the heading “Government Proceedings - McNeil Consumer Healthcare” in Note 21 “Legal Proceedings” under “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K. 5Table of ContentsFor information regarding lease obligations, see Note 16 “Rental Expense and Lease Commitments” under “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K. Segment information on additions to property, plant and equipment is contained in Note 18 “Segments of Business and Geographic Areas” under “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.Item 3.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSThe following information is incorporated herein by reference: the information set forth in Note 21 “Legal Proceedings” under “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” of the Annual Report filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.In addition, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are from time to time party to government investigations, inspections or other proceedings relating to environmental matters, including their compliance with applicable environmental laws.  In connection with a routine inspection of a subsidiary's manufacturing facility, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged violation of regulations dealing with the handling of certain wastes.  In the fourth quarter of 2014, the subsidiary entered into a settlement agreement with the State of California and agreed to perform certain remedial actions and pay approximately $400,000 to settle the claim.
