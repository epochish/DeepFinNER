                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

GENERAL

     Johnson & Johnson, employing approximately 98,500 people worldwide, is
engaged in the manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health
care field. It conducts business in virtually all countries of the world.
Johnson & Johnson's primary interest, both historically and currently, has been
in products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was
organized in the State of New Jersey in 1887.

     Johnson & Johnson is organized on the principle of decentralized
management. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal
management group responsible for the operations and allocation of the resources
of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of
domestic and international companies related to each of the Consumer,
Pharmaceutical and Professional businesses. Each international subsidiary is,
with some exceptions, managed by citizens of the country where it is located.

SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS; GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

     Johnson & Johnson's worldwide business is divided into three segments:
Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Professional. Johnson & Johnson further categorizes
its sales and operating profit by major geographic areas of the world.
Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference
to the narrative and tabular (but not the graphic) descriptions of segments and
geographic areas captioned "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of
Operations and Financial Condition -- Segments of Business, Consumer,
Pharmaceutical, Professional and Geographic Areas" on pages 28 through 31 and 49
of Johnson & Johnson's Annual Report to Shareowners for fiscal year 2000.

CONSUMER

     The Consumer segment's principal products are personal care and hygienic
products, including nonprescription drugs, adult skin and hair care products,

These products are marketed principally to the general public and distributed
both to wholesalers and directly to independent and chain retail outlets.

PHARMACEUTICAL

     The Pharmaceutical segment's principal worldwide franchises are in the
antifungal, anti-infective, cardiovascular, dermatology, gastrointestinal,
hematology, immunology, neurology, oncology, pain management, psychotropic and
women's health fields. These products are distributed both directly and through
wholesalers for use by health care professionals and the general public.
Prescription drugs in the antifungal field include NIZORAL (ketoconazole),
SPORANOX (itraconazole), TERAZOL (terconazole) and DAKTARIN (miconazole nitrate)
antifungal products. Prescription drugs in the anti-infective field include
FLOXIN (ofloxacin) and LEVAQUIN (levofloxacin). Prescription drugs in the
cardiovascular field include RETAVASE (reteplase), a recombinant biologic
cardiology care product for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction to
improve blood flow to the heart, and REOPRO (abciximab) for the treatment of
<PAGE>   4

acute cardiac disease. Prescriptions drugs in the dermatology field include
RETIN-A MICRO (tretinoin), a dermatological cream for acne. Prescription drugs
in the gastrointestinal field include ACIPHEX (rabeprazole sodium), a proton
pump inhibitor for treating erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and
duodenal ulcers; IMODIUM (loperamide HCl), an antidiarrheal; MOTILIUM
(domperidone), a gastrointestinal mobilizer; and REMICADE (infliximab), a novel
monoclonal antibody for treatment of certain Crohn's disease patients. REMICADE
is also indicated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

     Prescription drugs in the hematology field include PROCRIT (epoetin alfa,
sold outside the U.S. as EPREX), a biotechnology derived version of the human
hormone erythropoietin that stimulates red blood cell production. Prescription
drugs in the immunology field include ORTHOCLONE OKT-3 (muromonab-CD3), for
reversing the rejection of kidney, heart and liver transplants. Prescription
drugs in the neurology field include REMINYL (galantamine), TOPAMAX (topiramate)
and STUGERON (cinnarizine). Prescription drugs in the oncology field include
ERGAMISOL (levamisole hydrochloride), a colon cancer drug, and LEUSTATIN
(cladribine), for hairy cell leukemia. Prescription drugs in the pain management
field include DURAGESIC (fentanyl transdermal system, sold abroad as DUROGESIC),
a transdermal patch for chronic pain; and ULTRAM (tramadol hydrochloride), an
analgesic for moderate to moderately severe pain. Prescription drugs in the
psychotropics field include RISPERDAL (risperidone), an antipsychotic drug, and
HALDOL (haloperidol). Prescription drugs in the women's health field include
ORTHO-NOVUM (norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol) and TRICILEST
(norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol, sold in the U.S. as ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN) group of
oral contraceptives and ORTHO-PREFEST (17 (beta)-estradiol/norgestimate) for
hormone replacement therapy.

PROFESSIONAL

     The Professional segment includes a broad range of products used by or
under the direction of health care professionals, including, suture and
mechanical wound closure products, surgical equipment and devices, wound
management and infection prevention products, interventional and diagnostic
cardiology products, diagnostic equipment and supplies, joint replacements and
disposable contact lenses. These products are used principally in the
professional fields by physicians, nurses, therapists, hospitals, diagnostic
laboratories and clinics. Distribution to these markets is done both directly
and through surgical supply and other dealers.

INTERNATIONAL

     The international business of Johnson & Johnson is conducted by
subsidiaries located in 50 countries outside the United States, which are
selling products in more than 175 countries throughout the world. The products
made and sold in the international business include many of those described
above under "Business -- Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Professional." However,
the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international
business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in the
international business include not only those which were developed in the United
States but also those which were developed by subsidiaries abroad.

     Investments and activities in some countries outside the United States are
subject to higher risks than comparable domestic activities because the
investment and commercial climate is influenced by restrictive economic policies
and political uncertainties.

RAW MATERIALS

     Raw materials essential to Johnson & Johnson's business are generally
readily available from multiple sources.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

     Johnson & Johnson has made a practice of obtaining patent protection on its
products and processes where possible. Johnson & Johnson owns or is licensed
under a number of patents relating to its products and manufacturing processes,
which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the
operation of its business. However, it is believed that no single patent or
related group of patents is material in relation to Johnson & Johnson as a
whole.

                                        2
<PAGE>   5

     Johnson & Johnson has made a practice of selling its products under
trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available
means. Johnson & Johnson's trademarks are protected by registration in the
United States and other countries where its products are marketed. Johnson &
Johnson considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance
in the operation of its business.

SEASONALITY

     Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality;
however spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in
other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for
advertising and research grants.

COMPETITION

     In all its product lines, Johnson & Johnson companies compete with
companies both large and small, located in the United States and abroad.
Competition is strong in all lines without regard to the number and size of the
competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development
of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and
processes, is particularly significant and results from time to time in product
and process obsolescence. The development of new and improved products is
important to Johnson & Johnson's success in all areas of its business. This
competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research
and in multiple sales forces. In addition, the winning and retention of customer
acceptance of Johnson & Johnson's consumer products involve heavy expenditures
for advertising, promotion and selling.

RESEARCH

     Research activities are important to all segments of Johnson & Johnson's
business. Major research facilities are located not only in the United States
but also in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Switzerland and the
United Kingdom. The costs of Johnson & Johnson's worldwide research activities
relating to the development of new products, the improvement of existing
products, technical support of products and compliance with governmental
regulations for the protection of the consumer amounted to $2,926, $2,600, and
$2,336 million for fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. These costs
are charged directly to income in the year in which incurred. All research was
sponsored by Johnson & Johnson.

ENVIRONMENT

     During the past year Johnson & Johnson was subject to a variety of federal,
state and local environmental protection measures. Johnson & Johnson believes
that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable
environmental laws and regulations. Johnson & Johnson's compliance with these
requirements did not and is not expected to have a material effect upon its
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

REGULATION

     Most of Johnson & Johnson's business is subject to varying degrees of
governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and
the general trend is toward regulation of increasing stringency. In the United
States, the drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been
subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies, primarily as
to product safety, efficacy, advertising and labeling. The exercise of broad
regulatory powers by the Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") continues to
result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA
clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense
of product introduction. Similar trends toward product and process regulation
are also evident in a number of major countries outside of the United States,
especially in the European Economic Community where efforts are continuing to
harmonize the internal regulatory systems.

     The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of
study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative
bodies in the United States and other countries. In the
                                        3
<PAGE>   6

United States, attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and
programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or
recommend particular medical devices. Even in the absence of new government
regulation, managed care has become a more potent force in the market place and
it is likely that increased attention will be paid to drug and medical device
pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality of
health care.

     The regulatory agencies under whose purview Johnson & Johnson operates have
administrative powers that may subject Johnson & Johnson to such actions as
product recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In
some cases Johnson & Johnson may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls
voluntarily.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

     Johnson & Johnson and its worldwide subsidiaries operate 140 manufacturing
facilities occupying approximately 16.4 million square feet of floor space.

     The manufacturing facilities are used by the industry segments of Johnson &
Johnson's business approximately as follows:

by the Pharmaceutical segment and 44 by the Professional segment. Johnson &
Johnson's manufacturing operations outside the United States are often conducted

</TABLE>

     In addition to the manufacturing facilities discussed above, Johnson &
Johnson maintains numerous office and warehouse facilities throughout the world.
Research facilities are also discussed in Item 1 under "Business -- Research."

     Johnson & Johnson generally seeks to own its manufacturing facilities,
although some, principally in locations abroad, are leased. Office and warehouse
facilities are often leased.

     Johnson & Johnson's properties are maintained in good operating condition
and repair and are well utilized.

     For information regarding lease obligations see Note 4 "Rental Expense and
Lease Commitments" under "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 38
of Johnson & Johnson's Annual Report to Shareowners for fiscal year 2000.
Segment information on additions to Johnson & Johnson's property, plant and
equipment is contained on page 49 of Johnson & Johnson's Annual Report to

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The information set forth in Note 18 "Legal Proceedings" under "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 46 of Johnson & Johnson's Annual
Report to Shareowners for fiscal year 2000 is incorporated herein by reference.

     The Company or its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings
brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state laws, in which
the primary relief sought is the cost of past and future remediation. While it
is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings, in the
opinion of the Company, such proceedings would not have a material adverse
effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the
Company.

                          FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE

To the Shareowners and Board of Directors of

     Our audits of the consolidated financial statements of Johnson & Johnson
referred to in our report dated January 22, 2001 appearing in the Johnson &
Johnson 2000 Annual Report to Shareowners (which report and consolidated
financial statements are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form

     In our opinion, this financial statement schedule presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction
with the related consolidated financial statements.
