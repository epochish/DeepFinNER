THE COMPANY CONSOLIDATES THIS ENTITY, INCLUDING SUCH RECEIVABLES, AND REPORTS THE AMOUNTS INVESTED BY OUTSIDE INVESTORS AS A MINORITY INTEREST.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCING OR UNCONSOLIDATED SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES. THE COMPANY'S TREASURY AND RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES PROHIBIT THE USE OF LEVERAGED DERIVATIVES OR DERIVATIVES FOR TRADING PURPOSES. THE VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE MARKED TO MARKET ARE BASED UPON INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY SOURCES INCLUDING QUOTED MARKET PRICES. THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO VARIOUS SUPERFUND AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND IS CONTINGENTLY LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO LAWSUITS, TAXES AND OTHER MATTERS ARISING OUT OF THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS AS MORE FULLY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT PROACTIVELY REVIEWS AND MANAGES ITS EXPOSURE TO, AND THE IMPACT OF, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE COMPANY'S CASH FLOWS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A PARTICULAR QUARTER OR YEAR COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE ONE-TIME IMPACTS OF THE RESOLUTION OF 11 <PAGE> (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) SUCH CONTINGENCIES, IT IS THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT THAT THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF THESE MATTERS, TO THE EXTENT NOT PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED FOR, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION OR ONGOING CASH FLOWS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. RESTRUCTURING RESERVES IN DECEMBER 2000, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $63.9 ($42.5 AFTERTAX) ASSOCIATED WITH THE REALIGNMENT OF THREE MANUFACTURING LOCATIONS IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE EXITING OF OUR BUSINESS IN NIGERIA. THE CHARGE RECORDED INCLUDED $14.2 FOR TERMINATION COSTS AND $49.7 FOR EXITING OF MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS. THE RESTRUCTURING WAS COMPLETED IN 2001 WITH A FINAL PAYMENT OF $7.2 REPRESENTING TERMINATION COSTS FOR 979 EMPLOYEES. MANAGING FOREIGN CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE EXPOSURE THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO MARKET RISK FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY PRICE FLUCTUATIONS. THE COMPANY MANAGES THE VOLATILITY RELATING TO THESE EXPOSURES ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS BY UTILIZING A NUMBER OF TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, SELECTIVE BORROWINGS IN LOCAL CURRENCIES AND ENTERING INTO CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT TRANSACTIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMPANY'S TREASURY AND RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES. THE COMPANY OPERATES IN OVER 200 COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES AND IS EXPOSED TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATION RELATED TO MANUFACTURING AND SELLING ITS PRODUCTS IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. THE MAJOR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES INVOLVE THE MARKETS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, MEXICO AND BRAZIL, ALTHOUGH ALL REGIONS OF THE WORLD ARE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY CHANGES VERSUS THE U.S. DOLLAR. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY MONITORS ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES IN THESE MARKETS AND HAS BEEN ABLE TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET THE IMPACT ON EARNINGS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE MOVEMENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF COST-CONTAINMENT MEASURES, FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING ACTIVITIES AND SELLING PRICE INCREASES. THE COMPANY PRIMARILY UTILIZES FORWARD EXCHANGE AND CURRENCY SWAP CONTRACTS TO HEDGE PORTIONS OF ITS EXPOSURES RELATING TO FOREIGN CURRENCY PURCHASES AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CREATED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY HEDGES CERTAIN OF ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY PURCHASES USING FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WITH DURATIONS NO GREATER THAN 18 MONTHS. THE COMPANY UTILIZES INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND DEBT ISSUANCES TO MANAGE ITS TARGETED MIX OF FIXED AND FLOATING RATE DEBT AND TO MINIMIZE SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS THAT MAY RESULT FROM INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY. THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO PRICE VOLATILITY RELATED TO RAW MATERIALS USED IN PRODUCTION. THE COMPANY USES FUTURES AND OPTION CONTRACTS ON A LIMITED BASIS TO MANAGE VOLATILITY RELATED TO ANTICIPATED RAW MATERIAL INVENTORY PURCHASES. THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANY'S COMMODITY HEDGING ACTIVITY IS NOT MATERIAL. THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT LOSS IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES TO THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT CONTRACTS HELD BY THE COMPANY; HOWEVER, NONPERFORMANCE BY THESE COUNTERPARTIES IS CONSIDERED REMOTE AS IT IS THE COMPANY'S POLICY TO CONTRACT WITH DIVERSIFIED COUNTERPARTIES THAT HAVE A LONG-TERM DEBT RATING OF A OR HIGHER. IN ADDITION, IF ALL THESE COUNTERPARTIES DID NOT PERFORM, THE COMPANY'S RISK OF CREDIT LOSS WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL. VALUE AT RISK THE COMPANY'S RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES INCLUDE THE MONITORING OF INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES AND THE COMPANY'S OFFSETTING HEDGE POSITIONS UTILIZING STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF CASH FLOWS, MARKET VALUE, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS AND VALUE-AT-RISK ESTIMATIONS. HOWEVER, THE USE OF THESE TECHNIQUES TO QUANTIFY THE MARKET RISK OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN ENDORSEMENT OF THEIR ACCURACY OR THE ACCURACY OF THE RELATED ASSUMPTIONS. THE COMPANY UTILIZES A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL AND AN EARNINGS-AT-RISK (EAR) MODEL THAT ARE INTENDED TO MEASURE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL LOSS IN ITS INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ASSUMING ADVERSE MARKET CONDITIONS OCCUR, GIVEN A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THE MODELS UTILIZE A VARIANCE/COVARIANCE MODELING TECHNIQUE. HISTORICAL INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES FROM THE PRECEDING YEAR ARE USED TO ESTIMATE THE VOLATILITY AND CORRELATION OF FUTURE RATES. 12 <PAGE> (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF INTEREST RATE OR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE INSTRUMENTS, CALCULATED USING THE VAR MODEL, IS NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS OF THE COMPANY. THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM YEARLY LOSS IN EARNINGS DUE TO INTEREST RATE OR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE INSTRUMENTS, CALCULATED UTILIZING THE EAR MODEL, IS NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ACTUAL RESULTS IN THE FUTURE MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE PROJECTED RESULTS DUE TO ACTUAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND A DESCRIPTION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT ACTIVITIES, REFER TO NOTE 2 AND NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ACCOUNTING CHANGES THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD'S (FASB) EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) RECENTLY REACHED CONSENSUS ON TOPICS RELATING TO THE CLASSIFICATION OF VARIOUS TYPES OF SALES INCENTIVES AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES. THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT THE NEW ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002. THE IMPACT OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING WILL RESULT IN THE RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN SALES INCENTIVES AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES FROM SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TO EITHER A REDUCTION OF NET SALES OR AN INCREASE OF COST OF SALES, BUT WILL HAVE NO IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION OR NET INCOME. BASED ON HISTORICAL INFORMATION, ANNUAL NET SALES AS CURRENTLY REPORTED FOR 2001 AND 2000 WILL BE REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY 4% WITH A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE IMPACT ON ANNUAL COST OF SALES AS CURRENTLY REPORTED IS NOT MATERIAL. IN OUR 2002 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ALL COMPARATIVE PERIODS WILL BE RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE NEW REQUIREMENTS. IN JULY 2001, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 141, "BUSINESS COMBINATIONS" AND SFAS NO. 142, "GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS." IN ADDITION TO REQUIRING THE USE OF THE PURCHASE METHOD FOR ALL FUTURE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, SFAS 141 BROADENS THE CRITERIA FOR RECORDING INTANGIBLE ASSETS SEPARATE FROM GOODWILL. SFAS 142 ADDRESSES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR ACQUIRED GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. UNDER THE NEW STANDARDS, GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SUCH AS THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL BRANDS, ARE NO LONGER AMORTIZED BUT WILL BE SUBJECT TO ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS. FINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS SUCH AS NON-COMPETE AGREEMENTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES. THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT THESE STATEMENTS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY WILL CEASE AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES BY APPROXIMATELY $50.0 AND NET INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $40.0. ANNUAL AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WAS $68.0, $72.1 AND $75.6 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY. DURING 2002, THE COMPANY WILL PERFORM THE REQUIRED TRANSITIONAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS OF GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IT IS MANAGEMENT'S PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT THAT A TRANSITIONAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, IF ANY, WILL NOT BE MATERIAL. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO USE JUDGMENT AND MAKE ESTIMATES. THE LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY IN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCREASES WITH THE LENGTH OF TIME UNTIL THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS ARE COMPLETED. AS SUCH, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY IN THE COMPANY'S ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES INVOLVED IN PREPARING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE PENSION AND HEALTH CARE COST ASSUMPTIONS AND LEGAL AND TAX CONTINGENCY RESERVES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD ULTIMATELY DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES ALLOW FOR THE SELECTION OF ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNTING METHODS. THE COMPANY'S MORE SIGNIFICANT POLICIES WHERE ALTERNATIVE METHODS ARE AVAILABLE INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK OPTIONS (REFER TO NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION) AND INVENTORIES (LIFO/FIFO). FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES, REFER TO THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. 13 <PAGE> (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) OUTLOOK LOOKING FORWARD INTO 2002, THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED FOR CONTINUED GROWTH IN MOST OF ITS MARKETS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE THAT IS EXPERIENCING INCREASED TRADE CONCENTRATION. IN ADDITION, MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CAN IMPACT FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AS MEASURED IN U.S. DOLLARS. IN PARTICULAR, ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY IN SOME COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA AND CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE EURO MAY IMPACT THE OVERALL RESULTS OF LATIN AMERICA AND EUROPE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF COLGATE TOOTHPASTE, USING PATENTED AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY, TO BOLSTER WORLDWIDE ORAL CARE LEADERSHIP AND EXPECTS NEW PRODUCTS IN ORAL CARE AND OTHER CATEGORIES TO ADD POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER GROWTH. OVERALL, SUBJECT TO GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE 2002 MARKET CONDITIONS TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE EXPERIENCED IN 2001 AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS POSITIVE MOMENTUM TO CONTINUE. HISTORICALLY, THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS INDUSTRY HAS BEEN LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO CHANGES IN ECONOMIC GROWTH THAN MANY OTHER INDUSTRIES, AND THEREFORE THE COMPANY CONSTANTLY EVALUATES PROJECTS THAT WILL FOCUS OPERATIONS ON OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENHANCED GROWTH POTENTIAL. OVER THE LONG TERM, COLGATE'S CONTINUED FOCUS ON ITS CONSUMER PRODUCTS BUSINESS AND THE STRENGTH OF ITS GLOBAL BRAND NAMES, ITS BROAD INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE IN BOTH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING MARKETS, AND ITS STRONG CAPITAL BASE ALL POSITION THE COMPANY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AND TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE PROFITABILITY AND SHAREHOLDER VALUE. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY MAY MAKE STATEMENTS WHICH CONSTITUTE OR CONTAIN "FORWARD-LOOKING" INFORMATION AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 OR BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IN ITS RULES, REGULATIONS AND RELEASES. SUCH STATEMENTS MAY RELATE, FOR EXAMPLE, TO SALES OR VOLUME GROWTH, EARNINGS GROWTH, FINANCIAL GOALS, COST REDUCTION PLANS AND NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AMONG OTHER MATTERS. THE COMPANY CAUTIONS INVESTORS THAT ANY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE BY THE COMPANY ARE NOT GUARANTEES OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND THAT ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM ANTICIPATED RESULTS OR EXPECTATIONS EXPRESSED IN THE COMPANY'S FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS: (1) GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY OPERATES ON A GLOBAL BASIS, WITH APPROXIMATELY 70% OF ITS NET SALES COMING FROM OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE FULL RANGE OF ECONOMIC RISKS, INCLUDING THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, SUCH AS ECONOMIC RECESSION, INFLATION, ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS AND RELATED COSTS, MOVEMENTS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES, TRADE RESTRICTIONS, TAX LAW CHANGES, POLITICAL AND LEGAL INSTABILITY, THE IMPOSITION OF TRADE RESTRICTIONS AND SIMILAR FACTORS BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. (2) COMPETITION. THE COMPANY FACES VIGOROUS COMPETITION FROM MULTINATIONAL CONSUMER PRODUCT COMPANIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WITH THE SAME OR GREATER RESOURCES THAN THE COMPANY. SUCH COMPETITION IS BASED ON PRICING OF PRODUCTS, PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES, ADVERTISING, NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, ELECTRONIC COMMERCE INITIATIVES AND OTHER ACTIVITIES OF COMPETITORS, THE TIMING AND SCALE OF WHICH CANNOT BE FORESEEN BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO COMPETE ALSO DEPENDS ON THE STRENGTH OF ITS BRANDS, ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY TALENT AND ITS ABILITY TO PROTECT ITS PATENT, TRADEMARK AND TRADE DRESS RIGHTS AND TO DEFEND AGAINST RELATED CHALLENGES BROUGHT BY COMPETITORS. (3) RETAIL TRADE. THE COMPANY CAN BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE POLICIES OF ITS RETAIL TRADE CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS INVENTORY DE-STOCKING, LIMITATIONS ON ACCESS TO SHELF SPACE, ELECTRONIC DATA TRANSMISSION REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER CONDITIONS. WITH THE GROWING TREND TOWARDS RETAIL TRADE CONSOLIDATION, ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPED MARKETS SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE, THE COMPANY IS INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON KEY RETAILERS, AND THESE RETAILERS HAVE INCREASINGLY GREATER BARGAINING STRENGTH. IN ADDITION, PRIVATE LABEL BRANDS SOLD BY RETAIL TRADE CHAINS ARE BECOMING A SOURCE OF COMPETITION FOR THE COMPANY. 14 <PAGE> (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) (4) PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY'S GROWTH DEPENDS ON THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT AND INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND LINE EXTENSIONS, WHICH FACE THE UNCERTAINTY OF RETAIL AND CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE AND REACTION FROM COMPETITORS, AS WELL AS THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF EXISTING PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO CREATE NEW PRODUCTS AND LINE EXTENSIONS AND TO SUSTAIN EXISTING PRODUCTS IS AFFECTED BY ITS ABILITY TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS, TO RECEIVE AND MAINTAIN NECESSARY PATENT AND TRADEMARK PROTECTION AND REGULATORY APPROVALS AND TO ANTICIPATE SUCCESSFULLY CONSUMER NEEDS AND PREFERENCES. (5) COST PRESSURES. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS COST STRUCTURE CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY MOVEMENTS IN RAW MATERIAL PRICES AND BY UNANTICIPATED DELAYS OR DIFFICULTIES IN ACHIEVING COST EFFICIENCIES IN MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S MOVE TO GLOBAL SUPPLIERS, TO ACHIEVE COST REDUCTIONS AND SIMPLIFY ITS BUSINESS, HAS RESULTED IN AN INCREASING DEPENDENCE ON KEY SUPPLIERS. (6) MANUFACTURING. AS A COMPANY ENGAGED IN MANUFACTURING ON A GLOBAL SCALE, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE RISKS INHERENT IN SUCH ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL EVENTS, STRIKES AND OTHER LABOR DISPUTES, LOSS OR IMPAIRMENT OF KEY MANUFACTURING SITES, PRODUCT QUALITY AND SAFETY ISSUES, NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER EXTERNAL FACTORS OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NO CONTROL.
