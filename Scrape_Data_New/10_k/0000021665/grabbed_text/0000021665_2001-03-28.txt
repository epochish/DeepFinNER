LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS INCREASED 19% TO $1,536.2 COMPARED WITH $1,292.7 IN 1999 AND $1,178.8 IN 1998. THE INCREASES REFLECT THE COMPANY'S IMPROVED PROFITABILITY AND WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT.

THE COMMERCIAL PAPER AS WELL AS OTHER SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS ARE CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM DEBT AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, AS IT IS THE COMPANY'S INTENT AND ABILITY TO REFINANCE SUCH OBLIGATIONS ON A LONG-TERM BASIS. THE COMPANY HAS ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AVAILABLE IN THE FORM OF LINES OF CREDIT MAINTAINED WITH VARIOUS BANKS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, SUCH UNUSED LINES OF CREDIT AMOUNTED TO $1,398.1.

CAPITAL SPENDING CONTINUES TO BE FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON PROJECTS THAT YIELD HIGH AFTERTAX RETURNS. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR 2001 ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AT THE CURRENT RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 4% OF NET SALES. OTHER INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2000, 1999 AND 1998 INCLUDED STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES AROUND THE WORLD. THE AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF ALL 2000, 1999 AND 1998 ACQUISITIONS WAS $64.9, $46.4 AND $22.6, RESPECTIVELY.

THE AGGREGATE SALE PRICE OF ALL 2000, 1999 AND 1998 SALES OF BRANDS WAS $102.5, $94.7 AND $57.4, RESPECTIVELY. IN 1993, THE COMPANY PARTICIPATED IN THE FORMATION OF A FINANCING SUBSIDIARY WITH OUTSIDE INVESTORS. THE COMPANY CONSOLIDATED THIS ENTITY AND REPORTED THE AMOUNTS INVESTED BY OUTSIDE INVESTORS AS A MINORITY INTEREST. DURING 2000 THIS SUBSIDIARY CEASED OPERATIONS RESULTING IN A CASH PAYMENT OF $113.9 TO THE OUTSIDE INVESTORS. THE COMPANY REPURCHASES COMMON SHARES IN OPEN MARKET AND PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND TO MAINTAIN ITS TARGETED CAPITAL STRUCTURE. AGGREGATE REPURCHASES FOR 2000 WERE 19.1 MILLION SHARES, WITH A TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE OF $1,040.6. IN 1999, 12.8 MILLION SHARES WERE REPURCHASED, WITH A TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE OF $624.4.

SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS WOULD REQUIRE EXTERNAL FINANCING. THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO VARIOUS SUPERFUND AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND IS CONTINGENTLY LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO LAWSUITS, TAXES AND OTHER MATTERS ARISING OUT OF THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. MANAGEMENT PROACTIVELY REVIEWS AND MANAGES ITS EXPOSURE TO, AND THE IMPACT OF, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE COMPANY'S CASH FLOWS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A PARTICULAR QUARTER OR YEAR COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE ONE-TIME IMPACTS OF THE RESOLUTION OF SUCH CONTINGENCIES, IT IS THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT THAT THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF THESE MATTERS, TO THE EXTENT NOT PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED FOR, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION OR ONGOING CASH FLOWS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. RESTRUCTURING RESERVES IN DECEMBER 2000 THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $63.9 ($42.5 AFTERTAX) ASSOCIATED WITH THE REALIGNMENT OF THREE MANUFACTURING LOCATIONS IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE EXITING OF OUR BUSINESS IN NIGERIA. THE CHARGE RECORDED INCLUDED $14.2 FOR TERMINATION COSTS AND $49.7 FOR EXITING OF MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, THE REMAINING RESERVE OF $7.2 IS CLASSIFIED AS A CURRENT LIABILITY REPRESENTING TERMINATION COSTS FOR 979 EMPLOYEES TO BE PAID DURING 2001. IN SEPTEMBER 1995, A RESERVE OF $460.5 WAS ESTABLISHED TO COVER A WORLDWIDE RESTRUCTURING OF MANUFACTURING AND ADMINISTRATIVE OPERATIONS. THE COST OF COMPLETING THE RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES APPROXIMATED THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATE. THE PLANNED RESTRUCTURING PROJECTS, PRIMARILY IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE BUT ALSO AFFECTING HILL'S PET NUTRITION AND COLGATE LOCATIONS IN ASIA/AFRICA AND CERTAIN LATIN AMERICA LOCATIONS, WERE COMPLETED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000. MANAGING FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO MARKET RISK FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AND INTEREST RATES. TO MANAGE THE VOLATILITY RELATING TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, THE COMPANY UTILIZES A NUMBER OF TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING SELECTIVE BORROWINGS IN LOCAL CURRENCIES, PURCHASES OF FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT AND INCREASES IN SELLING PRICES. THE COMPANY OPERATES IN OVER 200 COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES AND IS EXPOSED TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATION RELATED TO MANUFACTURING AND SELLING ITS PRODUCTS IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. THE MAJOR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES INVOLVE THE MARKETS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, MEXICO AND BRAZIL, WHICH REPRESENT 13%, 11% AND 5%, RESPECTIVELY, OF 2000 WORLDWIDE SALES. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY MONITORS ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES IN THESE MARKETS AND HAS BEEN ABLE TO OFFSET THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE MOVEMENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF SELLING PRICE INCREASES, COST-CONTAINMENT MEASURES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY PRIMARILY UTILIZES FORWARD EXCHANGE AND CURRENCY SWAP CONTRACTS TO HEDGE PORTIONS OF ITS EXPOSURES RELATING TO FOREIGN CURRENCY PURCHASES AND SALES, AS WELL AS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CREATED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY UTILIZES SIMPLE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE THE COMPANY'S MIX OF FIXED AND FLOATING RATE DEBT. THE COMPANY'S TARGET FLOATING RATE OBLIGATIONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL DEBT IS SET BY POLICY. IT IS THE COMPANY'S POLICY TO ENTER INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS WITH DIVERSIFIED AND REPUTABLE COUNTERPARTIES AND AS SUCH, THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE NON-PERFORMANCE BY ANY COUNTERPARTY. VALUE AT RISK THE COMPANY'S RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES INCLUDE THE MONITORING OF INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES AND THE COMPANY'S OFFSETTING HEDGE POSITIONS UTILIZING STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF CASH FLOWS, MARKET VALUE, 11 <PAGE> (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS AND VALUE-AT-RISK ESTIMATIONS. HOWEVER, THE USE OF THESE TECHNIQUES TO QUANTIFY THE MARKET RISK OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN ENDORSEMENT OF THEIR ACCURACY OR THE ACCURACY OF THE RELATED ASSUMPTIONS. THE COMPANY UTILIZES A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL AND AN EARNINGS- AT-RISK (EAR) MODEL THAT ARE INTENDED TO MEASURE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL LOSS IN ITS INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ASSUMING ADVERSE MARKET CONDITIONS OCCUR, GIVEN A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THE MODELS UTILIZE A VARIANCE/COVARIANCE MODELING TECHNIQUE. HISTORICAL INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES FROM THE PRECEDING YEAR ARE USED TO ESTIMATE THE VOLATILITY AND CORRELATION OF FUTURE RATES. THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF INTEREST RATE OR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE INSTRUMENTS, CALCULATED USING THE VAR MODEL, IS NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS OF THE COMPANY. THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM YEARLY LOSS IN EARNINGS DUE TO INTEREST RATE OR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE INSTRUMENTS, CALCULATED UTILIZING THE EAR MODEL, IS NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ACTUAL RESULTS IN THE FUTURE MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE PROJECTED RESULTS DUE TO ACTUAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS. A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS INCLUDED IN THE SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND FURTHER DISCLOSURE RELATING TO FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS INCLUDED IN THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOTE. ACCOUNTING CHANGES IN JUNE 1998, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD (SFAS) NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES." SFAS 133, AS AMENDED, ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS REQUIRING THAT EVERY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT BE RECORDED IN THE BALANCE SHEET AS EITHER AN ASSET OR LIABILITY MEASURED AT ITS FAIR VALUE. THE STATEMENT REQUIRES THAT CHANGES IN THE DERIVATIVE'S FAIR VALUE BE RECOGNIZED CURRENTLY IN EARNINGS OR OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME DEPENDING ON WHETHER A DERIVATIVE IS DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGE TRANSACTION. THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 133 ON JANUARY 1, 2001 DID NOT RESULT IN A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. IN JULY 2000, THE FASB'S EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) REACHED A CONSENSUS ON ISSUE NO. 00-14, "ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN SALES INCENTIVES." THIS ISSUE ADDRESSES THE RECOGNITION, MEASUREMENT AND INCOME STATEMENT CLASSIFICATION FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF SALES INCENTIVES INCLUDING DISCOUNTS, COUPONS, REBATES AND FREE PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT THIS CONSENSUS EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2001 AND IT IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION WILL RESULT IN THE RECLASSIFICATION OF APPROXIMATELY $150.6, $129.1 AND $117.5 FOR THE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY, FROM SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TO A REDUCTION OF NET SALES. CONVERSION TO THE EURO CURRENCY ON JANUARY 1, 1999, CERTAIN MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ESTABLISHED FIXED CONVERSION RATES BETWEEN THEIR EXISTING CURRENCIES AND ADOPTED THE EURO AS THEIR NEW COMMON LEGAL CURRENCY. AS OF THAT DATE, THE EURO BEGAN TRADING ON CURRENCY EXCHANGES AND THE LEGACY CURRENCIES WERE TO REMAIN LEGAL TENDER IN THE PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES FOR A TRANSITION PERIOD BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 1999 AND JANUARY 1, 2002. THE COMPANY IS ADDRESSING THE ISSUES INVOLVED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THE EURO THROUGH ITS WORLDWIDE CONVERSION TO THE SAP SYSTEM AND OTHER MEASURES. THE MORE IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING THE COMPANY INCLUDE REASSESSING CURRENCY RISK AND PROCESSING TAX AND ACCOUNTING RECORDS. BASED UPON PROGRESS TO DATE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT USE OF THE EURO WILL NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE MANNER IN WHICH IT CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND PROCESSES ITS BUSINESS AND ACCOUNTING RECORDS. ACCORDINGLY, CONVERSION TO THE EURO IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, CASH FLOWS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 12 <PAGE> (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) OUTLOOK LOOKING FORWARD INTO 2001, THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED FOR CONTINUED GROWTH IN MOST OF ITS MARKETS. HOWEVER, MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CAN IMPACT FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AS MEASURED IN U.S. DOLLARS. IN PARTICULAR, ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY IN SOME COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA AND CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE EURO MAY IMPACT THE OVERALL RESULTS OF LATIN AMERICA AND EUROPE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF COLGATE TOTAL TOOTHPASTE, USING PATENTED PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY, TO BOLSTER WORLDWIDE ORAL CARE LEADERSHIP AND EXPECTS NEW PRODUCTS IN ORAL CARE AND OTHER CATEGORIES TO ADD POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER GROWTH. OVERALL, SUBJECT TO GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE 2001 MARKET CONDITIONS TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE EXPERIENCED IN 2000 AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS POSITIVE MOMENTUM TO CONTINUE. HISTORICALLY, THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS INDUSTRY HAS BEEN LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO CHANGES IN ECONOMIC GROWTH THAN MANY OTHER INDUSTRIES, AND THEREFORE THE COMPANY CONSTANTLY EVALUATES PROJECTS THAT WILL FOCUS OPERATIONS ON OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENHANCED GROWTH POTENTIAL. OVER THE LONG TERM, COLGATE'S CONTINUED FOCUS ON ITS CONSUMER PRODUCTS BUSINESS AND THE STRENGTH OF ITS GLOBAL BRAND NAMES, ITS BROAD INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE IN BOTH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING MARKETS, AND ITS STRONG CAPITAL BASE ALL POSITION THE COMPANY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AND TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE PROFITABILITY AND SHAREHOLDER VALUE. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS READERS ARE CAUTIONED THAT THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS REPORT CONTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND PROJECTIONS. A DESCRIPTION OF SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTATIONS EXPRESSED IN THE COMPANY'S FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SET FORTH IN THE COMPANY'S FORM 8-K FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ON NOVEMBER 13, 1998 UNDER THE CAPTION "CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS," TOGETHER WITH ANY FUTURE SUCH FILINGS MADE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, THE ACTIVITIES OF COMPETITORS, RETAIL TRADE PRACTICES, THE SUCCESS OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, COST PRESSURES, MANUFACTURING AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.
