ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

INTRODUCTION

     FedEx Corporation ("FedEx") is a leading global provider of
transportation, e-commerce and supply chain management services. Services
offered by FedEx companies include worldwide express delivery, ground
small-parcel delivery, less-than-truckload freight delivery, global
logistics, supply chain management and customs brokerage, as well as trade
facilitation and electronic commerce solutions. FedEx offers its integrated
business solutions through a portfolio of operating companies, including

-    FEDERAL EXPRESS CORPORATION ("FedEx Express"). FedEx Express is our largest
     subsidiary and is the world leader in global express distribution, offering
     time-certain delivery within 24 to 48 hours among markets that comprise
     more than 90% of the world's gross domestic product.

-    FEDEX GROUND PACKAGE SYSTEM, INC. ("FedEx Ground"). Formerly known as RPS,
     FedEx Ground is North America's second largest provider of
     business-to-business money-back guaranteed ground package delivery. FedEx
     Ground also provides money-back guaranteed, low-cost residential deliveries
     to many major U.S. markets through its new FedEx Home Delivery service.

-    FEDEX GLOBAL LOGISTICS, INC. ("FedEx Logistics"). FedEx Logistics offers
     complete supply chain solutions by combining worldwide transportation,
     information and physical logistics services.

-    FEDEX CUSTOM CRITICAL, INC. ("FedEx Custom Critical"). Formerly known as
     Roberts Express, FedEx Custom Critical is the world's leading
     surface-expedited carrier for time-critical shipments and those requiring
     special handling.

-    FEDEX TRADE NETWORKS, INC. ("FedEx Trade Networks"). FedEx Trade Networks
     provides customs brokerage and trade facilitation solutions, principally
     through its Tower Group International, Inc. subsidiary ("Tower").

-    VIKING FREIGHT, INC. ("Viking"). Viking is a less-than-truckload freight
     carrier operating principally in the western United States.

     FedEx was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 1997 to serve as the
holding company parent of FedEx Express and each of our other operating
companies. Through our holding company, along with our FedEx Corporate
Services, Inc. subsidiary ("FedEx Services"), we are able to provide
strategic direction to, and coordination of, the FedEx portfolio of
companies. We recently formed FedEx Services, principally to combine the
sales, marketing and technology groups of FedEx, FedEx Express and FedEx
Ground, allowing us to provide our customers with a single point of contact
in these areas for easy access to our broad portfolio of services. We believe
that sales and marketing activities, as well as the information systems that
support the extensive automation of our services, are functions that are best
coordinated across subsidiary lines. Through the use of our advanced
information systems which connect the FedEx companies, we make it easy and
convenient for our customers to use the full range of FedEx services.

     We believe that seamless information integration is critical in order to
obtain business synergies from multiple operating units. For example, we have
redesigned our Web site, www.fedex.com, as a single point of contact for our
customers to access FedEx Express and FedEx Ground package tracking, customer
service and invoicing information. In addition, we have combined FedEx
Express and FedEx Ground domestic shipping functionality on our FedEx
PowerShipMC proprietary computer system. This permits customers to use the
dedicateD computer installed in their offices and, with a few keystrokes,
switch between FedEx Express and FedEx Ground domestic shipping services. Our
commitment to provide customers with fully integrated shipping solutions is
reflected in the new strategic initiatives we announced in January 2000. As

<PAGE>

described below, these initiatives are intended to, among other things,
provide a convenient single point of access to our customers for their
shipping needs.

     We manage our business as a portfolio. As a result, decisions on capital
investment, expansion of delivery and information technology networks, and
service additions or enhancements are based on achieving the highest overall
long-term return on capital. For each one of the FedEx companies, we focus on
making appropriate investments in the technology and transportation assets
necessary to optimize our earnings performance and cash flow.

     For financial information concerning FedEx's business segments, refer to
Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere
herein.

     Except as otherwise indicated, references to years means the
fiscal year of FedEx ended May 31 of the year referenced.

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES

       On January 19, 2000, we announced three important strategic
initiatives designed to strengthen our competitive position and to offer new
and more robust solutions for customers worldwide:

-    A new branding strategy to extend the FedEx brand name to most of our
     subsidiaries and to the holding company.

-    Organizational changes planned to take effect over the first half of
     calendar 2000, designed to provide a convenient single point of access to
     customers for sales, customer service, billing and automation systems.

-    An innovative expansion of FedEx Ground service to the low-cost residential
     delivery market, FedEx Home Delivery, began rolling out to many major U.S.
     markets in March 2000.

     Our strategy is to leverage and extend one of our greatest assets, the
FedEx brand, and to provide our customers with an integrated set of business
solutions. Our customers increasingly want a single solution that can meet
all of their global transportation needs. Our goal is to provide them
convenient access to our powerful collection of express, ground, logistics,
supply chain and trade facilitation solutions.

     THE FEDEX BRAND

     Immediately following our January 19th announcement, the parent company,
formerly FDX Corporation, was renamed FedEx Corporation. Substantially all of
our global subsidiaries now operate under the highly-recognized and trusted
FedEx brand name.

-    Federal Express, the worldwide leader in express transportation, retained
     its name but modified its logo to FedEx Express.

-    RPS, which specializes in small-package, business-to-business ground
     delivery, was renamed FedEx Ground. FedEx Home Delivery, the new
     residential delivery service, is provided through FedEx Ground.

-    Roberts Express, the leader in the expedited, time-critical delivery
     sector, was renamed FedEx Custom Critical.

-    FDX Logistics was renamed FedEx Logistics.

     We will continue to meet the needs of customers requiring distinct regional
services through Viking, the leading less-than-truckload carrier in the western
U.S., Tower, an international logistics and trade

<PAGE>

information technology company, and Caribbean Transportation Services, an
airfreight forwarder. These companies remain part of FedEx but retain their
individual brand names, as they are well known and respected in the regional
markets where they operate.

     FedEx is one of the most trusted and respected brands in the world, and
the FedEx brand name is a powerful sales and marketing tool. While FedEx
Ground and FedEx Custom Critical have established excellent reputations in
their market segments, we believe that bringing them under the FedEx brand
umbrella will accelerate their prospects for growth. For example, research
indicates that many customers are not as familiar with the service
reliability levels at RPS as they are with the FedEx reputation for
reliability. We believe that branding those RPS services with the FedEx name
will increase customer awareness for FedEx Ground and generate additional
business.

     ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES

     While each of our subsidiaries will continue to operate independently,
completely focused on the distinct needs of various market segments, we now
provide a single point of access for many customer support functions, such as
customer service, sales and automation. Our sales and marketing organizations
have been combined under FedEx Services to more effectively sell the entire
portfolio of express, ground and e-commerce services. FedEx Services sells
and markets the full portfolio of services offered by our principal
subsidiaries and provides customer-facing solutions that meet customer needs.
FedEx Services also includes substantially all of the information technology
groups from FedEx, FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. The majority of our
e-commerce groups are also part of FedEx Services. By forming a new
subsidiary responsible for sales, marketing, electronic commerce and customer
automation systems, we can fully integrate those vital activities to make our
services more convenient and consistent. We now speak to the customer with
one voice, and provide them with a single access point to our services while
allowing the operating companies to execute the delivery of their services at
the lowest cost with the highest level of service.

     These strategic actions are designed to fulfill our two-fold business
philosophy - to operate independently yet compete collectively. We strongly
believe that the optimal way to serve very distinct market segments, such as
express and ground, is to operate highly efficient, independent networks with
different facilities, different cut-off times and different delivery
commitments. Our collective approach also allows customers to select the
right network, for the right place, at the right price through a single point
of access.

     Each subsidiary generally serves a separate and distinct sector of the
market. Everything about the companies - the operations, the cost structure,
the policies and the culture - has been designed to serve the unique customer
needs of a particular market segment successfully. Each of the companies is a
service leader for its market segment. We believe combining the operations
would lower the superior service levels we are now able to provide. At the
same time, while we operate separately, we compete collectively by combining
the functions that are related to customer communication and information.
That is where our customers want a single, consistent, convenient point of
access.

     In the United States, one of the primary tactics used by our competitors
is to bundle their ground and express services at one packaged price. An
estimated 1.7 million businesses ship both express and ground packages,
accounting for nearly 14 million shipments every day. These "multi-mode"
shippers need one convenient bundled solution, which is why our integrated
sales force has been trained to cross-sell both FedEx Express and FedEx
Ground services. These changes are simply a response to customer preferences
and should strengthen our competitive position in the marketplace.

<PAGE>

     FEDEX HOME DELIVERY

     In March 2000, FedEx Ground began providing FedEx Home Delivery to
approximately 50% of the U.S. population. This delivery-only service is
dedicated to the needs of businesses specializing in the business-to-consumer
marketplace by providing unique and compelling low-cost service offerings.
This new neighborhood-friendly service is designed to fit the way we live,
work and shop today. With this new service, we provide a money-back
guaranteed, low-cost solution to the rapidly increasing number of businesses
who ship large volumes to residential customers. These customers, in general,
want more economical and convenient home delivery options. Features of this
service include:

-    CONVENIENT AND CUSTOMIZED -- FedEx Home Delivery provides customized
     delivery options, including delivery by appointment day or evening, with a
     money-back guarantee.

-    UNIQUE AND EFFICIENT -- FedEx Home Delivery takes advantage of the FedEx
     Ground operational network for pickup and package sorting to maintain a low
     cost structure.

-    DEDICATED TO DELIVERIES -- FedEx Home Delivery is different from the
     competition because it is dedicated to the delivery side of the equation.
     Hence, it is able to focus on meeting the distinct customer interface
     requirements of residential customers.

-    A SUPERIOR E-COMMERCE SOLUTION -- This service complements FedEx Ground's
     leadership position in the business-to-business e-commerce market - by far
     the largest and fastest growing segment of e-commerce. FedEx Home Delivery
     gives "e-tailers" an option that combines reliability with cost-effective
     ground transportation.

     For more information regarding FedEx Home Delivery see "FedEx Ground --
FedEx Home Delivery" elsewhere herein.

FEDEX STRATEGY

     Our strategy is to have focused operating companies that excel in each
segment of the transportation and logistics marketplace, from price-sensitive
to service-sensitive, and to create synergies across companies through
coordinated sales and marketing programs enhanced by state-of-the-art
information technology. We believe that operating independent transportation
networks, each focused on its own respective markets, results in optimal
service quality, reliability and profitability from each of our businesses.
All of the FedEx subsidiaries are free to focus exclusively on the market
sectors in which they have the most expertise.

    We believe that our strategy is proving successful at producing higher
levels of service quality. In June 2000, two FedEx subsidiaries, FedEx
Express and FedEx Ground were named "Carriers of the Year" by Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc., the nation's leading discount retailer. FedEx Express and FedEx
Ground were honored by Wal-Mart for the second year in a row for exceptional
performance in transportation services in their respective categories,
express and ground small package delivery. Wal-Mart's "Carrier of the Year"
is determined by a transportation services provider's ability to meet the
following rigorous criteria: technology, percentage of accepted and rejected
deliveries, on-time pick-up and delivery, customer service, capacity, quality
assurance, ease-of-doing business and long-term commitment.

    Our strategy is also producing improved financial results. For the second
year in a row, we experienced record revenues and earnings per share. During
2000, revenue rose 9% to $18.3 billion, net income increased 9% to $688
million and earnings per share rose 10% to $2.32.

    While our subsidiaries operate independently, they compete collectively.
Because they compete

<PAGE>

collectively, FedEx has the flexibility to rapidly tailor customized delivery
and logistics solutions for its customers. As an example, in June 2000
Amazon.com and FedEx teamed up to deliver the highly anticipated fourth Harry
Potter book on the first day that the book became available to the public.
The arrangement, which we believe is the largest distribution event to date
of any single item in e-commerce, used both FedEx Home Delivery and FedEx
Express services to provide special Saturday door-to-door delivery for a
quarter-million orders placed at the Amazon.com website. To deliver the
books, we mobilized more than 9,000 delivery personnel and vehicles from more
than 700 stations covering the continental U.S. and about 100 regularly
scheduled FedEx Express flights.

    Our strategy allows us to capitalize on four trends shaping the emerging
"Network Economy":

     GLOBAL SOURCING AND SELLING

     As the world's economy becomes more fully integrated, and as barriers
and borders to trade continue to decrease, companies are sourcing and selling
globally. For example, businesses can obtain components from Southeast Asia,
assemble them in Europe and sell them in the United States. This, in turn,
has opened multiple legs of transportation on both the in-bound "sourcing"
side as well as the out-bound "selling" side. With customers in 210
countries, we are a major facilitator in this supply chain because of our
global reach, delivery services and information capabilities. During 2000,
our global express network delivered very strong growth, particularly in Asia
and Europe. Revenue from our FedEx Express international business grew 18%
during 2000, including over 20% in the fourth quarter.

     RAPID GROWTH OF HIGH-TECH AND HIGH-VALUE-ADDED BUSINESSES

    We believe that the high-tech and high-value-added goods sector will
continue to experience strong growth as a percentage of total economic
activity. Information technology alone contributes significantly to real
economic growth in the United States and overseas. The high-value-added
sector, however, is broader, including pharmaceuticals, automotive,
electronics, aviation and other goods with high value per pound.

     ACCELERATION OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN

    The third major trend affecting the "Network Economy" is the increase of
fast-cycle logistics. Companies of varying sizes, particularly in industries
experiencing rapid obsolescence, are increasing productivity, efficiency and
profitability through sharply increased supply chain velocity. A supply chain
is the series of transportation and information exchanges required to convert
raw materials into finished, delivered goods. Managing inventory at rest is
unprofitable. Warehouses, for example, are expensive ways to ensure the
availability of goods. We believe in substituting real-time information to
manage inventory in motion, thereby enabling customers to reduce overhead and
obsolescence, while speeding time-to-market.

    FedEx Logistics allows us to take advantage of the move toward faster,
more efficient supply chains. We believe that the future of logistics will
not be in brick-and-mortar warehouses, but in providing information-intensive
services that increase the value, visibility and velocity of the goods in
customers' supply chains.

    RAPID GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE

     While there has been significant press recently about the expected
growth of consumer purchases over the Internet, the business-to-business
e-commerce marketplace is substantially larger than the business-to-consumer
e-commerce marketplace. Business-to-business e-commerce is estimated to
exceed the $2.7

<PAGE>

trillion sales mark in 2004. Computers and electronics, already two of
FedEx's largest customer segments, currently account for almost half of this
category, and supply chains are increasingly moving online. While FedEx
expects business-to-business e-commerce to remain the largest e-commerce
segment, FedEx is also leveraging the strength of the FedEx portfolio in the
business-to-consumer market. In March 2000, we began our new FedEx Home
Delivery service through FedEx Ground. This new service provides a money-back
guaranteed, low-cost solution to the rapidly increasing number of businesses,
including e-tailers, who ship large volumes to residential customers.

    The following describes in more detail the business of each of our six
principal operating companies:

FEDEX EXPRESS

     INTRODUCTION

     FedEx Express invented express distribution in 1973 and remains the
industry leader, providing rapid, reliable, time-definite delivery of
documents, packages and freight to 210 countries. FedEx Express offers
time-certain delivery in 24 to 48 hours to markets that generate 90% of the
world's gross domestic product through door-to-door, customs-cleared service,
with a money-back guarantee. FedEx Express's extensive air route authorities
and transportation infrastructure, combined with its use of leading-edge
information technologies, make FedEx Express the world's largest
express-distribution company, providing fast, reliable service for over 3.3
million shipments each business day. FedEx Express employs more than 149,000
employees and has more than 46,000 drop-off locations, 663 aircraft and
49,000 vehicles in its integrated global network.

     DELIVERY SERVICES

     DOMESTIC

     FedEx Express offers three U.S. overnight delivery services: FedEx First
Overnight, FedEx Priority Overnight and FedEx Standard Overnight. Overnight
document and package service extends to virtually the entire United States
population. FedEx SameDay service is for urgent shipments up to 70 pounds to
virtually any U.S. destination. Packages and documents are either picked up
from shippers by FedEx Express couriers or are dropped off by shippers at
FedEx Express sorting facilities, FedEx World Service Centers, FedEx Drop
Boxes, FedEx ShipSites or FedEx Authorized ShipCenters strategically located
throughout the country. Two U.S. deferred services are available for less
urgent shipments: FedEx 2Day and FedEx Express Saver.

     U.S. overnight and second-day services are backed by money-back
guarantees and are primarily used by customers for shipment of time-sensitive
documents and goods, including high-value machines and machine parts,
computer parts, software and consumer items. FedEx Express handles virtually
every shipment from origin to destination.

     FedEx Express also offers express freight services to handle the needs
of the time-definite freight market, which is growing at almost twice the
rate of the non-time-definite market. FedEx Express offers customers the
option of one, two or three business day service backed by two money-back
guarantees. Shipments must be 151 lbs. - 2,200 lbs., and be forkliftable,
stackable, banded and shrinkwrapped. FedEx 1Day-SM- Freight offers 10:30 a.m.
delivery, next-business-day in many areas of the continental United States,
including Alaska. FedEx 2Day Freight offers noon delivery in 2 business
days in all 50 states. No advance booking is required. FedEx 3Day-SM- Freight
offers 3:00 p.m. delivery within 3 business days in every state

except Alaska and Hawaii. No advance booking is required.

     INTERNATIONAL

     FedEx Express offers various international package and document delivery
services and international freight services to 210 countries. These services
include: FedEx-Registered Tradmark- International Next Flight, FedEx
International First-Registered Tradmark-, FedEx International Priority
("IP"), FedEx International Economy, FedEx International Priority
DirectDistribution-SM-, FedEx International Priority Plus, FedEx
International MailService, FedEx International Priority Freight, FedEx
International Economy Freight, FedEx InternationaL Express Freight, FedEx
International Airport-to-Airport-SM-, and the FedEx Expressclear-SM-
Electronic Customs Clearance and FedEx International Broker Select service
feature options.

     FedEx Express offers next business day 10:30 a.m. express cargo service
from Asia to the United States. FedEx has a direct flight from Osaka, Japan
to Memphis, Tennessee. The nonstop daily flight cuts transit times across the
Pacific in half for FedEx Express customers -- from 48 to 24 hours -- who
ship from Asia to North America. The FedEx Express IP service is backed by
FedEx Express's money-back guarantee. The flight schedule also enables FedEx
Express to offer its Asian customers later pickup times for connections
through FedEx Express's AsiaOne hub in Subic Bay, the Philippines, to 13
major Asian markets.

     International freight and express delivery markets, particularly
outbound from Asia, are growing rapidly. FedEx Express offers the most
comprehensive international freight service in the industry, backed by a
money-back guarantee, real-time tracking and advanced customs clearance. In
June 2000, FedEx Express announced the expansion of its international freight
service to provide more delivery options to more countries. Three new FedEx
International Priority Freight delivery options were made available for
U.S. outbound and inbound shipments beginning July 1: Door to Airport (DTA),
Airport to Airport (ATA) and Airport to Door (ATD). These options were in
addition to the existing Door to Door (DTD) service. FedEx International
Priority Freight and FedEx International Economy Freight now provide
service to five and ten more countries, respectively. FedEx Express's
enhanced international freight services may now be used by customers to
combine pick-up, linehaul and four delivery options to meet their daily
business needs.

     In order to capitalize on the rapid traffic growth in Europe and Asia,
FedEx Express announced in June 2000 a significant strengthening of its
global network, with new connections in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and
India. As a result of the network reconfiguration, FedEx Express offers
reduced transit times, later customer pick-ups and earlier deliveries in key
global markets. FedEx Express customers in India are able to get their
products to the East Coast of the U.S. a full business day faster as a result
of the new flights. Companies in southeast Asia doing business in Europe are
now able to take orders from their customers two to three hours later in the
evening, thanks to later cut off times for FedEx Express pick-ups.

     In June 1999, the U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT") announced a
new protocol with the Chinese government permitting FedEx Express to expand
its existing service to China. FedEx Express is currently the only U.S.
all-cargo airline with route authority to serve China, with 10 weekly flights.

     FedEx Express is ISO 9001 certified for its global operations. ISO 9001
is currently the most rigorous international standard for Quality Management
and Assurance. These quality standards were developed by the International
Organization for Standardization in Geneva, Switzerland to promote and
facilitate international trade. More than 90 countries, including European
Union members, the United States and Japan, recognize ISO standards.

     Detailed information about all of FedEx Express's delivery services can

site, however, does not form part of this Report.

     E-COMMERCE SERVICES

     We have played a significant role in three business revolutions that
have influenced the emergence of what is now known as e-commerce. First came
the express revolution. We anticipated the "just-in-time future," which led
to the creation of FedEx and the first integrated air/ground express
transportation network in 1973.

     Second came the automation revolution. We have been the leader in
customer automation since 1985, when FedEx Express launched the first
PC-based automated shipping system, named FedEx PowerShip-Registered
Tradmark-. In 1993, FedEx Ground launched MultiShip-Registered Tradmark-, the
first carrier-supplied customer automation system to process packages shipped
by other transportation providers. In 1994, the FedEx Web site, fedex.com,
became the first Web site to offer online package tracking. Two years later,
in 1996, FedEx Express launched FedEx interNetShip-Registered Tradmark-, the
first shipping application for express packages on the Internet. Customers
could now prepare paperwork using formatted screens, print the label on any
laser printer, and electronically request a courier to pick up the package.

     The third revolution, the integration revolution, is now underway. We
are empowering businesses with integrated eBusiness and complete supply chain
solutions. Many of our newest eBusiness solutions are directed toward the
rapidly growing small and medium-sized business ("SMB") market. In June 2000,
we announced an alliance with Orbit Commerce, Inc., a leading eBusiness
services platform provider, resulting in the introduction of FedEx eCommerce
Builder on our Web site. This solution provides SMB's with the ability to
build and manage an online store. FedEx eCommerce Builder integrates the core
business processes necessary for SMB's to sell online, including FedEx
shipping and tracking.

     We have a comprehensive Internet strategy, driven by our desire for
customer convenience. The focal point of our Internet strategy is our
fedex.com Web site, through which our customers accomplish all of the tasks
they could otherwise accomplish with us by phone or in person. In addition,
we design our e-commerce tools and solutions so that they are easily
integrated into our customers' applications, as well as into third-party
software being developed by the leading e-procurement, systems integration
and enterprise resource planning companies. This is increasingly important
given the growing customer trend toward multi-carrier shipping platforms.

     Reflecting our emphasis on e-commerce and information technology, we
have had a lineage of distinguished Chief Information Officers, including
James L. Barksdale, who went on to serve as the President and Chief Executive
Officer of Netscape Communications Corporation, Dennis H. Jones, named by
NETWORK WORLD as "One of the 25 Most Powerful People in Networking" and by PC
WEEK as "One of the Top 10 Toughest CIOs," and current CIO Robert B. Carter,
named as INFOWORLD'S first-ever "Chief Technology Officer of the Year."

     E-SHIPPING TOOLS AND SOLUTIONS

     We offer e-shipping tools and solutions which give our customers the

     accounts payable systems to allow them to receive FedEx invoice data
     electronically, including data regarding domestic and international
     shipments, duties and taxes.

     PRICING

     FedEx Express periodically publishes list prices in its Service Guides
for the majority of its services. In general, during 2000, U.S. shipping
rates were based on the service selected, destination zone, weight, size, any
ancillary service charge and whether or not the shipment was picked up by a
FedEx Express courier or dropped off by the customer at a FedEx Express
location. International rates are based on the type of service provided and
vary with size, weight and destination. FedEx Express offers its customers
volume discounts generally based on actual or potential average daily revenue
produced. Discounts are generally determined by reference to several local
and national revenue bands developed by FedEx Express.

     In response to higher fuel costs, FedEx Express implemented a fuel
surcharge of 3% on most U.S. domestic and international services, effective
February 1, 2000. The fuel surcharge was further increased to 4%, effective
April 1, 2000. The surcharge applies to all shipments tendered within the
United States and all U.S. export shipments, where legally and contractually
possible.

     OPERATIONS

     FedEx Express's global transportation and distribution services are
provided through an extensive worldwide network consisting of numerous
aviation and ground transportation operating rights and authorities, 663
aircraft, approximately 49,000 vehicles, sorting facilities, FedEx World
Service Centers, FedEx Drop Boxes, FedEx ShipSites and ShipCenters and
sophisticated package tracking, billing and communications systems.

     FedEx Express's primary sorting facility, the SuperHub located in
Memphis, serves as the center of FedEx Express's multiple hub-and-spoke
system. A second national hub is located in Indianapolis. In addition to
these national hubs, FedEx Express operates regional hubs in Newark, Oakland
and Fort Worth and major metropolitan sorting facilities in Los Angeles and
Chicago. Facilities in Anchorage, Paris and Subic Bay, the Philippines, serve
as sorting facilities for express package and freight traffic moving to and
from Asia, Europe and North America. Additional major sorting and freight
handling facilities are located at Narita Airport in Tokyo, Stansted Airport
outside London and Pearson Airport in Toronto. Facilities in Subic Bay and
Paris are also designed to serve as regional hubs for their respective market
areas.

    Throughout its worldwide network, FedEx Express operates city stations
and employs a staff of customer service agents, cargo handlers and couriers
who pick up and deliver shipments in the station's service area. In some
cities, FedEx Express operates FedEx World Service Centers which are staffed,
store-front facilities located in high-traffic, high-density areas. Unmanned
FedEx Drop Boxes provide customers the opportunity to drop off packages at
locations in office buildings, shopping centers and corporate or industrial
parks. FedEx Express has also formed alliances with certain retailers to
extend this customer convenience network to drop-off sites in retail stores.
In international regions where low package traffic makes FedEx Express's

<PAGE>

direct presence less economical, Global Service Participants ("GSPs") have
been selected to complete deliveries and to pick up packages.

     FedEx Express has an advanced package tracking and billing system, FedEx
COSMOS-Registered Tradmark-, that utilizes hand-held electronic scanning
equipment and computer terminals. This system provides proof of delivery
information, an electronically reproduced airbill for the customer and
information regarding the location of a package within FedEx Express's
system. For international shipments, FedEx Express has developed FedEx
Expressclear-SM-, a worldwide electronic customs clearance system, which
speeds up customs clearance by allowing customs agents in destination
countries to review information about shipments before they arrive.

     FUEL SUPPLIES AND COSTS

     During 2000, FedEx Express purchased aviation fuel from various
suppliers under contracts which vary in length and which provide for specific
amounts of fuel to be delivered. The fuel represented by these contracts is
purchased at market prices that may fluctuate daily.

     As a result of rising fuel prices during 2000, we entered into jet fuel
hedging contracts during the second half of 2000 that are designed to limit
our exposure to fluctuations in jet fuel prices. Under these contracts, we
make (or receive) payments based on the difference between a specified lower
(or upper) limit and the market price of jet fuel, as determined by an index
of spot market prices representing various geographic regions. The difference
is recorded as an increase or decrease in fuel expense. Under jet fuel
hedging contracts, we received approximately $18 million in 2000. As of May
31, 2000, we had entered into jet fuel hedging contracts for approximately
one-third of FedEx Express's estimated requirements for jet fuel in 2001. The
timing and magnitude of any additional contracts may vary due to availability
and pricing. Notwithstanding our hedging activities, during 2000, fuel costs
increased by $273 million due to higher fuel prices.

     The following table sets forth FedEx Express's costs for aviation fuel
and its percentage of total operating expense for the previous five fiscal
years:

               1997                  557,533                       5.2
               1996                  461,401                       4.8
</TABLE>

     In response to higher fuel costs, FedEx Express implemented a fuel
surcharge of 3% on most U.S. domestic and international services, effective
February 1, 2000. The fuel surcharge was increased to 4%, effective April 1,
2000. The surcharge applies to all shipments tendered within the United
States and all U.S. export shipments, where legally and contractually
possible. These fuel surcharges offset the increase in fuel expense during
the fourth quarter of 2000.

     Approximately 15% of FedEx Express's requirement for vehicle fuel is
purchased in bulk. The remainder of FedEx Express's requirement is satisfied
by retail purchases with various discounts.

<PAGE>

     Management believes that, barring a substantial disruption in supplies
of crude oil, these agreements will ensure the availability of an adequate
supply of fuel for FedEx Express's needs for the immediate future. However, a
substantial reduction of oil supplies from oil producing regions or refining
capacity, or other events causing a substantial reduction in the supply of
aviation fuel, could have a significant adverse effect on FedEx Express.

     COMPETITION

     The express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and
sensitive to price and service. The ability to compete effectively depends
upon price, frequency and capacity of scheduled service, ability to track
packages, extent of geographic coverage and reliability. Competitors in these
markets include other package delivery concerns, principally United Parcel
Service, Inc. ("UPS"), Airborne Express, DHL Worldwide Express, passenger
airlines offering express package services, regional express delivery
concerns, airfreight forwarders and the United States Postal Service. FedEx
Express's principal competitors in the international market are DHL Worldwide
Express, UPS, foreign postal authorities such as Deutsche Poste and TNT Post
Group, passenger airlines and all-cargo airlines.

     FedEx Express currently holds certificates of authority to serve more
foreign countries than any other United States all-cargo air carrier and its
extensive, scheduled international route system allows it to offer
single-carrier service to many points not offered by its principal all-cargo
competitors. This international route system, combined with an integrated air
and ground network, enables FedEx Express to offer international customers
more extensive single-carrier service to a greater number of U.S. domestic
points than can be provided currently by competitors. Many of FedEx Express's
competitors in the international market, however, are government owned,
controlled, or subsidized carriers which may have greater resources, lower
costs, less profit sensitivity and more favorable operating conditions than
FedEx Express.

     EMPLOYEES

     FedEx Express is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. David J. Bronczek
is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Express. As of May 31,
2000, FedEx Express employed approximately 96,000 permanent full-time and
53,000 permanent part-time employees, of which approximately 20% are employed
in Memphis. Employees of FedEx Express's international branches and
subsidiaries in the aggregate represent approximately 13% of all employees.
FedEx Express believes its relationship with its employees is excellent.

     Since May 31, 1999, FedEx Express and the Fedex Pilots Association
("FPA") have been operating under a five-year collective bargaining agreement
which provides, in part, for a 17% pay increase over the term of the contract
(3.4% average annual increase), enhanced retirement benefits, direct pilot
input on scheduling issues, and limits on types of trips scheduled during
certain times of the day.

     Attempts by other labor organizations to organize certain other groups
of employees occur from time to time. Although FedEx Express responds to
these organization attempts, we cannot predict the outcome of these labor
activities or their effect, if any, on FedEx Express or its employees.

FEDEX GROUND

     INTRODUCTION

<PAGE>

     By focusing on business-to-business customers, maintaining a low cost
structure and efficiently using information technology, FedEx Ground has
become the second-largest ground small-package carrier in the United States.
FedEx Ground serves customers in the small-package market in North America,
focusing primarily on the business-to-business delivery of packages weighing
up to 150 pounds. FedEx Ground provides ground service to 100% of the United
States population and overnight service to approximately 80% of the United
States population. Through its subsidiary, FedEx Ground Package System, Ltd.,
service is provided to 100% of the Canadian population. Additionally, FedEx
Ground provides service to Mexico through an alliance with Estefeda Mexicana,
S.A. de C.V. FedEx Ground also offers service offshore to Puerto Rico, Alaska
and Hawaii via a ground/air network operation in cooperation with other
transportation providers.

     In March 2000, FedEx Ground began providing FedEx Home Delivery to
approximately 50% of the U.S. population. FedEx Home Delivery takes advantage
of the FedEx Ground operational network for pickup and package sorting to
maintain a low cost structure. FedEx Home Delivery is dedicated exclusively
to the delivery side of the business. Hence, it focuses and excels on meeting
the distinct customer interface requirements of residential customers.

     FedEx Ground provides other specialized transportation services to meet
specific customer requirements in the small-package market. FedEx Ground
conducts its operations primarily with 9,800 owner-operated vehicles and, in
addition, owns over 10,800 trailers. Competition for high-volume, profitable
business focuses largely on providing competitive pricing and dependable
service. FedEx Ground provides a money-back guarantee on all
business-to-business ground deliveries within the continental United States.

     FEDEX HOME DELIVERY

     FedEx Home Delivery was created to respond to business-to-consumer
demand for a better ground delivery solution for the residential market.
Recognizing the unique needs of this growing sector, which Forrester
Research, Inc. projects will escalate from $39 billion in 2000 to $184
billion by 2004, FedEx Home Delivery introduced new ideas to
business-to-consumer delivery to help retailers address mounting fulfillment
challenges. This service expansion offers an economical and customized
residential solution to fit the individual needs of customers. FedEx Home
Delivery offers a suite of service options not offered by competitors,
including extended evening delivery, Saturday delivery, and premium services,
such as day-specific, signature and appointment delivery. FedEx Home Delivery
brings an unmatched level of service to residential shippers and their
customers and also offers the only money-back guarantee in the residential
ground delivery market.

    In June 2000, due to the response of business-to-consumer shippers and
their customers to the innovative service options FedEx Home Delivery brings
to the residential market, FedEx Ground announced the accelerated expansion
of the FedEx Home Delivery network. Through a two-phase expansion plan, which
began in July 2000, FedEx Ground will open approximately 150 new FedEx Home
Delivery terminals to increase the network's service coverage. FedEx Home
Delivery expects to increase its reach from 50% to 70% of the U.S. population
by March 31, 2001 and to approximately 80% of the U.S. population by
September 2001. Full coverage of the U.S. population is expected to be
achieved by September 2002, more than one year earlier than originally
scheduled.

     OPERATIONS

     FedEx Ground utilizes advanced automatic sortation technology to
streamline the handling of over 1.4 million daily packages. FedEx Ground also
utilizes software systems and Internet-based applications to

<PAGE>

offer its customers new ways to connect internal package information with
external delivery information. FedEx Ground provides multiple-carrier
shipment tracing and proof-of-delivery signature functionality on the FedEx
Web site (www.fedex.com). For additional information regarding FedEx Ground's
e-shipping tools and solutions, see "FedEx Express - E-Commerce Services."

     Like FedEx Express, FedEx Ground utilizes a hub-and-spoke sorting and
distribution system. Its 27 hubs are equipped with sophisticated
package-sortation technology, with average processing speeds of 15,000 to
20,000 packages per hour. In January 1999, FedEx Ground announced its
intention to boost its package-processing capacity by 50% through a
three-year expansion program. Plans included the opening of three new
state-of-the-art distribution hubs that will support key metropolitan markets
in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, as well as the relocation and expansion
of more than 50 local terminals. The Chicago and Los Angeles area hubs opened
in 2000, while the New York area hub is scheduled to open in August 2000. The
New York area facility will be the largest in the FedEx Ground network. It
will be 326,000 square feet in size and capable of processing 30,000 packages
per hour - approximately double the processing capacity of the average FedEx
Ground hub.  FedEx Ground also expanded existing hubs in Toledo and Denver
during 2000 and expects to complete expansion of its Sacramento hub in 2001.
As of May 31, 2000, FedEx Ground operated 369 facilities in the U.S. and
Canada.

     Using overhead laser scanners, hub conveyors electronically guide
packages to their appropriate destination chute, where they are loaded for
transport to their destination terminals for local delivery. FedEx Ground is
still the only ground carrier to operate a fully automated hub network for
greater efficiency and package integrity.

     In order to provide the new FedEx Home Delivery service, FedEx Ground is
leveraging its existing pickup operation and hub and linehaul network while
initiating a separate delivery network comprised of distinct terminals and a
separate team of independent contractors. As of May 31, 2000, FedEx Ground
had opened 64 dedicated delivery terminals to support the FedEx Home Delivery
service in 45 metropolitan areas. FedEx Ground plans to add more dedicated
FedEx Home Delivery facilities over the next two years as part of an
aggressive plan to rapidly expand its residential service area.

     FedEx Ground is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Daniel J.
Sullivan is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Ground. FedEx
Ground has approximately 35,000 employees and contractors in North America.
FedEx Ground's primary competitors are UPS and the United States Postal
Service.

SEASONALITY OF BUSINESS

     FedEx Express's express package business and freight business are both
seasonal in nature. Historically, the U.S. package business experiences an
increase in late November and December. International business, particularly
in the Asia to U.S. market, peaks in October and November due to U.S. holiday
sales. The latter part of FedEx Express's third fiscal quarter and late
summer, being post winter-holiday and summer vacation seasons, have
historically exhibited lower volumes relative to other periods.

     The transportation and logistics industry is affected directly by the
state of the overall domestic and international economies. Seasonal
fluctuations affect tonnage, revenues and earnings. Normally, the fall of
each year is the busiest shipping period for FedEx Ground and FedEx Custom
Critical, while the latter part of December, January, June and July of each
year are the slowest periods. For Viking, the fall of each year is the
busiest shipping period and the latter part of December, January and February
of each year are the slowest periods. Shipment levels, operating costs and
earnings can also be adversely affected by inclement weather.

REGULATION

     AIR. Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, both the DOT
and the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") exercise regulatory authority
over FedEx Express. The DOT's authority relates primarily to economic aspects
of air transportation. The DOT's jurisdiction extends to aviation route
authority and to other regulatory matters, including the transfer of route
authority between carriers. FedEx Express holds various certificates issued
by the DOT, authorizing FedEx Express to engage in U.S. and international air
transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis. FedEx Express's
international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from several
points in its U.S. route system to numerous points throughout the world. The
DOT regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to
investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of United States
air carriers abroad. The right of a United States carrier to serve foreign
points is subject to the DOT's approval and generally requires a bilateral
agreement between the United States and the foreign government. The carrier
must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide
specific flights and services. The regulatory environment for global aviation
rights may from time to time impair the ability of FedEx Express to operate
its air network in the most efficient manner.

     The FAA's regulatory authority relates primarily to safety and
operational aspects of air transportation, including aircraft standards and
maintenance, personnel and ground facilities, which may from time to time
affect the ability of FedEx Express to operate its aircraft in the most
efficient manner. FedEx Express holds an operating certificate granted by the
FAA pursuant to Part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. This
certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as FedEx
Express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational
requirements of the regulations.

     FedEx Express participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet ("CRAF")
program. Under this program, the Department of Defense may requisition for
military use certain of FedEx Express's wide-bodied aircraft in the event of
a declared need, including a national emergency. FedEx Express is compensated
for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the CRAF program at
standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of
awarding contracts. Through its participation in the CRAF program, FedEx
Express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business.
FedEx Express, together with a consortium of other carriers, currently
contracts with the United States Government for charter flights.

     GROUND. The ground transportation performed by FedEx Express is integral to
its air transportation

<PAGE>

services. Prior to January 1996, FedEx Express conducted its interstate motor
carrier operations pursuant to common and contract carrier authorities issued
by the Interstate Commerce Commission ("ICC"). The ICC Termination Act of
1995 abolished the ICC and transferred responsibility for interstate motor
carrier registration to the DOT.

     The enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act
of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates, routes or
services of intermodal all-cargo air carriers and most motor carriers. States
may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance. FedEx Express
is registered in those states that require registration.

    The operations of FedEx Ground, Viking and FedEx Custom Critical in
interstate commerce are currently regulated by the DOT and the Federal
Highway Administration, which retain limited oversight authority over motor
carriers. Federal legislation has been enacted that preempted regulation by
the states of rates and service in intrastate freight transportation.

     Like other interstate motor carriers, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground,
Viking and FedEx Custom Critical are subject to certain DOT safety
requirements governing interstate operations. In addition, vehicle weight and
dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations.

     COMMUNICATION. Because of the extensive use of radio and other
communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation
operations, FedEx Express is subject to the Federal Communications Commission
Act of 1934, as amended. Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission
regulates and licenses FedEx Express's activities pertaining to satellite
communications.

     ENVIRONMENTAL. Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the
assistance of the Environmental Protection Agency, is authorized to establish
standards governing aircraft noise. FedEx Express's present aircraft fleet is
in compliance with current noise standards of the Federal Aviation
Regulations. FedEx Express's aircraft are also subject to, and are in
compliance with, the regulations governing engine emissions. In addition to
federal regulation of aircraft noise, certain airport operators have local
noise regulations which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and
time of day. These regulations have had a restrictive effect on FedEx
Express's aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but
do not have a material effect on any of FedEx Express's significant markets.
Congress' passage of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 established a
National Noise Policy which enabled FedEx Express to plan for noise reduction
and better respond to local noise constraints. FedEx Express's international
operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries
in which it operates.

     FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, Viking and FedEx Custom Critical are
subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations
relating to, among other things, contingency planning for spills of petroleum
products and the disposal of waste oil. Additionally, these companies are
subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks,
hazardous waste handling, vehicle and equipment emissions and the discharge
of effluents from properties and equipment owned or operated by them. Each
company has environmental management programs to ensure compliance with these
regulations.

      WORKPLACE. In November 1999, the U.S. Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, or OSHA, proposed regulations to mandate an ergonomics
standard that could require many businesses, including FedEx's operating
companies, to make significant changes in the workplace in order to reduce
the incidence of musculoskeletal disorders such as lower back pain. The
proposal does not specify which workplace changes would be required in order
to comply with the proposed new regulations. We, our competitors and other
affected parties have submitted comments to OSHA challenging the economic and
technical feasibility of the proposed regulations. In July 2000, OSHA
completed public hearings on the proposed regulations and is expected to
release final rules later this year.

<PAGE>

     If OSHA adopts the proposed regulations and applies them in the same way
as it attempted unsuccessfully in the past to impose ergonomic measures under
its general authority, we would be required to make extensive changes to the
layout of our sorting facilities and hire a significant number of additional
employees. We believe that the cost of compliance would be substantial and
have a material adverse effect on our business. We expect that our
competitors, along with the rest of American industry, would also incur
substantial compliance costs.

     CUSTOMS. Through its FedEx Trade Networks subsidiary, FedEx provides
customs brokerage and freight forwarding services. These activities are
subject to regulation by the U.S. Customs Service (customs brokerage), the
U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (ocean freight forwarding) and the U.S.
Department of Transportation (airfreight forwarding). FedEx's offshore
operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of
the respective foreign jurisdictions.

     Express and leased to unaffiliated

<PAGE>

     operators to support FedEx Express operations in areas where demand does
     not justify use of a larger aircraft.

     An inventory of spare engines and parts is maintained for each aircraft
type.

     In addition, FedEx Express "wet leases" 45 smaller piston-engine and
turbo-prop aircraft which feed packages to and from airports served by FedEx
Express's larger jet aircraft. The wet lease agreements call for the
owner-lessor to provide flight crews, insurance and maintenance, as well as
fuel and other supplies required to operate the aircraft. FedEx Express's wet
lease agreements are for terms not exceeding one year and are generally
cancelable upon 30 days' notice.

     At May 31, 2000, FedEx Express operated worldwide approximately 49,000
ground transport vehicles, including pick-up and delivery vans, larger trucks
called container transport vehicles and over-the-road tractors and trailers.

     AIRCRAFT PURCHASE COMMITMENTS

     At May 31, 2000, FedEx Express was committed under various contracts to
purchase 28 MD11s, 13 DC10s (in addition to those discussed below) and 75
Ayres ALM 200 aircraft to be delivered through 2007.

     FedEx Express has entered into agreements with two airlines to acquire
53 DC10 aircraft (49 of which have been received as of May 31, 2000), spare
parts, aircraft engines and other equipment, and maintenance services in
exchange for a combination of aircraft engine noise reduction kits and cash.
Delivery of these aircraft began in 1997 and will continue through 2001.
Additionally, these airlines may exercise put options through December 31,
2003, requiring FedEx Express to purchase up to 11 additional DC10s, along
with additional aircraft engines and equipment.

     In April 2000, put options were exercised by an airline requiring FedEx
Express to purchase six DC10s (in addition to those discussed in the
preceding paragraph) for a total purchase price of $26.4 million. Delivery of
the aircraft is expected to be completed by April 2001.

     FedEx Express's facilities at the Memphis International Airport also
include aircraft hangars, flight training and fuel facilities, administrative
offices and warehouse space. FedEx Express leases these facilities from the
Memphis-Shelby County Airport Authority (the "Authority") under several
leases. The leases cover land, the administrative and sorting buildings,
other facilities, ramps and certain related equipment. FedEx Express has the
option to purchase certain equipment (but not buildings or improvements to
real estate) leased under such leases at the end of the lease term for a
nominal sum. The leases obligate FedEx Express to maintain and insure the
leased property and to pay all related taxes, assessments and other charges.
The leases are subordinate to, and FedEx Express's rights thereunder could be
affected by, any future lease or agreement between the Authority and the
United States Government.

     In addition to the facilities noted above, FedEx Express has major
international sorting and freight handling facilities located at Narita
Airport in Tokyo, Japan, Stansted Airport outside London, England and Pearson
Airport in Toronto, Canada. New, larger facilities were opened in 1998 at the
new Chek Lap Kok Airport in Hong Kong, CKS International Airport in Taiwan
and Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Construction on a 204,000 square foot
facility to be located at Miami International Airport is expected to begin
during 2001.

     ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER PROPERTIES AND FACILITIES

     FedEx Express has facilities housing administrative and technical
operations on approximately 200 acres adjacent to the Memphis International
Airport. Of the seven buildings located on this site, four are subject to
long-term leases, and the other three are owned by FedEx Express. FedEx
Express also leases approximately 90 facilities in the Memphis area for its
corporate headquarters, warehouse facilities and administrative offices.
FedEx Express is building a headquarters office campus in East Shelby County,
Tennessee. The headquarters campus, which will comprise nine separate
buildings with more than 1.1 million square feet of space, is designed to
consolidate many administrative and training functions currently spread
throughout the Memphis metropolitan area. Beginning in July 2000, the office
campus will bring together approximately 3,700 employees from more than 100
work groups.

     FedEx Express owns or leases 725 facilities for city station operations
in the United States. In addition, 153 city stations are owned or leased
throughout FedEx Express's international network. The majority of these
leases are for terms of five to ten years. City stations serve as the sorting
and distribution center for a particular city or region. FedEx Express
believes that suitable alternative facilities are available in each locale on
satisfactory terms, if necessary.

     As of May 31, 2000, FedEx Express owned or leased space for 387 FedEx
World Service Centers in the United States and had placed approximately
34,500 Drop Boxes. FedEx Express also operates stand-alone mini-centers
located on leaseholds in parking lots adjacent to office buildings, shopping
centers and office parks, of which 93 were in service at May 31, 2000. As of
May 31, 2000, FedEx Express also had approximately 10,000 ShipSites and
ShipCenters, which are drop-off locations situated within certain retailers,
such as Staples or Kinkos. Internationally, FedEx Express operates 91 FedEx
World Service Centers and has over 650 FedEx Drop Boxes.

     FedEx Services has an office campus in Collierville, Tennessee for its
information technology and telecommunications division.

FEDEX GROUND

     As of May 31, 2000, FedEx Ground operated 369 facilities, including 27
hubs. FedEx Ground owns 52

<PAGE>

facilities (23 of which are hubs) and leases 317, generally for terms of
three years or less. The 27 hub facilities are strategically located to cover
the geographic area served by FedEx Ground. These facilities average 131,000
square feet and range in size from 31,000 to 262,000 square feet. FedEx
Ground Package System, Ltd., FedEx Ground's subsidiary operating in Canada,
operates 13 facilities, three of which are hubs.

     FedEx Ground's corporate offices and information and data centers are
located in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area in an approximately 350,000
square foot building owned by FedEx Ground. FedEx Ground is expanding its
corporate offices with a 156,000 square foot addition, which is expected to
be completed in 2002.

FEDEX  LOGISTICS

     FedEx Logistics' corporate headquarters is located in Memphis, Tennessee
in leased facilities. FedEx Supply Chain Services' headquarters is located in
Hudson, Ohio in leased facilities.  Caribbean Transportation Services'
headquarters is located in Greensboro, North Carolina in leased facilities.

FEDEX CUSTOM CRITICAL

Tennessee in leased facilities. Tower's corporate headquarters is located in
Buffalo, New York in owned facilities. Tower also has 63 owned and leased
offices throughout North America. Worldtariff's corporate headquarters is

VIKING

     As of May 31, 2000, Viking operated 50 service centers, 32 of which are
owned. The service centers are strategically located to cover the geographic
area served by Viking. These facilities range in size from 1,800 to 72,000
square feet of office and dock space, and are located on sites ranging from
1.8 to 38.3 acres. Viking's corporate headquarters is located in leased
facilities in San Jose, California.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     In November 1987, The Flying Tiger Line Inc. ("Flying Tigers"), a
company acquired by FedEx Express in 1989, received a notice from the United
States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") identifying Flying Tigers as a
potentially responsible party ("PRP") in connection with a "Superfund" site
located in Monterey Park, California. The site is a 190-acre landfill that
operated from 1948 through 1984. In June 1985, the EPA began a remedial
investigation of the site to identify the extent of contamination. The EPA
estimates that approximately 0.1% of the waste disposed at the site is
attributable to Flying Tigers. Flying Tigers participated in a partial
settlement relating to remedial actions for management of contamination and
site control. Partial consent decrees were entered in the United States
District Court for the Central District of California in 1989 and 1992 which
provided, in part, for payments of $109,000 and $230,000, respectively, by
Flying Tigers and FedEx Express to the partial-settlement escrow account. All
outstanding issues are not expected to be resolved for several years. Due to
several variables which are beyond FedEx Express's control, it is impossible
to accurately estimate FedEx Express's potential share of the remaining

<PAGE>

costs, but based on Flying Tigers' relatively insignificant contribution of
waste to the site, FedEx Express believes that its remaining liability will
not be material.

     FedEx and its subsidiaries are subject to other legal proceedings and
claims that arise in the ordinary course of their business. In the opinion of
management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to these other
actions will not materially adversely affect FedEx's financial position or
results of operations.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

     There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the
fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2000.

This issuance of securities was made in reliance on the exemption from
registration provided by Section 3(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, as a
transaction by an issuer not involving a public offering. The securities were
acquired by the Worldtariff shareholder for investment and not with a view
toward the resale or distribution of these shares. The offer and sale was
made without any public solicitation and the stock certificate bears a
restrictive legend. No underwriter was involved in the transaction and no
commissions were paid.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

       FedEx Corporation (also referred to herein as "FedEx" or the
"Company") results for 2000 reflect strong international package volume
growth, particularly in Asia and Europe, and improved revenue per package
(yield), which lessened the effect of higher fuel prices. U.S. domestic
package volume growth during 2000 was below that experienced over the past
two years. However, the Company's execution of cost containment and
productivity enhancement programs helped mitigate the impact of the decrease
in U.S. domestic volume growth in 2000.

       Increased prices caused fuel expense to increase by $273 million in
2000. In response to higher fuel costs, several of our subsidiaries
implemented fuel surcharges during 2000. At Federal Express Corporation
("FedEx Express"), the Company's largest business segment, a 3% fuel
surcharge on most U.S. domestic and international services was implemented
effective February 1, 2000. Effective April 1, 2000, this surcharge was
increased to 4%. The surcharge applies to all shipments tendered within the
United States and all U.S. export shipments, where legally and contractually
possible. We have also entered into jet fuel hedging contracts designed to
limit our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices. In 2000, we received
approximately $18 million under these contracts, principally in the fourth
quarter. FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. ("FedEx Ground") also implemented
a 1.25% fuel surcharge on all of its services, effective August 7, 2000, in
response to continued high fuel costs.

       During 2000, we began a major rebranding and reorganization initiative
that management believes will enable our operating subsidiaries to compete
collectively while retaining the independent operating structure of their
business units. The new branding strategy extended the FedEx brand name to
three subsidiaries and the Company, formerly FDX Corporation. The
reorganization is designed to enhance revenue growth and improve financial
returns by centralizing the sales, marketing, customer service and most of
the information technology functions of our two largest subsidiaries. Most of
these functions were moved into a new corporate services company called FedEx
Corporate Services, Inc. ("FedEx Services") effective June 1, 2000. We also
launched our FedEx Home Delivery service in March 2000. This service was
initially offered to approximately 50% of the U.S. population. The rebranding
and reorganization actions and FedEx Home Delivery negatively affected 2000
operating income by approximately $40 million.

       As expected, operating profit from the sale of engine noise reduction
kits ("hushkits") declined by $50 million in 2000, following a $30 million
decline in 1999.

       Operating results for 1999 included $81 million in operating expenses
associated with strike contingency planning during contract negotiations
between FedEx Express and the Fedex Pilots Association ("FPA"). To avoid
service interruptions related to a threatened strike, FedEx began strike
contingency planning, including entering into agreements for additional
third-party air and ground transportation and establishing special financing
arrangements. Negotiations with the FPA ultimately resulted in a five-year
collective bargaining agreement that took effect on May 31, 1999.

<PAGE>

       Operating results in 1998 included $88 million of expenses related to
the acquisition of Caliber System, Inc. ("Caliber") and the formation of
FedEx. These expenses were primarily investment banking fees and payments to
members of Caliber's management in accordance with pre-existing management
retention agreements. Excluding these expenses, consolidated net income for
1998 was $583 million.

       Another significant item impacting 1998's results of operations was
the Teamsters strike against United Parcel Service ("UPS") in August 1997.
FedEx analytically calculated that the volume not retained at the end of the
first quarter of 1998 contributed approximately $170 million in revenues and
approximately $.12 additional earnings per share.

     OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE AND INCOME TAXES

       Net interest expense increased 8% for 2000, due to higher average debt
levels, primarily incurred as a result of FedEx's stock repurchase program,
business acquisitions and bond redemptions. For 1999, net interest expense
decreased 21% primarily due to lower debt levels.

       Other, net in 2000 included gains of approximately $12 million from an
insurance settlement for a destroyed MD11 aircraft and approximately $11
million from the sale of securities held. In 1999 this category included
approximately $10 million of expenses related to the Company's strike
contingency plans described above, primarily costs associated with a business
interruption credit facility.

       FedEx's effective tax rate was 39.5% in 2000, 40.5% in 1999 and 44.6% in
1998. Excluding nonrecurring items from the Caliber acquisition in 1998, the
effective rate would have been 41.5% in 1998. The 39.5% effective tax rate in
2000 was lower than the 1999 effective rate primarily due to stronger results
from international operations. Generally, the effective tax rate exceeds the
statutory U.S. federal tax rate because of state income taxes and other
factors as identified in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. For 2001, we expect the effective tax rate will not exceed, and
could possibly be lower than, the 2000 rate. The actual rate, however, will
depend on a number of factors, including the amount and source of operating
income.

       OUTLOOK

       In 2001, we expect FedEx will realize increased volumes and yields as
a result of the rebranding and reorganization initiative begun in 2000.
Training of the combined sales force was completed in the fourth quarter of
2000 and sales and marketing efforts to cross-sell express and ground
services have begun. While there will be continued front-end costs associated
with increasing the sales force and emphasizing marketing efforts on small
and medium-sized customers, we expect the Company may begin to realize
benefits from this initiative starting as early as the second quarter of
2001. Full integration of the customer service function, expected to be
completed in the second half of 2001, will provide customers with one FedEx
account number and a single point of contact for all express and ground
services. However, there are certain risks and uncertainties associated with
this initiative that could affect its success and FedEx's future financial
performance. Those risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to,
the complexities and costs associated with integrating the sales and
marketing functions, including the technologies supporting those functions;
market acceptance of the new branding strategy and the combined sales force;
competitive responses to our actions, including those affecting pricing, and
general U.S. and international economic conditions.

     We will continue to invest in the expansion of FedEx Home Delivery and have
announced plans to

<PAGE>

accelerate the rollout of this service to achieve service coverage of
approximately 80% of the U.S. population by September 2001. We believe this
service will allow the Company to capture an increased share of the
business-to-consumer shipping market, particularly in retail sales generated
through the Internet. FedEx Home Delivery operating losses are expected to
approximate $50 million in 2001. Actual results for 2001 will depend upon a
number of factors such as consumer demand for and satisfaction with the FedEx
Home Delivery product, competitive responses to the product, the extent of
our ability to penetrate the business-to-consumer electronic commerce market,
and the ability to attract and retain qualified contractors for the delivery
network.

     For 2001, fuel costs are expected to remain at levels approaching those
experienced in the second half of 2000. FedEx currently has jet fuel hedges
in place to fix the price of approximately one-third of the anticipated jet
fuel usage for 2001 at FedEx Express who anticipates retaining its fuel
surcharge until such time as fuel costs have declined for a sustained period.
The actual effect of the cost of fuel and our ability to mitigate price
fluctuations through fuel surcharges and the use of jet fuel hedging
contracts is subject to a number of uncertainties, including variability in
the spot price of jet fuel, actions taken by foreign producers of crude oil,
the actions of competitors and others within the transportation industry
regarding fuel surcharges, and general U.S. and international economic
conditions.

       REVENUES

       In 2000, total package revenue for FedEx Express increased 8%,
principally due to increases in international package volume and yield. List
price increases, including an average 2.8% domestic rate increase in March
1999, the fuel surcharges implemented in the second half of the year, an
ongoing yield management program and a slight increase in average weight per
package, all contributed to the increases in yields in 2000. While growth in
U.S. domestic package volume was lower than anticipated, the higher-yielding
IP services experienced strong growth, particularly in Asia and Europe.

       Total freight revenue increased in 2000 due to higher average daily
pounds and improved yields in U.S. freight, offset by declines in
international freight pounds.

       In 1999, FedEx Express experienced increased volume and slightly
improved yields in its U.S. overnight, U.S. deferred and IP services. Growth
in higher-priced U.S. overnight and IP services and higher average weight per
package were the primary factors in revenue growth. List price increases and
other yield-management actions contributed to the yield improvement in 1999.

       The U.S. deferred package growth rate declined in 1999 in large part
due to specific management actions to restrict growth of these lower-yielding
services. IP package volume and international freight pounds and yield were
negatively affected by weakness in Asian markets, especially in U.S. outbound
traffic destined for that region.

       Other revenue included Canadian domestic revenue, charter services,
logistics services, sales of hushkits and other. Revenue from hushkit sales
has continued to decline over the past three years and is expected to be
negligible hereafter.

       OPERATING INCOME

       Operating income increased 3% in 2000 despite higher fuel costs and
costs associated with the corporate realignment and reorganization of the
sales, marketing and information technology functions. A 48% increase in
average fuel price per gallon had a negative impact of approximately $260
million on 2000 fuel costs, including the results of jet fuel hedging
contracts entered into to mitigate some of the increased jet fuel costs. Fuel
surcharges implemented during 2000 offset the increase in fuel costs in the
fourth quarter. As anticipated, maintenance and repairs increased in 2000 due
to the timing of scheduled maintenance and a greater number of routine cycle
checks resulting from fleet usage and certain Federal Aviation Administration
directives.

       Operating income increased in 1999 compared to 1998 in spite of $81
million in strike contingency costs in 1999 and continued weakness in Asian
markets. Lower fuel prices and cost controls, including adjustments in
network expansion and aircraft deployment plans, contributed to improved
results. A decline in average jet fuel price per gallon of 23% was partially
offset by an increase in gallons consumed of 6%. Although international
freight pounds and revenue per pound continued to decline in 1999, higher
yielding IP volume continued to grow, utilizing capacity otherwise occupied
by freight.

       In 1998, operating income improved as package yield increased at a
higher rate than costs. An increase in average daily packages also
contributed to the improvement in operating income. In 1998, fuel expense
included amounts paid by FedEx Express under jet fuel hedging contracts that
were designed to mitigate some of the increased jet fuel costs. Lower
international freight yield, rising expenses associated

<PAGE>

with international expansion and foreign currency fluctuations along with
expenses of $14 million related to the acquisition of Caliber negatively
affected 1998 results. Operating income for 1998 increased approximately $50
million related to the UPS strike. Proceeds from a 2% temporary fuel
surcharge on U.S. domestic shipments through August 1, 1997 also had a
favorable impact.

       Year-over-year comparisons were also affected by fluctuations in the
contribution from sales of hushkits. Operating profit from these sales
declined $50 million in 2000 and $30 million in 1999.

       OUTLOOK

       We believe U.S. overnight package volumes for FedEx Express will grow
in 2001 at rates higher than those experienced in 2000, with second half
growth rates exceeding those in the first half of 2001. We believe U.S.
deferred package volume growth rates at FedEx Express will be lower in 2001
as we implement the strategy of shifting a portion of these shipments to
FedEx Ground. Improved domestic yields associated with the new sales
initiatives are also expected in 2001. We expect IP package volume growth
rates to remain strong in 2001. Freight pounds are expected to continue to
increase in 2001, with increases in the U.S. partially offset by continued
declines in international freight, as it is replaced by higher-yielding
priority packages.

       FedEx Express also plans to continue cost containment and productivity
enhancement programs in 2001. By lowering discretionary spending and limiting
staffing additions, we expect to align controllable costs with business
growth; however, these actions will not affect plans for strategic spending
in support of long-term growth goals.

       FedEx Express will continue to use the flexibility of its global
network infrastructure by reconfiguring its system and flights to meet market
demands. While long-term profitability is expected to improve, incremental
costs incurred during periods of strategic expansion and varying economic
conditions can affect short-term operating results.

       Actual results may vary depending on the successful implementation of
our reorganization and rebranding initiative, the impact of competitive
pricing changes, customer responses to yield management initiatives, the
timing and extent of network refinement, actions by our competitors,
including capacity fluctuations, jet fuel prices, regulatory conditions for
aviation rights and the rate of domestic and international economic growth.

       In the past three years, the FedEx Express worldwide aircraft fleet
has increased, resulting in a corresponding rise in maintenance expense.
While we expect a predictable pattern of aircraft maintenance and repairs
expense, unanticipated maintenance events will occasionally disrupt this
pattern, resulting in periodic fluctuations in maintenance and repairs
expense.

       FedEx Express's operating income from the sales of hushkits, which
peaked in 1998 and declined in 1999 and 2000, is expected to become
insignificant in 2001.

</TABLE>

       REVENUES

       Revenues for FedEx Ground increased 8% in 2000, while average daily
packages increased 4% and yields increased 4%. The increase in yields is due
to a 2.3% price increase, which was effective in February 1999 and a slight
increase in the mix of higher yielding packages.

       In 1999, FedEx Ground's revenue increased due to improving yields and
steady volume growth. Yields were positively impacted by rate increases of
2.3% and 3.7% in February 1999 and 1998, respectively. During 1999, FedEx
Ground recognized a year-to-date, one-time benefit of approximately $6
million to align its estimation methodology for in-transit revenue with that
of our other operating subsidiaries. Year-to-date package yield was increased
by $.02 because of this one-time adjustment.

       Results for 1998 included incremental volume associated with the UPS
strike. Excluding this incremental volume, average daily packages increased
6% for 1999.

       OPERATING INCOME

       Operating income for 2000 reflects higher operating costs, due
primarily to increases in capacity and technology, as well as the effects of
FedEx Home Delivery and the rebranding and reorganization initiatives.
Depreciation expense increased 20% in 2000 as new terminal facilities were
opened late in 1999 and throughout the first half of 2000. In March 2000,
FedEx Ground launched its new service, FedEx Home Delivery. This new service
is dedicated to meeting the needs of business-to-consumer shippers.
Currently, this service is available for approximately 50% of the U.S.
population. An operating loss of $19 million was incurred by the home
delivery service in 2000.

       Operating income increased in 1999 due to increased volume and
yield-management actions. Results for 1998 contained approximately $6 million
of incremental operating income associated with the UPS strike.

<PAGE>

       OUTLOOK

       FedEx Ground continues to expand capacity in order to accommodate
volume growth, while maintaining or improving yields. FedEx Ground opened two
additional hub facilities in 2000 and will continue to expand
package processing capacity to meet its growth plans. Package volume and
yields are expected to increase in 2001 as the results of the new rebranding
and reorganization effort are realized.

       FedEx Ground plans to accelerate its expansion of the home delivery
service to reach approximately 80% of the U.S. population by September 2001
and full U.S. coverage by September 2002. We expect to incur operating losses
on the FedEx Ground home delivery service of approximately $50 million in
2001, including costs associated with the acceleration of the expansion of
the service.

       Actual results may vary depending on a number of factors, such as
consumer demand for and satisfaction with the FedEx Ground product, the
service coverage and brand awareness of the FedEx Ground product, competitive
responses including pricing and capacity fluctuations, the rate of U.S.
domestic economic growth, the extent of FedEx Ground's ability to penetrate
the business-to-consumer electronic commerce market, and the ability to
attract and retain qualified contractors for the delivery network.

OTHER OPERATIONS

       Other operations include FedEx Global Logistics, Inc. ("FedEx
Logistics"), a contract logistics provider; FedEx Custom Critical, Inc.
("FedEx Custom Critical"), a critical-shipment carrier; FedEx Trade Networks,
Inc. ("FedEx Trade Networks"), a trade services provider; Viking Freight,
Inc. ("Viking"), a regional less-than-truckload freight carrier operating in
the western United States, and certain unallocated corporate items.

       REVENUES

       Revenues from other operations increased 26% in 2000. Excluding the
effects of businesses acquired in 2000, the increase was 15% compared with 1%
in 1999, due to substantially higher revenues at FedEx Custom Critical
combined with double-digit revenue growth at Viking. Revenue growth for 1999
reflects an increase at FedEx Custom Critical, offset by modest decreases at
Viking and FedEx Logistics.

       OPERATING INCOME

       Increased operating income for 2000 is due to strong earnings at
Viking and continued earnings growth at FedEx Custom Critical. Results for
2000 also include a $10 million favorable adjustment related to estimated
future lease costs from the Viking restructuring. Operating income for 1999
reflected improved performances at FedEx Custom Critical, offset by a decline
at FedEx Logistics.

       Operating income in 1998 includes $74 million in expenses, which were
not allocated to operating segments, for merger costs associated with the
acquisition of Caliber. These expenses were primarily investment banking fees
and payments to members of Caliber's management in accordance with
pre-existing management retention agreements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

       LIQUIDITY

       Cash and cash equivalents totaled $68 million at May 31, 2000,
compared to $325 million at May 31, 1999. Cash flows from operating
activities during 2000 totaled $1.6 billion, compared to $1.8 billion for
1999 and $1.6 billion for 1998.

       FedEx's operations have generated increased cash earnings over the
past three years. The following table compares cash earnings (in billions,
except per share amounts) for the years ended May 31:

</TABLE>

       The Company currently has a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility
that is generally used to finance temporary operating cash requirements and
to provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. As of May 31, 2000,
approximately $478 million of the credit facility remains available. For more
information regarding the credit facility, see Note 5 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

       During 2000, FedEx acquired three businesses for approximately $264
million, primarily in cash. These purchases were funded from operations and
borrowings under our commercial paper program.

       On September 27, 1999, the Company's Board of Directors approved a
plan that authorized the purchase of up to 15 million, or approximately 5%,
of FedEx's outstanding shares of common stock. We completed the purchase of
15 million shares at an average cost of $39.75 per share. The purchase of
these shares was funded principally through the issuance of commercial paper.
Shares held in treasury will be used for general corporate purposes.

       FedEx Express redeemed $100 million of 9.625% unsecured sinking fund
debentures on March 1, 2000. The bond redemption was financed with commercial
paper borrowings.

       In 1999, FedEx filed a $1 billion shelf registration statement with
the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), indicating that we may issue
up to that amount in one or more offerings of either unsecured debt
securities, preferred stock or common stock, or a combination of such
instruments. The Company may, at its option, direct FedEx Express to issue
guarantees of the debt securities.

       We believe that cash flow from operations, our commercial paper
program and revolving bank credit facility will adequately meet the Company's
working capital needs for the foreseeable future.

       CAPITAL RESOURCES

       FedEx's operations are capital intensive, characterized by significant
investments in aircraft, vehicles, computer and telecommunications equipment,
package handling facilities and sort equipment. The amount and timing of
capital additions depend on various factors including volume growth, domestic
and

<PAGE>

international economic conditions, new or enhanced services, geographical
expansion of services, competition, availability of satisfactory financing
and actions of regulatory authorities.

</TABLE>

       FedEx finances a significant amount of its aircraft and certain other
equipment needs using long-term operating leases. We believe the
determination to lease versus buy equipment is a financing decision, and both
forms of financing are considered when evaluating the resources committed for
capital. The amount that the Company would have expended to purchase these
assets had it not chosen to obtain their use through operating leases is
considered equivalent capital in the table above. While capital expenditures
over the past two years have been reduced based on lower than expected U.S.
domestic volume growth at FedEx Express, we plan to continue to make
strategic capital investments in support of our long-term growth goals. For
2001, we expect capital spending, including equivalent capital, to
approximate $2.3 billion. For information on the Company's purchase
commitments, see Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

       We have historically financed our capital investments through the use
of lease, debt and equity financing in addition to the use of internally
generated cash from operations. Generally, our practice in recent years with
respect to funding new wide-bodied aircraft acquisitions has been to finance
such aircraft through long-term lease transactions that qualify as
off-balance sheet operating leases under applicable accounting rules. We have
determined that these operating leases have provided economic benefits
favorable to ownership with respect to market values, liquidity and after-tax
cash flows. In the future, other forms of secured financing may be pursued to
finance FedEx Express's aircraft acquisitions when we determine that it best
meets FedEx Express's needs. FedEx Express has been successful in obtaining
investment capital, both domestic and international, for long-term leases on
terms acceptable to it although the marketplace for such capital can become
restricted depending on a variety of economic factors beyond its control. See
Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information concerning the Company's debt facilities.

       In July 1999, approximately $231 million of pass-through certificates
were issued to finance or refinance the debt portion of leveraged operating
leases related to four A300 aircraft, which were delivered in 2000. In June
1998, approximately $833 million of pass-through certificates were issued to
finance or refinance the debt portion of FedEx Express's leveraged operating
leases related to eight A300 and five MD11 aircraft, which were delivered in
2000. The pass-through certificates are not direct obligations of, or
guaranteed by, the Company or FedEx Express, but amounts payable by FedEx
Express under the leveraged operating leases are sufficient to pay the
principal of and interest on the certificates. In June 2000, FedEx Express
filed a shelf registration with the SEC, indicating that it may issue up to
$450 million in pass-

<PAGE>

through certificates in one or more offerings to finance or refinance
leveraged operating aircraft leases.

       We believe that the capital resources available to us provide
flexibility to access the most efficient markets for financing its capital
acquisitions, including aircraft, and are adequate for FedEx's future capital
needs.

       DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

       At May 31, 2000, the Company had a net cumulative deferred tax
liability of $27 million, consisting of $884 million of deferred tax assets
and $911 million of deferred tax liabilities. The reversals of deferred tax
assets in future periods will be offset by similar amounts of deferred tax
liabilities.

       EURO CURRENCY CONVERSION

       Since the beginning of the European Union's transition to the euro on
January 1, 1999, our subsidiaries have been prepared to quote rates to
customers, generate billings and accept payments, in both euro and legacy
currencies. The legacy currencies will remain legal tender through December
31, 2001. FedEx believes that the introduction of the euro, any price
transparency brought about by its introduction and the phasing out of the
legacy currencies will not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Costs associated
with the euro project are being expensed as incurred and are being funded
entirely by internal cash flows.

       YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE

       FedEx's operating subsidiaries rely heavily on sophisticated
information technology for their business operations. Our Year 2000 ("Y2K")
computer compliance issues were, therefore, broad and complex. Nothing has
come to the Company's attention that would cause it to believe that its Y2K
compliance effort was not successful.

       Since 1996, FedEx has incurred approximately $115 million on Y2K
compliance ($22 million in 2000), which was funded by internal cash flows. We
do not expect to incur any material additional Y2K-related costs. We
classified costs as Y2K for reporting purposes if they remedied only Y2K
risks or resulted in the formulation of contingency plans and would otherwise
have been unnecessary in the normal course of business. For 2000, Y2K
expenditures were less than 10% of the Company's total information technology
expense budget. We believe that no significant information technology
projects were deferred due to our Y2K compliance effort.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
          ABOUT MARKET RISK

      FedEx currently has market risk sensitive instruments related to
interest rates; however, there is no significant exposure to changing
interest rates on our long-term debt because the interest rates are fixed. As
disclosed in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, FedEx has
outstanding unsecured long-term debt exclusive of capital leases of $1.1
billion and $1.2 billion at May 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Market risk
for fixed-rate long-term debt is estimated as the potential decrease in fair
value resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and
amounts to approximately $54 million as of May 31, 2000 ($45 million as of
May 31, 1999). The underlying fair values of our long-term debt were
estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for
debt with similar terms and maturities. FedEx does not use derivative
financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.

      FedEx's earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S.
dollar, as compared with foreign currencies, as a result of transactions in
foreign markets. At May 31, 2000, the result of a uniform 10% strengthening
in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the Company's
transactions are denominated would result in a decrease in operating income
of approximately $52 million for the year ending May 31, 2001 (the comparable
amount in the prior year was $25 million). This calculation assumes that each
exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar.
In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, which are a
changed dollar value of the resulting reported operating results, changes in
exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales
price as competitors' services become more or less attractive. FedEx's
sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange
rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency
prices.

       FedEx has entered into jet fuel hedging contracts on behalf of its
subsidiary FedEx Express, which are designed to limit its exposure to
fluctuations in jet fuel prices. Under these contracts, FedEx makes (or
receives) payments based on the difference between a fixed price and the
market price of jet fuel, as determined by an index of spot market prices
representing various geographic regions. The difference is recorded as an
increase or decrease in fuel expense. Market risk for jet fuel is estimated
as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical 10%
increase in jet fuel prices applied to projected 2001 usage and amounts to
approximately $49 million, net of hedging settlements, as of May 31, 2000.
There were no such jet fuel hedging contracts at May 31, 1999. As of May 31,
2000, jet fuel hedging contracts cover approximately one-third of the
estimated usage in 2001. See Notes 2 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for accounting policy and additional information
regarding jet fuel hedging contracts.

      FedEx does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments
for trading purposes.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS



To the Stockholders of FedEx Corporation:

       We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FedEx
Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of May 31, 2000 and
1999, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
stockholders' investment and comprehensive income and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended May 31, 2000. These financial statements
are the responsibility of FedEx's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

       We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

       In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of FedEx Corporation
as of May 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2000, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

NOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION

On January 19, 2000, new branding strategy was announced that resulted in
name changes of the holding company and certain operating companies to
include the FedEx brand name. The name of the holding company was changed
from FDX Corporation to FedEx Corporation ("FedEx") and the following
operating subsidiaries' names were changed:

The names of Federal Express Corporation ("FedEx Express") and Viking Freight,
Inc. ("Viking") did not change.

NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION. The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of FedEx Corporation and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. Expenditures for major additions, improvements,
flight equipment modifications and certain equipment overhaul costs are
capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The
cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment disposed of are
removed from the related accounts, and any gain or loss is reflected in the
results of operations.

For financial reporting purposes, depreciation and amortization of property
and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis over the asset's service
life or related lease term as follows:

Flight equipment                                                  5 to 20 years
Package handling and ground support equipment and vehicles        3 to 30 years
Computer and electronic equipment                                 3 to 10 years
Other                                                             2 to 30 years

Aircraft airframes and engines are assigned residual values ranging from 10%
to 20% of asset cost. All other property and equipment have no material
residual values. Vehicles are depreciated on a straight-line basis over five
to 10 years.

For income tax purposes, depreciation is generally computed using accelerated
methods.

DEFERRED GAINS. Gains on the sale and leaseback of aircraft and other
property and equipment are deferred and amortized over the life of the lease
as a reduction of rent expense. Included in other liabilities at May 31, 2000
and 1999, were deferred gains of $533,371,000 and $429,488,000, respectively.


                                   F-7

<PAGE>

DEFERRED LEASE OBLIGATIONS. While certain of FedEx's aircraft and facility
leases contain fluctuating or escalating payments, the related rent expense
is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Included in other
liabilities at May 31, 2000 and 1999, were $354,566,000 and $321,248,000,
respectively, representing the cumulative difference between rent expense and
rent payments.

SELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS. FedEx is self-insured up to certain levels for
workers' compensation, employee health care and vehicle liabilities. Accruals
are based on the actuarially estimated undiscounted cost of claims. Included
in other liabilities at May 31, 2000 and 1999, were $324,869,000 and
$282,889,000, respectively, representing the long-term portion of
self-insurance accruals for FedEx's workers' compensation and vehicle
liabilities.

CAPITALIZED INTEREST. Interest on funds used to finance the acquisition and
modification of aircraft, construction of certain facilities, and development
of certain software up to the date the asset is placed in service is
capitalized and included in the cost of the asset. Capitalized interest was
$34,823,000, $38,880,000 and $33,009,000 for 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.

ADVERTISING. Advertising costs are generally expensed as incurred and are
included in other operating expenses. Advertising expenses were $221,511,000,
$202,104,000 and $183,253,000 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

CASH EQUIVALENTS. Cash equivalents in excess of current operating
requirements are invested in short-term, interest-bearing instruments with
maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and are stated at
cost, which approximates market value. Interest income was $15,116,000,
$12,399,000 and $11,283,000 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES. FedEx's marketable securities are available-for-sale
securities and are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are
reported, net of related deferred income taxes, as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income within common stockholders' investment.

SPARE PARTS, SUPPLIES AND FUEL. Spare parts are stated principally at
weighted-average cost; supplies and fuel are stated principally at standard
cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Neither
method values inventory in excess of current replacement cost.

GOODWILL. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
net assets of businesses acquired. It is amortized on a straight-line basis
over periods generally ranging from 15 to 40 years. Accumulated amortization
was $165,624,000 and $157,106,000 at May 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. FedEx reviews long-lived assets for
impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not
be recoverable. If an impairment exists, an adjustment is made to write the
asset down to its fair value, and a loss is recorded as the difference
between the carrying value and fair value.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. Translation gains and losses of FedEx's foreign
operations that use local currencies as the functional currency are
accumulated and reported, net of related deferred income taxes, as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income within common
stockholders' investment. Transaction gains and losses that arise from
exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other
than the local functional currency are included in the results of operations.

INCOME TAXES. Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of
temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and
their reported amounts in the financial statements. FedEx uses the liability
method to account for income taxes, which requires deferred taxes to be
recorded

                                    F-8

<PAGE>

at the statutory rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid.

FedEx has not provided for U.S. federal income taxes on its foreign
subsidiaries' earnings deemed to be permanently reinvested. Quantification of
the deferred tax liability, if any, associated with permanently reinvested
earnings is not practicable.

REVENUE RECOGNITION. Revenue is recorded based on the percentage of service
completed at the balance sheet date.

RECENT PRONOUNCEMENTS. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," was
issued in June 1998, was subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, and is now
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000 (2002 for FedEx).
The Statement requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either
assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and to measure those instruments
at fair value. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 133, if any, on
earnings, comprehensive income and financial position will depend on the
amount, timing and nature of any agreements entered into by FedEx. As of May
31, 2000, FedEx has not adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 133.

SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activities," was issued in June 2000, and amends SFAS No. 133. SFAS
No. 138 must be adopted concurrently with FedEx's adoption of SFAS No. 133.
FedEx does not believe the amendment will affect its implementation of SFAS
No. 133.

RECLASSIFICATIONS. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the 2000 presentation.

USE OF ESTIMATES. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

NOTE 3:   BUSINESS COMBINATION AND ACQUISITIONS

On January 27, 1998, FedEx Express became a wholly-owned subsidiary of FedEx
Corporation in connection with the acquisition of Caliber System, Inc.
("Caliber"). The acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests.
FedEx Corporation exchanged 0.8 shares of its common stock for each share of
Caliber common stock. Each share of FedEx Express's common stock was
automatically converted into one share of FedEx Corporation common stock.

On September 10, 1999, FedEx Logistics acquired the assets of GeoLogistics
Air Services, Inc., an airfreight forwarder servicing freight shipments
between the United States and Puerto Rico, for approximately $116,000,000 in
cash. This business operates under the name Caribbean Transportation
Services, Inc. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of
the net assets acquired ($103,000,000) has been recorded as goodwill and is
being amortized ratably over 15 years.

On February 29, 2000, FedEx acquired the common stock of Tower Group
International, a leader in the business of providing international customs
clearance services, for approximately $140,000,000 in cash. This business is
operating as a subsidiary of FedEx Trade Networks, Inc. ("FedEx Trade
Networks"). The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the
net assets acquired ($30,000,000) has been recorded as goodwill and is being
amortized ratably over 25 years.

On March 31, 2000, FedEx acquired the common stock of World Tariff, Limited,
a premier source of customs duty and tax information around the globe, for
approximately $8,400,000 in cash and stock. This business is operating as a
subsidiary of FedEx Trade Networks. The excess of purchase price over the
estimated fair value of the net assets acquired ($8,300,000) has been
recorded as goodwill and is being amortized ratably over 25 years.

The operating results of these acquired companies are included in the
operations of FedEx from the date of acquisition. Pro forma results including
these acquisitions would not differ materially from reported results in any
of the periods presented.

</TABLE>

FedEx has a $1,000,000,000 revolving credit agreement with domestic and foreign
banks. The revolving credit agreement comprises two parts. The first part
provides for a commitment of $800,000,000 through January 27, 2003. The second
part provides for a 364-day commitment for $200,000,000 through October 13,
2000. Interest rates on borrowings under this agreement are generally determined
by maturities selected and prevailing market conditions. The agreement contains
certain covenants and restrictions, none of which are expected to significantly
affect FedEx's operations or its ability to pay dividends. As of May 31, 2000,
approximately $2,093,000,000 was available for the payment of dividends under
the restrictive covenant of the agreement. Commercial paper borrowings are
backed by unused commitments under this revolving credit agreement and reduce
the amount available under the agreement. Borrowings under this credit agreement
and commercial paper borrowings are classified as long-term based on FedEx's
ability and intent to refinance such borrowings. At May 31, 2000, $478,000,000
of the $1,000,000,000 commitment amount was available.

Unsecured sinking fund debentures in the amount of $100,000,000, originally due
through 2020, were redeemed by FedEx Express on March 1, 2000. Other income
(expense) includes a charge of approximately $6,000,000, which represents
premiums paid to the holders of the bonds retired and the write-off of the
related unamortized deferred finance charges and discount.

The components of unsecured debt were as follows:

Of the senior debt outstanding at May 31, 2000 and 1999, $200,000,000 was
issued by Caliber. On April 28, 2000, FedEx assumed all obligations relating
to the notes, including restrictive covenants limiting the

ability of FedEx and its subsidiaries to incur liens on assets and enter into
leasing transactions. These notes mature on August 1, 2006 and bear interest
at 7.80%.

Tax exempt bonds were issued by the Memphis-Shelby County Airport Authority
("MSCAA") and the City of Indianapolis. Lease agreements with the MSCAA and a
loan agreement with the City of Indianapolis covering the facilities and
equipment financed with the bond proceeds obligate FedEx Express to pay
rentals and loan payments, respectively, equal to the principal and interest
due on the bonds.

Scheduled annual principal maturities of long-term debt for the five years
subsequent to May 31, 2000, are as follows: $6,500,000 in 2001; $202,600,000
in 2002; $6,100,000 in 2003; $25,100,000 in 2004; and $5,500,000 in 2005.

FedEx's long-term debt, exclusive of capital leases, had carrying values of
$1,063,000,000 and $1,178,000,000 at May 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively,
compared with fair values of approximately $1,055,000,000 and $1,250,000,000
at those dates. The estimated fair values were determined based on quoted
market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and
maturities.

NOTE 6:   LEASE COMMITMENTS

FedEx utilizes certain aircraft, land, facilities and equipment under capital
and operating leases that expire at various dates through 2027. In addition,
supplemental aircraft are leased under agreements that generally provide for
cancellation upon 30 days' notice.

The components of property and equipment recorded under capital leases were

</TABLE>

At May 31, 2000, the present value of future minimum lease payments for
capital lease obligations, including certain tax exempt bonds, was $200,259,000.

FedEx Express makes payments under certain leveraged operating leases that
are sufficient to pay principal and interest on certain pass-through
certificates. The pass-through certificates are not direct obligations of, or
guaranteed by, FedEx or FedEx Express.

NOTE 7:   PREFERRED STOCK

The Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors, at its
discretion, to issue up to 4,000,000 shares of Series Preferred Stock. The
stock is issuable in series, which may vary as to certain rights and
preferences, and has no par value. As of May 31, 2000, none of these shares
had been issued.

NOTE 8:   COMMON STOCKHOLDERS' INVESTMENT

STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS

At May 31, 2000, FedEx had options and awards outstanding under stock-based
compensation plans described below. As of May 31, 2000, there were 25,210,811
shares of common stock reserved for issuance under these plans. The Board of
Directors has authorized repurchase of FedEx's common stock necessary for
grants under its restricted stock plans. As of May 31, 2000, 13,418,185 of
the 27,688,302 total shares repurchased by FedEx at an average cost of $27.42
(including the 15,000,000 shares repurchased under the current year stock
repurchase program, see Note 9) had been reissued under the above-mentioned
plans.

FedEx applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations to measure
compensation expense for its plans. Compensation cost for the restricted
stock plans was $12,178,000, $8,928,000 and $5,817,000 for 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively. If compensation cost for FedEx's stock-based compensation
plans had been determined under SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," FedEx's net income and earnings per share would have been the
pro forma amounts indicated below:

</TABLE>

The pro forma disclosures, applying SFAS No. 123, are not likely to be
representative of pro forma disclosures for future years. The pro forma
effect is not expected to be fully reflected until 2002, since SFAS No. 123
is applicable to options granted by FedEx after May 31, 1995, and because
options vest over several years and additional grants could be made.

FIXED STOCK OPTION PLANS

Under the provisions of FedEx's stock incentive plans, options may be granted
to certain key employees (and, under the 1997 plan, to directors who are not
employees of FedEx) to purchase shares of common stock of FedEx at a price
not less than its fair market value at the date of grant. Options granted
have a

                                    F-13
<PAGE>

maximum term of 10 years. Vesting requirements are determined at the
discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
Presently, option vesting periods range from one to eight years. At May 31,
2000, there were 9,714,810 shares available for future grants under these
plans.

Beginning with the grants made on or after June 1, 1995, the fair value of
each option grant was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions for each option grant:

RESTRICTED STOCK PLANS

Under the terms of FedEx's Restricted Stock Plans, shares of FedEx's common
stock are awarded to key employees. All restrictions on the shares expire
over periods varying from two to five years from their date of award. Shares
are valued at the market price of FedEx's common stock at the date of award.
Compensation related to these plans is recorded as a reduction of common
stockholders' investment and is being amortized to expense as restrictions on
such shares expire. The following table summarizes information about
restricted stock awards for the years ended May 31:

Income taxes have been provided for foreign operations based upon the various
tax laws and rates of the countries in which FedEx's operations are
conducted. There is no direct relationship between FedEx's overall foreign
income tax provision and foreign pretax book income due to the different
methods of taxation used by countries throughout the world. In 1998, FedEx
entities in foreign locations reported a net foreign pretax loss of
$98,000,000, comprising foreign pretax income of $208,000,000 and foreign
pretax losses of $306,000,000.

A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to FedEx's
effective income tax rate for the years ended May 31 is as follows:

NOTE 11: EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

PENSION PLANS. FedEx sponsors defined benefit pension plans covering a majority
of employees. The largest plans cover certain U.S. employees age 21 and over,
with at least one year of service, and provide benefits based on average
earnings and years of service. Plan funding is actuarially determined, and is

                                     F-17

<PAGE>

also subject to certain tax law limitations. International defined benefit
pension plans provide benefits primarily based on final earnings and years of
service and are funded in accordance with local laws and income tax
regulations. Plan assets consist primarily of marketable equity securities
and fixed income instruments. During 1999, benefits provided under certain of
FedEx's pension plans were enhanced, principally in connection with the
ratification on February 4, 1999, of a collective bargaining agreement
between FedEx Express and the Fedex Pilots Association ("FPA"). These benefit
enhancements are reflected in the funded status of the plans at May 31, 2000
and 1999, but did not materially affect pension cost in either year.

POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE PLANS. FedEx Express offers medical and dental
coverage to eligible U.S. retirees and their eligible dependents. Vision
coverage is provided for retirees, but not their dependents. Substantially
all FedEx Express U.S. employees become eligible for these benefits at age 55
and older, if they have permanent, continuous service with FedEx Express of
at least 10 years after attainment of age 45 if hired prior to January 1,
1988, or at least 20 years after attainment of age 35 if hired on or after
January 1, 1988. Life insurance benefits are provided only to retirees of the
former Tiger International, Inc. who retired prior to acquisition. FedEx
Ground offers similar benefits to its eligible retirees.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value
of plan assets for the pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in
excess of plan assets were $177,900,000, $126,300,000 and $2,700,000,
respectively, as of May 31, 2000, and $201,700,000, $172,800,000 and $2,600,000,
respectively, as of May 31, 1999. The minimum pension liability and
corresponding intangible asset recognized in the balance sheet at May 31, 1999,
relate principally to the collective bargaining agreement between FedEx Express
and the FPA. During 2000, FedEx obtained the necessary approvals to fund a
substantial portion of these benefits in the qualified pension plan, and the
minimum liability and related intangible asset have been reduced accordingly.

FedEx Express's future medical benefit costs were estimated to increase at an
annual rate of 8.5% during 2001, decreasing to an annual growth rate of 6.3% in
2006 and thereafter. Future dental benefit costs were estimated to increase at
an annual rate of 7.5% during 2001, decreasing to an annual growth rate of 6.3%
in 2006 and thereafter. FedEx Express's cost is capped at 150% of the 1993
employer cost and, therefore, will not be subject to medical and dental trends
after the capped cost is attained, projected to be in 2001. A 1% change in these
annual trend rates would not have a significant impact on the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation at May 31, 2000, or 2000 benefit expense.
Claims are paid as incurred.

PROFIT SHARING PLANS. The profit sharing plans cover a majority of U.S.
employees age 21 and over, with at least one year of service with FedEx as of
the contribution date. The plans provide for discretionary employer
contributions, which are determined annually by the Board of Directors. Profit
sharing expense was $125,300,000 in 2000, $137,500,000 in 1999 and $124,700,000
in 1998. Included in these expense amounts are cash distributions made directly
to employees of $39,100,000, $46,800,000 and $43,100,000 in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.

At May 31, 2000, FedEx Express was committed to purchase 28 MD11s, 13 DC10s
(in addition to those discussed in the following paragraph) and 75 Ayres ALM
200s to be delivered through 2007. Deposits and progress payments of
$7,100,000 have been made toward these purchases.

FedEx Express has agreements with two airlines to acquire 53 DC10 aircraft
(49 of which had been received as of May 31, 2000), spare parts, aircraft
engines and other equipment, and maintenance services in exchange for a
combination of aircraft engine noise reduction kits and cash. Delivery of
these aircraft began in 1997 and will continue through 2001. Additionally,
these airlines may exercise put options through December 31, 2003, requiring
FedEx Express to purchase up to 11 additional DC10s along with additional
aircraft engines and equipment.

In April 2000, put options were exercised by an airline requiring FedEx
Express to purchase six DC10s (in addition to those discussed in the
preceding paragraph) for a total purchase price of $26,400,000. Delivery of
the aircraft is expected to be completed by April 2001.

In January 1999, put options were exercised by an airline requiring FedEx
Express to purchase six DC10s (in addition to those discussed above) for a
total purchase price of $21,150,000. Delivery of five of the aircraft was
completed by August 1999, and the commitment to purchase the sixth aircraft
has been cancelled.

FedEx has entered into jet fuel hedging contracts on behalf of its subsidiary
FedEx Express, which are designed to limit its exposure to fluctuations in
jet fuel prices. Under these jet fuel hedging contracts, FedEx makes (or
receives) payments based on the difference between a fixed price and the
market price of jet fuel, as determined by an index of spot market prices
representing various geographic regions. The difference is recorded as an
increase or decrease in fuel expense. Under jet fuel hedging contracts, FedEx
received $18,512,000 in 2000 and made payments of $28,764,000 in 1998. There
was no jet fuel hedging activity in 1999. As of May 31, 2000, contracts in
place to fix the price of jet fuel cover a total notional volume of
352,822,000 gallons or approximately one-third of the estimated usage in
2001. Based on current market prices, the fair value of these jet fuel
hedging contracts, which have no carrying value, was an asset of
approximately $51,060,000 at May 31, 2000. There were no such jet fuel
hedging contracts in place at May 31, 1999.

NOTE 15: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

FedEx and its subsidiaries are subject to legal proceedings and claims that
arise in the ordinary course of their business. In the opinion of management,
the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to these actions will not
materially adversely affect FedEx's financial position or results of
operations.

NOTE 16: OTHER EVENTS

In 2000, FedEx Express recorded nonoperating gains of approximately
$11,000,000 from the sale of securities and approximately $12,000,000 from
the insurance settlement for a leased MD11 destroyed in October 1999.

To avoid service interruptions related to a threatened strike by the FPA in
November 1998, FedEx and FedEx Express implemented strike contingency plans
including entering into agreements for additional third-party air and ground
transportation and establishing special financing arrangements. Subsequently,
a five-year collective bargaining agreement was ratified by the FPA
membership in February 1999 and became effective May 31, 1999. Costs
associated with these contingency plans were approximately $91,000,000. Of
these costs, approximately $81,000,000, primarily the cost of contracts for
supplemental airlift and ground transportation, was included in operating
expenses. The remaining $10,000,000 was included in nonoperating expenses and
represents the costs associated with obtaining additional short-term
financing capabilities.

In 1998, FedEx Express realized a net gain of $17,000,000 from the insurance
settlement and the release from certain related liabilities on a leased MD11
aircraft destroyed in an accident in July 1997. The gain was recorded in
operating and nonoperating income in substantially equal amounts.

FedEx incurred $88,000,000 of merger expenses related to the acquisition of
Caliber and the formation of FedEx in 1998, primarily investment banking fees
and payments to members of Caliber's management in accordance with
pre-existing management retention agreements. There are no remaining accrued
costs at May 31, 2000 related to the merger.

On March 27, 1997, Caliber announced a major restructuring of its Viking
subsidiary. In connection with the restructuring, Viking recorded a pretax
restructuring charge of $85,000,000 ($56,400,000 net of tax) in the period
from January 1, 1997 to May 24, 1997. This restructuring charge is included
in the adjustment to conform Caliber's fiscal year in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Investment and
Comprehensive Income and, therefore, is excluded from the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Components of the $85,000,000 restructuring charge
included asset impairment charges, future lease costs and other contractual
obligations, employee severance and other benefits and other exit costs.
Gains on assets sold in the restructuring of $16,000,000 were recognized in
the third quarter of 1998 and estimates, primarily for future lease costs,
were revised in 2000 resulting in a favorable adjustment of approximately
$10,000,000. There are no remaining accrued restructuring costs at May 31,
2000.

On November 6, 1995, Caliber announced plans to exit the airfreight business
served by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Roadway Global Air, Inc. Income from
discontinuance of $4,875,000, net of tax, in 1998 included the favorable
settlement of leases and other contractual obligations.

To FedEx Corporation:

We have audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the

made for the purpose of forming an opinion on those statements taken as a
whole. The financial statement schedule on page S-2 is the responsibility of
FedEx Corporation's management and is presented for purposes of complying
with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the
basic financial statements. The financial statement schedule has been
