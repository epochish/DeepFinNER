BUSINESS       Overview         FedEx Corporation (FedEx) provides a broad portfolio     of transportation,     e-commerce     and business services through companies that compete     collectively, operate independently and manage collaboratively,     under the respected FedEx brand. These companies are included in     four reportable business segments:                  FedEx Express:  Federal Express     Corporation (FedEx Express) is the worlds     largest express transportation company, offering time-certain     delivery within one to three business days and serving markets     that comprise more than 90% of the worlds gross domestic     product. The FedEx Express segment also includes FedEx Trade     Networks, Inc., which provides international trade services,     specializing in customs brokerage and global cargo distribution.              FedEx Ground:  FedEx Ground Package     System, Inc. (FedEx Ground) is a leading provider of     small-package ground delivery service. FedEx Ground provides     low-cost service to every business address in the United States,     Canada and Puerto Rico, as well as residential delivery to     nearly 100% of U.S. residences through FedEx Home Delivery.     The FedEx Ground segment also includes FedEx SmartPost, Inc.,     which specializes in the consolidation and delivery of high     volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer     packages using the U.S. Postal Service for final delivery     to residences.              FedEx Freight:  FedEx Freight     Corporation is a leading U.S. provider of     less-than-truckload (LTL) freight services through     its FedEx Freight business (regional     next-day and     second-day     and interregional LTL freight services) and its FedEx National     LTL business (long-haul LTL freight services). The FedEx Freight     segment also includes FedEx Custom Critical, Inc., North     Americas largest time-specific, critical shipment carrier,     and Caribbean Transportation Services, Inc., a leading provider     of airfreight forwarding services between the United States and     Puerto Rico.              FedEx Kinkos:  FedEx Kinkos     Office and Print Services, Inc. (FedEx Kinkos)     is a leading provider of document solutions and business     services. FedEx Kinkos global network of     digitally-connected locations offers access to technology for     copying and printing, professional finishing, document creation,     Internet access, computer rentals, videoconferencing, signs and     graphics, direct mail,     Web-based     printing and the full range of FedEx day-definite ground     shipping and time-definite global express shipping services, and     a variety of other retail services and products, including     office supplies.           For financial information concerning our reportable business     segments, refer to the accompanying financial section, which     includes managements discussion and analysis of results of     operations and financial condition and our consolidated     financial statements.         Our Web site is located at fedex.com. Detailed     information about our services and our     e-commerce     tools and solutions can be found on our Web site. In addition,     we make our Annual Reports on     Form 10-K,     Quarterly Reports on     Form 10-Q,     Current Reports on     Form 8-K     and all amendments to such reports available, free of charge,     through our Web site, as soon as reasonably practicable after     they are filed with or furnished to the SEC. These and other SEC     filings are available through the Investor Relations page of our     Web site, the address of which is     http://www.fedex.com/us/investorrelations.     The information on our Web site, however, is not incorporated by     reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report on     Form 10-K.         Except as otherwise specified, any reference to a year indicates     our fiscal year ended May 31 of the year referenced.     Strategy         FedEx was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 1997 to     serve as the parent holding company of FedEx Express and each of     our other operating companies. Through our holding company and     FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. (FedEx Services), we     provide strategic direction to, and coordination of, the FedEx     portfolio        3    Table of Contents       of companies. We intend to continue leveraging and extending the     FedEx brand and providing our customers with convenient,     seamless access to our entire portfolio of integrated business     solutions.         We are pursuing a number of initiatives to continue to enhance     the FedEx customer experience. For instance, we are expanding     our transportation and retail networks (as described below) to     accommodate future volume growth and increase customer     convenience. In addition, we are broadening and more effectively     bundling our portfolio of services in response to the needs and     desires of our customers, such as through our recent     acquisitions in the long-haul LTL freight and international     domestic express transportation markets (as described below) and     our new and improved service offerings  for example,     FedEx Kinkos Print Online (see FedEx Kinkos     Segment below).         We believe that sales and marketing activities, as well as the     information systems that support the extensive automation of our     package delivery services, are functions that are best     coordinated across operating companies. Through the use of     advanced information systems that connect the FedEx companies,     we make it convenient for customers to use the full range of     FedEx services. We believe that seamless information integration     is critical to obtain business synergies from multiple operating     units. For example, our Web site, fedex.com, provides a     single point of contact for our customers to access FedEx     Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight shipment tracking,     customer service and invoicing information and FedEx     Kinkos office and print services. Similarly, by making one     call to the new FedEx Expedited Freight Services, our customers     can quickly and easily evaluate surface and air freight shipping     options available from FedEx Express, FedEx Freight and FedEx     Custom Critical in order to select the best service meeting     their needs. Through this one point of contact, customers can     select from a broad range of freight services, based on their     pickup and delivery requirements, time sensitivity and the     characteristics of the products being shipped.         We manage our business as a portfolio  in the     long-term best interest of FedEx as a whole, not a particular     operating company. As a result, we base decisions on capital     investment, expansion of delivery, information technology and     retail networks, and service additions or enhancements on     achieving the highest overall long-term return on capital for     our business as a whole. For each FedEx company, we focus on     making appropriate investments in the technology and assets     necessary to optimize our earnings performance and cash flow. As     an example of our commitment to managing collaboratively, most     of our management incentive compensation programs are tied to     the performance of FedEx as a whole.         While we have increased our emphasis on competing collectively     and managing collaboratively, we continue to believe that     operating independent networks, each focused on its own     respective markets, results in optimal service quality,     reliability and profitability from each business unit. Each     FedEx company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which     it has the most expertise. Each companys operations, cost     structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer     needs of a particular market segment.         Our compete collectively, operate independently, manage     collaboratively strategy also provides flexibility in     sizing our various operating companies to align with varying     macro-economic conditions and customer demand for the market     segments in which they operate. For example:                     To accommodate international growth at FedEx Express, we are     adding flights, purchasing aircraft, increasing capacity and     improving services to and from Europe and Asia based on the     growth prospects of these regions.                 We are expanding network capacity at our growing FedEx Ground     and FedEx Freight companies. For instance, we expect to increase     FedEx Grounds daily package     pick-up     capacity to approximately five million packages by 2012.                 We are expanding the FedEx Kinkos retail network, which     will further increase customer access to FedEx shipping services     and offer growth opportunities in     e-commerce     and other business services.           We believe the following four trends continue to drive world     commerce and shape the global marketplace:                 Globalization:  As the worlds economy     becomes more fully integrated, and as barriers to trade continue     to decrease, companies are sourcing and selling globally. With     customers in more than 220 countries and          4    Table of Contents              territories, we facilitate this supply chain through our global     reach, delivery services and information capabilities.                    Supply Chain Acceleration:  As the economy has     become increasingly global, it has also become more fast-paced,     and companies of all sizes now depend on the delivery of     just-in-time     inventory to help them compete. We have taken advantage of the     move toward faster, more efficient supply chains by helping     customers obtain near real-time information to manage inventory     in motion, thereby reducing overhead and obsolescence and     speeding time-to-market.              Increase in High-Tech and High-Value-Added     Businesses:  High-tech and high-value-added goods     continue to increase as a percentage of total economic output.     Our various operating companies offer a unique menu of services     to fit virtually all shipping needs of high-tech and     high-value-added industries.              Growth of     E-Commerce:  E-commerce     acts as a catalyst for the other three trends and is a vital     growth engine for businesses today. Through our global     transportation and technology networks, we contribute to and     benefit from the growth of     e-commerce.           These trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of     customer access  to goods, services and information.     This access is fueling a remarkable transformation of the     worlds economy, helping businesses and nations flourish,     and empowering individuals with greater choices and     opportunities. Through our global transportation, information     technology and retail networks, we help to make this access     possible. We continue to position our companies to facilitate     and capitalize on this access and move toward even stronger     long-term growth, productivity and profitability by:                     Optimizing and expanding our worldwide FedEx Express network,     particularly in key markets such as China and India.                 Increasing the capacity, speed and reliability of our FedEx     Ground and FedEx Freight networks and expanding the FedEx     Kinkos retail network.                 Emphasizing the compete collectively part of our     core strategy through service improvements and focusing our     employees and contractors on delivering the best customer     experience in the industry, resulting in better alignment across     the entire FedEx network.           During 2007, we made several strategic acquisitions, each of     which is expected to provide important contributions to our     long-term growth, productivity and profitability.                     In September 2006, we acquired the U.S. and Canadian LTL     freight operations of Watkins Motor Lines, a leading provider of     long-haul LTL freight services, and certain affiliates for     $787 million in cash.                ¡        Watkins U.S. long-haul LTL freight business, which     has been renamed FedEx National LTL, operates within the FedEx     Freight segment. The addition of Watkins     three-day or     more long-haul service to FedEx Freights industry-leading     next-day and     second-day     regional LTL freight service meaningfully extends our leadership     position in the heavyweight freight market.         ¡        Watkins Canadian business, formerly known as Watkins     Canada Express, has been renamed FedEx Freight Canada and will     extend our reach and create opportunities for growth in the     Canadian LTL market.                       In December 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding capital     stock of ANC Holdings Ltd. (ANC), a United Kingdom     domestic express transportation company, for $241 million,     predominantly in cash. The acquisition of ANC, included in the     FedEx Express segment, allows us to better serve the United     Kingdom domestic market, which we previously served primarily     through independent agents.                 In January 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding capital     stock of Prakash Air Freight Pvt. Ltd. (PAFEX), our     primary service provider in India, for $32 million in cash.     The acquisition of PAFEX, included in the FedEx Express segment,     extends our operations in the global express industry with a     wholly owned company in one of the worlds fastest growing     markets.                 In March 2007, we acquired Tianjin Datian W. Group Co.,     Ltd.s (DTW Group) fifty percent share of the     FedEx-DTW International Priority express joint venture and     assets relating to DTW Groups domestic          5    Table of Contents              express network in China for $427 million in cash. The     acquisition converted our joint venture with DTW Group, formed     in 1999, into a wholly owned subsidiary of FedEx Express and     increases our presence in China in the international and     domestic express businesses.           In sum, our overall long-term goal is to continue to:                     deliver superior financial returns for our stockholders;                 expand our portfolio of services to meet our customers     needs; and                 execute our compete collectively, operate independently,     manage collaboratively strategy with both discipline and     imagination.       Reputation     and Responsibility         By competing collectively under the FedEx brand, our operating     companies benefit from one of the worlds most recognized     brands. FedEx is one of the most trusted and respected brands in     the world, and the FedEx brand name is a powerful sales and     marketing tool. Among the many reputation awards we received     during 2007:                     FedEx ranked sixth in FORTUNE magazines     Americas Most Admired Companies list and     seventh in its Worlds Most Admired Companies     list  the sixth consecutive year we have been ranked     in the top ten on both lists.                 For the fourth consecutive year, FedEx ranked in the top 15 in     corporate reputation in The Wall Street     Journals Harris Interactive/Reputation Institute RQ     Survey.                 FedEx continued to rank highest in customer satisfaction in the     University of Michigan Business School National Quality Research     Centers American Customer Satisfaction Index in the     express delivery category.                 FedEx ranked in the top 25 of InformationWeek     magazines InformationWeek 500 list of the     most innovative users of information technology.           FedEx is well recognized as a leader, not only in the     transportation industry and technological innovation, but also     in social and environmental responsibility and corporate     governance. Along with a strong reputation among customers and     the general public, FedEx is widely acknowledged as a great     place to work. It is our people  our greatest     asset  that give us our strong reputation. In     addition to superior physical and information networks, FedEx     has an exemplary human network, with more than     280,000 employees and contractors who are absolutely,     positively focused on safety, the highest ethical and     professional standards, and the needs of their customers and     communities. Through our internal Purple Promise and     Humanitarian Award programs, we recognize and reward employees     who enhance customer service and promote human welfare.     Community         We are committed to causes that help improve the communities     where we live and work, all around the world. As an example, we     routinely donate our transportation capabilities and services to     deliver aid to disaster sites and to support charitable causes.     We support and promote diversity and ethnic outreach by, among     other things, making contributions to various non-profit     organizations that serve the     African-American     and Hispanic communities, such as the Hispanic Scholarship Fund,     the National Council of La Raza, the National Association     for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), INROADS, the     Trumpet Awards and the Little Rock Nine Foundation. In addition     to corporate philanthropy and employee volunteerism, we develop     strategic relationships with certain charitable organizations     that share our values, including:                 United Way of America:  We believe the United     Way is one of the most effective and efficient ways of meeting     community needs. FedEx supports a yearly fundraising campaign     company-wide, and during our annual FedEx Cares     week, FedEx employee volunteers donate thousands of hours to     support United Way community efforts.          6    Table of Contents                  American Red Cross:  FedEx works with the Red     Cross to provide a quick response to disasters around the world.     FedEx uses its logistics and transportation expertise to provide     complimentary shipping of emergency supplies and assists with     financial support.              Safe Kids Worldwide:  Reflecting the fact that     safety is one of our top priorities, FedEx is the sole corporate     sponsor of Safe Kids Walk This Way, a global program     that advocates child pedestrian safety and teaches children,     parents and communities how to prevent pedestrian accidents.              ORBIS International:  FedEx helps ORBIS     International provide eye care and treatment to people in     developing countries. FedEx provides free aircraft maintenance     and our pilots volunteer their time for ORBISs     Flying Eye Hospital  a converted DC-10     aircraft equipped with surgical and training facilities.              Salvation Army:  FedEx recently donated five     mobile canteen vehicles to the Salvation Army disaster response     units. FedEx also supports the Salvation Armys training of     emergency response personnel worldwide through an initiative     called Prepare to Respond to Emergencies  Planning     and Readiness Education (PREPARE).              National Civil Rights Museum:  FedEx serves as     a major corporate sponsor of the National Civil Rights Museum,     which educates the public on the lessons of the civil rights     movement in the United States and its impact and influence on     the human rights movement worldwide.              March of Dimes:  FedEx is a national sponsor of     March of Dimes WalkAmerica, and thousands of FedEx     employees participate in it and other events that raise funds to     help improve the health of babies by preventing birth defects     and infant mortality.              Heart to Heart International:  FedEx helps     Heart to Heart International deliver food, medicine and     emergency supplies to areas in need throughout the world.       Environment         We are committed to protecting the environment. FedEx evaluates     the environmental impacts of FedEx packaging and minimizes waste     generation through efforts that include recycling and pollution     prevention. FedEx Kinkos history also includes a     longstanding dedication to protecting the environment, such as     through the use of copy paper with a high recycled content.         FedEx is actively involved in efforts to promote cleaner air by     reducing emissions through efficient route planning and the use     of clean, alternative and renewable energy sources. For example,     the FedEx Express OptiFleet E700 hybrid electric vehicle     decreases particulate emissions by over 90 percent and     greenhouse gas emissions by over 25 percent and increases     fuel economy by over 40 percent. FedEx Express operates     93 hybrid vehicles in North America, with more than     1 million miles in revenue service. In August 2005, we     opened Californias then largest corporate solar electric     rooftop system atop the FedEx Express regional hub in Oakland.     To date, this solar electric system has provided approximately     2 billion watt hours of renewable energy generated by     sunlight. We are also modernizing our aircraft fleet. For     example, we are retiring and replacing older Boeing 727s with     more fuel-efficient and quieter Boeing 757s. The use of newer     and more fuel efficient aircraft will have the effect of     reducing greenhouse gas emissions and airport noise and     increasing our jet fuel efficiency.     Governance         FedEx has an independent Board of Directors committed to the     highest quality corporate governance. Reflecting this     commitment, we have embraced the spirit of corporate governance     reform rather than merely meeting the minimum compliance     standards set forth in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the     New York Stock Exchanges corporate governance listing     standards. We have implemented many governance enhancements that     go well beyond those legal requirements. For example, in March     2007, our Board of Directors adopted a majority-voting standard     in uncontested director elections and a resignation requirement     for directors who fail to receive the required majority vote.     The Board is prohibited from changing back to a plurality-voting     standard without the approval of our stockholders.        7    Table of Contents       In addition, we have made compliance with the reporting     requirements of Section 404 of the     Sarbanes-Oxley     Act of 2002 one of our highest priorities, and we have leveraged     this expensive and     time-consuming     effort to further improve our already rigorous disclosure     controls and procedures and effective internal control over     financial reporting. Our goal has been not only to comply with     the law, but also to build upon a process that will further     enhance a strong controls mindset across FedEx today and in the     future.         Our Board of Directors reviews all aspects of our governance     policies and practices, including our Corporate Governance     Guidelines and our Code of Business Conduct & Ethics,     at least annually in light of best practices and makes whatever     changes are necessary to further our longstanding commitment to     the highest standards of corporate governance. The Guidelines     and the Code, which applies to all of our directors, officers     and employees, including our principal executive officer and     senior financial officers, are available in the corporate     governance section of the Investor Relations page of our Web     site at     http://www.fedex.com/us/investorrelations.     We will post in the corporate governance section of the Investor     Relations page of our Web site information regarding any     amendment to, or waiver from, the provisions of the Code to the     extent such disclosure is required. The information on our Web     site, however, does not form part of this Report.     Business     Segments         The following describes in more detail the operations of each of     our business segments, as well as FedEx Services:     FedEx     Express Segment     FedEx     Express     Overview         FedEx Express invented express distribution in 1973 and remains     the industry leader, providing rapid, reliable, time-definite     delivery of packages and freight to more than 220 countries and     territories. FedEx Express offers time-certain delivery within     one to three business days, serving markets that generate more     than 90% of the worlds gross domestic product through     door-to-door, customs-cleared service, with a money-back     guarantee. FedEx Expresss unmatched air route authorities     and extensive transportation infrastructure, combined with     leading-edge information technologies, make it the worlds     largest express transportation company. FedEx Express employs     more than 143,000 employees and has approximately 53,500     drop-off locations (including at FedEx Kinkos centers),     669 aircraft and 53,000 vehicles and trailers in its integrated     global network.     Services         FedEx Express offers a wide range of shipping services for     delivery of packages and freight. Overnight package services are     backed by money-back guarantees and extend to virtually the     entire United States population. FedEx Express offers three     U.S. overnight delivery services: FedEx First Overnight,     FedEx Priority Overnight and FedEx Standard Overnight. FedEx     SameDay service is available for urgent shipments up to 70     pounds to virtually any U.S. destination. FedEx Express     also offers express freight services backed by     money-back     guarantees to handle the needs of the time-definite global     freight market.         International express delivery with a money-back guarantee is     available to more than 220 countries and territories, with a     variety of time-definite services to meet distinct customer     needs. FedEx Express also offers a comprehensive international     freight service, backed by a money-back guarantee, real-time     tracking and advanced customs clearance. During 2007, FedEx     Express significantly increased the reach of its FedEx     International Priority Freight service to cover more than 130     countries.         For information regarding FedEx Express     e-shipping     tools and solutions, see FedEx Services      Technology.     International     Expansion         FedEx Express is focused on further expanding its international     presence, especially in key markets such as China and India.     China and India are the two fastest growing major economies in     the world, consistently        8    Table of Contents       recording gross domestic product growth rates of over 7% a year.     China is already the third largest trading country in the world,     behind the United States and Germany, with total foreign trade     exceeding $1.7 trillion in calendar 2006.         We began serving China in 1984, and since that time, we have     expanded our service to cover more than 200 cities and     counties across the country  with plans to add 100     additional cities and counties over the next few years. We now     employ approximately 6,000 workers in China. We have recently     taken several important actions that increase our presence in     China and India and bolster our leadership in the global air     cargo industry. For example, during 2007, we completed the DTW     Group and PAFEX acquisitions (see Strategy) and     initiated a next-business-day, time-definite domestic express     delivery service in China, which is available to more than     30 cities and counties throughout the country. The new     China domestic express service is supported by a money-back     guarantee and real-time package status tracking. Our China     domestic express network relies on a     hub-and-spoke     system centered at the Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport,     located in East Chinas Zhejiang Province. Other recent     actions in China and India include:                     In 2005, we launched the express air cargo industrys first     direct flight from mainland China to Europe (a daily direct     flight from Shanghai to Frankfurt, Germany) as part of a new     westbound around-the-world route that originates and terminates     in Memphis and provides connections via the FedEx AsiaOne     network to and from northern and eastern China.                 In 2006, we launched the first overnight express link between     India and China as part of our new eastbound around-the-world     route, which connects Europe, India, China and Japan with the     FedEx Express U.S. hub in Memphis.                 In 2006, we expanded our service in India. We increased our     flight frequencies in and out of India and improved connectivity     between key export centers and regional hubs, resulting in     improved service, especially for customers in Delhi and northern     India.                 In 2006, we broke ground on a new Asia-Pacific hub at the     Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in Southern China. The     new Asia-Pacific hub is expected to assume and expand the     current activities of our existing hub in Subic Bay,     Philippines, beginning in 2009. We believe the new hub will     better serve our global customers doing business in and with the     fast-growing China and Asia-Pacific markets.                 In 2007, we began using four new flight frequencies into China.     We now have authority to operate a total of 30 weekly     flights into China, the most of any     U.S.-based     cargo carrier.           In support of our international expansion, we have agreed to     purchase 15 Boeing 777 Freighter (B777F) aircraft, a     new high-capacity, long-range airplane, with deliveries     beginning in calendar 2009. We also hold an option to purchase     an additional 15 B777F aircraft. To facilitate the use of our     growing international network, we offer strong international     trade consulting services and a variety of online tools that     enable customers to more easily determine and comply with     international shipping requirements.     U.S.     Postal Service Agreement         Under a July 2006 agreement with the U.S. Postal Service     that runs through September 2013, FedEx Express provides     domestic air transportation services to the U.S. Postal     Service, including for its     First-Class,     Priority and Express Mail. FedEx Express also has approximately     5,000 drop boxes at U.S. Post Offices in approximately 340     metropolitan areas and provides transportation and delivery for     the U.S. Postal Services international delivery     service called Global Express Guaranteed (GXG).     Pricing         FedEx Express periodically publishes list prices in its Service     Guides for the majority of its services. In general, during     2007, U.S. shipping rates were based on the service     selected, destination zone, weight, size, any ancillary service     charge and whether the shipment was picked up by a FedEx Express     courier or dropped off by the customer at a FedEx Express, FedEx     Kinkos or FedEx Authorized ShipCenter location.     International rates are based on the type of service provided     and vary with size, weight, destination and,        9    Table of Contents       whenever applicable, whether the shipment was picked up by a     FedEx Express courier or dropped off by the customer at a FedEx     Express, FedEx Kinkos or FedEx Authorized ShipCenter     location. FedEx Express offers its customers discounts generally     based on actual or potential average daily revenue produced.         FedEx Express has an indexed fuel surcharge for     U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound shipments and for     shipments originating internationally, where legally and     contractually possible. The surcharge percentage is subject to     monthly adjustment based on the spot price for jet fuel. For     example, the fuel surcharge for June 2007 was based on the     spot price for jet fuel published for April 2007. Changes to the     FedEx Express fuel surcharge, when calculated according to the     spot price for jet fuel and FedEx Express trigger points, are     applied effective from the first Monday of the month. These     trigger points may change from time to time, but information on     the fuel surcharge for each month is available at fedex.com     approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable.     Operations         FedEx Expresss primary sorting facility, located in     Memphis, serves as the center of the companys multiple     hub-and-spoke     system. A second national hub facility, which we are     significantly expanding, is located in Indianapolis. In addition     to these national hubs, FedEx Express operates regional hubs in     Newark, Oakland, and Fort Worth and major metropolitan     sorting facilities in Los Angeles and Chicago. FedEx Express is     building a new regional hub in Greensboro, North Carolina, which     is scheduled to begin operations in calendar 2009.         Facilities in Anchorage, Paris and Subic Bay, Philippines, serve     as sorting facilities for express package and freight traffic     moving to and from Asia, Europe and North America. Additional     major sorting and freight handling facilities are located at     Narita Airport in Tokyo, Stansted Airport outside London and     Pearson Airport in Toronto. The facilities in Subic Bay and     Paris are also designed to serve as regional hubs for their     respective market areas. A facility in Miami  the     Miami Gateway Hub  serves our South Florida, Latin     American and Caribbean markets. In 2006, we broke ground on a     new Asia-Pacific hub at the Guangzhou Baiyun International     Airport in Southern China. The new Asia-Pacific hub is expected     to assume and expand the current activities of our existing hub     in Subic Bay, Philippines, beginning in 2009.         Throughout its worldwide network, FedEx Express operates city     stations and employs a staff of customer service agents, cargo     handlers and couriers who pick up and deliver shipments in the     stations service area. For more information about our     sorting and handling facilities, see Part I, Item 2 of     this Annual Report on     Form 10-K     under the caption FedEx Express Segment. In some     international areas, independent agents (Global Service     Participants) have been selected to complete deliveries and to     pick up packages.         FedEx Kinkos offers retail access to FedEx Express     shipping services at all of its U.S. locations and is     adding FedEx Express shipping services at its international     locations. FedEx Express also has alliances with certain other     retailers to provide in-store drop-off sites. Our unmanned FedEx     Drop Boxes provide customers the opportunity to drop off     packages in office buildings, shopping centers, corporate or     industrial parks and outside U.S. Post Offices.     Fuel     Supplies and Costs         During 2007, FedEx Express purchased jet fuel from various     suppliers under contracts that vary in length and which provide     for specific amounts of fuel to be delivered. The fuel     represented by these contracts is purchased at market prices     that may fluctuate daily. Because of our indexed fuel surcharge,     we do not have any jet fuel hedging contracts. See FedEx     Express  Pricing.        10    Table of Contents       The following table sets forth FedEx Expresss costs for     jet fuel and its percentage of total revenues for the last five     fiscal years:                                                         Percentage                  Total Cost            of Total           Fiscal Year        (in millions)           Revenues               2007                 $       2,639                   7.5       %      2006                     2,497                   7.7          2005                     1,780                   6.1          2004                     1,160                   4.7          2003                     1,058                   4.7                 Approximately 10% of FedEx Expresss requirement for     vehicle fuel is purchased in bulk. The remainder of FedEx     Expresss requirement is satisfied by retail purchases with     various discounts.     Competition         The express package and freight markets are both highly     competitive and sensitive to price and service. The ability to     compete effectively depends upon price, frequency and capacity     of scheduled service, ability to track packages, extent of     geographic coverage, reliability and innovative service     offerings. Competitors in these markets include other package     delivery concerns, principally United Parcel Service, Inc.     (UPS), DHL, passenger airlines offering express     package services, regional express delivery concerns, airfreight     forwarders and the U.S. Postal Service.         FedEx Expresss principal competitors in the international     market are DHL, UPS, foreign postal authorities such as Deutsche     Post and TNT N.V., freight forwarders, passenger airlines and     all-cargo airlines. Many of FedEx Expresss competitors in     the international market are government-owned, -controlled or     -subsidized     carriers, which may have greater resources, lower costs, less     profit sensitivity and more favorable operating conditions than     FedEx Express.     Employees         David J. Bronczek is the President and Chief Executive Officer     of FedEx Express, which is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee.     As of May 31, 2007, FedEx Express employed approximately     93,000 permanent     full-time     and 50,000 permanent part-time employees, of which approximately     16% are employed in the Memphis area. FedEx Expresss     international employees in the aggregate represent approximately     25% of all employees. FedEx Express believes its relationship     with its employees is excellent.         The pilots of FedEx Express are represented by the Air Line     Pilots Association, International (ALPA), and are     employed under a four-year collective bargaining agreement that     took effect on October 30, 2006. Attempts by other labor     organizations to organize certain other groups of employees     occur from time to time. Although these organizing attempts have     not resulted in any certification of a U.S. domestic     collective bargaining representative (other than ALPA), we     cannot predict the outcome of these labor activities or their     effect, if any, on FedEx Express or its employees.     FedEx     Trade Networks         FedEx Trade Networks is a leading provider of international     trade services, specializing in customs brokerage and global     cargo distribution. Its value-added services include Global     Trade Data, an information tool that allows customers to track     and manage imports. FedEx Trade Networks provides international     trade advisory services, including assistance with the     Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program,     and through its WorldTariff subsidiary, FedEx Trade Networks     publishes customs duty and tax information for over 100 customs     areas worldwide. FedEx Trade Networks has approximately     3,500 employees and 100 offices in 70 service locations     throughout North America. Offices are also maintained in major     Asian and European markets through dedicated agents.        11    Table of Contents   FedEx     Ground Segment     FedEx     Ground     Overview         By leveraging the FedEx brand, maintaining a low cost structure     and efficiently using information technology and advanced     automation systems, FedEx Ground continues to enhance its     competitive position as a leading provider of business and     residential money-back-guaranteed ground package delivery     services. FedEx Ground serves customers in the North American     small-package market, focusing primarily on business and     residential delivery of packages weighing up to 150 pounds.     Ground service is provided to 100% of the United States     population and overnight service up to 400 miles to nearly     100% of the United States population. Service is also provided     to nearly 100% of the Canadian population. In addition, FedEx     Ground offers service to Puerto Rico, Alaska and Hawaii through     a ground and air network operation coordinated with other     transportation providers.         FedEx Ground continues to improve the speed, reach and service     capabilities of its network, by reducing transit time for many     of its lanes and introducing or expanding overnight ground     service in many metropolitan areas. In addition, to meet growing     customer demand for its services, FedEx Ground is in the midst     of a major network capacity expansion program, which is expected     to increase its daily     pick-up     capacity to approximately five million packages by 2012. The     multi-phase plan includes the addition of nine new hubs, the     expansion of existing hubs and the expansion or relocation of     other existing facilities. Each of the new hubs will feature the     latest automated sorting technology.         In addition to the continuing success of FedEx Grounds     business-to-business service, the increasing popularity of FedEx     Home Delivery, which reaches nearly 100% of     U.S. residences, has driven growth in the companys     package volumes and financial results. FedEx Home Delivery is     dedicated exclusively to meeting the delivery needs of     residential customers and provides routine Saturday and evening     delivery and premium options such as day-specific, appointment     and signature delivery. FedEx Home Delivery brings unmatched     services to residential shippers and their customers and also     offers a money-back guarantee.         FedEx SmartPost (a subsidiary of FedEx Ground) is a leading     national small-parcel consolidator, which specializes in the     consolidation and delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less     time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages, using the     U.S. Postal Service for final delivery to residences. The     company picks up shipments from customers (including     e-tailers     and catalog companies), provides sorting and linehaul services     and then delivers the packages to a U.S. Postal Service     facility for final delivery by a postal carrier. Through its     network of 20 distribution hubs and approximately     1,680 employees, FedEx SmartPost provides delivery Monday     through Saturday to all residential addresses in the U.S.,     including P.O. Boxes and military destinations.     Pricing         FedEx Ground periodically publishes list prices for the majority     of its services in its Service Guide. In general, during 2007,     U.S. shipping rates were based on the service selected,     destination zone, weight, size, any ancillary service charge and     whether the shipment was picked up by a FedEx Ground contractor     or dropped off by the customer at a FedEx Kinkos or FedEx     Authorized ShipCenter.         FedEx Ground has an indexed fuel surcharge, which applies to all     shipments. The surcharge percentage is subject to monthly     adjustment based on a rounded average of the national     U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel     as published monthly by the U.S. Department of Energy. For     example, the fuel surcharge for June 2007 was based on the     average diesel fuel price published for April 2007. Changes to     the FedEx Ground fuel surcharge, when calculated according to     the rounded index average and FedEx Ground trigger points, are     applied effective from the first Monday of the month. These     trigger points may change from time to time, but information on     the fuel surcharge for each month is available at fedex.com     approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable.        12    Table of Contents   Operations         FedEx Ground operates a multiple     hub-and-spoke     sorting and distribution system consisting of approximately 500     facilities, including 29 hubs, in the U.S. and Canada.     FedEx Ground conducts its operations primarily with     approximately 20,600 owner-operated vehicles and     25,800 company-owned trailers. To provide FedEx Home     Delivery service, FedEx Ground leverages its existing pickup     operation and hub and linehaul network. FedEx Home     Deliverys operations are often co-located with existing     FedEx Ground facilities to achieve further cost efficiencies.         Advanced automated sorting technology is used to streamline the     handling of over 3.1 million packages daily. Using overhead     laser and six-sided charge-coupled device (CCD) scan     technologies, hub conveyors electronically guide packages to     their appropriate destination chute, where they are loaded for     transport to their respective destination terminals for local     delivery. Software systems and Internet-based applications are     also deployed to offer customers new ways to connect internal     package data with external delivery information. FedEx Ground     provides shipment tracing and proof-of-delivery signature     functionality through the FedEx Web site, fedex.com.

Although FedEx Ground believes its relationship with its     employees and independent contractors is excellent, the company     is involved in numerous purported     class-action     lawsuits and other proceedings that claim that the     companys owner-operators should be treated as employees,     rather than independent contractors. For a description of these     proceedings, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on     Form 10-K     (Risk Factors) and Note 17 of the accompanying     consolidated financial statements.         David F. Rebholz is the President and Chief Executive Officer of     FedEx Ground. FedEx Ground is headquartered in Pittsburgh,     Pennsylvania, and its primary competitors are UPS, DHL and the     U.S. Postal Service.     FedEx     Freight Segment     FedEx     Freight Corporation         FedEx Freight Corporation provides a full range of LTL freight     services through its FedEx Freight business (regional     next-day and     second-day     and interregional LTL freight services), its FedEx National LTL     business (long-haul LTL freight services) and its FedEx Freight     Canada business, and is known for its exceptional service,     reliability and on-time performance. Through a comprehensive     network of service centers and advanced information systems,     FedEx Freight provides service to virtually all U.S. ZIP     Codes (including Alaska and Hawaii) with industry-leading     transit times. FedEx Freights regional and interregional     LTL freight services are supported by a no-fee money-back     guarantee on eligible shipments. Internationally, FedEx Freight     serves Mexico, Puerto Rico, Central and South America, the     Caribbean, Europe and Asia via alliances and purchased     transportation. FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL have an     indexed fuel surcharge, which is subject to weekly adjustment     based on a rounded average of the national U.S. on-highway     average price for a gallon of diesel fuel.         We are focused on expanding the FedEx Freight     network  opening new service centers and increasing     capacity at a number of key locations  to better meet     customer demand. For example, in 2007, FedEx Freight opened     seven new service centers and expanded eight others. In 2007,     FedEx Freight Corporation also added a long-haul LTL freight     business and Canadian operations by acquiring the U.S. and     Canadian LTL freight operations of Watkins Motor Lines and     certain affiliates, now known as FedEx National LTL and FedEx     Freight Canada. See Strategy.         FedEx Freight specializes in fast-cycle distribution and     provides tailored shipping solutions to help shippers meet tight     deadlines. Through its many service offerings, FedEx Freight can     match customers     time-critical        13    Table of Contents       needs with reduced transit times,     after-hours     pickup or delivery, or     same-day     delivery. FedEx Freights fully integrated Web site and     other     e-tools,     including a bill of lading generator and     e-mail     delivery notification, make freight shipping easier and bring     customers closer to their own account information.

FedEx Freight Corporation has leveraged its relationships with     other FedEx operating companies to meet the increasingly global     needs of customers. For example, the FedEx Freight Corporation     sales force sells FedEx Express freight services, and FedEx     Services sales representatives share LTL leads with their     counterparts at FedEx Freight Corporation. The sales effort is     one phase of a broad initiative aimed at leveraging FedExs     competitive advantage in U.S. domestic freight services.

Smiths vision that the information     about a package is as important as the delivery of the package     itself remains at the core of our comprehensive technology     strategy.         Our technology strategy is driven by our desire for customer     satisfaction. We strive to build technology solutions that will     solve our customers business problems with simplicity,     convenience, speed and reliability. The focal point of our     strategy is our award-winning Web site, together with our     customer integrated solutions.         The fedex.com Web site was launched over ten years ago,     and during that time, customers have shipped and tracked     billions of packages at fedex.com. The fedex.com     Web site is widely recognized for its speed, ease of use and     customer-focused features. At fedex.com, our customers     ship packages, determine international documentation     requirements, track package status, pay invoices and access     FedEx Kinkos office and printing services. Our FedEx     Insight application provides customers with visibility and     package status of their inbound and outbound express, ground and     freight shipments.

Marketing         The FedEx brand name is a symbol for high-quality service,     reliability and speed. FedEx is one of the most widely     recognized brands in the world. Special emphasis is placed on     promoting and protecting the FedEx        16    Table of Contents       brand, one of our most important assets. In addition to     traditional print and broadcast advertising, we promote the     FedEx brand through corporate sponsorships and special events.     For example, FedEx sponsors:                     The National Football League (NFL), as its Official     Delivery Service Sponsor                 FedExField, home of the NFLs Washington Redskins                 FedEx Orange Bowl, host of one of college footballs Bowl     Championship Series games                 The #11 Joe Gibbs Racing Chevrolet driven by Denny Hamlin     in the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series                 PGA TOUR and the Champions Tour golf organizations, as the     Official Shipping Company                 FedExCup, a season-long points competition for PGA TOUR players                 FedEx Kinkos Classic, a PGA Champions Tour event                 Pebble Beach Golf Resorts, as the official shipping company                 National Basketball Association (NBA), as its official delivery     service sponsor                 FedExForum, the home of the NBAs Memphis Grizzlies                 Vodafone McLaren Mercedes Formula One team                 French Open tennis tournament       FedEx     Global Supply Chain Services         FedEx Services offers a range of supply chain solutions,     including critical inventory logistics, transportation     management, fulfillment and fleet services, through its FedEx     Global Supply Chain Services subsidiary. FedEx Global Supply     Chain Services focuses on information technology-sensitive     business to meet the needs of its customers and to drive     transportation business to other FedEx operating companies.     FedEx Global Supply Chain Services service offerings use     advanced electronic data interchanges to speed communications     between customers and their suppliers, resulting in more     cost-effective solutions and enhanced levels of customer service.     Trademarks         The FedEx trademark, service mark and trade name is     essential to our worldwide business. FedEx, FedEx Express, FedEx     Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Kinkos, FedEx Services, FedEx     Global Supply Chain Services, FedEx Customer Information     Services, FedEx National LTL, FedEx Trade Networks, FedEx     SmartPost and FedEx Custom Critical, among others, are     trademarks, service marks and trade names of Federal Express     Corporation for which registrations, or applications for     registration, are on file. We have authorized, through licensing     arrangements, the use of certain of our trademarks, service     marks and trade names by our contractors and Global Service     Participants to support our business. In addition, we license     the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks and trade     names on promotional items for the primary purpose of enhancing     brand awareness.     Regulation     Air.  Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958,     as amended, both the U.S. Department of Transportation     (DOT) and the Federal Aviation Administration     (FAA) exercise regulatory authority over FedEx     Express.         The FAAs regulatory authority relates primarily to     operational aspects of air transportation, including aircraft     standards, maintenance and corrosion control, as well as     personnel and ground facilities, which may from time to time     affect the ability of FedEx Express to operate its aircraft in     the most efficient manner. FedEx Express holds an air carrier     certificate granted by the FAA pursuant to Part 119 of the     federal aviation regulations. This certificate is of unlimited     duration and remains in effect so long as FedEx Express     maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational     requirements of the regulations.        17    Table of Contents       The DOTs authority relates primarily to economic aspects     of air transportation. The DOTs jurisdiction extends to     aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters,     including the transfer of route authority between carriers.     FedEx Express holds various certificates issued by the DOT,     authorizing FedEx Express to engage in U.S. and     international air transportation of property and mail on a     worldwide basis. FedEx Expresss international authority     permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its     U.S. route system to numerous points throughout the world.     The DOT regulates international routes and practices and is     authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory     treatment of United States air carriers abroad. The right of a     United States carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the     DOTs approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement     between the United States and the foreign government. The     carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign     government to provide specific flights and services. The     regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time     to time impair the ability of FedEx Express to operate its air     network in the most efficient manner.         Under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as     amended, the Transportation Security Administration     (TSA), an agency within the Department of Homeland     Security, has responsibility for aviation security. In May 2006,     the TSA adopted new rules enhancing many of the security     requirements for air cargo on both passenger and all-cargo     aircraft, and in May 2007, the TSA issued a revised model     all-cargo aircraft security program for implementing the new     rules. Together with other all-cargo aircraft operators, we have     filed comments with the TSA requesting clarification regarding     several provisions in the revised model program. Until the     requirements for our security program under the new rules are     finalized, we cannot determine the effect that these new rules     will have on our cost structure or our operating results. It is     reasonably possible, however, that these rules or other future     security requirements for air cargo carriers could impose     material costs on us.         FedEx Express participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet     (CRAF) program. Under this program, the     U.S. Department of Defense may requisition for military use     certain of FedEx Expresss wide-bodied aircraft in the     event of a declared need, including a national emergency. FedEx     Express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft     requisitioned under the CRAF program at standard contract rates     established each year in the normal course of awarding     contracts. Through its participation in the CRAF program, FedEx     Express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter     business. FedEx Express, together with a consortium of other     carriers, currently contracts with the U.S. Government for     charter flights.     Ground.  The ground transportation performed by     FedEx Express is integral to its air transportation services.     The enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration     Authorization Act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to     regulate the rates, routes or services of intermodal all-cargo     air carriers and most motor carriers. States may now only     exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance. FedEx Express     is registered in those states that require registration.         The operations of FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx National     LTL and FedEx Custom Critical in interstate commerce are     currently regulated by the DOT and the Federal Motor Carrier     Safety Administration, which retain limited oversight authority     over motor carriers. Federal legislation preempts regulation by     the states of rates and service in intrastate freight     transportation.         Like other interstate motor carriers, our operations are subject     to certain DOT safety requirements governing interstate     operations. In addition, vehicle weight and dimensions remain     subject to both federal and state regulations.     Communication.  Because of the extensive use of     radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and     ground transportation operations, FedEx Express is subject to     the Federal Communications Commission Act of 1934, as amended.     Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission regulates     and licenses FedEx Expresss activities pertaining to     satellite communications.     Environmental.  Pursuant to the Federal     Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the     U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is authorized to     establish standards governing aircraft noise. FedEx     Expresss aircraft fleet is in compliance with current     noise standards of the federal aviation regulations. FedEx     Expresss aircraft are also subject to, and are in     compliance with, the regulations governing engine emissions. In     addition to federal        18    Table of Contents       regulation of aircraft noise, certain airport operators have     local noise regulations, which limit aircraft operations by type     of aircraft and time of day. These regulations have had a     restrictive effect on FedEx Expresss aircraft operations     in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a     material effect on any of FedEx Expresss significant     markets. Congresss passage of the Airport Noise and     Capacity Act of 1990 established a National Noise Policy, which     enabled FedEx Express to plan for noise reduction and better     respond to local noise constraints. FedEx Expresss     international operations are also subject to noise regulations     in certain of the countries in which it operates.         We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws     and regulations relating to, among other things, contingency     planning for spills of petroleum products, the disposal of waste     oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in FedEx     Kinkos copy machines and photo film developing operations.     Additionally, we are subject to numerous regulations dealing     with underground fuel storage tanks, hazardous waste handling,     vehicle and equipment emissions and the discharge of effluents     from our properties and equipment. We have environmental     management programs to ensure compliance with these regulations.     Customs.  Our activities, including customs     brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to regulation by     the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the TSA within     the Department of Homeland Security (customs brokerage and     security issues), the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission     (ocean freight forwarding) and the DOT (airfreight forwarding).     Our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the     regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions.            ITEM 1A.

The DC10s come in two models, the DC10-10 and the     DC10-30. The DC10-30 has a longer range and higher weight     capacity than the DC10-10.                 The MD10s are three-engine, wide-bodied DC10 aircraft that have     received an Advanced Common Flightdeck (ACF) modification, which     includes a conversion to a two-pilot cockpit, as well as     upgrades of electrical and other systems.                 The A300s and A310s are two-engine, wide-bodied aircraft that     have a longer range and more capacity than B757s and B727s.                 The B757s are two-engine aircraft configured for cargo service.                 The B727s are three-engine aircraft configured for cargo service.                 The Fokker F27, Cessna 208 and ATR turbo-prop aircraft are     leased to independent operators to support FedEx Express     operations in areas where demand does not justify use of a     larger aircraft.          20    Table of Contents         An inventory of spare engines and parts is maintained for each     aircraft type.         In addition, FedEx Express wet leases approximately     45 smaller piston-engine and turbo-prop aircraft, which feed     packages to and from airports served by FedEx Expresss     larger jet aircraft. The wet lease agreements call for the     owner-lessor to provide the aircraft, flight crews, insurance     and maintenance, as well as fuel and other supplies required to     operate the aircraft. FedEx Expresss wet lease agreements     are for terms not exceeding one year and are generally     cancelable upon 30 days notice.         At May 31, 2007, FedEx Express operated approximately     53,000 ground transport vehicles, including pickup and delivery     vans, larger trucks called container transport vehicles and     over-the-road tractors and trailers.

FedEx Expresss primary sorting facility, which serves as     the center of its multiple     hub-and-spoke     system, is located at the Memphis International Airport. FedEx     Expresss facilities at the Memphis International Airport     also include aircraft hangars, aircraft ramp areas, vehicle     parking areas, flight training and fuel facilities,     administrative offices and warehouse space. FedEx Express leases     these facilities from the Memphis-Shelby County Airport     Authority (the Authority). The lease obligates FedEx     Express to maintain and insure the leased property and to pay     all related taxes, assessments and other charges. The lease is     subordinate to, and FedEx Expresss rights thereunder could     be affected by, any future lease or agreement between the     Authority and the U.S. Government.         FedEx Express has international sorting and freight handling     facilities located at Narita Airport in Tokyo, Japan, Stansted     Airport outside London, England and Pearson Airport in Toronto,     Canada. FedEx Express also has a substantial presence at     airports in Hong Kong; Taiwan; Dubai, United Arab Emirates;     Frankfurt, Germany; and Miami.     Administrative     and Other Properties and Facilities         The World Headquarters of FedEx Express is located in     southeastern Shelby County, Tennessee. The headquarters campus,     which comprises eight separate buildings with approximately     1.1 million square feet of        22    Table of Contents       space, houses approximately 1,800 employees. FedEx Express     also leases approximately 30 facilities in the Memphis area for     administrative offices and warehouses. FedEx Express and FedEx     Services lease state-of-the-art technology centers in     Collierville, Tennessee, Irving, Texas, Colorado Springs,     Colorado, and Orlando, Florida. These facilities house personnel     responsible for strategic software development and other     functions that support FedExs technology and     e-commerce     solutions.         FedEx Express owns or leases approximately 665 facilities for     city station operations in the United States. In addition,     approximately 740 city stations are owned or leased throughout     FedEx Expresss international network. The majority of     these leases are for terms of five to ten years. City stations     serve as a sorting and distribution center for a particular city     or region. We believe that suitable alternative facilities are     available in each locale on satisfactory terms, if necessary.         As of May 31, 2007, FedEx Express had approximately 42,500     Drop Boxes, including 5,000 Drop Boxes outside U.S. Post     Offices.

Internationally, FedEx Express has approximately 2,000     drop-off     locations.     FedEx     Ground Segment         FedEx Grounds corporate offices and information and data     centers are located in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, area in an     approximately 500,000 square-foot building owned by FedEx     Ground. As of May 31, 2007, FedEx Ground had approximately     25,800 company-owned trailers and owned or leased     approximately 500 facilities, including 29 hubs. In addition,     approximately 20,600 owner-operated vehicles support FedEx     Grounds business. Of the approximately 300 facilities that     support FedEx Home Delivery, more than 200 are co-located with     existing FedEx Ground facilities. Leased facilities generally     have terms of five years or less. The 29 hub facilities are     strategically located to cover the geographic area served by     FedEx Ground. The hub facilities average 252,000 square     feet and range in size from 31,000 to 488,000 square feet.

The following MD&A     describes the principal factors affecting the results of     operations, liquidity, capital resources, contractual cash     obligations and the critical accounting estimates of FedEx. The     discussion in the financial section should be read in     conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report,     particularly Item 1: Business and our detailed     discussion of risk factors included in this MD&A.     ORGANIZATION     OF INFORMATION         Our MD&A is comprised of three major sections: Results of     Operations, Financial Condition and Critical Accounting     Estimates. These sections include the following information:                     Results of Operations includes an overview of our consolidated     2007 results compared to 2006, and 2006 results compared to     2005. This section also includes a discussion of key actions and     events that impacted our results, as well as a discussion of our     outlook for 2008.                 The overview is followed by a financial summary and analysis     (including a discussion of both historical operating results and     our outlook for 2008) for each of our four reportable     business segments.                 Our financial condition is reviewed through an analysis of key     elements of our liquidity, capital resources and contractual     cash obligations, including a discussion of our cash flow     statements and our financial commitments.                 We conclude with a discussion of the critical accounting     estimates that we believe are important to understanding certain     of the material judgments and assumptions incorporated in our     reported financial results.       DESCRIPTION     OF BUSINESS         FedEx provides a broad portfolio of transportation,     e-commerce     and business services through companies competing collectively,     operating independently and managed collaboratively, under the     respected FedEx brand. These operating companies are primarily     represented by FedEx Express, the worlds largest express     transportation company; FedEx Ground, a leading provider of     small-package ground delivery services; FedEx Freight     Corporation, a leading U.S. provider of less-than-truckload     (LTL) freight services; and FedEx Kinkos, a     leading provider of document solutions and business services.     These companies represent our major service lines and form the     core of our reportable segments. See Reportable     Segments for further discussion and refer to     Item 1: Business for a more detailed     description of each of our operating companies.         The key indicators necessary to understand our operating results     include:                     the overall customer demand for our various services;                 the volumes of transportation and business services provided     through our networks, primarily measured by our average daily     volume and shipment weight;                 the mix of services purchased by our customers;                 the prices we obtain for our services, primarily measured by     yield (average price per shipment or pound) or average price per     hundredweight for FedEx Freight LTL Group shipments;                 our ability to manage our cost structure for capital     expenditures and operating expenses and to match our cost     structure to shifting volume levels; and          33    Table of Contents                     the timing and amount of fluctuations in fuel prices and our     ability to recover incremental fuel costs through our fuel     surcharges.           Except as otherwise specified, references to years indicate our     fiscal year ended May 31, 2007 or ended May 31 of the year     referenced and comparisons are to the prior year. References to     our transportation segments mean, collectively, our FedEx     Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight segments.

Operating results moderated     during 2007, reflecting the impact of weaker volumes in the     second half of our fiscal year in our FedEx Express and FedEx     Freight segments due to the slowing economic environment. The     year-over-year negative impact from the timing lag in our fuel     surcharges and a $143 million charge associated with     upfront compensation and benefits under the new contract with     our pilots also negatively impacted 2007 operating results.         Revenue growth in 2007 was due to strong FedEx Ground package     volume growth and continued growth in FedEx Express     International Priority (IP) services, as we     continued to focus on expanding these service offerings. Our     2007 revenues also reflected the acquisition of FedEx National     LTL (formerly known as Watkins Motor Lines), which added     approximately $760 million to 2007 revenue. Revenue growth     in 2007 was slightly offset by declines in copy product revenues     at FedEx Kinkos.         Operating income increased in 2007, as revenue growth at FedEx     Express and FedEx Ground more than offset reduced profitability     at the FedEx Freight segment and FedEx Kinkos. Operating     margin was flat in 2007 due to slower economic growth, the     negative impact of higher salaries and benefits primarily as a     result of the new labor contract with our pilots and the timing     of adjustments to our fuel surcharges at FedEx Express     (described below), as well as operating losses at FedEx National     LTL. Softening volumes in the LTL sector and ongoing expenses to     integrate the FedEx National LTL network negatively impacted the     performance of the FedEx Freight segment in 2007.        35    Table of Contents       Salaries and employee benefits increased in 2007 as a result of     the new labor contract for the pilots of FedEx Express and the     FedEx National LTL acquisition. The impacts of expensing stock     options commencing in 2007 and higher retirement plan costs were     largely offset by lower incentive compensation accruals.     Purchased transportation costs increased in 2007 due to FedEx     Ground volume growth, the FedEx National LTL acquisition and IP     package volume growth.         The pilots of FedEx Express, who represent a small number of our     total employees, are employed under a collective bargaining     agreement. In October 2006, the pilots ratified a new four-year     labor contract that included signing bonuses and other upfront     compensation of approximately $143 million, as well as pay     increases and other benefit enhancements. These costs were     partially mitigated by reductions in variable incentive     compensation. The effect of this new agreement on second quarter     2007 net income was approximately $78 million net of     tax, or $0.25 per diluted share.         The timing and amount of fluctuations in fuel prices and our     ability to recover incremental fuel costs through our various     fuel surcharges continue to impact our results. Fuel costs     increased during 2007 due to an increase in the average price     per gallon of fuel and an increase in gallons consumed. Because     of the timing lag that exists between when we purchase fuel and     when our fuel surcharges are automatically adjusted at FedEx     Express, fuel surcharges were not sufficient to offset the     effect of changes in fuel costs on our operating results for     2007. Though fluctuations in fuel surcharge rates can be     significant from period to period, fuel surcharges represent one     of the many individual components of our pricing structure that     impact our overall revenue and yield. Additional components     include the mix of services purchased, the base price and other     extra service fees we obtain for these services and the level of     pricing discounts offered. In order to provide information about     the impact of fuel surcharges on the trend in revenue and yield     growth, we have included the comparative fuel surcharge rates in     effect for 2007, 2006 and 2005 in the accompanying discussions     of each of our transportation segments.         Our 2006 results benefited from strong growth in the global     economy. During 2006, revenue growth was primarily attributable     to yield improvement across our transportation segments, package     volume growth in our IP services at FedEx Express and volume     growth at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight. Yields improved     principally due to incremental fuel surcharges and base rate     increases.         Operating income increased during 2006 primarily due to revenue     growth and improved margins across all our transportation     segments. Yield and cost management activities, combined with     productivity gains across all transportation segments,     contributed to our margin growth. Operating income improvement     was partially offset by higher costs at FedEx Express to support     international volume growth, expansion costs at FedEx Ground and     reduced operating profit at FedEx Kinkos.         While fuel costs increased substantially in 2006, fuel     surcharges more than offset the effect of these higher fuel     costs. Salaries and employee benefits increased in 2006 due     largely to increases in wage rates, pension and medical     expenses. Pension expense increased $64 million in 2006 due     primarily to a reduction in the discount rate. Purchased     transportation increased in 2006 due primarily to the continued     increase in the use of contract carriers to support increasing     volumes at FedEx Ground, increased IP volumes at FedEx Express     and higher fuel surcharges from third-party transportation     providers, including our independent contractors.     Other     Income and Expense         Net interest expense decreased $51 million during 2007     primarily due to increased interest income earned on higher cash     balances. Net interest expense decreased $35 million during     2006 due primarily to the reduction in the level of outstanding     debt and capital leases as a result of scheduled payments,     increased interest income due to higher cash balances and     interest rates, and higher capitalized interest related to     modification of certain aircraft at FedEx Express.     Income     Taxes         Our effective tax rate was 37.3% in 2007, 37.7% in 2006 and     37.4% in 2005. Our 2007 tax rate was favorably impacted by the     conclusion of various state and federal tax audits and appeals.     This favorable impact was        36    Table of Contents       partially offset by tax charges incurred as a result of a     reorganization in Asia associated with our acquisition in China     (described below). The 37.4% effective tax rate in 2005 was     favorably impacted by the reduction of a valuation allowance on     foreign tax credits arising from certain of our international     operations as a result of the passage of the American Jobs     Creation Act of 2004 and by a lower effective state tax rate.     For 2008, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 37.5%     and 38%. The actual rate, however, will depend on a number of     factors, including the amount and source of operating income.     Business     Acquisitions         On September 3, 2006, we acquired the assets and assumed     certain obligations of the LTL operations of Watkins Motor     Lines, a privately held company, and certain affiliates for     $787 million in cash. Watkins, a leading provider of     long-haul LTL services, was renamed FedEx National LTL and     meaningfully extends our leadership position in the heavyweight     LTL freight sector. The financial results of FedEx National LTL     are included in the FedEx Freight segment from the date of     acquisition.         On December 16, 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding     capital stock of ANC Holdings Ltd. (ANC), a United     Kingdom domestic express transportation company, for     $241 million, predominantly in cash. This acquisition     allows FedEx Express to better serve the United Kingdom domestic     market, which we previously served primarily through independent     agents.         On March 1, 2007, FedEx Express acquired Tianjin Datian W.     Group Co., Ltd.s (DTW Group) 50% share of the     FedEx-DTW International Priority express joint venture and     assets relating to DTW Groups domestic express network in     China for $427 million in cash. This acquisition converts     our joint venture with DTW Group into a wholly owned subsidiary     and increases our presence in China in the international and     domestic express businesses. Prior to the fourth quarter of     2007, we accounted for our investment in the joint venture under     the equity method.         The financial results of the ANC and DTW Group acquisitions, as     well as other immaterial business acquisitions during 2007, are     included in the FedEx Express segment from the date of     acquisition. These acquisitions were not material to our results     of operations or financial condition.         We paid the purchase price for these acquisitions from available     cash balances, which included the net proceeds from our     $1 billion senior unsecured debt offering completed during     2007. See Note 6 of the accompanying consolidated financial     statements for further discussion of this debt offering.         See Note 3 of the accompanying consolidated financial     statements for further information about these acquisitions.     Lease     Accounting Charge         Our results for 2006 included a noncash charge of     $79 million ($49 million net of tax, or $0.16 per     diluted share) to adjust the accounting for certain facility     leases, predominantly at FedEx Express. The charge, which     included the impact on prior years, related primarily to rent     escalations in on-airport facility leases that were not being     recognized appropriately.     Airline     Stabilization Act Charge         In 2005, the United States Department of Transportation     (DOT) issued a final order in its administrative     review of the FedEx Express claim for compensation under the Air     Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act. As a result,     we recorded a charge of $48 million in 2005     ($31 million net of tax, or $0.10 per diluted share),     representing the DOTs repayment demand of $29 million     and the write-off of a $19 million receivable.     Outlook         Our outlook for 2008 reflects continued investment in several     major, long-term initiatives in a soft but stable     U.S. economy. Outside the United States, economic activity     is expected to continue to expand, but at a more        37    Table of Contents       moderate pace than in 2007. As a result, we expect our revenue     trends to moderate in 2008, with growth driven by increased     shipments at FedEx Ground, the full-year benefit of the FedEx     National LTL business and expansion of international business at     FedEx Express (both IP and international domestic services).         We expect our earnings in 2008 to be below our long-term goal of     10% to 15% annual earnings growth due to the softening     U.S. economy and planned investments in our businesses,     which are critical to our     long-term     strategy. We remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for     all of our business segments.         We expect to make significant investments to expand our global     networks, in part through the continued integration and     expansion of the businesses we acquired in 2007. Our planned     investments for 2008 are focused on the following three key     opportunities:                     support for long-term volume growth, such as additional or     expanded facilities across all segments, new aircraft (such as     the Boeing 757 and 777 Freighter) and expansion of our     international domestic express businesses;                 improvements in service levels, including expanded delivery     areas for the FedEx Priority Overnight and FedEx First Overnight     services at FedEx Express and reduced transit times at FedEx     Ground; and                 improvements to productivity, including updates and enhancements     to our technology capabilities.           FedEx Kinkos will continue to focus on key strategies     related to adding new locations, improving customer service and     increasing investments in employee development and training. We     expect these strategies to continue to adversely affect     profitability in 2008. FedEx Kinkos plans to open     approximately 300 new centers in the coming year, which will     bring the total number of centers to approximately 2,000 by the     end of 2008.         All of our transportation businesses operate in a competitive     pricing environment, exacerbated by continuing volatile fuel     prices. Historically, our fuel surcharges have generally been     sufficient to offset incremental fuel costs; however, volatility     in fuel costs may impact earnings because adjustments to our     fuel surcharges lag changes in actual fuel prices paid.     Therefore, the trailing impact of adjustments to our fuel     surcharges can affect our earnings.         See Risk Factors for a discussion of these and other     potential risks and uncertainties that could materially affect     our future performance.     Seasonality     of Business         Our businesses are seasonal in nature. Seasonal fluctuations     affect volumes, revenues and earnings. Historically, the     U.S. express package business experiences an increase in     volumes in late November and December. International business,     particularly in the Asia-to-U.S. market, peaks in October     and November in advance of the U.S. holiday sales season.     Our first and third fiscal quarters, because they are summer     vacation and post winter-holiday seasons, have historically     experienced lower volumes relative to other periods. Normally,     the fall is the busiest shipping period for FedEx Ground, while     late December, June and July are the slowest periods. For the     FedEx Freight LTL Group, the spring and fall are the busiest     periods and the latter part of December, January and February     are the slowest periods. For FedEx Kinkos, the summer     months are normally the slowest periods. Shipment levels,     operating costs and earnings for each of our companies can also     be adversely affected by inclement weather, particularly in our     third fiscal quarter. In addition, the transportation and     business services industries are directly affected by the state     of the overall global economy.      NEW     ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS          New accounting rules and disclosure requirements can     significantly impact the comparability of our financial     statements. We believe the following new accounting     pronouncements, which were issued or became effective for us     during 2007, are relevant to the readers of our financial     statements.         On June 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of     Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 123R,     Share-Based Payment, which requires recognition of     compensation expense for stock-based awards using a fair value     method. The adoption of SFAS 123R reduced earnings for 2007     by $0.17 per diluted share. For        38    Table of Contents       additional information on the impact of the adoption of     SFAS 123R, refer to Note 1 to the accompanying     consolidated financial statements.         On May 31, 2007, we adopted SFAS 158,     Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and     Other Postretirement Plans, which requires recognition in     the balance sheet of the funded status of defined benefit     pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and the     recognition in accumulated other comprehensive income of     unrecognized gains or losses, prior service costs or credits and     transition assets or obligations existing at the time of     adoption. Additionally, SFAS 158 requires the measurement     date for plan assets and liabilities to coincide with the     sponsors year-end. We currently use a February 28     measurement date for our plans; therefore, this standard will     require us to change our measurement date to May 31 (beginning     in 2009).         The funded status recognition and disclosure provisions of     SFAS 158 were effective for FedEx as of May 31, 2007.     The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations     as of our fiscal year-end is effective for FedEx no later than     2009.         The adoption of SFAS 158 resulted in a $982 million     charge to shareholders equity at May 31, 2007 through     accumulated other comprehensive income. Under SFAS 158, we     were required to write off our prepaid pension asset of     $1.4 billion and increase our pension and other     postretirement benefit liabilities by $120 million. These     adjustments, net of deferred taxes of $582 million, were     required to recognize the unfunded projected benefit obligation     in our balance sheet. SFAS 158 has no impact on the     determination of expense for our pension or other postretirement     benefit plans.         In February 2007, we announced changes to modernize certain of     our retirement programs over the next two fiscal years.     Effective January 1, 2008, we will increase the annual     company matching contribution under the largest of our 401(k)     plans covering most employees from $500 to a maximum of 3.5% of     eligible compensation. Effective May 31, 2008, benefits     previously accrued under our primary pension plans using a     traditional pension benefit formula will be capped for most     employees, and those benefits will be payable beginning at     retirement. Beginning June 1, 2008, future pension benefits     for most employees will be accrued under a cash balance formula     we call the Portable Pension Account. These changes will not     affect the benefits of current retirees. For additional     information on the adoption of SFAS 158 and these changes,     see Note 12 to the accompanying audited financial     statements and the Critical Accounting Estimates section of this     MD&A.         In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board     (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No.     (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income     Taxes. This interpretation establishes new standards for     the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure     of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in     income tax returns. The new rules will be effective for FedEx in     the first quarter of 2008. The adoption of this interpretation     will not have a material effect on our financial statements.         In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission     (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin     (SAB) 108, Considering the Effects of Prior     Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current     Year Financial Statements, which eliminates the diversity     in practice surrounding the quantification and evaluation of     financial statement errors. The guidance outlined in     SAB 108 was effective for FedEx in the fourth quarter of     2007 and is consistent with our historical practices for     assessing such matters when circumstances have required such an     evaluation.        39    Table of Contents      REPORTABLE     SEGMENTS          FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight and FedEx     Kinkos represent our major service lines and form the core     of our reportable segments. (For further discussion of our     operating companies, refer to Item 1:     Business.) As of May 31, 2007, our reportable     segments included the following businesses:     FedEx     Express Segment          FedEx Express (express transportation)     FedEx Trade Networks (global trade services)       FedEx     Ground Segment          FedEx Ground (small-package ground delivery)     FedEx SmartPost (small-parcel consolidator)     FedEx     Freight Segment          FedEx Freight LTL Group:       FedEx Freight (regional LTL freight     transportation)       FedEx National LTL (long-haul LTL freight     transportation)     FedEx Custom Critical (time-critical transportation)     Caribbean Transportation Services (airfreight forwarding)     FedEx     Kinkos Segment          FedEx Kinkos (document solutions and business services)     FEDEX     SERVICES & OTHER INTERSEGMENT     TRANSACTIONS         FedEx Services provides customer-facing sales, marketing and     information technology support, primarily for FedEx Express and     FedEx Ground. The costs for these activities are allocated based     on metrics such as relative revenues or estimated services     provided. We believe these allocations approximate the cost of     providing these functions.         The operating expenses line item Intercompany     charges on the accompanying unaudited financial summaries     of our reportable segments includes the allocations from FedEx     Services to the respective segments. The Intercompany     charges caption also includes allocations for     administrative services provided between operating companies and     certain other costs such as corporate management fees related to     services received for general corporate oversight, including     executive officers and certain legal and finance functions.     Management evaluates segment financial performance based on     operating income.         Effective June 1, 2006, we moved the credit, collections     and customer service functions with responsibility for FedEx     Express U.S. and FedEx Ground customer information from     FedEx Express into a new subsidiary of FedEx Services named     FedEx Customer Information Services, Inc. (FCIS).     Also, effective June 1, 2006, we moved FedEx Supply Chain     Services, Inc., the results of which were previously reported in     the FedEx Ground segment, into a new subsidiary of FedEx     Services named FedEx Global Supply Chain Services, Inc. The     costs of providing these customer service functions and the net     operating costs of FedEx Global Supply Chain Services are     allocated back to the FedEx Express and FedEx Ground segments.     Prior year amounts have not been reclassified to conform to the     current year segment presentation, as the financial results are     materially comparable.         Certain FedEx operating companies provide transportation and     related services for other FedEx companies outside their     reportable segment. Billings for such services are based on     negotiated rates that we believe approximate fair value and are     reflected as revenues of the billing segment. These rates are     adjusted from time to time based on market conditions. FedEx     Kinkos segment revenues include package acceptance     revenue, which represents the fee received by FedEx Kinkos     from FedEx Express and FedEx Ground for accepting and handling     packages at FedEx Kinkos locations on behalf of these     operating companies. Package acceptance        40    Table of Contents       revenue does not include the external revenue associated with     the actual shipments. Such intersegment revenues and expenses     are eliminated in the consolidated results and are not     separately identified in the following segment information, as     the amounts are not material.

(2)   We reclassified certain prior     period international priority freight service statistics     previously included within the IP package statistics to     international priority freight statistics to conform to the     current period presentation and more precisely present the     nature of the services provided.           FedEx     Express Segment Revenues         Solid yield growth primarily due to pricing discipline     contributed to revenue growth in 2007, despite flat package     volume growth. Package revenue growth in 2007 was driven by IP     revenues, which grew 9% on yield growth of 5% as a result of     yield improvements across all regions and a 5% increase in     volumes due to IP volume growth in U.S. outbound, Asia and     Europe, as we continued to focus on expanding this service. Also     contributing to revenue growth in 2007 were increases in other     revenues primarily due to our acquisition of ANC and increases     in freight revenues due to higher U.S. and international     priority freight volumes. U.S. domestic package revenues     increased 1% as a result of yield improvements, partially offset     by a decrease in volumes.         IP yield increased during 2007 as a result of favorable exchange     rates, higher package weights and an increase in the average     rate per pound. U.S. domestic composite yield increases in     2007 were due to an increase in the        42    Table of Contents       average rate per pound, partially offset by changes in product     mix and lower package weights. U.S. freight yield increased     in 2007 due to an increase in the average rate per pound and     higher fuel surcharges.         IP volume growth in 2007 was primarily due to increased demand     in the U.S. outbound, Asia and Europe markets.     U.S. domestic package volumes decreased during 2007     primarily due to the moderating growth rate of the     U.S. economy.         FedEx Express segment revenues increased in 2006 due to yield     improvements and volume growth in IP services (particularly in     Asia, U.S. outbound and Europe). U.S. domestic package     and U.S. freight revenue growth also contributed to the     revenue increase for 2006. U.S. volumes were flat compared     to the prior year, as growth in our U.S. domestic overnight     services was offset by declines in deferred volumes that     resulted from yield management actions.         IP yield increased during 2006 due to higher fuel surcharges and     increases in international average weight per package and     average rate per pound. U.S. domestic composite yield     increases were due to higher fuel surcharges and improved yields     on U.S. domestic deferred packages. Improvements in     U.S. domestic deferred yield resulted from our continued     efforts to improve the profitability of this service.     U.S. freight yield increases were due to an increase in     average rate per pound and higher fuel surcharges.         Our fuel surcharges are indexed to the spot price for jet fuel.     Using this index, the U.S. domestic and outbound fuel     surcharge and the international fuel surcharges ranged as     follows for the years ended May 31:                                                         2007           2006           2005               U.S. Domestic and Outbound Fuel     Surcharge:                                                            Low                     8.50       %               10.50       %               6.00       %      High                     17.00                   20.00                   13.00          Weighted-average                     12.91                   13.69                   9.05          International Fuel Surcharges:                                                            Low                     8.50                   10.00                   3.00          High                     17.00                   20.00                   13.00          Weighted-average                     12.98                   12.73                   8.45             FedEx     Express Segment Operating Income         Despite slower overall revenue growth, operating income and     operating margin increased in 2007. Increases in operating     income and margin in 2007 resulted from growth in IP services     and were partially offset by costs associated with the     ratification of a new labor contract with our pilots in October     2006. These costs included signing bonuses and other upfront     compensation of $143 million, as well as pay increases and     other benefit enhancements, which were mitigated by reductions     in variable incentive compensation. Year-over-year results in     2007 were positively affected by a $75 million charge in     2006 to adjust the accounting for certain facility leases.         Fuel costs increased during 2007 due to an increase in the     average price per gallon of fuel. Fuel surcharges did not offset     the effect of higher fuel costs on our year-over-year operating     results for 2007, due to the timing lag that exists between when     we purchase fuel and when our fuel surcharges are adjusted,     based on a static analysis of the year-over-year changes in fuel     prices compared to changes in fuel surcharges.         Salaries and employee benefits increased in 2007 primarily as a     result of the new labor contract with our pilots. Purchased     transportation costs increased 13% in 2007 due to IP volume     growth, which required a higher utilization of contract pickup     and delivery services and an increase in the cost of purchased     transportation. We use purchased transportation in markets where     we do not have a direct presence or to meet short-term capacity     needs. Maintenance and repairs increased 7% in 2007 primarily     due to higher aircraft maintenance expenses for various     airframes and Airbus A300 engines. The 5% decrease in rentals     and landing fees in 2007 was attributable to the one-time     adjustment for leases in 2006 described above. Intercompany     charges increased 35% in 2007 due to allocations as a result of     moving the FCIS organization from FedEx        43    Table of Contents       Express to FedEx Services in 2007. The costs associated with the     FCIS organization in 2006 were of a comparable amount but were     reported in individual operating expense captions.         During 2007, we terminated our agreement with Airbus for the     purchase of A380 aircraft and in March 2007 entered into a     separate settlement agreement with Airbus that, among other     things, provides us with credit memoranda applicable to the     purchase of goods and services in the future. The net impact of     this settlement was immaterial to our 2007 results and was     recorded as an operating gain during the fourth quarter of 2007.         Operating income grew significantly in 2006 as a result of     strong revenue growth and improved operating margin. Volume     growth in higher margin U.S. domestic overnight and IP     services contributed to yield improvements. Improved yields,     combined with productivity gains and cost containment, allowed     FedEx Express to improve operating margin in 2006. Revenue and     margin growth for 2006 more than offset the     one-time     adjustment for leases and costs associated with two new     around-the-world flights.         In 2006, salaries and benefits increased primarily due to higher     pension costs and wage rates. Fuel costs were higher in 2006     primarily due to an increase in the average price per gallon of     jet fuel, while gallons consumed increased slightly, primarily     related to the two new around-the-world flights. However, our     fuel surcharges substantially mitigated the impact of higher jet     fuel prices. Purchased transportation costs increased in 2006,     though at a slower rate than in 2005, driven by IP volume     growth, which required a higher utilization of contract pickup     and delivery services. Rentals and landing fees increased in     2006, primarily due to the one-time adjustment for leases of     $75 million.     FedEx     Express Segment Outlook         We expect moderate revenue growth at FedEx Express in 2008, as     growth in both IP and domestic package services will continue to     slow as a result of the softening U.S. economy and     declining growth outside the U.S. The majority of the     revenue increase in 2008 will be provided by IP services, as we     continue to focus on growing our service offerings in     international markets, particularly China and Europe. Our     international domestic revenue is projected to increase in 2008     due to the full-year benefit of 2007 acquisitions such as ANC     and DTW Group and the expansion of our China domestic service.         Operating income and operating margin are expected to improve in     2008 despite the soft U.S. economy due to continued cost     containment and productivity improvements. Capital expenditures     at FedEx Express are expected to be higher in 2008 due to     investments in equipment and facilities necessary to support     projected long-term volume growth, as well as continued     investments in China. In March 2006, we broke ground on a new     $150 million Asia-Pacific hub in the southern China city of     Guangzhou. This hub is planned to be operational in 2009.     Aircraft-related capital and expense outlays, including support     of our Boeing 757 program and the new Boeing 777 Freighter     fleet, are expected to approximate 2007 spending levels. We will     continue to make strategic investments despite short-term     economic softness.        44    Table of Contents      FEDEX     GROUND SEGMENT          The following table compares revenues, operating expenses,     operating income and operating margin (dollars in millions) and     selected package statistics (in thousands, except yield amounts)     for the years ended May 31:                                                                                                                     Percent Change                 2007           2006           2005           2007/2006           2006/2005               Revenues                 $       6,043               $       5,306               $       4,680                   14                   13          Operating expenses:                                                                                            Salaries and employee benefits                     1,006                   929                   845                   8                   10          Purchased transportation                     2,326                   2,019                   1,791                   15                   13          Rentals                     166                   133                   122                   25                   9          Depreciation and amortization                     268                   224                   176                   20                   27          Fuel                     117                   93                   48                   26                   94          Maintenance and repairs                     134                   118                   110                   14                   7          Intercompany charges                     578                   526                   482                   10                   9          Other                     635                   559                   502                   14                   11                                                                                                Total operating expenses                     5,230                   4,601                   4,076                   14                   13                                                                                                Operating income                 $       813               $       705               $       604                   15                   17                                                                                                Operating margin                     13.5       %               13.3       %               12.9       %               20        bp               40        bp      FedEx Ground:                                                                                            Average daily package volume                     3,126                   2,815                   2,609                   11                   8          Revenue per package (yield)                 $       7.21               $       7.02               $       6.68                   3                   5             FedEx     Ground Segment Revenues         Strong volume growth fueled a 14% increase in revenue during     2007. Average daily volumes at FedEx Ground rose 11% because of     increased commercial business and the continued growth of our     FedEx Home Delivery service. Yield improvement during 2007 was     primarily due to the impact of general rate increases and higher     extra service revenues, primarily on our residential services.     This yield increase was partially offset by higher customer     discounts and a lower average weight and zone per package.     Additionally, revenue at FedEx SmartPost increased significantly     in 2007 due to increased market share, as a major competitor     exited this market in 2006, enabling significant growth in the     customer base and related volumes.         Revenues increased during 2006 due to volume increases and yield     improvement. Average daily volumes increased across all of our     services, led by the continued growth of our FedEx Home Delivery     service. Yield improvement during 2006 was primarily due to     increased fuel surcharges, higher extra service revenue and the     impact of general rate increases. These increases were partially     offset by higher customer discounts and a lower average weight     per package.         The FedEx Ground fuel surcharge is based on a rounded average of     the national U.S. on-highway average prices for a gallon of     diesel fuel, as published by the Department of Energy. Our fuel     surcharge ranged as follows for the years ended May 31:                                                         2007           2006           2005               Low                     3.50       %               2.50       %               1.80       %      High                     5.25                   5.25                   2.50          Weighted-average                     4.18                   3.54                   2.04                 No fuel surcharge was in effect from January 2004 to January     2005.        45    Table of Contents     FedEx     Ground Segment Operating Income         FedEx Ground segment operating income increased 15% during 2007     principally due to revenue growth and improved results at FedEx     SmartPost. Operating margin increased only slightly in 2007, as     revenue growth was partially offset by increased purchased     transportation costs, increased legal costs and higher     depreciation and rent expense associated with network expansion.         Purchased transportation increased 15% in 2007 primarily due to     volume growth and higher rates paid to our independent     contractors, including fuel supplements. Our fuel surcharge was     sufficient to offset the effect of higher fuel costs on our     operating results, based on a static analysis of the     year-over-year changes in fuel prices compared to changes in the     fuel surcharge. Other operating expenses increased 14% in 2007     primarily due to increased legal costs. Depreciation expense     increased 20% and rent expense increased 25% principally due to     higher spending on material handling and scanning equipment and     facilities associated with our     multi-year     network expansion.         Effective June 1, 2006, we moved FedEx Supply Chain     Services, Inc., the results of which were previously reported in     the FedEx Ground segment, into a new subsidiary of FedEx     Services named FedEx Global Supply Chain Services, Inc. The net     operating costs of this entity are allocated to FedEx Express     and FedEx Ground. Prior year amounts have not been reclassified     to conform to the current year segment presentation, as     financial results are materially comparable.         FedEx Ground segment operating income increased in 2006,     resulting principally from revenue growth and yield improvement.     Operating margin for the segment improved in 2006 due to fuel     surcharges, general rate increases, improved productivity and     the inclusion in 2005 of a $10 million charge at FedEx     Supply Chain Services related to the termination of a vendor     agreement. A portion of the operating margin improvement was     offset by higher year-over-year expenses related to investments     in new technology and the opening of additional FedEx Ground     facilities.         Salaries and employee benefits increased in 2006 principally due     to wage rate increases and increases in staffing and facilities     to support volume growth. Depreciation expense in 2006 increased     at a higher rate than revenue due to increased spending     associated with material handling and scanning equipment. In     2006, purchased transportation increased due to increased     volumes and an increase in the cost of purchased transportation     due to higher fuel surcharges from third-party transportation     providers, including our independent contractors.     FedEx     Ground Segment Outlook         We expect the FedEx Ground segment to have revenue growth in     2008 consistent with 2007, led by continued strong volume growth     at FedEx Ground and FedEx SmartPost. FedEx Grounds average     daily volume is expected to increase in 2008 due to increased     base business and FedEx Home Delivery volumes. FedEx SmartPost     volumes are also expected to grow, because of increased market     share and improved service levels. Yields for all services at     FedEx Ground are expected to increase in 2008 from increases in     list prices and residential and commercial delivery area     surcharges.         FedEx Grounds operating margin in 2008 is expected to     improve from continued cost controls, productivity gains and     yield improvements, partially offset by the impact of our     network expansion and increased purchased transportation costs.     Capital spending is expected to grow, as we continue with     comprehensive network expansion and productivity-enhancing     technologies within the FedEx Ground segment. During 2008, the     multi-phase expansion plan includes one new hub, 14 expanded     hubs and two relocated facilities. We are committed to investing     in the FedEx Ground network because of the long-term benefits we     will experience from these investments.        46    Table of Contents      FEDEX     FREIGHT SEGMENT          The following table shows revenues, operating expenses,     operating income and operating margin (dollars in millions) and     selected statistics for the years ended May 31:                                                                                                                     Percent Change                 2007           2006           2005           2007/2006           2006/2005               Revenues                 $       4,586               $       3,645               $       3,217                   26                   13          Operating expenses:                                                                                            Salaries and employee benefits                     2,250                   1,801                   1,650                   25                   9          Purchased transportation                     465                   298                   315                   56                   (5       )      Rentals and landing fees                     112                   94                   99                   19                   (5       )      Depreciation and amortization                     195                   120                   102                   63                   18          Fuel                     468                   377                   257                   24                   47          Maintenance and repairs                     165                   120                   128                   38                   (6       )      Intercompany charges                     61                   37                   26                   65                   42          Other                     407                   313                   286                   30                   9                                                                                                Total operating expenses                     4,123                   3,160                   2,863                   30                   10                                                                                                Operating income                 $       463               $       485               $       354                   (5       )               37                                                                                                Operating margin                     10.1       %               13.3       %               11.0       %               (320       ) bp               230        bp      Average daily LTL shipments (in     thousands)                     78                   67                   63                   16                   6          Weight per LTL shipment (lbs)                     1,130                   1,143                   1,132                   (1       )               1          LTL yield (revenue per     hundredweight)                 $       18.65               $       16.84               $       15.48                   11                   9                 The results of operations of FedEx National LTL are included in     FedEx Freight segment results from the date of acquisition on     September 3, 2006.     FedEx     Freight Segment Revenues         FedEx Freight segment revenues increased 26% in 2007 primarily     as a result of the acquisition of FedEx National LTL, which     contributed significantly to an increase in average daily LTL     shipments of 16% and LTL yield of 11%. Average daily LTL     shipments excluding FedEx National LTL grew slightly in 2007 due     to increased demand for our regional and interregional services.     This growth rate moderated throughout the year, however, with     year-over-year declines in the second half of 2007. LTL yield     growth was due to higher yields from longer-haul FedEx National     LTL shipments, higher rates and favorable contract renewals.         FedEx Freight segment revenues increased 13% in 2006 due to     growth in LTL yield and average daily LTL shipments. LTL yield     grew during 2006, reflecting incremental fuel surcharges     resulting from higher fuel prices and higher rates. Average     daily LTL shipment growth in 2006 was driven in part by features     such as our no-fee money-back guarantee and our Advance Notice     service, which continue to differentiate us in the LTL market.         The indexed LTL fuel surcharge is based on the average of the     national U.S. on-highway average prices for a gallon of     diesel fuel, as published by the Department of Energy. The     indexed LTL fuel surcharge ranged as follows for the years ended     May 31:                                                         2007           2006           2005               Low                     14.0       %               12.5       %               7.6       %      High                     21.2                   20.1                   14.0          Weighted-average                     17.8                   16.3                   11.0                47    Table of Contents   FedEx     Freight Segment Operating Income         FedEx Freight segment operating income decreased 5% during 2007     due to operating losses at FedEx National LTL, which resulted     from softening volumes and ongoing expenses to integrate its     network. The inclusion of FedEx National LTL in our results has     impacted the year-over-year comparability of all of our     operating expenses. Along with incremental costs from FedEx     National LTL (including amortization of acquired intangible     assets), depreciation expense increased due to prior-year     purchases of vehicles and other operating equipment to support     volume growth. Purchased transportation increased due to higher     rates paid to our third-party transportation providers and the     utilization of third-party providers at FedEx National LTL.     While fuel costs increased in 2007, our fuel surcharge was more     than sufficient to offset the effect of higher fuel costs, based     on a static analysis of the year-over-year changes in fuel     prices compared to changes in the fuel surcharge.         FedEx Freight segment operating income increased in 2006     primarily due to LTL revenue growth, as well as our ability to     control costs in line with volume growth. Increased staffing to     support volume growth and higher incentive compensation expense     increased salaries and employee benefits in 2006. While fuel     costs increased substantially in 2006, fuel surcharges more than     offset the effect of higher fuel costs. Depreciation costs     increased in 2006 primarily due to investments in operating     equipment, which in some cases replaced leased equipment.     Maintenance and repairs decreased in 2006 due to the presence of     rebranding costs in 2005, as well as an increase in the purchase     of new fleet vehicles. Purchased transportation costs decreased,     due to increased utilization of company equipment in our     interregional freight services.     FedEx     Freight Segment Outlook         We expect FedEx Freight segment revenue to increase in 2008 due     to continued growth in our LTL business and the inclusion of     FedEx National LTL for the full year. LTL yield is expected to     increase due to our continued focus on pricing discipline, as     well as the impact of higher yields on longer-haul FedEx     National LTL shipments. Ongoing costs to integrate information     technology systems and to increase sales resources to support     long-term growth opportunities, as well as incremental costs     associated with facility expansions, are expected to restrain     operating income and operating margin growth in 2008. Continued     investments in facilities and equipment to support revenue     growth and in technology to improve productivity and to meet our     customers needs account for the majority of the total     incremental capital spending anticipated for 2008. We expect our     rebranding efforts at FedEx National LTL to continue in 2008.

During     2007, FedEx Kinkos announced a multi-year network     expansion plan, including the model for new centers, which will     be approximately one-third the size of a traditional center and     will include enhanced     pack-and-ship     stations and a doubling of the number of retail office products     offered. While revenues from new centers were not significant in     2007, this multi-year expansion of the FedEx Kinkos     network is a key strategy relating to FedEx Kinkos future     revenue growth. In addition, this expansion will provide FedEx     Express and FedEx Ground customers with more retail access     points. FedEx Kinkos opened 226 new centers during 2007.         In 2006, a year-over-year increase in package acceptance revenue     led to modest revenue growth. Package acceptance revenue     benefited year over year from the April 2005 conversion of FedEx     World Service Centers to FedEx Kinkos Ship Centers. FedEx     Kinkos experienced declines in copy product line revenues     in 2006 due to decreased demand for these services and a     competitive pricing environment.     FedEx     Kinkos Segment Operating Income         Operating income decreased $12 million during 2007     primarily due to the decrease in copy product revenues, as well     as the impact of increased salaries and employee benefit costs     incurred in connection with expansion activities and significant     investments in employee training and development programs.     Rentals decreased during 2007 due to declines in copier rental     expenses, which are variable based on usage. The increase in     intercompany charges was primarily due to increased allocations     of sales and marketing and IT support functions in 2007.         Operating income decreased in 2006, as the increase in package     acceptance revenues was more than offset by a decline in copy     product line revenues. In 2006, salaries and employee benefits     increased due to the addition of FedEx Kinkos Ship     Centers, higher group health insurance costs and increased costs     associated with employee training and development programs.     Increased depreciation in 2006 was driven by center rebranding     and investments in new technology to replace legacy systems. The     increase for 2006 in other operating expenses was primarily due     to increased costs related to technology, strategic and product     offering initiatives.     FedEx     Kinkos Segment Outlook         We expect increased revenue at FedEx Kinkos in 2008     primarily due to the new store openings associated with the     multi-year network expansion, together with a sales force     realignment and marketing and service initiatives. The network     expansion program, combined with employee training and retention     programs, is expected to negatively impact operating income and     operating margin in 2008. These investments, however, are     focused on long-term profit and margin growth. Initiatives in     e-commerce     technology such as Print Online and new service offerings,     including our direct mail service, are expected to support     additional growth opportunities for 2008 and beyond. Capital     spending is expected to increase at FedEx Kinkos in 2008     primarily due to the multi-year network expansion and technology     investments. FedEx Kinkos plans to open approximately 300     new centers in 2008, which will bring the total number of     centers to approximately 2,000 by the end of the year.        49    Table of Contents   FINANCIAL     CONDITION      LIQUIDITY          Cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.569 billion at     May 31, 2007, compared to $1.937 billion at     May 31, 2006 and $1.039 billion at May 31, 2005.

In addition,     other forms of secured financing may be used to obtain capital     assets if we determine that they best suit our needs for the     foreseeable future. We have been successful in obtaining     investment capital, both domestic and international, although     the marketplace for such capital can become restricted depending     on a variety of economic factors. We believe the capital     resources available to us provide flexibility to access the most     efficient markets for financing capital acquisitions, including     aircraft, and are adequate for our future capital needs.     Cash Provided by Operating Activities.  Cash     flows from operating activities decreased $113 million in     2007 primarily due to an increase in income tax payments of     $184 million, partially offset by increased earnings. The     $559 million increase in cash flows from operating     activities in 2006 was principally due to increased earnings.     During 2007, we made tax-deductible voluntary contributions to     our principal U.S. domestic pension plans of     $482 million, compared to $456 million during 2006 and     $460 million during 2005.     Cash Used in Investing Activities.  During     2007, $1.3 billion of cash was used for the FedEx National     LTL, ANC, DTW Group and other immaterial acquisitions. See     Note 3 of the accompanying audited financial statements for     further discussion of these acquisitions. See Capital     Resources for a discussion of capital expenditures during     2007 and 2006.     Financing Activities.  On August 2, 2006,     we filed an updated shelf registration statement with the SEC.     The new registration statement does not limit the amount of any     future offering. By using this shelf registration statement, we     may sell, in one or more future offerings, any combination of     our unsecured debt securities and common stock.        50    Table of Contents       On August 8, 2006, under the new shelf registration     statement, we issued $1 billion of senior unsecured debt,     comprised of floating-rate notes totaling $500 million due     in August 2007 and fixed-rate notes totaling $500 million     due in August 2009. The floating-rate notes bear interest at the     three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)     plus 0.08%, reset on a quarterly basis. As of May 31, 2007,     the floating interest rate was 5.44%. The fixed-rate notes bear     interest at an annual rate of 5.5%, payable semi-annually. The     net proceeds were used for working capital and general corporate     purposes, including the funding of the acquisitions referenced     above.         During 2007, $700 million of senior unsecured notes and     $18 million of medium-term notes matured and were repaid.     During 2006, $250 million of senior unsecured notes matured     and were repaid. In addition, other debt was reduced by     $118 million as a result of the purchase by FedEx Express     of two MD11 aircraft in March 2007. In 2001, FedEx Express     entered into a lease for the two MD11 aircraft from a separate     entity, which we were required to consolidate under FIN 46.     The purchase of these aircraft extinguished this liability.         A $1.0 billion revolving credit facility is available to     finance our operations and other cash flow needs and to provide     support for the issuance of commercial paper. Our revolving     credit agreement contains a financial covenant, which requires     us to maintain a leverage ratio of adjusted debt (long-term     debt, including the current portion of such debt, plus six times     rentals and landing fees) to capital (adjusted debt plus total     common stockholders investment) that does not exceed 0.7.     Our leverage ratio of adjusted debt to capital was 0.6 at     May 31, 2007. We are in compliance with this and all other     restrictive covenants of our revolving credit agreement and do     not expect the covenants to affect our operations. As of     May 31, 2007, no commercial paper was outstanding and the     entire $1.0 billion under the revolving credit facility was     available for future borrowings.         The $500 million of floating rate notes issued in 2007 will     become due in August 2007. The timing of cash requirements in     the first half of 2008 may dictate that we refinance a     portion of this debt through our commercial paper program. As     discussed in Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated     financial statements, we adopted SFAS 158 on May 31,     2007. Our adoption of this standard did not impact our     compliance with any current loan covenants or affect our debt     ratings, pension funding requirements or our overall liquidity.     Dividends.  Dividends paid were     $110 million in 2007, $97 million in 2006 and     $84 million in 2005. On May 25, 2007, our Board of     Directors declared a dividend of $0.10 per share of common     stock, an increase of $0.01 per share. The dividend was paid on     July 2, 2007 to stockholders of record as of the close of     business on June 11, 2007. Each quarterly dividend payment     is subject to review and approval by our Board of Directors, and     we intend to evaluate our dividend payment amount on an annual     basis at the end of each fiscal year.     Other Liquidity Information.  We have a senior     unsecured debt credit rating from Standard &     Poors of BBB and a commercial paper rating of     A-2.     Moodys Investors Service has assigned us a senior     unsecured debt credit rating of Baa2 and a commercial paper     rating of     P-2.     Moodys characterizes our ratings outlook as     stable, while Standard & Poors     characterizes our ratings outlook as positive. If     our credit ratings drop, our interest expense may increase. If     our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels, we may     have difficulty utilizing the commercial paper market. If our     senior unsecured debt ratings drop below investment grade, our     access to financing may become more limited.      CAPITAL     RESOURCES          Our operations are capital intensive, characterized by     significant investments in aircraft, vehicles, technology,     package handling facilities and sort equipment. The amount and     timing of capital additions depend on various factors, including     pre-existing contractual commitments, anticipated volume growth,     domestic and international economic conditions, new or enhanced     services, geographical expansion of services, availability of     satisfactory financing and actions of regulatory authorities.        51    Table of Contents       The following table compares capital expenditures by asset     category and reportable segment for the years ended May 31 (in     millions):                                                                                                                     Percent Change                 2007           2006           2005           2007/2006           2006/2005               Aircraft and related equipment                 $       1,107               $       1,033               $       990                   7                   4          Facilities and sort equipment                     674                   507                   496                   33                   2          Vehicles                     445                   413                   261                   8                   58          Information and technology     investments                     431                   394                   331                   9                   19          Other equipment                     225                   171                   158                   32                   8                                                                                                Total capital expenditures                 $       2,882               $       2,518               $       2,236                   14                   13                                                                                                FedEx Express segment                 $       1,672               $       1,408               $       1,195                   19                   18          FedEx Ground segment                     489                   487                   456                                      7          FedEx Freight segment                     287                   274                   217                   5                   26          FedEx Kinkos segment                     157                   94                   152                   67                   (38       )      Other, principally FedEx Services                     277                   255                   216                   9                   18                                                                                                Total capital expenditures                 $       2,882               $       2,518               $       2,236                   14                   13                                                                                                       Capital expenditures increased during 2007 primarily due to     increased spending at FedEx Express for facility expansion and     aircraft and related equipment and expenditures at FedEx     Kinkos associated with its multi-year expansion program.     Capital expenditures during 2006 were higher than the prior year     primarily due to the purchase of vehicles at FedEx Express and     FedEx Freight and information technology investments at FedEx     Services. In addition, investments were made in the FedEx Ground     and FedEx Freight networks in 2006 to support growth in customer     demand.         While we pursue market opportunities to purchase aircraft when     they become available, we must make commitments regarding our     airlift requirements years before aircraft are actually needed     because of substantial lead times associated with the     manufacture and modification of aircraft. We are closely     managing our capital spending based on current and anticipated     volume levels and will defer or limit capital additions where     economically feasible, while continuing to invest strategically     in growing service lines.         During 2007, FedEx Express announced two aircraft acquisition     programs designed to meet future capacity needs. The first is a     $2.6 billion multi-year program to acquire and modify     approximately 90 Boeing     757-200     aircraft to replace our narrowbody fleet of Boeing     727-200     aircraft. The second is an agreement to acquire 15 new Boeing     777F (B777F) aircraft and an option to purchase an     additional 15 B777F aircraft. The B777F aircraft will provide us     with non-stop, point-to-point transoceanic routes with shorter     flight times. See Note 16 of the accompanying consolidated     financial statements for further discussion of our aircraft     purchase commitments.         Our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately     $3.5 billion in 2008, with much of the year-over-year     increase due to spending for facilities and sort equipment at     FedEx Express and FedEx Ground and network expansion at FedEx     Kinkos. We also continue to invest in     productivity-enhancing technologies. Aircraft-related capital     and expense outlays, including support of the narrowbody     aircraft replacement program and the B777F fleet, are expected     to approximate 2007 aircraft spending levels. We currently     expect to fund our 2008 capital requirements with cash from     operations.      CONTRACTUAL     CASH OBLIGATIONS          The following table sets forth a summary of our contractual cash     obligations as of May 31, 2007. Certain of these     contractual obligations are reflected in our balance sheet,     while others are disclosed as future obligations under     accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.     Except for the current portion of long-term debt and capital     lease obligations, this table does not include amounts already     recorded in our balance        52    Table of Contents       sheet as current liabilities at May 31, 2007. Accordingly,     this table is not meant to represent a forecast of our total     cash expenditures for any of the periods presented.

(2)   See Note 16 to the     accompanying consolidated financial statements.               We have certain contingent liabilities that are not accrued in     our balance sheets in accordance with accounting principles     generally accepted in the United States. These contingent     liabilities are not included in the table above.     Amounts     Reflected in Balance Sheet         We have certain financial instruments representing potential     commitments, not reflected in the table above, that were     incurred in the normal course of business to support our     operations, including surety bonds and standby letters of     credit. These instruments are generally required under certain     U.S. self-insurance programs and are also used in the     normal course of international operations. The underlying     liabilities insured by these instruments are reflected in our     balance sheets, where applicable. Therefore, no additional     liability is reflected for the surety bonds and letters of     credit themselves.         We have other long-term liabilities reflected in our balance     sheet, including deferred income taxes, qualified and     non-qualified pension and postretirement healthcare liabilities     and other self-insurance accruals. The payment obligations     associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the table     above due to the absence of scheduled maturities. Therefore, the     timing of these payments cannot be determined, except for     amounts estimated to be payable within twelve months that are     included in current liabilities.     Other     Cash Obligations Not Reflected in Balance Sheet         The amounts reflected in the table above for purchase     commitments represent non-cancelable agreements to purchase     goods or services. Such contracts include those for certain     purchases of aircraft, aircraft modifications, vehicles,     facilities, computers, printing and other equipment and     advertising and promotions contracts. In addition, we have     committed to modify our DC10 aircraft for two-man cockpit     configurations, which is reflected in the table above.     Commitments to purchase aircraft in passenger configuration do     not include the attendant costs to modify these aircraft for     cargo transport unless we have entered into a     non-cancelable     commitment. Open purchase orders that are cancelable are not     considered unconditional purchase obligations for financial     reporting purposes and are not included in the table above. Such     purchase orders often represent authorizations to purchase     rather than binding agreements.         The amounts reflected in the table above for interest on     long-term debt represent future interest payments due on our     long-term debt, which are primarily fixed rate.        53    Table of Contents       The amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases     represent future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable     operating leases (principally aircraft and facilities) with an     initial or remaining term in excess of one year at May 31,     2007. In the past, we financed a significant portion of our     aircraft needs (and certain other equipment needs) using     operating leases (a type of off-balance sheet     financing). At the time that the decision to lease was     made, we determined that these operating leases would provide     economic benefits favorable to ownership with respect to market     values, liquidity or after-tax cash flows.         In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in     the United States, our operating leases are not recorded in our     balance sheet. Credit rating agencies routinely use information     concerning minimum lease payments required for our operating     leases to calculate our debt capacity. In addition, we have     guarantees under certain operating leases, amounting to     $17 million as of May 31, 2007, for the residual     values of vehicles and facilities at the end of the respective     operating lease periods. Although some of these leased assets     may have a residual value at the end of the lease term that is     less than the value specified in the related operating lease     agreement, we do not believe it is probable that we will be     required to fund material amounts under the terms of these     guarantee arrangements. Accordingly, no material accruals have     been recognized for these guarantees.      CRITICAL     ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES          The preparation of financial statements in accordance with     accounting principles generally accepted in the United States     requires management to make significant judgments and estimates     to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial     statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or     estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough     process to review the application of our accounting policies and     to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are     required to prepare the financial statements of a complex,     global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances,     estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing     circumstances and new or better information.         The estimates discussed below include the financial statement     elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the     selection or application of alternative accounting policies and     are material to our financial statements. Management has     discussed the development and selection of these critical     accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of     Directors and with our independent registered public accounting     firm.         As discussed in the notes to our financial statements and     previously in this MD&A, we are required to adopt new     accounting rules for income taxes under FIN 48, commencing     in 2008. While the adoption of FIN 48 will not have a     material effect on our financial statements, its application     substantially increases the sensitivities of the estimation     process used in the accounting and reporting for tax     contingencies. Therefore, we will add a Contingencies,     including Income Taxes category to our critical     accounting estimates in the first quarter of 2008.         Over the past several years, we have substantially improved and     automated the rating and billing processes for our package     businesses. As a result, our experience with invoice corrections     and bad debts has improved markedly, as has the accuracy of our     revenue estimates for shipments not yet billed at period end.     Therefore, substantially less judgment is required in the     reporting of revenue and we have concluded that revenue     recognition will no longer be considered a critical accounting     estimate commencing in 2008.      RETIREMENT     PLANS      Overview.  We sponsor programs that provide     retirement benefits to most of our employees. These programs     include defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution     plans and retiree healthcare plans. The accounting for pension     and healthcare plans includes numerous assumptions, such as:     discount rates; expected long-term investment returns on plan     assets; future salary increases; employee turnover; mortality;     and retirement ages. These assumptions most significantly impact     our U.S. domestic pension plan.        54    Table of Contents       A summary of our retirement plans costs over the past three     years is as follows (in millions):                                                         2007           2006           2005               U.S. domestic pension plans                 $       442               $       400               $       337          International pension and defined     contribution plans                     49                   45                   41          U.S. domestic defined contribution     plans                     152                   147                   136          Retiree healthcare plans                     55                   73                   68                                                                           $       698               $       665               $       582                                                                       The determination of our annual retirement plans cost is highly     sensitive to changes in the assumptions discussed above because     we have a large active workforce, a significant amount of assets     in the pension plans, and the payout of benefits will occur over     an extended period in the future. Total retirement plans cost     increased approximately $33 million in 2007,     $83 million in 2006 and $37 million in 2005, primarily     due to changes to these assumptions.         In February 2007, we announced changes to modernize certain of     our retirement programs over the next two fiscal years.     Effective January 1, 2008, we will increase the annual     company matching contribution under the largest of our 401(k)     plans covering most employees from $500 to a maximum of 3.5% of     eligible compensation. Employees not participating in the 401(k)     plan as of January 1, 2008 will be automatically enrolled     at 3% of eligible pay with a company match of 2% of eligible     pay. Effective May 31, 2008, benefits previously accrued     under our primary pension plans using a traditional pension     benefit formula will be capped for most employees, and those     benefits will be payable beginning at retirement. Beginning     June 1, 2008, future pension benefits for most employees     will be accrued under a cash balance formula we call the     Portable Pension Account. These changes will not affect the     benefits of current retirees.         Under the Portable Pension Account, the retirement benefit is     expressed as a dollar amount in a notional account that grows     with annual credits based on pay, age and years of credited     service and interest on the notional account balance. An     employees pay credits are determined each year under a     graded formula that combines age with years of service for     points. The plan interest credit rate will vary from year to     year based on the selected U.S. Treasury index, with a     minimum rate of 4% or the one-year Treasury Constant Maturities     rate and a maximum rate based on the average     30-year     Treasury rate.         Under the new programs, we expect the long-term costs and     funding for our retirement plans will approximate those under     the current design. However, we expect that the costs of our     retirement plans will become more predictable, as we reduce     highly volatile pension costs in favor of more predictable     401(k) costs associated with our matching contributions. These     retirement plan changes were contemplated in our     February 28, 2007 actuarial measurement and reduced the     impact on shareholders equity of adopting SFAS 158 by     $1 billion. Because it will take several years to fully     implement the increases to our 401(k) plan contributions, we     will realize a net retirement plans cost reduction in the near     term from these changes.         Retirement plans cost in 2008 is expected to be approximately     $615 million, a decrease of $83 million from 2007.     This expected decrease in cost is due to the retirement plan     design changes described above, which will be partially offset     by changes in assumptions related to plan asset rate of return,     mortality, benefit age for deferred vested participants and     pilot-specific benefit formula and salary increases. Retirement     plans cost is included in the Salaries and Employee     Benefits caption in our consolidated income statements.         As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net     funded status volatility, we are also in the process of     re-evaluating our pension investment strategy. We have decided     to move certain equity investments out of actively managed funds     and into index funds. Also, we are currently evaluating the mix     of investments between equities and fixed income securities,     whose cash flows will more closely align with the cash flows of     our pension obligations. Based on these considerations, we have     reduced our estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets     from 9.1% to 8.5% for 2008.        55    Table of Contents   Pension Cost.  Of all of our retirement plans,     our largest qualified U.S. domestic pension plan is the     most significant and subjective. The components of pension cost     for all pension plans recognized in our income statements are as     follows (in millions):                                                         2007           2006           2005               Service cost                 $       540               $       473               $       417          Interest cost                     707                   642                   579          Expected return on plan assets                     (930       )               (811       )               (707       )      Recognized actuarial losses and     other                     150                   121                   72                                                                           $       467               $       425               $       361                                                                       Following is a discussion of the key estimates we consider in     determining our pension costs:     Discount Rate.  This is the interest rate used     to discount the estimated future benefit payments that have been     accrued to date (the projected benefit obligation, or PBO) to     their net present value. The discount rate is determined each     year at the plan measurement date (February 28) and affects     the succeeding years pension cost. A decrease in the     discount rate increases pension expense.         This assumption is highly sensitive, as the following table     illustrates:                                                         Discount            Sensitivity (in     millions)(2)                 Rate(1)           Expense           PBO               2008                     n/a               $       2.1                   n/a          2007                     6.012       %               2.5               $       19          2006                     5.912       %               2.1                   21          2005                     6.285       %               1.8                   16                       (1)   The discount rate in effect at the     end of a given fiscal year affects the current years     projected benefit obligation (PBO) and the succeeding     years pension expense.           (2)   Sensitivities show the impact on     expense and the PBO of a one-basis-point change in the discount     rate.               We determine the discount rate (which is required to be the rate     at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively     settled as of the measurement date) with the assistance of     actuaries, who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of     high-grade corporate bonds (rated Aa or better) with cash flows     that generally match our expected benefit payments in future     years. This bond modeling technique allows for the use of     non-callable and make-whole bonds that meet certain screening     criteria to ensure that the selected bonds with a call feature     have a low probability of being called. To the extent scheduled     bond proceeds exceed the estimated benefit payments in a given     period, the yield calculation assumes those excess proceeds are     reinvested at the one-year forward rates implied by the     Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. The trend of declines in the     discount rate negatively affected our primary domestic pension     plan expense by $89 million in 2007, $101 million in     2006 and $32 million in 2005. Pension costs will be     favorably affected in 2008 by approximately $27 million due     to the slight increase in the discount rate.     Plan Assets.  Pension plan assets are invested     primarily in listed securities. Our pension plans hold only a     minimal investment in FedEx common stock that is entirely at the     discretion of third-party pension fund investment managers. The     estimated average rate of return on plan assets is a long-term,     forward-looking assumption that also materially affects our     pension cost. It is required to be the expected future long-term     rate of earnings on plan assets. At February 28, 2007, with     approximately $11.3 billion of plan assets, a     one-basis-point change in this assumption for our domestic     pension plans affects pension cost by approximately     $1.1 million. We have assumed an 8.5% compound geometric     long-term rate of return on our principal U.S. domestic     pension plan assets for 2008, down from 9.1% in 2007, as     discussed above.        56    Table of Contents       Establishing the expected future rate of investment return on     our pension assets is a judgmental matter. Management considers     the following factors in determining this assumption:                     the duration of our pension plan liabilities, which drives the     investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan assets;                 the types of investment classes in which we invest our pension     plan assets and the expected compound geometric return we can     reasonably expect those investment classes to earn over the next     10- to     15-year time     period (or such other time period that may be     appropriate); and                 the investment returns we can reasonably expect our active     investment management program to achieve in excess of the     returns we could expect if investments were made strictly in     indexed funds.           As noted above, we have refined our investment strategy and     lowered the long-term rate of return for 2008. To support our     conclusions, we periodically commission asset/liability studies     performed by third-party professional investment advisors and     actuaries to assist us in our reviews. These studies project our     estimated future pension payments and evaluate the efficiency of     the allocation of our pension plan assets into various     investment categories. These studies also generate     probability-adjusted expected future returns on those assets.     The following table summarizes our current asset allocation     strategy:                                                                     Percent of Plan Assets at Measurement Date                 2007           2006          Asset Class        Actual           Target           Actual           Target               Domestic equities                     52       %               53       %               54       %               53       %      International equities                     21                   17                   20                   17          Private equities                     3                   5                   3                   5                                                                                Total equities                     76                   75                   77                   75          Long duration fixed income     securities                     15                   15                   14                   15          Other fixed income securities                     9                   10                   9                   10                                                                                               100       %               100       %               100       %               100       %                                                                                   The actual historical return on our U.S. pension plan     assets, calculated on a compound geometric basis, was 9.8%, net     of investment manager fees, for the     15-year     period ended February 28, 2007. In addition, our actual     return on plan assets exceeded the estimated return in each of     the past four fiscal years.         Pension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used     to determine the value of plan assets at the measurement date.     We use a calculated-value method to determine the value of plan     assets, which helps mitigate short-term volatility in market     performance (both increases and decreases). Another method used     in practice applies the market value of plan assets at the     measurement date. The application of the calculated-value method     equaled the result from applying the market-value method for     2005 through 2007.     Salary Increases.  The assumed future increase     in salaries and wages is also a key estimate in determining     pension cost. Generally, we correlate changes in estimated     future salary increases to changes in the discount rate (since     that is an indicator of general inflation and cost of living     adjustments) and general estimated levels of profitability     (since most incentive compensation is a component of pensionable     wages). Our average future salary increases based on age and     years of service were 3.46% for 2007 and 3.15% for 2006 and     2005. Future salary increases are estimated to be 4.47% for our     2008 pension costs, reflecting the impact of the modernization     of our retirement plans (discussed above). In the future, a     one-basis-point     across-the-board     change in the rate of estimated future salary increases will     have an immaterial impact on our pension costs.        57    Table of Contents       Following is information concerning the funded status of our     pension plans as of May 31 (in millions):                                             2007(1)           2006               Funded Status of     Plans:                                            Projected benefit obligation (PBO)                 $       12,209               $       12,153          Fair value of plan assets                     11,506                   10,130                                                PBO in excess of plan assets                     (703       )               (2,023       )      Unrecognized actuarial losses and     other                     22   (2)               3,119   (3)                                            Net amount recognized                 $       (681       )           $       1,096                                                Components of Amounts Included     in Balance Sheets:                                       Prepaid pension cost                 $          (4)           $       1,349          Noncurrent pension assets                     1                             Current pension, postretirement     healthcare and other benefit obligations                     (24       )                         Accrued pension liability                        (4)               (253       )      Minimum pension liability                        (4)               (122       )      Noncurrent pension, postretirement     healthcare and other benefit obligations                     (658       )                         Accumulated other comprehensive     income                        (4)               112          Intangible asset and other                        (4)               10                                                Net amount recognized                 $       (681       )           $       1,096                                                Cash     Amounts:                                            Cash contributions during the year                 $       524               $       492          Benefit payments during the year                 $       261               $       228                       (1)   Incorporates the provisions of     SFAS 158 adopted on May 31, 2007.           (2)   Amounts for 2007 represent only     employer contributions after measurement date, as unrecognized     net actuarial loss, unamortized prior service cost and     unrecognized net transition amount were not applicable in 2007     due to adoption of SFAS 158.           (3)   Amounts for 2006 consist of     unrecognized net actuarial loss, unamortized prior service cost,     unrecognized net transition amount and employer contributions     after measurement date.           (4)   Not applicable for 2007 due to     adoption of SFAS 158.               The funded status of the plans reflects a snapshot of the state     of our long-term pension liabilities at the plan measurement     date. Our plans remain adequately funded to provide benefits to     our employees as they come due and current benefit payments are     nominal compared to our total plan assets (benefit payments for     2007 were approximately 2% of plan assets). As described     previously in this MD&A, the adoption of SFAS 158     resulted in a $982 million charge to shareholders     equity in accumulated other comprehensive income from the     elimination of our prepaid pension asset of $1.4 billion     and an increase in other postretirement benefit liabilities of     $120 million, net of tax. Under SFAS 158 we are     required to recognize the funded status of the PBO and cannot     defer actuarial gains and losses even though such items continue     to be deferred for the determination of pension expense.         We made tax-deductible voluntary contributions of     $482 million in 2007 and $456 million in 2006 to our     qualified U.S. domestic pension plans. We expect     approximately $10 million of contributions to such plans to     be legally required in 2008, and we currently expect to make     tax-deductible voluntary contributions to our qualified plans in     2008 at levels approximating those in 2007.         Cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses for pension plans     expense determination were approximately $3.3 billion     through February 28, 2007, compared to $3.0 billion at     February 28, 2006. These unrecognized losses primarily     reflect the declining discount rate from 2002 through 2006 and     other changes in assumptions. A portion is also attributable to     the differences between expected and actual asset returns, which     are being        58    Table of Contents       amortized over future periods. These unrecognized losses may be     recovered in future periods through actuarial gains. However,     unless they are below a corridor amount, these unrecognized     actuarial losses are required to be amortized and recognized in     future periods. For example, projected U.S. domestic plan     pension expense for 2008 includes $162 million of     amortization of these actuarial losses versus $136 million     in 2007, $107 million in 2006 and $60 million in 2005.      SELF-INSURANCE     ACCRUALS          We are self-insured up to certain limits for costs associated     with workers compensation claims, vehicle accidents and     general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee     healthcare and long-term disability programs. At May 31,     2007 there were approximately $1.3 billion of     self-insurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet     ($1.2 billion at May 31, 2006). In 2007 approximately     41% of these accruals were classified as current liabilities and     in 2006 approximately 43% of self-insurance accruals were     classified as current liabilities.         The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of     historical cost experience, judgments about the present and     expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels. We     account for these costs primarily through actuarial methods,     which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims     incurred, including those claims incurred but not reported, on a     quarterly basis for material accruals. These methods provide     estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims     incurred as of the balance sheet date. We self-insure up to     certain limits that vary by operating company and type of risk.     Periodically, we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and     adjust insurance levels based on risk tolerance and premium     expense. Historically, it has been infrequent that incurred     claims exceeded our self-insured limits. Other acceptable     methods of accounting for these accruals include measurement of     claims outstanding and projected payments based on historical     development factors.         We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these     liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure     these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any     estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given     the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until     the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations     for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative     basis. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, accident     frequency and severity, insurance retention levels and other     factors can materially affect the estimates for these     liabilities.      LONG-LIVED     ASSETS      Property and Equipment.  Our key businesses are     capital intensive, with more than 53% of our total assets     invested in our transportation and information systems     infrastructures. We capitalize only those costs that meet the     definition of capital assets under accounting standards.     Accordingly, repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the     useful life of an asset or are not part of the cost of acquiring     the asset are expensed as incurred. However, consistent with     industry practice, we capitalize certain aircraft-related major     maintenance costs on one of our aircraft fleet types and     amortize these costs over their estimated service lives.         The depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over     their estimated useful lives, and the determination of any     salvage values, requires management to make judgments about     future events. Because we utilize many of our capital assets     over relatively long periods (the majority of aircraft costs are     depreciated over 15 to 18 years), we periodically evaluate     whether adjustments to our estimated service lives or salvage     values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly match     the economic use of the asset. This evaluation may result in     changes in the estimated lives and residual values used to     depreciate our aircraft and other equipment. These estimates     affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period     and, ultimately, the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset.     Historically, gains and losses on operating equipment have not     been material (typically less than $15 million annually).     However, such amounts may differ materially in the future due to     technological obsolescence, accident frequency, regulatory     changes and other factors beyond our control.         Because of the lengthy lead times for aircraft manufacture and     modifications, we must anticipate volume levels and plan our     fleet requirements years in advance, and make commitments for     aircraft based on those projections. These activities create     risks that asset capacity may exceed demand and that an     impairment of our        59    Table of Contents       assets may occur. In addition, aircraft purchases (primarily     aircraft in passenger configuration) that have not been placed     in service totaled $71 million at May 31, 2007 and     $208 million at May 31, 2006. We plan to modify these     assets in the future to place them into operation.         The accounting test for whether an asset held for use is     impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the     asset with its estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the     cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, the asset must be     adjusted to its current fair value. Because the cash flows of     our transportation networks cannot be identified to individual     assets, and based on the ongoing profitability of our     operations, we have not experienced any significant impairment     of assets to be held and used. However, from time to time we     make decisions to remove certain long-lived assets from service     based on projections of reduced capacity needs and those     decisions may result in an impairment charge. Assets held for     disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair values when     the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other     criteria are met. There were no material asset impairment     charges recognized in 2007, 2006 or 2005.     Leases.  We utilize operating leases to finance     certain of our aircraft, facilities and equipment. Such     arrangements typically shift the risk of loss on the residual     value of the assets at the end of the lease period to the     lessor. As disclosed in Contractual Cash Obligations     and Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial     statements, at May 31, 2007 we had approximately     $13 billion (on an undiscounted basis) of future     commitments for payments under operating leases. The     weighted-average remaining lease term of all operating leases     outstanding at May 31, 2007 was approximately seven years.         The future commitments for operating leases are not reflected as     a liability in our balance sheet because these leases do not     meet the accounting definition of capital leases. The     determination of whether a lease is accounted for as a capital     lease or an operating lease requires management to make     estimates primarily about the fair value of the asset and its     estimated economic useful life. We believe we have well-defined     and controlled processes for making this evaluation, including     obtaining third-party appraisals for material transactions to     assist us in making these evaluations.     Goodwill.  We have approximately     $3.5 billion of goodwill in our balance sheet resulting     from business acquisitions. Our business acquisitions in 2007     contributed approximately $670 million in goodwill, as     follows:                                               Goodwill           Segment         Acquisition        (in millions)               FedEx Express             DTW Group                $       348          FedEx Express             ANC                    168          FedEx Freight             FedEx National LTL                    121          FedEx Express             Other                    33                                                           $       670                                               The annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires the use of     estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of our     reporting units using a discounted cash flow methodology, such     as: revenue growth rates; operating margins; discount rates and     expected capital expenditures. Estimates used by management can     significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test. Each     year, independent of our goodwill impairment test, we update our     weighted-average cost of capital calculation and perform a     long-range planning analysis to project expected results of     operations. Using this data, we complete a separate fair-value     analysis for each of our reporting units. Changes in forecasted     operations and other assumptions could materially affect these     estimates. We compare the fair value of our reporting units to     the carrying value, including goodwill, of each of those units.     We performed our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter     of 2007. Because the fair value of each of our reporting units     exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill, no additional     testing or impairment charge was necessary.     Intangible Asset with an Indefinite Life.  We     have an intangible asset of $567 million associated with     the Kinkos trade name. This intangible asset is not     amortized because it has an indefinite remaining useful life. We     must review this asset for impairment on at least an annual     basis. This annual evaluation requires the use of estimates     about the future cash flows attributable to the Kinkos     trade name to determine the estimated fair        60    Table of Contents       value of the trade name. Changes in forecasted operations and     changes in discount rates can materially affect this estimate.     However, once an impairment of this intangible asset has been     recorded, it cannot be reversed. We performed our annual     impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2007. Because the fair     value of the trade name exceeded its carrying value, no     impairment charge was necessary.         While FedEx Kinkos experienced a slight revenue decline in     2007 and decreased profitability in 2007 and 2006, we believe     that our long-term growth and expansion strategies support our     fair value conclusions. For both goodwill and recorded     intangible assets at FedEx Kinkos, the recoverability of     these amounts is dependent on execution of key initiatives     related to revenue growth, location expansion and improved     profitability.      REVENUE     RECOGNITION          Historically, the policies adopted to recognize revenue have     been deemed critical because an understanding of the accounting     applied in this area is fundamental to assessing our overall     financial performance and because revenue and revenue growth are     key measures of financial performance in the marketplace.     Revenue recognition will no longer be considered a critical     accounting estimate category for 2008 due to the improvements we     have made in our rating and billing processes, which have     significantly reduced the level of management judgment applied     in these areas.         Our businesses are primarily involved in the direct pickup and     delivery of commercial package and freight shipments, as well as     providing document solutions and business services. Our     employees, independent contractors and agents are involved     throughout the process and our operational, billing and     accounting systems directly capture and control all relevant     information necessary to record revenue, bill customers and     collect amounts due to us. Certain of our transportation     services are provided through independent contractors. FedEx is     the principal to the transaction in most instances and in these     cases revenue from these transactions is recognized on a gross     basis. Costs associated with independent contractor settlements     are recognized as incurred and included in the purchased     transportation caption in the accompanying income statements.         We recognize revenue upon delivery of shipments for our     transportation businesses and upon completion of services for     our business services, logistics and trade services businesses.     Transportation industry practice includes four acceptable     methods for revenue recognition for shipments in process at the     end of an accounting period, two of which are predominant:     (1) recognize all revenue and the related delivery costs     when shipments are delivered or (2) recognize a portion of     the revenue earned for shipments that have been picked up but     not yet delivered at period end and accrue delivery costs as     incurred. We use the second method and recognize the portion of     revenue earned at the balance sheet date for shipments in     transit and accrue all delivery costs as incurred. We believe     this accounting policy effectively and consistently matches     revenue with expenses and recognizes liabilities as incurred.         Our contract logistics, global trade services and certain     transportation businesses engage in some transactions wherein     they act as agents. Revenue from these transactions is recorded     on a net basis. Net revenue includes billings to customers less     third-party charges, including transportation or handling costs,     fees, commissions, taxes and duties. These amounts are not     material.         There are three key estimates that are included in the     recognition and measurement of our revenue and related accounts     receivable under the policies described above:     (1) estimates for unbilled revenue on shipments that have     been delivered; (2) estimates for revenue associated with     shipments in transit; and (3) estimates for future     adjustments to revenue or accounts receivable for billing     adjustments and bad debts.     Unbilled Revenue.  There is a time lag between     the completion of a shipment and the generation of an invoice     that varies by customer and operating company. Accordingly,     unbilled revenue is recognized through estimates using actual     shipment volumes and historical trends of shipment size and     length of haul. These estimates are adjusted in subsequent     months to the actual amounts invoiced. Due to strong system     controls and shipment visibility, there is a low level of     subjectivity inherent in these accrual processes and the     estimates have historically not varied significantly from actual     amounts subsequently invoiced.        61    Table of Contents   Shipments in Process.  Because the majority of     our shipments have short cycle times, less than 5% of a total     months revenue is typically in transit at the end of a     period. We periodically perform studies to measure the     percentage of completion for shipments in process. At month end,     we estimate the amount of revenue earned on shipments in process     based on actual shipments picked up, the scheduled day of     delivery, the day of the week on which the month ends (which     affects the percentage of completion) and current trends in our     average price for the respective services. We believe these     estimates provide a reasonable approximation of the actual     revenue earned at the end of a period.     Future Adjustments to Revenue and Accounts     Receivable.  In the transportation industry,     pricing that is put in place may be subsequently adjusted due to     continued negotiation of contract terms, earned discounts     triggered by certain shipment volume thresholds,     and/or     no-fee money-back guarantee refunds caused by on-time service     failures. We account for estimated future revenue adjustments     through a reserve against accounts receivable that takes into     consideration historical experience and current trends. For     2007, 2006 and 2005, revenue adjustments as a percentage of     total revenue averaged approximately 1%. Due to our reliable     on-time service, close communication with customers, strong     revenue systems and minimal volume discounts in place, we have     maintained a consistently low revenue adjustment percentage. A     one-basis-point change in the revenue adjustment percentage     would increase or decrease revenue adjustments by approximately     $2 million. While write-offs related to bad debts do occur     from time to time, they are small compared to our total revenue     and accounts receivable balances due to the small value of     individual shipping transactions spread over a large customer     base, our short credit terms and our strong credit and     collection practices. Bad debt expense associated with credit     losses has averaged approximately 0.3% in 2007, 0.4% in 2006 and     0.3% in 2005 of total revenue and reflects our strong credit     management processes.      RISK     FACTORS          Our financial and operating results are subject to many risks     and uncertainties, as described below.     Our businesses depend on our strong reputation and the     value of the FedEx brand.  The FedEx brand     name symbolizes high-quality service, reliability and speed.     FedEx is one of the most widely recognized, trusted and     respected brands in the world, and the FedEx brand is one of our     most important and valuable assets. In addition, we have a     strong reputation among customers and the general public for     high standards of social and environmental responsibility and     corporate governance and ethics. The FedEx brand name and our     corporate reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools, and     we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting     them. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to     activities by our employees, contractors or agents could tarnish     our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Damage to our     reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our     services and thus have an adverse effect on our financial     condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as     require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and     restore the value of our brand.     We rely heavily on technology to operate our     transportation and business networks, and any disruption to our     technology infrastructure or the Internet could harm our     operations and our reputation among     customers.  Our ability to attract and retain     customers and to compete effectively depends in part upon the     sophistication and reliability of our technology network,     including our ability to provide features of service that are     important to our customers. Any disruption to the Internet or     our technology infrastructure, including those impacting our     computer systems and Web site, could adversely impact our     customer service and our volumes and revenues and result in     increased costs. While we have invested and continue to invest     in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans,     these measures cannot fully insulate us from technology     disruptions and the resulting adverse effect on our operations     and financial results.     Our businesses are capital intensive, and we must make     capital expenditures based upon projected volume     levels.  We make significant investments in     aircraft, vehicles, technology, package handling facilities,     sort equipment, copy equipment and other capital to support our     transportation and business networks. We also make significant     investments to rebrand, integrate and grow the companies that we     acquire. The amount and timing of capital investments depend on     various factors, including our anticipated volume growth. For     example, we must make commitments to purchase or modify aircraft     years before the aircraft are actually        62    Table of Contents       needed. We must predict volume levels and fleet requirements and     make commitments for aircraft based on those projections. If we     miss our projections, we could end up with too much or too     little capacity relative to our shipping volumes.     We face intense competition.  The     transportation and business services markets are both highly     competitive and sensitive to price and service. Some of our     competitors have more financial resources than we do, or they     are controlled or subsidized by foreign governments, which     enables them to raise capital more easily. We believe we compete     effectively with these companies  for example, by     providing more reliable service at compensatory prices. However,     our competitors determine the charges for their services. If the     pricing environment becomes irrational, it could limit our     ability to maintain or increase our prices (including our fuel     surcharges in response to rising fuel costs) or to maintain or     grow our market share. In addition, maintaining a broad     portfolio of services is important to keeping and attracting     customers. While we believe we compete effectively through our     current service offerings, if our competitors offer a broader     range of services or more effectively bundle their services, it     could impede our ability to maintain or grow our market share.     If we do not effectively operate, integrate, leverage and     grow acquired businesses, our financial results and reputation     may suffer.  Our strategy for long-term     growth, productivity and profitability depends in part on our     ability to make prudent strategic acquisitions and to realize     the benefits we expect when we make those acquisitions. In     furtherance of this strategy, during 2007 we acquired the LTL     freight operations of Watkins Motor Lines (renamed FedEx     National LTL) and made strategic acquisitions in China, the     United Kingdom and India. While we expect these acquisitions to     enhance our value proposition to customers and improve our     long-term profitability, there can be no assurance that we will     realize our expectations within the time frame we have     established, if at all. We acquired FedEx Kinkos in     February 2004 to expand our portfolio of business services and     enhance our ability to provide package-shipping services to     small- and medium-sized business customers through its network     of retail locations. However, FedEx Kinkos financial     performance has not yet met our expectations. Accordingly, we     have undertaken key initiatives at FedEx Kinkos relating     to revenue growth, network expansion and improved profitability.     There can be no assurance that our acquisitions will be     successful or that we can continue to support the value we     allocate to these acquired businesses, including their goodwill     or other intangible assets.     Our transportation businesses may be impacted by the price     and availability of fuel.  We must purchase     large quantities of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicles,     and the price and availability of fuel can be unpredictable and     beyond our control. To date, we have been successful in     mitigating the impact of higher fuel costs through our indexed     fuel surcharges, as the amount of the surcharges is closely     linked to the market prices for fuel. If we are unable to     maintain or increase our fuel surcharges because of competitive     pricing pressures or some other reason, fuel costs could     adversely impact our operating results. In addition, disruptions     in the supply of fuel could have a negative impact on our     ability to operate our transportation networks.     FedEx Ground relies on owner-operators to conduct its     operations, and the status of these     owner-operators     as independent contractors, rather than employees, is being     challenged.  FedEx Grounds use of     independent contractors is well suited to the needs of the     ground delivery business and its customers. We are involved in     numerous purported     class-action     lawsuits and other proceedings, however, that claim that these     owner-operators should be treated as employees and not     independent contractors. We expect to incur certain costs,     including legal fees, in defending the status of FedEx     Grounds owner-operators as independent contractors. We     strongly believe that the owner-operators are properly     classified as independent contractors and that we will prevail     in our defense. However, adverse determinations in these matters     could, among other things, entitle some of our contractors to     the reimbursement of certain expenses and to the benefit of     wage-and-hour     laws and result in employment and withholding tax liability for     FedEx Ground. Moreover, if FedEx Ground is compelled to convert     its independent contractors to employees, our operating costs     could increase and we could incur significant capital outlays.     Increased security requirements could impose substantial     costs on us, especially at FedEx Express.  As     a result of concerns about global terrorism and homeland     security, governments around the world are adopting or are     considering adopting stricter security requirements that will     increase operating costs for businesses, including those in the     transportation industry. For example, in May 2006, the     U.S. Transportation Security        63    Table of Contents       Administration (TSA) adopted new rules enhancing     many of the security requirements for air cargo on both     passenger and all-cargo aircraft, and in May 2007, the TSA     issued a revised model all-cargo aircraft security program for     implementing the new rules. Together with other all-cargo     aircraft operators, we have filed comments with the TSA     requesting clarification regarding several provisions in the     revised model program. Until the requirements for our security     program under the new rules are finalized, we cannot determine     the effect that these new rules will have on our cost structure     or our operating results. It is reasonably possible, however,     that these rules or other future security requirements for air     cargo carriers could impose material costs on us.     The regulatory environment for global aviation rights may     impact our air operations.  Our extensive air     network is critical to our success. Our right to serve foreign     points is subject to the approval of the Department of     Transportation and generally requires a bilateral agreement     between the United States and foreign governments. In addition,     we must obtain the permission of foreign governments to provide     specific flights and services. Regulatory actions affecting     global aviation rights or a failure to obtain or maintain     aviation rights in important international markets could impair     our ability to operate our air network.     We are also subject to risks and uncertainties that affect     many other businesses, including:                     the impact of any international conflicts or terrorist     activities on the United States and global economies in general,     the transportation industry or us in particular, and what     effects these events will have on our costs or the demand for     our services;                 any impacts on our businesses resulting from new domestic or     international government laws and regulation, including tax,     accounting, labor or environmental rules;                 our ability to manage our cost structure for capital     expenditures and operating expenses and match them to shifting     customer volume levels;                 changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially in the     euro, Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar, Great Britain pound and     Japanese yen, which can affect our sales levels and foreign     currency sales prices;                 our ability to maintain good relationships with our employees     and prevent attempts by labor organizations to organize groups     of our employees, which could significantly increase our     operating costs;                 a shortage of qualified labor and our ability to mitigate this     shortage through recruiting and retention efforts and     productivity gains;                 increasing costs for employee benefits, especially pension and     healthcare benefits;                 significant changes in the volumes of shipments transported     through our networks, customer demand for our various services     or the prices we obtain for our services;                 market acceptance of our new service and growth initiatives;                 any liability resulting from and the costs of defending against     class-action     litigation, such as     wage-and-hour     claims, and any other legal proceedings;                 the impact of technology developments on our operations and on     demand for our services (for example, the impact that low-cost     home copiers and printers are having on demand for FedEx     Kinkos copy services);                 adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, such as     earthquakes and hurricanes, which can damage our property,     disrupt our operations, increase fuel costs and adversely affect     shipment levels;                 widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable     disease, or any other public health crisis; and                 availability of financing on terms acceptable to us and our     ability to maintain our current credit ratings, especially given     the capital intensity of our operations.       We are directly affected by the state of the     economy.  While the global, or macro-economic,     risks listed above apply to most companies, we are particularly     vulnerable. The transportation industry is highly cyclical and     especially susceptible to trends in economic activity. Our     primary business is to transport goods, so our        64    Table of Contents       business levels are directly tied to the purchase and production     of goods  key macro-economic measurements. When     individuals and companies purchase and produce fewer goods, we     transport fewer goods. In addition, we have a relatively high     fixed-cost structure, which is difficult to adjust to match     shifting volume levels. Moreover, as we grow our international     business, we are increasingly affected by the health of the     global economy.

Our     internal control over financial reporting includes, among other     things, defined policies and procedures for conducting and     governing our business, sophisticated information systems for     processing transactions and a properly staffed, professional     internal audit department. Mechanisms are in place to monitor     the effectiveness of our internal control over financial     reporting and actions are taken to correct deficiencies     identified. Our procedures for financial reporting include the     active involvement of senior management, our Audit Committee and     our staff of highly qualified financial and legal professionals.         Management, with the participation of our principal executive     and financial officers, assessed our internal control over     financial reporting as of May 31, 2007, the end of our     fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria     established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework     issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the     Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).         Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our     internal control over financial reporting was effective as of     May 31, 2007.         Our independent registered public accounting firm,     Ernst & Young LLP, audited managements     assessment and the effectiveness of our internal control over     financial reporting. Ernst & Young LLP has issued     their report concurring with managements assessment, which     is included in this Annual Report on     Form 10-K.        66    Table of Contents      REPORT OF     INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM          The Board of Directors and Stockholders      FedEx Corporation         We have audited managements assessment, included in the     accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over     Financial Reporting, that FedEx Corporation maintained effective     internal control over financial reporting as of May 31,     2007, based on criteria established in Internal     Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee     of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO     criteria). FedEx Corporations management is responsible     for maintaining effective internal control over financial     reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of     internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is     to express an opinion on managements assessment and an     opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal     control over financial reporting based on our audit.         We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the     Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those     standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain     reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control     over financial reporting was maintained in all material     respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of     internal control over financial reporting, evaluating     managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design     and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing     such other procedures as we considered necessary in the     circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable     basis for our opinion.         A companys internal control over financial reporting is a     process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the     reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of     financial statements for external purposes in accordance with     generally accepted accounting principles. A companys     internal control over financial reporting includes those     policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance     of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly     reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the     company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions     are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial     statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting     principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company     are being made only in accordance with authorizations of     management and directors of the company; and (3) provide     reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of     unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the     companys assets that could have a material effect on the     financial statements.         Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over     financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.     Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future     periods are subject to the risk that controls may become     inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree     of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.         In our opinion, managements assessment that FedEx     Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial     reporting as of May 31, 2007, is fairly stated, in all     material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our     opinion, FedEx Corporation maintained, in all material respects,     effective internal control over financial reporting as of     May 31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.         We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the     Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the     consolidated balance sheets of FedEx Corporation as of     May 31, 2007 and 2006, and related consolidated statements     of income, changes in stockholders investment and     comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years     in the period ended May 31, 2007 of FedEx Corporation and     our report dated July 9, 2007 expressed an unqualified     opinion thereon.     /s/  Ernst &     Young LLP         Memphis, Tennessee       July 9, 2007        67    Table of Contents   REPORT OF     INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM         The Board of Directors and Stockholders      FedEx Corporation         We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of     FedEx Corporation as of May 31, 2007 and 2006, and the     related consolidated statements of income, changes in     stockholders investment and comprehensive income, and cash     flows for each of the three years in the period ended     May 31, 2007. These financial statements are the     responsibility of the Companys management. Our     responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial     statements based on our audits.         We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the     Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those     standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain     reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are     free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a     test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in     the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the     accounting principles used and significant estimates made by     management, as well as evaluating the overall financial     statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a     reasonable basis for our opinion.         In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above     present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated     financial position of FedEx Corporation at May 31, 2007 and     2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and its     cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended     May 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally     accepted accounting principles.         As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial     statements, effective June 1, 2006, the Company adopted     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)     No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment,     and effective May 31, 2007 the Company adopted     SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for     Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit     Plans  An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,     88, 106 and 132(R).         We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the     Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the

Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the     Treadway Commission and our report dated July 9, 2007     expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.     /s/  Ernst &     Young LLP         Memphis,

   NOTE 1:     DESCRIPTION     OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING     POLICIES       DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.  FedEx Corporation     (FedEx) provides a broad portfolio of     transportation,     e-commerce     and business services through companies competing collectively,     operating independently and managed collaboratively, under the     respected FedEx brand. These operating companies are primarily     represented by Federal Express Corporation (FedEx     Express), the worlds largest express transportation     company; FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. (FedEx     Ground), a leading provider of small-package ground     delivery services; FedEx Freight Corporation, a leading     U.S. provider of less-than-truckload (LTL)     freight services; and FedEx Kinkos Office and Print     Services, Inc. (FedEx Kinkos), a leading     provider of document solutions and business services. These     companies represent our major service lines and form the core of     our reportable segments.         Other business units in the FedEx portfolio are FedEx Trade     Networks, Inc. (FedEx Trade Networks), a global     trade services company; FedEx SmartPost, Inc. (FedEx     SmartPost), a small-parcel consolidator; FedEx Global     Supply Chain Services, Inc. (FedEx Supply Chain     Services), a contract logistics provider; FedEx Custom     Critical, Inc. (FedEx Custom Critical), a     critical-shipment carrier; Caribbean Transportation Services,     Inc. (Caribbean Transportation Services), a provider     of airfreight forwarding services, and FedEx Corporate Services,     Inc. (FedEx Services), a provider of customer-facing     sales, marketing and information technology functions, primarily     for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground.     FISCAL YEARS.  Except as otherwise specified,     references to years indicate our fiscal year ended May 31,     2007 or ended May 31 of the year referenced.     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION.  The consolidated     financial statements include the accounts of FedEx and its     subsidiaries, substantially all of which are wholly owned. All     significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been     eliminated.     REVENUE RECOGNITION.  We recognize revenue upon     delivery of shipments for our transportation businesses and upon     completion of services for our business services, logistics and     trade services businesses. Certain of our transportation     services are provided with the use of independent contractors.     FedEx is the principal to the transaction in most instances and     in those cases revenue from these transactions is recognized on     a gross basis. Costs associated with independent contractor     settlements are recognized as incurred and included in the     caption Purchased transportation in the accompanying     consolidated statements of income. For shipments in transit,     revenue is recorded based on the percentage of service completed     at the balance sheet date. Estimates for future billing     adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable are recognized at     the time of shipment for money-back service guarantees and     billing corrections. Delivery costs are accrued as incurred.         Our contract logistics, global trade services and certain     transportation businesses engage in some transactions wherein     they act as agents. Revenue from these transactions is recorded     on a net basis. Net revenue includes billings to customers less     third-party charges, including transportation or handling costs,     fees, commissions, and taxes and duties. These amounts are not     material.         Certain of our revenue-producing transactions are subject to     taxes assessed by governmental authorities, such as sales tax.     We present these taxes on a net basis.     CREDIT RISK.  We routinely grant credit to many     of our customers for transportation and business services     without collateral. The risk of credit loss in our trade     receivables is substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation     process, short collection terms and sales to a large number of     customers, as well as the low revenue per transaction for most     of our services. Allowances for potential credit losses are     determined based on historical experience and current evaluation     of the composition of accounts receivable. Historically, credit     losses have been within managements expectations.        74    Table of Contents     FEDEX     CORPORATION      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)    ADVERTISING.  Advertising and promotion costs     are expensed as incurred and are classified in other operating     expenses. Advertising and promotion expenses were     $406 million in 2007, $376 million in 2006 and     $326 million in 2005.     CASH EQUIVALENTS.  Cash in excess of current     operating requirements is invested in short-term,     interest-bearing instruments with maturities of three months or     less at the date of purchase and is stated at cost, which     approximates market value.     SPARE PARTS, SUPPLIES AND FUEL.  Spare parts     (principally aircraft related) are reported at weighted-average     cost. Supplies and fuel are reported at standard cost, which     approximates actual cost on a     first-in,     first-out basis. Allowances for obsolescence are provided for     spare parts expected to be on hand at the date the aircraft are     retired from service over the estimated useful life of the     related aircraft and engines. Additionally, allowances for     obsolescence are provided for spare parts currently identified     as excess or obsolete. These allowances are based on management     estimates, which are subject to change.     PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT.  Expenditures for major     additions, improvements, flight equipment modifications and     certain equipment overhaul costs are capitalized when such costs     are determined to extend the useful life of the asset or are     part of the cost of acquiring the asset. Maintenance and repairs     are charged to expense as incurred, except for certain     aircraft-related major maintenance costs on one of our aircraft     fleet types, which are capitalized as incurred and amortized     over the estimated remaining useful lives of the aircraft. We     capitalize certain direct internal and external costs associated     with the development of internal use software. Gains and losses     on sales of property used in operations are classified with     depreciation and amortization.         For financial reporting purposes, we record depreciation and     amortization of property and equipment on a straight-line basis     over the assets service life or related lease term. For     income tax purposes, depreciation is generally computed using     accelerated methods. The depreciable lives and net book value of     our property and equipment are as follows (dollars in millions):                                                                     Net Book Value                              at May 31,                 Range           2007           2006               Wide-body aircraft and related     equipment                     15 to 25 years               $       5,391               $       4,669          Narrow-body and feeder aircraft     and related equipment                     5 to 15 years                   352                   369          Package handling and ground     support equipment                     2 to 30 years                   1,420                   1,255          Computer and electronic equipment                     2 to 10 years                   1,021                   928          Vehicles                     3 to 15 years                   957                   743          Facilities and other                     2 to 40 years                   3,495                   2,806                 Substantially all property and equipment have no material     residual values. The majority of aircraft costs are depreciated     on a straight-line basis over 15 to 18 years. We     periodically evaluate the estimated service lives and residual     values used to depreciate our property and equipment. This     evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives and     residual values. Such changes did not materially affect     depreciation expense in any period presented. Depreciation     expense, excluding gains and losses on sales of property and     equipment used in operations, was $1.7 billion in 2007,     $1.5 billion in 2006 and $1.4 billion in 2005.     Depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of     assets under capital lease.     CAPITALIZED INTEREST.  Interest on funds used     to finance the acquisition and modification of aircraft,     construction of certain facilities and development of certain     software up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use     is capitalized and included in the cost of the asset if the     asset is actively under construction. Capitalized interest was     $34 million in 2007, $33 million in 2006 and     $22 million in 2005.        75    Table of Contents     FEDEX     CORPORATION      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)    IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS.  Long-lived     assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate     the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. For     assets that are to be held and used, an impairment is recognized     when the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the     asset or group of assets is less than their carrying value. If     impairment exists, an adjustment is made to write the asset down     to its fair value, and a loss is recorded as the difference     between the carrying value and fair value. Fair values are     determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows     or internal and external appraisals, as applicable. Assets to be     disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or     estimated net realizable value. We operate integrated     transportation networks, and accordingly, cash flows cannot be     associated with an individual asset for our analysis of     impairment.     GOODWILL.  Goodwill is recognized for the     excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and     identifiable intangible net assets of businesses acquired.     Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment by     comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its     carrying value (including attributable goodwill). Fair value is     determined using a discounted cash flow methodology and includes     managements assumptions on revenue growth rates, operating     margins, discount rates and expected capital expenditures.     Unless circumstances otherwise dictate, we perform our annual     impairment testing in the fourth quarter.     INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  Amortizable intangible     assets include customer relationships, technology assets and     contract-based intangibles acquired in business combinations.     Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging     from 2 to 15 years, either on a straight-line basis or an     accelerated basis depending upon the pattern in which the     economic benefits are realized. Our only     non-amortizing     intangible asset is the Kinkos trade name.     Non-amortizing     intangibles are reviewed at least annually for impairment.     Unless circumstances otherwise dictate, we perform our annual     impairment testing in the fourth quarter.     PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE     PLANS.  On May 31, 2007, we adopted Statement     of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 158,     Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and     Other Postretirement Plans, which amended several other     Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)     Statements. SFAS 158 requires recognition in the balance     sheet of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other     postretirement benefit plans, and the recognition in accumulated     other comprehensive income (AOCI) of unrecognized     gains or losses and prior service costs or credits existing at     the time of adoption. Additionally, SFAS 158 requires the     measurement date for plan assets and liabilities to coincide     with the sponsors year end. We currently use a February 28     measurement date for our plans; therefore, this standard will     require us to change our measurement date to May 31 (beginning     in 2009). The impact of adopting the measurement date provision     on our financial statements will depend on the funded status of     the plans at the date of adoption.         The adoption of SFAS 158 resulted in a $982 million     charge to shareholders equity at May 31, 2007 through     AOCI. Under SFAS 158, we were required to write off our     prepaid pension asset of $1.4 billion and increase our     pension and other post-retirement benefit liabilities by     $120 million. These adjustments, net of deferred taxes of     $582 million, were required to recognize the unfunded     projected benefit obligation in our balance sheet. SFAS 158     has no impact on the determination of expense for our pension     and other postretirement benefit plans.         In February 2007, we announced changes to modernize certain of     our retirement programs over the next two fiscal years.     Effective May 31, 2008, all benefits previously accrued     under our primary pension plans using a traditional pension     benefit formula will be capped for most employees, and those     benefits will be payable beginning at retirement. Beginning     June 1, 2008, future pension benefits for most employees     will be accrued under a cash balance formula we call the     Portable Pension Account (as described in Note 12). These     retirement plan changes were contemplated in our     February 28, 2007 actuarial measurement. These changes will     not affect the benefits of current retirees.         Currently, our defined benefit plans are measured using     actuarial techniques that reflect managements assumptions     for discount rate, rate of return, salary increases, expected     retirement, mortality, employee        76    Table of Contents     FEDEX     CORPORATION      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)        turnover and future increases in healthcare costs. We determine     the discount rate (which is required to be the rate at which the     projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled as of     the measurement date) with the assistance of actuaries, who     calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high-grade     corporate bonds (rated Aa or better) with cash flows that     generally match our expected benefit payments. A     calculated-value method is employed for purposes of determining     the expected return on the plan asset component of net periodic     pension cost for our qualified U.S. pension plans.     Generally, we do not fund defined benefit plans when such     funding provides no current tax deduction or when such funding     would be deemed current compensation to plan participants.     INCOME TAXES.  Deferred income taxes are     provided for the tax effect of temporary differences between the     tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts     in the financial statements. The liability method is used to     account for income taxes, which requires deferred taxes to be     recorded at the statutory rate expected to be in effect when the     taxes are paid.         We have not recognized deferred taxes for U.S. federal     income taxes on foreign subsidiaries earnings that are     deemed to be permanently reinvested and such taxes associated     with these earnings are not material. Pretax earnings of foreign     operations were approximately $648 million in 2007,     $606 million in 2006 and $636 million in 2005, which     represent only a portion of total results associated with     international shipments.     SELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS.  We are primarily     self-insured for workers compensation claims, vehicle     accidents and general liabilities, benefits paid under employee     healthcare programs and long-term disability benefits. Accruals     are primarily based on the actuarially estimated, undiscounted     cost of claims, which includes incurred-but-not-reported claims.     Current workers compensation claims, vehicle and general     liability, employee healthcare claims and long-term disability     are included in accrued expenses. We self-insure up to certain     limits that vary by operating company and type of risk.     Periodically, we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and     adjust insurance levels based on risk tolerance and premium     expense.     LEASES.  We lease certain aircraft, facilities,     equipment and vehicles under capital and operating leases. The     commencement date of all leases is the earlier of the date we     become legally obligated to make rent payments or the date we     may exercise control over the use of the property. In addition     to minimum rental payments, certain leases provide for     contingent rentals based on equipment usage principally related     to aircraft leases at FedEx Express and copier usage at FedEx     Kinkos. Rent expense associated with contingent rentals is     recorded as incurred. Certain of our leases contain fluctuating     or escalating payments and rent holiday periods. The related     rent expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease     term. The cumulative excess of rent payments over rent expense     is accounted for as a deferred lease asset and recorded in     Intangible and other assets in the accompanying     consolidated balance sheets. The cumulative excess of rent     expense over rent payments is accounted for as a deferred lease     obligation. Leasehold improvements associated with assets     utilized under capital or operating leases are amortized over     the shorter of the assets useful life or the lease term.     DEFERRED GAINS.  Gains on the sale and     leaseback of aircraft and other property and equipment are     deferred and amortized ratably over the life of the lease as a     reduction of rent expense. Substantially all of these deferred     gains are related to aircraft transactions.     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  Translation     gains and losses of foreign operations that use local currencies     as the functional currency are accumulated and reported, net of     applicable deferred income taxes, as a component of accumulated     other comprehensive loss within common stockholders     investment. Transaction gains and losses that arise from     exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a     currency other than the local currency are included in the     caption Other, net in the accompanying consolidated     statements of income. Cumulative net foreign currency     translation gains in accumulated other comprehensive loss were     $69 million at May 31, 2007, $43 million at     May 31, 2006 and $14 million at May 31, 2005.        77    Table of Contents     FEDEX     CORPORATION      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)    AIRLINE STABILIZATION ACT CHARGE.  In 2005, the     United States Department of Transportation (DOT)     issued a final order in its administrative review of the FedEx     Express claim for compensation under the Air Transportation     Safety and System Stabilization Act. We recorded a charge of     $48 million in 2005, representing the repayment of     $29 million that we had previously received and the     write-off of a $19 million receivable that we concluded was     no longer collectible.     EMPLOYEES UNDER COLLECTIVE BARGAINING     ARRANGEMENTS.  The pilots of FedEx Express, which     represent a small number of our total employees, are employed     under a collective bargaining agreement. In October 2006, the     pilots ratified a new four-year labor contract that included     signing bonuses and other upfront compensation of approximately     $143 million, as well as pay increases and other benefit     enhancements. These costs were partially mitigated by reductions     in variable incentive compensation. The effect of this new     agreement on second quarter 2007 net income was     approximately $78 million after tax, or $0.25 per diluted     share.     STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  On June 1,     2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS 123R,     Share-Based     Payment, which requires recognition of compensation     expense for stock-based awards using a fair value method.     SFAS 123R is a revision of SFAS 123, Accounting     for Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes Accounting     Principles Board Opinion No. (APB) 25,     Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Prior to     the adoption of SFAS 123R, we applied APB 25 and its     related interpretations to measure compensation expense for     stock-based compensation plans. As a result, no compensation     expense was recorded for stock options, as the exercise price     was equal to the market price of our common stock at the date of     grant.         We adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method,     which resulted in prospective recognition of compensation     expense for all outstanding unvested share-based payments based     on the fair value on the original grant date. Under this method     of adoption, our financial statement amounts for the prior     period presented have not been restated.         Our total share-based compensation expense was $103 million     in 2007, $37 million in 2006 and $32 million in 2005.     The impact of adopting SFAS 123R for the year ended     May 31, 2007 was approximately $71 million     ($52 million, net of tax), or $0.17 per basic and diluted     share.         Stock option compensation expense, pro forma net income and     basic and diluted earnings per common share, if determined under     SFAS 123 at fair value using the Black-Scholes method,     would have been as follows (in millions, except for per share     amounts) for the years ended May 31:                                             2006           2005               Net income, as reported                 $       1,806               $       1,449          Add: Stock option compensation     included in reported net income, net of tax                     5                   4          Deduct: Total stock option     compensation expense determined under fair value based method     for all awards, net of tax benefit                     46                   40                                                Pro forma net income                 $       1,765               $       1,413                                                Earnings per common share:                                            Basic  as reported                 $       5.94               $       4.81                                                Basic  pro forma                 $       5.81               $       4.69                                                Diluted  as reported                 $       5.83               $       4.72                                                Diluted  pro forma                 $       5.70               $       4.60                                                   DIVIDENDS DECLARED PER COMMON SHARE.  On     May 25, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of     $0.10 per share of common stock. The dividend was paid on     July 2, 2007 to stockholders of        78    Table of Contents     FEDEX     CORPORATION      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)        record as of the close of business on June 11, 2007. Each     quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and approval by     our Board of Directors, and we evaluate our dividend payment     amount on an annual basis at the end of each fiscal year.     USE OF ESTIMATES.  The preparation of our     consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates     and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and     liabilities, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and     the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Management makes its     best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on     historical trends and other information available when the     financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are     recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the     estimate, which is typically in the period when new information     becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the     estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could     materially differ from amounts estimated include: self-insurance     accruals; retirement plan obligations; long-term incentive     accruals; tax liabilities; obsolescence of spare parts;     contingent liabilities; and impairment assessments on long-lived     assets (including goodwill and indefinite lived intangible     assets).           NOTE 2:     RECENT     ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS           New accounting rules and disclosure requirements can     significantly impact the comparability of our financial     statements. We believe the following new accounting     pronouncements, which were issued or became effective for us     during 2007, are relevant to the readers of our financial     statements.         In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.     (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income     Taxes. This interpretation establishes new standards for     the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure     of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in     income tax returns. The new rules will be effective for FedEx in     the first quarter of 2008. The adoption of this interpretation     will not have a material effect on our financial statements.         In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission     (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin     (SAB) 108, Considering the Effects of Prior     Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current     Year Financial Statements, which eliminates the diversity     in practice surrounding the quantification and evaluation of     financial statement errors. The guidance outlined in     SAB 108 was effective for FedEx in the fourth quarter of     2007 and is consistent with our historical practices for     assessing such matters when circumstances have required such an     evaluation.           NOTE 3:     BUSINESS     COMBINATIONS           On September 3, 2006, we acquired the assets and assumed     certain obligations of the LTL operations of Watkins Motor Lines     (Watkins), a privately held company, and certain     affiliates for $787 million in cash. Watkins, a leading     provider of long-haul LTL services, was renamed FedEx National     LTL and meaningfully extends our leadership position in the     heavyweight LTL freight sector. The financial results of FedEx     National LTL are included in the FedEx Freight segment from the     date of acquisition.         On December 16, 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding     capital stock of ANC Holdings Ltd. (ANC), a United     Kingdom domestic express transportation company, for     $241 million, predominantly in cash. This acquisition     allows FedEx Express to better serve the United Kingdom domestic     market, which we previously served primarily through independent     agents.         On March 1, 2007, FedEx Express acquired Tianjin Datian W.     Group Co., Ltd.s (DTW Group) 50% share of the     FedEx-DTW International Priority express joint venture and     assets relating to DTW Groups domestic express network in     China for $427 million in cash. This acquisition converts     our joint venture with DTW Group into a wholly owned subsidiary     and increases our presence in China in the international and     domestic express businesses. Prior to the fourth quarter of     2007, we accounted for our investment in the joint venture under     the equity method.        79    Table of Contents     FEDEX     CORPORATION      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)        The financial results of the ANC and DTW Group acquisitions, as     well as other immaterial business acquisitions during 2007, are     included in the FedEx Express segment from the date of     acquisition. These acquisitions were not material to our results     of operations or financial condition. The portion of the     purchase price allocated to goodwill and other identified     intangible assets for the FedEx National LTL, ANC and DTW Group     acquisitions will generally be deductible for U.S. tax     purposes over 15 years.         Pro forma results of these acquisitions, individually or in the     aggregate, would not differ materially from reported results in     any of the periods presented. Our accompanying consolidated     balance sheet reflects the following preliminary allocations of     the purchase price for the FedEx National LTL, ANC and DTW Group     acquisitions (in millions):                                                         FedEx                                          National LTL           ANC           DTW Group               Current assets                 $       121               $       68               $       54          Property and equipment                     525                   20                   16          Intangible assets                     77                   49                   17          Goodwill                     121                   168                   348          Other assets                     3                   2                   10          Current liabilities                     (60       )               (56       )               (18       )      Long-term liabilities                                        (10       )                                                                               Total purchase price                 $       787               $       241               $       427                                                                       While the purchase price allocations are substantially complete     and we do not expect any material adjustments, we may make     adjustments to the purchase price allocations as refinements to     estimates are deemed necessary. Our ANC and DTW Group     acquisitions included the impact of foreign currency     fluctuations from the execution of the purchase agreement to the     actual closing date. The impact of these foreign currency     fluctuations was immaterial to these transactions.         The intangible assets acquired in the FedEx National LTL and ANC     acquisitions consist primarily of customer-related intangible     assets, which will be amortized on an accelerated basis over     their average estimated useful lives of seven years for FedEx     National LTL and up to 12 years for ANC, with the majority     of the amortization recognized during the first four years. The     intangible assets acquired in the DTW Group acquisition relate     to the reacquired rights for the use of certain FedEx technology     and service marks. These intangible assets will be amortized     over their estimated useful lives of approximately two years.         We paid the purchase price for these acquisitions from available     cash balances, which included the net proceeds from our     $1 billion senior unsecured debt offering completed during     2007. See Note 6 for further discussion of this debt     offering.         On September 12, 2004, we acquired the assets and assumed     certain liabilities of FedEx SmartPost (formerly known as Parcel     Direct), a division of a privately held company, for     $122 million in cash. FedEx SmartPost is a leading     small-parcel consolidator and broadens our portfolio of services     by allowing us to offer a cost-effective option for delivering     low-weight, less time-sensitive packages to U.S. residences     through the U.S. Postal Service. The financial results of     FedEx SmartPost are included in the FedEx Ground segment from     the date of its acquisition and are not material to reported or     pro forma results of operations of any period.        80    Table of Contents     FEDEX     CORPORATION      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)        The purchase price was allocated as follows (in millions):                          Current assets, primarily accounts     receivable                 $       10          Property and equipment                     91          Intangible assets                     10          Goodwill                     20          Current liabilities                     (9       )                            Total purchase price                 $       122                                       The excess cost over the estimated fair value of the assets     acquired and liabilities assumed (approximately     $20 million) has been recorded as goodwill, which is     entirely attributed to FedEx Ground.           NOTE 4:     GOODWILL     AND INTANGIBLES           The FedEx National LTL, ANC and DTW Group acquisitions, as well     as other immaterial business acquisitions during 2007,     contributed approximately $670 million in goodwill for the     year ended May 31, 2007.

The new registration statement does not     limit the amount of any future offering. By using this shelf     registration statement, we may sell, in one or more future     offerings, any combination of our unsecured debt securities and     common stock.         On August 8, 2006, under the new shelf registration     statement, we issued $1 billion of senior unsecured debt,     comprised of floating-rate notes totaling $500 million due     in August 2007 and fixed-rate notes totaling $500 million     due in August 2009. The net proceeds were used for working     capital and general corporate purposes, including the funding of     acquisitions (see Note 3).         From time to time, we finance certain operating and investing     activities, including acquisitions, through borrowings under our     $1.0 billion revolving credit facility or the issuance of     commercial paper. The revolving credit agreement contains     certain covenants and restrictions, none of which are expected     to significantly affect our operations or ability to pay     dividends. Our commercial paper program is backed by unused     commitments under the revolving credit facility and borrowings     under the program reduce the amount available under the credit     facility. At May 31, 2007, no commercial paper borrowings     were outstanding and the entire amount under the credit facility     was available.         Long-term debt, exclusive of capital leases, had carrying values     of $2.3 billion compared with an estimated fair value of     approximately $2.4 billion at May 31, 2007, and     $2.1 billion compared with an estimated fair value of     $2.2 billion at May 31, 2006. The estimated fair     values were determined based on quoted market prices or on the     current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities.         Our other debt at May 31, 2006 included $118 million     related to leases for two MD-11 aircraft that were consolidated     under the provisions of FIN 46, Consolidation of     Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB     No. 51. These assets were held by a separate entity,     which was established to lease these aircraft to FedEx Express,     and was owned by independent third parties who provide financing     through debt and equity participation. FedEx Express purchased     these aircraft in March 2007, extinguishing this debt.         We issue other financial instruments in the normal course of     business to support our operations. Letters of credit at     May 31, 2007 were $694 million. The amount unused     under our letter of credit facility totaled approximately     $30 million at May 31, 2007. This facility expires in     July of 2010. These instruments are generally required under     certain U.S. self-insurance programs and are used in the     normal course of international operations. The underlying     liabilities insured by these instruments are reflected in the     balance sheets, where applicable. Therefore, no additional     liability is reflected for the letters of credit.         Our capital lease obligations include leases for aircraft and     facilities. Our facility leases include leases that guarantee     the repayment of certain special facility revenue bonds that     have been issued by municipalities primarily to finance the     acquisition and construction of various airport facilities and     equipment. These bonds require interest payments at least     annually, with principal payments due at the end of the related     lease agreement.        83    Table of Contents     FEDEX     CORPORATION      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          NOTE 7:     LEASES           We utilize certain aircraft, land, facilities and equipment     under capital and operating leases that expire at various dates     through 2039. We leased approximately 15% of our total aircraft     fleet under capital or operating leases as of May 31, 2007.     In addition, supplemental aircraft are leased by us under     agreements that generally provide for cancellation upon     30 days notice.

While certain of our lease agreements contain covenants     governing the use of the leased assets or require us to maintain     certain levels of insurance, none of our lease agreements     include material financial covenants or limitations.         FedEx Express makes payments under certain leveraged operating     leases that are sufficient to pay principal and interest on     certain pass-through certificates. The pass-through certificates     are not direct obligations of, or guaranteed by, FedEx or FedEx     Express.         Our results for 2006 included a noncash charge of     $79 million ($49 million after tax or $0.16 per     diluted share) to adjust the accounting for certain facility     leases, predominantly at FedEx Express. This charge, which     included the impact on prior years, related primarily to rent     escalations in on-airport facility leases that were not being     recognized appropriately.           NOTE 8:     PREFERRED     STOCK           Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Board of     Directors, at its discretion, to issue up to     4,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The stock is issuable     in series, which may vary as to certain rights and preferences,     and has no par value. As of May 31, 2007, none of these     shares had been issued.           NOTE 9:     STOCK-BASED     COMPENSATION           We have two types of equity-based compensation: stock options     and restricted stock.     STOCK OPTIONS.  Under the provisions of our     incentive stock plans, key employees and non-employee directors     may be granted options to purchase shares of common stock at a     price not less than its fair market value at the date of grant.     Options granted have a maximum term of 10 years. Vesting     requirements are determined at the discretion of the     Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Option-vesting     periods range from one to four years, with approximately 90% of     options granted vesting ratably over four years.     RESTRICTED STOCK.  Under the terms of our     incentive stock plans, restricted shares of common stock are     awarded to key employees. All restrictions on the shares expire     ratably over a four-year period. Shares are valued at the market     price at the date of award. Compensation related to these awards     is recognized as expense over the explicit service period.         For unvested stock options granted prior to June 1, 2006     and all restricted stock awards, the terms of these awards     provide for continued vesting subsequent to the employees     retirement. Compensation expense associated with these awards is     recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the     remaining service or        85    Table of Contents     FEDEX     CORPORATION      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)        vesting period. This post-retirement vesting provision was     removed from all stock option awards granted subsequent to     May 31, 2006.     VALUATION AND ASSUMPTIONS.  We use the     Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value     of stock options. The value of restricted stock awards is based     on the stock price of the award on the grant date. We recognize     stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over     the requisite service period of the award in the Salaries     and employee benefits caption in the accompanying     consolidated statements of income.         The key assumptions for the Black-Scholes valuation method     include the expected life of the option, stock price volatility,     risk-free interest rate, dividend yield and exercise price. Many     of these assumptions are judgmental and highly sensitive. The     following table describes each assumption, as well as the     results of increases in the various assumptions:                                         Change in            Impact on Fair      Assumption           Assumption           Value of Option     Expected life of the     option  This     is the period of time over which the options granted are     expected to remain outstanding. Generally, options granted have     a maximum term of 10 years. We examine actual stock option     exercises to determine the expected life of the options.                Increase                Increase          Expected     volatility      Actual changes in the market value of our stock are used to     calculate the volatility assumption. We calculate daily market     value changes from the date of grant over a past period equal to     the expected life of the options to determine volatility.                Increase                Increase          Risk-free interest     rate  This     is the U.S. Treasury Strip rate posted at the date of grant     having a term equal to the expected life of the option.                Increase                Increase          Expected dividend     yield  This     is the annual rate of dividends per share over the exercise     price of the option.                Increase                Decrease                                                Following is a table of the key weighted-average assumptions     used in the valuation calculations for the options granted     during the years ended May 31:                                                         2007       2006       2005           Expected lives               5 years                5 years                4 years             Expected volatility               22%                25%                27%             Risk-free interest rate               4.879%                3.794%                3.559%             Dividend yield               0.3023%                0.3229%                0.3215%                    The weighted-average Black-Scholes value of our stock option     grants using the assumptions indicated above was $31.60 per     option in 2007, $25.78 per option in 2006 and $20.37 per option     in 2005. The intrinsic value of options exercised was     $145 million in 2007, $191 million in 2006 and     $126 million in 2005.        86    Table of Contents     FEDEX     CORPORATION      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)        The following table summarizes information about stock option     activity for the year ended May 31, 2007:                                                                     Stock Options                                         Weighted-                                                      Average                                          Weighted-            Remaining            Aggregate                              Average            Contractual            Intrinsic Value                  Shares           Exercise Price           Term           (in millions)               Outstanding at June 1, 2006                     17,099,526               $       60.82                                                                                                                Granted                     2,094,873                   110.25                                          Exercised                     (2,333,845       )               49.55                                          Forfeited                     (270,153       )               89.12                                                                                                                Outstanding at May 31, 2007                     16,590,401               $       68.22                   5.9 years               $       696                                                                                Exercisable                     10,418,072               $       54.75                   4.6 years               $       577                                                                                Expected to Vest                     5,678,543               $       90.97                   8.0 years               $       109                                                                                       The following table summarizes information about vested and     unvested restricted stock for the year ended May 31, 2007:                                             Restricted Stock                             Weighted-                              Average                              Grant Date                  Shares           Fair Value               Unvested at June 1, 2006                     583,106               $       76.97                                                Granted                     175,005                   109.90          Vested                     (260,821       )               69.92          Forfeited                     (15,943       )               88.69                                                Unvested at May 31, 2007                     481,347               $       92.37                                                       During the year ended May 31, 2006, there were     233,939 shares of restricted stock granted with a weighted     average fair value of $90.12.

The 2007 rate reduction was partially offset by tax charges     incurred as a result of a reorganization in Asia associated with     our acquisition in China, as described in Note 3. The 37.4%     effective tax rate in 2005 was favorably impacted by the     reduction of a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits     arising from certain of our international operations as a result     of the passage of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and by     a lower effective state tax rate.

The valuation allowance primarily represents amounts reserved     for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, which expire     over varying periods starting in 2008. As a result of this and     other factors, we believe that a substantial portion of these     deferred tax assets may not be realized.           NOTE 12:     RETIREMENT     PLANS           We sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of     our employees. These programs include defined benefit pension     plans, defined contribution plans and retiree healthcare plans.     The accounting for pension and healthcare plans includes     numerous assumptions, such as: discount rates; expected     long-term        89    Table of Contents     FEDEX     CORPORATION      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)        investment returns on plan assets; future salary increases;     employee turnover; mortality; and retirement ages. These     assumptions most significantly impact our U.S. domestic     pension plan.         In February 2007, we announced changes to modernize certain of     our retirement programs over the next two fiscal years.     Effective January 1, 2008, we will increase the annual     company matching contribution under the largest of our 401(k)     plans covering most employees from $500 to a maximum of 3.5% of     eligible compensation. Employees not participating in the 401(k)     plan as of January 1, 2008 will be automatically enrolled     at 3% of eligible pay with a company match of 2% of eligible     pay. Effective May 31, 2008, benefits previously accrued     under our primary pension plans using a traditional pension     benefit formula will be capped for most employees, and those     benefits will be payable beginning at retirement. Beginning     June 1, 2008, future pension benefits for most employees     will be accrued under a cash balance formula we call the     Portable Pension Account. These retirement plan changes were     contemplated in our February 28, 2007 actuarial     measurement. These changes will not affect the benefits of     current retirees. In addition, these pension plans will be     modified to accelerate vesting from five years to three years     effective June 1, 2008.         A summary of our retirement plans costs over the past three     years is as follows (in millions):                                                         2007           2006           2005               U.S. domestic pension plans                 $       442               $       400               $       337          International pension and defined     contribution plans                     49                   45                   41          U.S. domestic defined contribution     plans                     152                   147                   136          Retiree healthcare plans                     55                   73                   68                                                                           $       698               $       665               $       582                                                                   PENSION PLANS.  The largest pension plan covers     certain U.S. employees age 21 and over, with at least     one year of service. Eligible employees as of May 31, 2003     were given the opportunity to make a     one-time     election to accrue future pension benefits under either the     Portable Pension Account, or a traditional pension benefit     formula. Benefits provided under the traditional formula are     based on average earnings and years of service. Under the     Portable Pension Account, the retirement benefit is expressed as     a dollar amount in a notional account that grows with annual     credits based on pay, age and years of credited service, and     interest on the notional account balance. Eligible employees     hired after May 31, 2003 accrue benefits exclusively under     the Portable Pension Account. We also sponsor or participate in     nonqualified benefit plans covering certain of our     U.S. employee groups and other pension plans covering     certain of our international employees. The international     defined benefit pension plans provide benefits primarily based     on final earnings and years of service and are funded in     accordance with local practice. Where plans are funded, they are     in compliance with local laws.     DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS.  Defined     contribution plans are in place covering a majority of     U.S. employees and certain international employees. Expense     under these plans was $176 million in 2007,     $167 million in 2006 and $153 million in 2005.     POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLANS.  Certain of     our subsidiaries offer medical, dental and vision coverage to     eligible U.S. retirees and their eligible dependents.     U.S. employees covered by the principal plan become     eligible for these benefits at age 55 and older, if they     have permanent, continuous service of at least 10 years     after attainment of age 45 if hired prior to     January 1, 1988, or at least 20 years after attainment     of age 35 if hired on or after January 1, 1988.     Postretirement healthcare benefits are capped at 150% of the     1993 per capita projected employer cost, which has been reached     and, therefore, these benefits are not subject to additional     future inflation.     NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT.  As discussed in     Note 1, we adopted the recognition and disclosure     provisions of SFAS 158 on May 31, 2007. The adoption     of SFAS 158 requires recognition in the        90    Table of Contents     FEDEX     CORPORATION      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)        balance sheet of the funded status of defined benefit pension     and other postretirement benefit plans, and the recognition in     AOCI of unrecognized gains or losses, prior service costs or     credits and transition assets or obligations existing at the     time of adoption. The funded status is measured as the     difference between the fair value of the plans assets and     the projected benefit obligation (PBO) of the plan.     Additionally, SFAS 158 requires the measurement date for     plan assets and liabilities to coincide with the sponsors     year-end. We currently use a February 28 measurement date for     our plans; therefore, this standard will require us to change     our measurement date to May 31. The requirement to measure     plan assets and benefit obligations as of our fiscal year end is     effective for FedEx no later than 2009.         As discussed in Note 1, upon adoption of SFAS 158, we     recognized assets of $1 million for our overfunded plans     and liabilities of $1.2 billion for our underfunded plans     in our balance sheet at May 31, 2007. In addition, we     eliminated the minimum pension liability balance of     $191 million and intangible assets of $3 million     related to our plans that had been recorded prior to adoption.     The adoption of SFAS 158 did not affect our operating     results in the current period and will not have any effect on     operating results in future periods. We have presented below the     incremental effects of adopting SFAS 158 to our balance     sheet for the individual line items impacted from this adoption,     as of May 31, 2007 (in millions).

Our pension cost is     materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension     obligations, the level of plan assets available to fund those     obligations and the expected     long-term     rate of return on plan assets.         We currently use a measurement date of February 28 for our     pension and postretirement healthcare plans. Management reviews     the assumptions used to measure pension costs on an annual     basis. Economic and market conditions at the measurement date     impact these assumptions from year to year and it is reasonably     possible that material changes in pension cost may be     experienced in the future. Additional information about our     pension plan can be found in the Critical Accounting Estimates     section of Managements Discussion and Analysis.         Actuarial gains or losses are generated for changes in     assumptions and to the extent that actual results differ from     those assumed. These actuarial gains and losses are amortized     over the remaining average service lives of our active employees     if they exceed a corridor amount in the aggregate.         Substantially all plan assets are actively managed. The     investment strategy for pension plan assets is to utilize a     diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolios,     together with public and private fixed income portfolios, to     earn a long-term investment return that meets our pension plan     obligations. Active management strategies are utilized within     the plan in an effort to realize investment returns in excess of     market indices.        91    Table of Contents     FEDEX     CORPORATION      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)        The weighted-average asset allocations for our primary pension     plan at February 28 were as follows:                                                                     2007           2006                 Actual           Target           Actual           Target               Domestic equities                     52       %               53       %               54       %               53       %      International equities                     21                   17                   20                   17          Private equities                     3                   5                   3                   5                                                                                Total equities                     76                   75                   77                   75          Long duration fixed income     securities                     15                   15                   14                   15          Other fixed income securities                     9                   10                   9                   10                                                                                               100       %               100       %               100       %               100       %                                                                                   Establishing the expected future rate of investment return on     our pension assets is a judgmental matter. Management considers     the following factors in determining this assumption:                     the duration of our pension plan liabilities, which drives the     investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan assets;                 the types of investment classes in which we invest our pension     plan assets and the expected compound return we can reasonably     expect those investment classes to earn over the next 10 to     15 year time period (or such other time period that may be     appropriate); and                 the investment returns we can reasonably expect our active     investment management program to achieve in excess of the     returns we could expect if investments were made strictly in     indexed funds.           We review the expected long-term rate of return on an annual     basis and revise it as appropriate. As part of our strategy to     manage future pension cost and net funded status volatility, we     are also in the process of     re-evaluating     our pension investment strategy. Initially, we have decided to     move some equity investments out of actively managed funds and     into index funds. Also, we are currently evaluating the mix of     investments between equities and fixed income securities, the     cash flows of which will more closely align with the cash flows     of our pension obligations. Based on these considerations, we     will reduce our estimated long-term rate of return on plan     assets from 9.1% to 8.5% for 2008.         We periodically commission asset/liability studies performed by     third-party professional investment advisors and actuaries to     assist us in our reviews. These studies project our estimated     future pension payments and evaluate the efficiency of the     allocation of our pension plan assets into various investment     categories. These studies also generate probability-adjusted     expected future returns on those assets. The studies performed     or updated supported the reasonableness of our expected rate of     return of 9.1% for 2007, 2006 and 2005. Our actual returns     exceeded this assumption in each of the last three years and for     the 15-year     period ended February 28, 2007.        92    Table of Contents     FEDEX     CORPORATION

(2)   Amounts in Other     consist of unrecognized net actuarial loss, unamortized prior     service cost, unrecognized net transition amount and employer     contributions after measurement date.           (3)   Amounts in Other for     2007 represent only employer contributions after measurement     date, as unrecognized net actuarial loss, unamortized prior     service cost and unrecognized net transition amount were not     applicable in 2007 due to adoption of SFAS 158.               The PBO is the actuarial present value of benefits attributable     to employee service rendered to date, including the effects of     estimated future pay increases. The ABO also reflects the     actuarial present value of benefits attributable to employee     service rendered to date, but does not include the effects of     estimated future pay increases. Therefore, the ABO as compared     to plan assets is an indication of the assets currently     available to fund vested and nonvested benefits accrued through     May 31.         Prior to SFAS 158, the measure of whether a pension plan     was underfunded for recognition of a liability under financial     accounting requirements was based on a comparison of the ABO to     the fair value of plan assets and amounts accrued for such     benefits in the balance sheets. With the adoption of     SFAS 158, the funded status is measured as the difference     between the fair value of the plans assets and the     projected benefit obligation of the plan.         At May 31, 2007 and 2006, the projected benefit obligation,     the accumulated benefit obligation, and the fair value of plan     assets for pension plans with a projected benefit obligation in     excess of plan assets, and for pension plans with an accumulated     benefit obligation in excess of plan assets were as follows (in     millions):                                             PBO Exceeds the Fair Value                  of Plan Assets                 2007           2006               Pension Benefits                                       PBO                 $       12,085               $       12,153          Fair Value of Plan Assets                     11,381                   10,130                  94    Table of Contents   FEDEX     CORPORATION      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)                                            ABO Exceeds the Fair Value of Plan Assets                 2007           2006               Pension Benefits                                       PBO                 $       727               $       584          ABO                     637                   498          Fair Value of Plan Assets                     206                   161                 The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation exceeds plan     assets for all of our postretirement healthcare plans.         Plan funding is actuarially determined and is subject to certain     tax law limitations. International defined benefit pension plans     provide benefits primarily based on final earnings or final     average earnings and years of service and are funded in     accordance with local practice. Where plans are funded, they are     in compliance with local laws and income tax regulations.     Amounts contributed to these plans are generally not recoverable     by us. Although not legally required, we made $482 million     in tax-deductible voluntary contributions to our qualified     U.S. pension plans in 2007 compared to total tax-deductible     voluntary contributions of $456 million in 2006. We expect     approximately $10 million of contributions to such     plans to be legally required in 2008, and we currently expect to     make tax-deductible voluntary contributions in 2008 at levels     approximating those in 2007.         We have certain nonqualified defined benefit pension plans that     are not funded because such funding provides no current tax     deduction and would be deemed current compensation to plan     participants. Primarily related to those plans and certain     international plans, we have ABOs aggregating approximately     $632 million at May 31, 2007 and $499 million at     May 31, 2006 and PBOs aggregating approximately     $722 million at May 31, 2007 and $584 million at     May 31, 2006, with assets of $206 million at     May 31, 2007 and $161 million at May 31, 2006.     Plans with this funded status resulted in the recognition of a     minimum pension liability in our balance sheets prior to     adopting SFAS 158. This minimum liability was     $122 million at May 31, 2006.         At the end of 2007 and prior to our adoption of SFAS 158,     we recorded a minimum pension liability on a     plan-by-plan     basis for many of our pension plans for the amount by which the     ABO exceeded the fair value of the plan assets, after adjusting     for previously recorded accrued or prepaid pension cost for the     plan. We subsequently eliminated the minimum pension liability     balance and intangible assets related to our plans that had been     recorded prior to adoption. The minimum liability eliminated at     May 31, 2007 was $191 million.

Future medical benefit claims costs are estimated to increase at     an annual rate of 11% during 2008, decreasing to an annual     growth rate of 5% in 2019 and thereafter. Future dental benefit     costs are estimated to increase at an annual rate of 6.25%     during 2008, decreasing to an annual growth rate of 5% in 2013     and thereafter. A 1% change in these annual trend rates would     not have a significant impact on the accumulated postretirement     benefit obligation at May 31, 2007 or 2007 benefit expense     because the level of these benefits is capped.           NOTE 13:     BUSINESS     SEGMENT INFORMATION           Our operations for the periods presented are primarily     represented by FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, the FedEx Freight     LTL Group and FedEx Kinkos. These businesses represent our     major service lines and form the core of our reportable     segments. Other business units in the FedEx portfolio are FedEx     Trade Networks, FedEx SmartPost, FedEx Supply Chain Services,     FedEx Custom Critical and Caribbean Transportation Services.     Management evaluates segment financial performance based on     operating income.         As of May 31, 2007, our reportable segments included the     following businesses:                    FedEx Express Segment        FedEx Express (express     transportation)     FedEx Trade Networks (global trade services)                         FedEx Ground Segment        FedEx Ground (small-package ground     delivery)     FedEx SmartPost (small-parcel consolidator)                         FedEx Freight Segment        FedEx Freight LTL Group:       FedEx Freight (regional LTL freight     transportation)       FedEx National LTL (long-haul LTL freight     transportation)     FedEx Custom Critical (time-critical transportation)     Caribbean Transportation Services (airfreight forwarding)                         FedEx Kinkos     Segment        FedEx Kinkos (document     solutions and business services)                 96    Table of Contents     FEDEX     CORPORATION      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)        FedEx Services provides customer-facing sales, marketing and     information technology support, primarily for FedEx Express and     FedEx Ground. The costs for these functions are allocated based     on metrics such as relative revenues or estimated services     provided. We also allocate costs for administrative functions     provided between operating companies and certain other costs,     such as those associated with services received for general     corporate oversight, including executive officers and certain     legal and finance functions. We believe these allocations     approximate the cost of providing these functions.         In addition, certain FedEx operating companies provide     transportation and related services for other FedEx companies     outside their reportable segment. Billings for such services are     based on negotiated rates that we believe approximate fair value     and are reflected as revenues of the billing segment. These     rates are adjusted from time to time based on market conditions.     FedEx Kinkos segment revenues include package acceptance     revenue, which represents the fee received by FedEx Kinkos     from FedEx Express and FedEx Ground for accepting and handling     packages at FedEx Kinkos locations on behalf of these     operating companies. Package acceptance revenue does not include     the external revenue associated with the actual shipments. All     shipment revenues are reflected in the segment performing the     transportation services. Intersegment revenues and expenses are     eliminated in the consolidated results and are not separately     identified in the following segment information, as the amounts     are not material.         Effective June 1, 2006, we moved the credit, collections     and customer service functions with responsibility for FedEx     Express and FedEx Ground customer information from FedEx Express     into a newly formed subsidiary of FedEx Services named FedEx     Customer Information Services, Inc. Also, effective June 1,     2006, we moved FedEx Supply Chain Services, Inc., the results of     which were previously reported in the FedEx Ground segment, into     a new subsidiary of FedEx Services named FedEx Global Supply     Chain Services, Inc. The costs of providing these customer     service functions and the net operating costs of FedEx Global     Supply Chain Services are allocated back to the FedEx Express     and FedEx Ground segments. Prior year amounts have not been     reclassified to conform to the current year segment     presentation, as the financial results of all segments are     materially comparable.        97    Table of Contents     FEDEX     CORPORATION      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)        The following table provides a reconciliation of reportable     segment revenues, depreciation and amortization, operating     income and segment assets to consolidated financial statement     totals for the years ended or as of May 31 (in millions):                                                                                             FedEx            FedEx            FedEx            FedEx                                          Express            Ground            Freight            Kinkos            Other and            Consolidated                  Segment           Segment           Segment(1)           Segment           Eliminations           Total               Revenues                                                                                                            2007                 $       22,681               $       6,043               $       4,586               $       2,040               $       (136       )           $       35,214          2006                     21,446                   5,306                   3,645                   2,088                   (191       )               32,294          2005                     19,485                   4,680                   3,217                   2,066                   (85       )               29,363          Depreciation and amortization                                                                                                            2007                 $       856               $       268               $       195               $       139               $       284               $       1,742          2006                     805                   224                   120                   148                   253                   1,550          2005                     798                   176                   102                   138                   248                   1,462          Operating income                                                                                                            2007(2)             $       1,955               $       813               $       463               $       45               $                      $       3,276          2006(3)                 1,767                   705                   485                   57                                      3,014          2005(4)                 1,414                   604                   354                   100                   (1       )               2,471          Segment     assets(5)                                                                                                        2007                 $       15,650               $       3,937               $       3,150               $       2,957               $       (1,694       )           $       24,000          2006                     14,673                   3,378                   2,245                   2,941                   (547       )               22,690          2005                     13,130                   2,776                   2,047                   2,987                   (536       )               20,404                       (1)   Includes the operations of FedEx     National LTL from the date of acquisition, September 3,     2006.

With     the exception of residual value guarantees in certain operating     leases (described below), a maximum obligation is generally not     specified in our guarantees and indemnifications. As a result,     the overall maximum potential amount of the obligation under     such guarantees and indemnifications cannot be reasonably     estimated. Historically, we have not been required to make     significant payments under our guarantee or indemnification     obligations and no amounts have been recognized in our financial     statements for the underlying fair value of these obligations.         We have guarantees under certain operating leases, amounting to     $17 million as of May 31, 2007, for the residual     values of vehicles and facilities at the end of the respective     operating lease periods. Under these leases, if the fair market     value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term is less     than an     agreed-upon     value as set forth in the related operating lease agreement, we     will be responsible to the lessor for the amount of such     deficiency. Based upon our expectation that none of these leased     assets will have a residual value at the end of the lease term     that is materially less than the value specified in the related     operating lease agreement, we do not believe it is probable that     we will be required to fund material amounts under the terms of     these guarantee arrangements. Accordingly, no material accruals     have been recognized for these guarantees.         Special facility revenue bonds have been issued by certain     municipalities primarily to finance the acquisition and     construction of various airport facilities and equipment. These     facilities were leased to us and are accounted for as either     capital leases or operating leases. FedEx Express has     unconditionally guaranteed $755 million in principal of     these bonds (with total future principal and interest payments     of approximately $1.1 billion as of May 31,     2007) through these leases. Of the $755 million bond     principal guaranteed, $204 million was included in capital     lease obligations in our balance sheet at May 31, 2007. The     remaining $551 million has been accounted for as operating     leases.

Commitments to purchase aircraft in passenger     configuration do not include the attendant costs to modify these     aircraft for cargo transport unless we have entered into     non-cancelable commitments to modify such aircraft. Open     purchase orders that are cancelable are not considered     unconditional purchase obligations for financial reporting     purposes.         In September 2006, we announced a $2.6 billion multi-year     program to acquire and modify approximately 90 Boeing     757-200     (B757) aircraft to replace our narrowbody fleet of     Boeing     727-200     aircraft. We expect to bring the new aircraft into service     during the eight-year period between calendar years 2008 and     2016 contingent upon identification and purchase of suitable     B757 aircraft. As of May 31, 2007, we had entered into     agreements to purchase 30 B757 aircraft under this program.         In November 2006, we entered into an agreement to acquire 15 new     Boeing 777 Freighter (B777F) aircraft and an option     to purchase an additional 15 B777F aircraft. In connection with     the decision to purchase these aircraft, we cancelled our order     of ten Airbus A380-800F aircraft. In March 2007, we entered into     a separate settlement agreement with Airbus that, among other     things, provides us with credit memoranda applicable to the     purchase of goods and services in the future. The net impact of     this settlement was immaterial to our 2007 results and was     recorded as an operating gain during the fourth quarter of 2007.         Deposits and progress payments of $109 million have been     made toward aircraft purchases, options to purchase additional     aircraft and other planned aircraft-related transactions. In     addition, we have committed to modify our DC10 aircraft for     two-man cockpit configurations. Future payments related to these     activities are included in the table above. Aircraft and     aircraft-related contracts are subject to price escalations. The     following table is a summary of the number and type of aircraft     we are committed to purchase as of May 31, 2007, with the     year of expected delivery:                                                                                 A300           A310           B757           B777F           Total               2008                     9                   2                   7                                      18          2009                     3                                      13                                      16          2010                                                           4                   6                   10          2011                                                           3                   9                   12          2012                                                           3                                      3          Thereafter                                                                                                                                                                                                 Total                     12                   2                   30                   15                   59                                                                                                         NOTE 17:     CONTINGENCIES       Wage-and-Hour.  We     are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in federal or     California state courts containing various     class-action     allegations under federal or California     wage-and-hour     laws. The plaintiffs in these lawsuits allege, among other     things, that they were forced to work off the clock,     were not paid overtime and were not provided work breaks or     other benefits. The plaintiffs generally seek unspecified     monetary damages, injunctive relief, or both. We have denied any     liability and intend to vigorously defend ourselves. Given the     nature and preliminary status of these     wage-and-hour     claims, we cannot yet determine the amount or a reasonable range     of potential loss in these matters, if any.     Independent Contractor.  FedEx Ground is     involved in numerous purported     class-action     lawsuits and other proceedings that claim that the     companys owner-operators should be treated as employees,     rather than independent contractors. These matters include     Estrada v. FedEx Ground, a class action involving     single work area contractors that was filed in California state     court. Although the trial court granted some of the     plaintiffs claims for relief in Estrada ($18 million,     inclusive of attorneys fees, plus equitable relief), the     appellate court has reversed the trial courts issuance of     equitable relief. The plaintiffs petitioned the California     Supreme        101    Table of Contents     FEDEX     CORPORATION      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)        Court for a review of the appellate court decision, and that     petition was denied. The rest of the appeal is pending.         Adverse determinations in these matters could, among other     things, entitle certain of our contractors to the reimbursement     of certain expenses and to the benefit of     wage-and-hour     laws and result in employment and withholding tax liability for     FedEx Ground. On August 10, 2005, the Judicial Panel on     Multi-District Litigation granted our motion to transfer and     consolidate the majority of the     class-action     lawsuits for administration of the pre-trial proceedings by a     single federal court  the U.S. District Court     for the Northern District of Indiana. We strongly believe that     FedEx Grounds owner-operators are properly classified as     independent contractors and that we will prevail in these     proceedings. Given the nature and preliminary status of these     claims, we cannot yet determine the amount or a reasonable range     of potential loss in these matters, if any.     Race Discrimination.  During the fourth quarter     of 2007, we settled Satchell v. FedEx Express, a     class action lawsuit in California that alleged discrimination     by FedEx Express in the Western region of the United States     against certain current and former minority employees in pay and     promotion. The settlement will require a payment of     approximately $55 million by FedEx Express, which is     covered by insurance. The court has granted preliminary approval     of the settlement, and a hearing is scheduled for August 2007     for the court to consider final approval of the settlement.     Other.  FedEx and its subsidiaries are subject     to other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of     their business. In the opinion of management, the aggregate     liability, if any, with respect to these other actions will not     materially adversely affect our financial position, results of     operations or cash flows.           NOTE 18:     RELATED     PARTY TRANSACTIONS           Two of our sponsorships of professional sports venues involve     related parties.

NOTE 20:     CONDENSED     CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS           We are required to present condensed consolidating financial     information in order for the subsidiary guarantors (other than     FedEx Express) of our public debt to be exempt from reporting     under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.         The guarantor subsidiaries, which are wholly owned by FedEx,     guarantee approximately $1.7 billion of our debt. The     guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several. Our     guarantor subsidiaries were not determined using geographic,     service line or other similar criteria, and as a result, the     Guarantor and     Non-Guarantor     columns each include portions of our domestic and international     operations. Accordingly, this basis of presentation is not     intended to present our financial condition, results of     operations or cash flows for any purpose other than to comply     with the specific

DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK      INTEREST RATES.  While we currently have market     risk sensitive instruments related to interest rates, we have no     significant exposure to changing interest rates on our long-term     debt because the interest rates are fixed on the majority of our     long-term debt. At May 31, 2007, we had approximately     $500 million of outstanding floating-rate senior unsecured     debt issued in August 2006. This floating rate debt matures in     August 2007. We have not employed interest rate hedging to     mitigate the risks with respect to this borrowing. A     hypothetical 10% increase in the interest rate on our     outstanding floating-rate debt would not have a material effect     on our results of operations. In 2006, we had approximately     $118 million of outstanding floating-rate borrowings     related to leases for two MD-11 aircraft that were consolidated     under the provisions of FIN 46, Consolidation of     Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB     No. 51. FedEx Express purchased these aircraft in     March 2007, extinguishing this debt. As disclosed in Note 6     to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we had     outstanding fixed-rate, long-term debt (exclusive of capital     leases) with an estimated fair value of $2.4 billion at     May 31, 2007 and $2.2 billion at May 31, 2006.     Market risk for fixed-rate, long-term debt is estimated as the     potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical     10% increase in interest rates and amounts to approximately     $36 million as of May 31, 2007 and $42 million as     of May 31, 2006. The underlying fair values of our     long-term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or     on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and     maturities.     FOREIGN CURRENCY.  While we are a global     provider of transportation,     e-commerce     and business services, the substantial majority of our     transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The     distribution of our foreign currency denominated transactions is     such that currency declines in some areas of the world are often     offset by currency gains in other areas of the world. The     principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are     exposed are in the euro, Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar, Great     Britain pound and Japanese yen. During 2007 and 2006, we believe     operating income was positively impacted due to foreign currency     fluctuations. However, favorable foreign currency fluctuations     also may have had an offsetting impact on the price we obtained     or the demand for our services. At May 31, 2007, the result     of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar     relative to the currencies in which our transactions are     denominated would result in a decrease in operating income of     approximately $151 million for 2008 (the comparable amount     in the prior year was approximately $135 million). This     theoretical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would     change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar.         In practice, our experience is that exchange rates in the     principal foreign markets where we have foreign currency     denominated transactions tend to have offsetting fluctuations.     Therefore, the calculation above is not indicative of our actual     experience in foreign currency transactions. In addition to the     direct effects of changes in exchange rates, fluctuations in     exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign     currency sales price as competitors services become more     or less attractive. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of     changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a     potential change in sales levels or local currency prices.     COMMODITY.  We have market risk for changes in     the price of jet and diesel fuel; however, this risk is largely     mitigated by our fuel surcharges. Our fuel surcharges are     closely linked to market prices for fuel. Therefore, a     hypothetical 10% change in the price of fuel would not be     expected to materially affect our earnings. However, our fuel     surcharges have a lag that exists before they are adjusted for     changes in fuel prices and fuel prices can fluctuate within     certain ranges before resulting in a change in our fuel     surcharges. Therefore, our operating income may be affected     should the spot price of fuel suddenly change by a significant     amount or change by amounts that do not result in a change in     our fuel surcharges.
