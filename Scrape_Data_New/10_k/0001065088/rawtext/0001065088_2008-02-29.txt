ITEM 1:     BUSINESS       Overview         eBay Inc. was formed as a sole proprietorship in September 1995     and was incorporated in California in May 1996. In April 1998,     we reincorporated in Delaware, and in September 1998, we     completed the initial public offering of our common stock. Our     principal executive offices are located at 2145 Hamilton Avenue,     San Jose, California 95125, and our telephone number is     (408) 376-7400.     When we refer to we, our or     eBay in this Annual Report on     Form 10-K,     we mean the current Delaware corporation (eBay Inc.) and its     California predecessor, as well as all of our consolidated     subsidiaries. When we refer to eBay.com, we mean the     online marketplace located at www.ebay.com and its     localized counterparts. When we refer to PayPal, we     mean the online payments platform located at www.paypal.com     and its localized counterparts. When we refer to     Skype, we mean the Voice over Internet Protocol, or     VoIP, offerings provided by our subsidiary Skype Technologies     S.A.         Our purpose is to pioneer new communities around the world built     on commerce, sustained by trust and inspired by opportunity. We     provide online marketplaces for the sale of goods and services     as well as other online commerce, or ecommerce, platforms,     online payments services and online communications offerings to     a diverse community of individuals and businesses.         We have three operating segments: Marketplaces, Payments and     Communications. Our Marketplaces segment enables online commerce     through a variety of platforms, including the traditional     eBay.com platform and our other online platforms, such as our     classifieds websites, as well as Half.com, Rent.com,     Shopping.com and StubHub. The wide array of websites that     comprise our Marketplaces segment brings together millions of     buyers and sellers every day on a local, national and     international basis. Our Payments segment, which consists of     PayPal, enables individuals and businesses to securely, easily     and quickly send and receive payments online. Our Communications     segment, which consists of Skype, enables VoIP communications     between Skype users and provides low-cost connectivity to     traditional fixed-line and mobile telephones.     Marketplaces         Our Marketplaces segment is comprised of online commerce     platforms that enable a global community of buyers and sellers     to interact and trade with one another. Our goal is to create,     maintain and expand the functionality, safety, ease-of-use and     reliability of our online commerce platforms while supporting     the growth and success of our community of users.        3    Table of Contents   Marketplaces     Value Proposition         We seek to attract buyers and sellers to our community by     offering:                      Buyers         Sellers                 Selection             Access to broad global markets           Value             Cost effective marketing and distribution           Convenience             Access to large buyer base           Entertainment             Good conversion rates              We believe our Marketplaces platforms make inefficient markets     more efficient because:                         Our global community of users can easily and inexpensively     communicate, exchange information and complete transactions;                    Our Marketplaces platforms include more than a hundred million     items on any given day and make available to our users a wide     variety and selection of goods; and                    We bring buyers and sellers together for lower fees than     traditional intermediaries.           We seek to create a global platform that enables individuals and     businesses of all types and sizes to access broad markets. We     have aggregated a significant number of buyers, sellers and     items listed for sale, which, in turn, has resulted in a vibrant     online commerce environment. Our sellers generally enjoy good     conversion rates and our buyers enjoy an extensive selection of     goods and services. Key components of our community philosophy     are maintaining honest and open marketplaces and treating     individual users with respect. We seek to maintain the     satisfaction and loyalty of our buyers and sellers by offering a     variety of community and support features, such as announcement     and bulletin boards, customer support boards and personal pages,     as well as other topical or category-specific information     exchanges.         Markets of goods with broad buyer and seller bases, wide product     ranges and moderate shipping costs have generally been     successful on our Marketplaces platforms. Generally speaking,     our Marketplaces platforms are more effective, relative to     available alternatives, at addressing markets of scarce new     goods, end-of-life products and used and vintage items. Our     highest growth, however, has been in our fixed-price listing     format, primarily for new     in-season     items.         Our historical success has resulted largely from the size of our     community of active users. We had approximately 83 million     active users at the end of 2007, compared to approximately     82 million at the end of 2006. We define an active user as     any user who bid on, bought, or listed an item during the most     recent     12-month     period.     Marketplaces     Platforms Overview         Our Marketplaces platforms seek to bring buyers and sellers     together through fully automated and easy-to-use online websites     that are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, from     any place in the world at any time. The platforms include     software tools and services, some available at no charge and     others for a fee, that allow buyers and sellers to trade with     one another more easily and efficiently. The Marketplaces     platforms consist of our core online commerce platform, eBay.com     and its localized counterparts, and adjacent platforms     consisting of our classifieds websites, as well as Half.com,     Rent.com, Shopping.com and StubHub. Our Marketplaces platforms     earn revenue from, as the case may be, listing, feature,     subscription and final value fees paid by sellers, lead referral     fees, transaction fees and advertising fees.     eBay.com     Platform         Our Marketplaces core platform, eBay.com, includes our     traditional auction-style format and fixed-price formats such as     Buy-It-Now and eBay Stores. We offer the core platform on     localized websites in 28 countries. In 2007, our auction-style     listing format accounted for approximately 60% of our Gross     Merchandise Volume, or GMV, which is the total value of all     successfully closed items between users on our Marketplaces     trading platform websites during the period, regardless of     whether the buyer and seller actually consummated the     transaction        4    Table of Contents       (excluding Rent.com, Shopping.com and eBays classified     websites), while the fixed-price listing format accounted for     the remaining 40% of our 2007 GMV.     Auction-Style     Listing Format         Our traditional auction-style format allows a seller to select a     minimum price for opening bids, with the option to set a reserve     price for the item, which is the minimum price at which the     seller is willing to sell the item. A seller with appropriate     feedback ratings can also sell in a Multiple     Item Auction format, which allows a seller to sell     multiple identical items to the highest bidders.     Fixed-Price     Listing Format         Our fixed-price format allows buyers and sellers to accelerate     the transaction process rather than waiting for the auction     period to expire. Sellers with appropriate feedback ratings can     choose to use the Buy-It-Now feature at the time an     item is listed, which allows sellers to name a price at which     they would be willing to sell the item to a buyer. Our Half.com     subsidiary also provides a fixed-price, person-to-person online     commerce platform that allows people to buy and sell new and     previously owned books, movies, music and games at discounted     prices.         In addition, eBay Stores enable sellers to exhibit all of their     listings in one place on our eBay platform and to describe their     respective businesses through customized pages. eBay Stores     provides sellers with useful tools to build, manage, promote and     track their businesses. Store Inventory Format     listings allow sellers to list items for a minimum     30-day     listing period at a lower insertion fee and higher final value     fee than regular auction-style and fixed-price listings. As of     December 31, 2007, there were over 532,000 online     storefronts established by users in locations around the world.     Other     Marketplaces Platforms and Services     Classifieds     Websites         Our classifieds websites are available in hundreds of cities and     regions around the world and are designed to help people meet,     share ideas and trade on a local level. Our classifieds websites     include Kijiji, Gumtree.com, LoQUo.com, OpusForum,     Marktplaats.nl and mobile.de. In addition, we have a minority     equity investment in craigslist, Inc., which operates the     craigslist classifieds websites around the world. Our classified     websites are monetized primarily through advertising.     Rent.com         Rent.com is a leading U.S. listing website in the rental     housing industry. The website is designed to bring apartment     seekers and apartment managers together in an efficient manner.     Landlords pay a fee to Rent.com for renters who indicate that     they have found their apartments through Rent.com.     Shopping.com         Shopping.com is a leading comparison shopping destination     featuring products from thousands of merchants across the     Internet. Shopping.com offers one of the largest product     catalogs on the Internet  searchable by thousands of     attributes  along with consumer product reviews     through Epinions.com, which help users make informed buying     decisions. Retailers pay a fee to Shopping.com for shoppers     directed to their sites by Shopping.com.     StubHub         StubHub is a leading U.S. ticket marketplace, enabling fans     to buy and sell tickets to a large selection of sporting,     concert, theater and other live entertainment events. StubHub     provides a marketplace dedicated solely to tickets and is     designed to enable users to buy or sell their tickets in a     secure, convenient and highly reliable environment. Buyers and     sellers pay fees to StubHub when tickets are bought and sold.        5    Table of Contents   Online     Advertising and Other Services         We work with strategic partners in a variety of areas, such as     online advertising, mailing and other services, that allow us to     extend the monetization of our platforms and user base.      Key     Services for Buyers and Sellers         We have developed a number of features on our platforms in the     areas of Trust and Safety, Customer Support and Value-Added     Tools and Services, as well as Loyalty Programs. These features     are designed to make users more comfortable dealing with unknown     trading partners and completing commercial transactions on the     Internet.     Trust and     Safety     Feedback Forum:  Our Feedback Forum encourages     users to provide feedback ratings and comments on other users     with whom they trade. Users profiles, which include these     feedback ratings and comments, can be viewed by any of our other     users. Every registered user has a feedback profile that may     contain compliments, criticisms     and/or other     comments by users who have conducted business with that user.     The Feedback Forum requires feedback to be related to specific     transactions and provides an easy tool for users to match     specific transactions with the user names of their trading     partners. This information is recorded in a profile that     includes a feedback rating for the user, with feedback sorted     according to whether the feedback has been provided over the     past month, six months or twelve months. Users who develop     positive reputations have color-coded star symbols displayed     next to their user names to indicate the number of positive     feedback ratings they have received. In addition to leaving an     overall Feedback rating (positive, neutral or negative) for a     seller, buyers also can leave anonymous Detailed Seller Ratings     (DSR) that cannot be viewed by the seller in four     areas: item as described, communication, shipping time and     shipping and handling charges. The Feedback Forum has several     automated features designed to detect and prevent certain forms     of abuse, such as a user leaving positive feedback about himself     or herself through multiple accounts. We recently announced     updates to our feedback system, including removing the ability     of sellers to leave negative feedback for buyers and providing     sellers with additional tools designed to avoid negative     feedback.     SafeHarbor Program:  We also offer the     SafeHarbor program, which provides guidelines for trading and     user dispute resolution. Our SafeHarbor staff investigates     users complaints of possible misuse of eBay platforms and     takes appropriate action, including issuing warnings to users,     ending and removing listings, or suspending users from bidding     on or listing items for sale.     Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) Program:  The VeRO     Program lets intellectual property rights owners request the     removal of listings that offer items or contain materials that     infringe on their rights. This helps to protect community     members from purchasing items that may be counterfeit or     otherwise unauthorized.     Customer     Support         We devote significant resources to providing personalized,     accurate and timely support services to our community of users.     Buyers and sellers can contact us through a variety of means,     including email, online text chat and, in certain circumstances,     telephone.

In addition, top eBay     sellers who qualify for our PowerSeller program receive     prioritized customer support.

We currently provide these services directly or through     contractual arrangements with third parties.     PowerSeller program:  PowerSellers are     eBays top sellers who have consistently sustained a high     volume of monthly sales and who have a high level of positive     feedback. Members of the PowerSeller program get a range of     special benefits, including pricing discounts, prioritized     customer support, promotional offers, eBay promotional     merchandise, advanced selling education, opportunities to     participate in research and other special rewards. The     PowerSeller program is free of charge and a special PowerSeller     icon is located next to the sellers user name if the     seller qualifies for the program. In January 2008, we announced     that we would raise the standards for sellers to qualify for our     PowerSeller program and would provide additional benefits, such     as pricing discounts for qualified PowerSellers with high DSR     ratings.     Top buyer program:  Our top buyers benefit from     having a special phone number to call if they have an     unsatisfactory user experience in connection with a transaction     on our websites, and we recently announced that we would also     offer special coupon initiatives to top buyers.     Marketplaces     Growth Strategy         We intend to continue to work toward our mission of creating the     worlds leading ecommerce franchise by investing in our     core Marketplaces segment and continuing to build our adjacent     Marketplaces businesses.         We intend to continue to enhance our core Marketplaces segment     by reinvesting in our customers, improving the buyer experience     and seller economics by enhancing our products and services,     improving Trust and Safety and customer support, extending our     product offerings into new formats, categories and geographies,     and experimenting with various pricing and buyer retention     strategies. We have made significant efforts to improve the user     experience over the course of 2007, including improvements to     the eBay.com homepage, the sites search functionality, the     ease with which sellers can list items, visual search, and the     expansion of our customer support infrastructure. We have begun     tailoring the features of our business model to the needs of     specific categories, such as motors, to help drive revenue, as     we recognize that a single user experience may not be optimal     for all products. Furthermore, we are        7    Table of Contents       invested heavily in promotions through marketing campaigns in     the U.S. and pricing promotions on our site to drive     traffic and continue the growth in GMV. We believe that these     measures will improve the number of items sold on our site and,     in turn, lead to higher GMV.         Another element of our growth strategy is to build adjacent     Marketplaces businesses, such as our classified platforms and     StubHub, which offer new formats and new monetization models, as     well as opportunities for growth beyond our core businesses. We     plan to continue to grow our adjacent Marketplaces businesses,     including our classifieds websites, Half.com, Rent.com, and     Shopping.com. In addition, we intend to expand our monetization     models through advertising partnerships.     Payments         Our global payments platform, PayPal, enables any individual or     business with an email address to securely, easily and quickly     send and receive payments online in over 190 markets worldwide.     We believe our global payments platform makes online commerce     more efficient compared to traditional payment alternatives such     as checks, money orders and credit cards via merchant accounts.     These traditional payment alternatives present various obstacles     to the online commerce experience, including lengthy processing     time, inconvenience and high costs. PayPal delivers a product     well-suited for online merchants and individuals by allowing     them to send and receive online payments securely, conveniently     and cost-effectively. The PayPal network builds on the existing     financial infrastructure of bank accounts and credit cards to     create a global, real-time payment solution.     PayPal     Value Proposition         Providing a more efficient and effective payment alternative for     users is essential to creating a faster, easier and safer online     commerce experience. Our PayPal online payments solution allows     account holders, as well as users of other online businesses, to     pay for their transactions securely, easily and quickly.     Buyer     Value Proposition         PayPal enables buyers to pay merchants without sharing sensitive     financial information. To make payments, buyers need to disclose     only their email addresses to recipients. Many buyers wary of     disclosing financial information online find this level of     personal privacy attractive. Buyers also benefit from     PayPals Buyer Protection Program, which reimburses buyers     using PayPal with respect to certain qualified purchases made on     eBay.com.     Seller     Value Proposition         PayPal offers online merchants an     all-in-one     payment processing solution that is less expensive than most     merchant accounts, offers industry-leading fraud prevention, and     enables merchants to conduct business with approximately     57 million PayPal registered active accounts in over 190     markets. PayPal also offers merchants the ability to maintain a     direct relationship with their customers.         A merchant can generally open a PayPal account and begin     accepting credit card payments within a few minutes. Most     merchants are approved instantly for a PayPal account, and do     not need to provide a personal guaranty, acquire any specialized     hardware, prepare an application, contact a payment gateway or     encrypt customer data. Furthermore, PayPal charges lower     transaction fees than most merchant accounts, and charges no     setup fees and few or no recurring monthly fees.         The account-based nature of PayPals network helps us to     detect and prevent fraud when funds enter, flow through, and     exit the PayPal network. Sellers can also reduce the risk of     transaction losses resulting from unauthorized credit card use     and fraudulent chargebacks if they comply with PayPals     Seller Protection Policy.     PayPal     Overview     Joining     the Network     PayPal offers three types of     accounts:  Personal, Business and Premier. A new     account holder typically opens an account to send money for an     eBay purchase or a purchase on another website, a payment for     services rendered,        8    Table of Contents       or a payment to an individual in lieu of cash. Allowing new     account holders to join the network when they make or receive     payments encourages PayPals natural, user-driven growth.     PayPals account     sign-up     process asks each new account holder to provide PayPal his or     her name, street address, phone number and email address. The     account holders email address serves as the unique account     identifier. PayPal also offers certain customers who sell on     their own websites the ability to accept credit card payments     from buyers without requiring the buyer to open a PayPal account.     Payment     Transaction Overview         Buyers make payments at the PayPal website (including for items     listed on eBay.com by sellers that accept PayPal as a payment     method), at other online businesses or platforms where the     seller has integrated PayPals Instant Purchase feature, or     at the websites of merchants that have integrated PayPals     Website Payments feature. To make a payment at PayPals     website, a buyer logs in to his or her account and enters the     recipients email address and the amount of the payment. To     make a payment through Instant Purchase or Website Payments, a     buyer selects an item for purchase, confirms the payment     information and enters his or her email address and password to     authorize the payment. The buyer chooses whether PayPal debits     the money from the buyers PayPal balance, credit card, or     bank account and the payment is then credited to the     recipients PayPal balance. In the case of an eCheck     payment, the transaction is held until the funds have cleared     the senders bank, which typically takes three to five     business days. In turn, the recipient can make payments to     others or withdraw his or her funds at any time via check (in     the U.S.), electronic funds transfer, or a PayPal-branded debit     card (which is only available to U.S. users).         PayPal earns revenues in several ways. First, PayPal earns     transaction fees when a Business or Premier account receives a     payment. Second, PayPal earns a foreign exchange fee when an     account holder converts a balance from one currency to another.     Third, PayPal earns fees from merchants who utilize     PayPals online payment processing services. Fourth, PayPal     earns fees when a user receives payments from outside the     U.S. Fifth, PayPal may earn fees when a user withdraws     money to a     non-U.S. bank     account, depending on the amount of the withdrawal. Sixth,     PayPal earns a return on certain customer balances. Finally,     PayPal may earn ancillary revenues from a suite of financial     products, described below.         PayPal incurs funding costs on payments at varying levels based     on the source of the payment. Costs associated with credit card     and debit card funded payments are significantly higher than     bank account or balance-funded payments. U.S. account     holders who choose to maintain PayPal balances in     U.S. dollars have the ability to sweep balances into the     PayPal Money Market Fund. This Money Market Fund, which is     invested in a portfolio managed by Barclays Global     Fund Advisors, bore a current compound annual yield of     3.62% as of February 14, 2008.     Verification     of Account Holders         To fund payments from their bank accounts in the United States,     account holders must first become verified by PayPal. The     primary method for verification is our Random Deposit technique.     Under this technique, PayPal makes two deposits ranging from 1     cent to 99 cents to the account holders bank account. To     verify ownership of the account, the account holder then enters     the two amounts as a four-digit code at the PayPal website. In     addition to allowing funding through bank accounts, verification     also removes some spending limits on account holders     accounts and gives them reputational advantages when transacting     with other members of the PayPal community.     Withdrawing     Money         Each account holder in the U.S. and in 34 other countries     may withdraw money from his or her PayPal account through an     electronic fund transfer to his or her bank account or, in the     U.S., by a mailed check from PayPal. Automated Clearing House,     or ACH, withdrawals may take three to five business days to     arrive in the account holders bank account, depending on     the bank. Anyone who can receive funds can make withdrawals to a     U.S. bank account. Mailed checks may take one to two weeks     to arrive, and PayPal charges $1.50 per check. Qualifying PayPal     business users in the U.S. can receive a PayPal ATM/debit     card, which provides these users with instant access to their     PayPal account balances. ATM/debit cardholders can withdraw     cash, for a $1.00 fee per transaction, from any ATM connected to     the Cirrus or Maestro networks and can make purchases at any     merchant accepting MasterCard.        9    Table of Contents   PayPals     Trust and Safety Programs         We have developed a number of PayPal trust and safety programs,     including PayPals Seller Protection and Buyer Protection     Programs. These programs provide additional protection to     certain account holders who pay or receive payment for their     transactions through PayPal on eBay. PayPals Seller     Protection Program covers sellers for up to $5,000 per year on     certain reversed transactions. PayPals Buyer Protection     Program covers qualified purchases on eBay.com for up to $2,000     coverage at no cost (with different terms for transactions     denominated in     non-U.S. currencies).     In addition, our Fraud Investigation Team focuses on identifying     and preventing fraud before it occurs, detecting fraud in     process, mitigating loss if fraud does occur and delivering     information to law enforcement around the world to better combat     online fraud.     PayPal     Growth Strategy         We seek to become the online payment network of choice around     the world through our focus on simplifying the customer     experience, striving to be the most secure method of payment on     the Internet, enhancing the product offering for our merchants     and utilizing multiple sales channels. To establish PayPal as     the global standard in online payments, we intend to continue     focusing on increased user adoption of PayPal on our     Marketplaces platforms, and continued expansion of PayPals     Merchant Services business and our financial products business.     Marketplaces         PayPals services are integrated into the checkout flow of     the eBay.com platform in our key markets, including the U.S.,     Germany, the U.K. and Canada. In 2007, eBay.com generated more     than $59 billion in GMV. PayPal, in turn, generated     approximately $28 billion of net Total Payment Volume     from eBay.com transactions, which represented approximately 58%     of PayPals net Total Payment Volume during 2007. Net     Total Payment Volume is the total dollar volume of payments, net     of payment reversals, successfully completed through the PayPal     system, excluding PayPals payment gateway business.         We intend to increase PayPals penetration of GMV on the     eBay.com platform globally by continuing to integrate with eBay     listings and new formats, including our adjacent Marketplaces     businesses, focusing on buyer protection programs and adding     product features and innovations important to the Marketplaces     community. We believe that our expansion into an increased     number of international markets and currencies will continue to     make cross-border transactions easier and more efficient,     benefiting both our Marketplaces and Payments segments.     Merchant     Services         Our Merchant Services business offers a differentiated product     solution for each merchant category, while providing a     cost-effective and secure payment solution across all     categories. In 2007, PayPal expanded its presence to ecommerce     websites such as Southwest Airlines, BlueNile.com, Lindt     Chocolatier, Toys R Us and Barnes & Noble. We intend     to continue to market our global payments solution to spur our     growth as a payment solution off of eBay.com for sole     proprietors and small, medium and large businesses.         We also intend to grow our Merchant Services business by     enhancing our product offering and leveraging our multiple sales     channels to expand our network of merchants globally.     Financial     Products         We will continue to identify transactions and markets not served     adequately by existing payment systems and seek to develop     product features that improve upon those legacy systems. In     addition, we intend to expand the breadth of products and     services available to our account holders and have begun     offering financial products such as the following:                         PayPal Buyer Credit, a personal credit account issued by GE     Money Bank, which allows users to buy now and pay later for     their PayPal purchases;                    PayPal ATM/Debit Card, which enables business users to withdraw     funds from their PayPal accounts at ATMs, pay for offline     purchases with funds from their PayPal account, and qualify to     receive cash back;          10    Table of Contents                         PayPal Plus Credit Card and eBay MasterCard issued by GE Money     Bank, which allow users to earn rewards on purchases made     offline or using PayPal. We also offer a PayPal Credit Card to     UK users through GE Money;                    PayPal Plug In, which allows users to use their PayPal account     to make payments on the Internet everywhere that MasterCard is     accepted (including websites that do not accept PayPal);                    PayPal Pay Later, which is a personal transactional credit     account issued by GE Money Bank that allows users to finance     PayPal purchases; and                    PayPal Money Market Fund, which allows participants to earn a     yield on the funds in their PayPal account.       Communications         We added the Communications segment through our acquisition of     Skype in October 2005. Founded in August 2003, Skype is a     leading global Internet communications company and is     headquartered in Luxembourg, with offices in Europe, the     U.S. and Asia.     Skype     Value Proposition         Skype seeks to set the standard in providing new and easy ways     to stay in touch over the Internet. Our vision is to enable our     users to communicate freely at home, at work and on the move.     Skype offers a simple, convenient, and cost-effective way for     people anywhere in the world to communicate from their computers     over the Internet to other computers, landlines and mobile     phones.     Skype     Overview         Millions of people everyday make free Skype-to-Skype voice and     video calls and send instant messages using Skype. Skype users     pay a low per-minute fee for long-distance and international     calls to landlines and mobile phones, and pay fees for other     features such as SMS (text messaging), voicemail and call     forwarding. Skype users can also purchase a variety of     subscription plans that provide an unlimited number of calls.         Highlights of Skypes activities in 2007 included:     Skypes launch of the 3 Skypephone in partnership     with mobile operator 3; an agreement with Wal-Mart to sell     Skype-certified hardware devices and prepaid cards with Skype     credit throughout Wal-Mart stores in the U.S.; a global     partnership between Skype and MySpace to bring Internet voice     communications to MySpace users; and the introduction of Skype     Send Money, which allows users to send/receive money using     PayPal through the Skype client. We continue to make     improvements to the Skype product, and late in 2007, we launched     Skype 3.6, which provides High Quality Video calling through a     collaboration with Logitech.     User     Base         Skype software has been downloaded more than half a billion     times and is available in over 34 languages. As of     December 31, 2007, Skype had over 276 million     registered users and was used in almost every country around the     world.         Skype software is designed to be extremely secure, sustainable     and scalable. At peak times, there are over 11 million     concurrent users and over 180,000 simultaneous calls.     Ecosystem         Skype has a large and expanding ecosystem that includes nearly     6,000 developers and over 50 partners. As of December 31,     2007, there were more than 190 Skype Certified hardware products.     Skype     Growth Strategy         To expand upon Skypes position as a leading global     Internet communications company, we will continue to focus on     acquiring new users and converting users to premium offerings,     while further developing two broad areas        11    Table of Contents       of Skypes business: existing telephony products and new     ecommerce opportunities. Part of our strategy to acquire new     users is to achieve a desktop presence. In order to do this, we     have partnered with certain computer manufacturers to include     Skype software in their new computers.     Existing     Internet Communications (VoIP) Products         Our strategy for driving growth from existing Internet     communications (VoIP) products relies on acquiring new users and     developing better products and innovative new features. In 2007,     we launched a new global pricing structure that gives users an     easy-to-understand     all-in-one     Skype package. This package offers a simple, convenient and     cost-effective way for consumers worldwide to call landlines and     mobile phones over the Internet.         To continue growing the number of Skype users and improving the     Skype experience, we will continue to work with our partners to     develop and introduce new Skype Certified devices, including     telephones and accessories, many of which eliminate the need for     a computer to make Skype calls over the Internet. In 2007, Skype     and 3, a mobile phone operator, launched a 3G Internet phone     that allows users to make free Skype-to-Skype calls and send     free Skype instant messages with the push of a button from their     mobile phone to other Skype users no matter where they are.         In addition to working with our partners, we will continue to     make Skype Certified products available directly to our users     through Skypes Internet store as well as through other     retail channels.     New     Ecommerce Opportunities         We plan on expanding Skypes presence within our existing     businesses because communication via email  the     traditional way for buyers and sellers to     communicate  can be a source of friction in the     online shopping experience, due primarily to delays in response     time. Skype enables us to create new channels for ecommerce     activity that help to streamline the online shopping experience.     Communication via Skype allows buyers and sellers to benefit     from being able to communicate directly with each other in an     instantaneous and private environment. Skype also offers Skype     Prime, which creates a marketplace for users to share their     knowledge, talent, skills and services with other users.     Other     Items     Employees         As of December 31, 2007, eBay Inc. and its subsidiaries     employed approximately 15,500 people (including temporary     employees), approximately 9,500 of whom were located in the U.S.     Competition         We encounter vigorous competition in our businesses from     numerous sources. Our users can find, buy, sell and pay for     similar items through a variety of competing channels. These     include, but are not limited to, online and offline retailers,     distributors, liquidators, import and export companies, online     and offline auctioneers, catalog and mail-order companies,     classifieds, directories, search engines, products of search     engines, virtually all online and offline commerce participants     (consumer-to-consumer, business-to-consumer and     business-to-business), online and offline shopping channels and     networks. As our product offerings continue to broaden into new     categories of items and new commerce formats, we expect to face     additional competition from other online and offline channels     for those new offerings. We also compete on the basis of price,     product selection, and services. Our growth rates in our most     mature markets have significantly slowed and we are losing     market share in some segments. For our Payments segment, our     users may choose to pay through a variety of alternative means,     including other online payment services, offline payment methods     such as cash, check or money order, and traditional online or     offline credit card merchant accounts. For our Communications     segment, our users may choose to use their local telephone     companies, cable providers and other VoIP providers. To compete     effectively, we may need to expend significant resources in     technology and marketing. These efforts may be expensive and     could reduce our margins and have a materially adverse effect on     our business, financial position, operating results and cash     flows and reduce the trading price of our stock. We believe that     we will be able to maintain profitability by preserving and     expanding the        12    Table of Contents       abundance and diversity of our users online community and     enhancing our user experience, but we may not be able to     continue to manage our operating expenses to avoid or reduce a     decline in our consolidated net income. For more information     regarding these risks, see the information in     Item 1A: Risk Factors under the caption     Our industry is intensely competitive, and other companies     or governmental agencies may allege that our behavior is     anti-competitive.     Seasonality         Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter     of sequential revenue growth. We expect transaction activity     patterns on our websites to increasingly mirror general consumer     buying patterns as our businesses continue to mature. Please see     the information in Item 7: Managements     Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of     Operations under the heading Seasonality.     Technology     Marketplaces     and Payments         Our Marketplaces and Payments platforms utilize a combination of     proprietary technologies and services as well as technologies     and services provided by others. We have developed intuitive     user interfaces, customer tools and transaction processing,     database and network applications that help enable our users to     reliably and securely complete transactions on our sites. Our     technology infrastructure simplifies the storage and processing     of large amounts of data, eases the deployment and operation of     large-scale global products and services and automates much of     the administration of large-scale clusters of computers. Our     infrastructure has been designed around industry-standard     architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or     catastrophic occurrences. We are continually improving our     technology to enhance the customer experience and to increase     efficiency, scalability and security. For information regarding     technology related risks, see the information in     Item 1A: Risk Factors under the captions     Our failure to manage growth could harm our     business, and System failures could harm our     business.     Communications         Skypes VoIP communication and other services are delivered     through a peer-to-peer network architecture, in which users     joining the network provide a significant portion of the     technology resources (for example, computer bandwidth and     hardware) that enable Skypes services. To access     Skypes services, users download Skype software over the     Internet. Skype utilizes a combination of proprietary     technologies and services as well as technologies and services     provided by others to design, develop and support its products.     For more information regarding Skypes technology risks,     see the information in Item 1A: Risk Factors     under the caption Skype depends on key technology that is     licensed from third parties.     Intellectual     Property         We regard the protection of our intellectual property as     critical to our success. We have entered into confidentiality     and invention assignment agreements with our employees and     contractors, and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom     we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure     of our proprietary information.         We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by     relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as a     variety of administrative procedures. We actively pursue the     registration of our trademarks, copyrights, patents and domain     names in the U.S. and international jurisdictions. The     expansion of our business has required us to protect our     trademarks, patents and domain names in an increasing number of     jurisdictions, a process that is expensive, may require     litigation, and may not be successful in every location. We have     registered our core brands as trademarks and domain names in the     U.S. and a large number of other jurisdictions and have in     place an active program to continue to secure trademarks and     domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of     interest. If we are unable to secure our trademarks or domain     names, we could be adversely affected in any jurisdiction in     which our trademarks or domain names are not registered.        13    Table of Contents       Third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may     claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual     property rights. We currently are involved in several such legal     proceedings. Please see the information in Item 3:     Legal Proceedings and in Item 1A: Risk     Factors under the captions We are subject to patent     litigation and We may be unable to protect or     enforce our own intellectual property rights adequately.     Segments     and Geographic Information         For an analysis of financial information about our segments as     well as our geographic areas, see Note 4      Segments to our consolidated financial statements included     elsewhere in this Annual Report on     Form 10-K.

ITEM 1A:     RISK     FACTORS       Risk     Factors That May Affect Results of Operations and Financial     Condition     The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only     ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate     or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results     of operations and financial condition.     Our     operating results may fluctuate.         Our operating results have varied on a quarterly basis during     our operating history. Our operating results may fluctuate     significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which     are outside our control. Factors that may affect our operating     results include the following:                         our ability to retain an active user base, attract new users,     and encourage existing users to list items for sale, purchase     items through our websites, or use our payment service or     communication software and products;                    our ability to increase activity of the users of our     Marketplaces business, especially with respect to our top buyers     and sellers, in our most mature geographies, especially the     U.S., Germany and the U.K.;                    the volume, size, timing, monetization, and completion rates of     transactions using our websites or technology;                    the amount and timing of operating costs and capital     expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our     businesses, operations, and infrastructure;                    the effect of recently announced changes to our pricing,     products and policies, including our buyer/seller feedback     features;                    the effect of recently announced management changes;                    general economic conditions, including higher inflation, the     possibility of a recession in the U.S. and interest rate     fluctuations, as well as those economic conditions specific to     the Internet and ecommerce industries;                    regulatory and legal actions imposing obligations on our     businesses or our users;                    new laws or regulations, or interpretations of existing laws or     regulations, that impose liability on us for actions of our     users or otherwise harm our business models or restrict the     Internet, electronic commerce, online payments, or online     communications;                    the actions of our competitors, including the introduction of     new sites, services, and products;                    consumer confidence in the safety and security of transactions     using our websites or technology and our ability to manage the     costs of our user protection programs;          14    Table of Contents                         our ability to manage PayPals transaction loss rate and     payment funding mix;                    the costs and results of litigation that involves us;                    our ability to successfully integrate and manage businesses that     we acquire;                    the cost and availability of online and traditional advertising,     and the success of our brand building and marketing campaigns;                    our ability to develop product enhancements, programs, and     features at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner;                    our ability to upgrade and develop our systems, infrastructure,     and customer service capabilities to accommodate growth and to     improve our websites at a reasonable cost while maintaining 24/7     operations;                    technical difficulties or service interruptions involving our     websites or services provided to us or our users by third     parties;                    our ability to comply with the requirements of entities whose     services are required for our operations, such as credit card     associations and banks;                    our ability to expand PayPals product offerings outside of     the U.S. (including our ability to obtain any necessary     regulatory approvals);                    our ability to increase the acceptance of PayPal by online     merchants outside of our Marketplaces platforms, which may     require long implementation cycles and incentives to merchants     that are initially dilutive;                    our ability to integrate, manage, and profitably expand and more     effectively monetize the Skype business;                    our ability to attract new personnel in a timely and effective     manner and to retain key employees;                    the continued healthy operation of our technology suppliers and     other parties with whom we have commercial relations;                    continued consumer acceptance of the Internet as a medium for     commerce and communication in the face of increasing publicity     about fraud, spoofing, phishing, viruses, spyware, and other     dangers of the Internet; and                    geopolitical events such as war, threat of war, or terrorist     actions.           The increased variety of services offered on our websites makes     it difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our     revenues or earnings accurately. In view of the rapidly evolving     nature of our business and our limited operating history, we     believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating     results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them     as an indication of future performance. We do not have backlog,     and substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come from     transactions involving sales or payments during that quarter.     Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues, it is     also difficult to forecast income statement expenses as a     percentage of net revenues. Quarterly and annual income     statement expenses as a percentage of net revenues may be     significantly different from historical or projected rates. Our     operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below     the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that     event, the trading price of our common stock would almost     certainly decline.     We may     not maintain our level of profitability or rates of     growth.         We believe that our continued profitability and growth will     depend in large part on our ability to do the following:                         attract new users, keep existing users active and reactivate     former users on our websites and services, and increase the     activity levels of our active users;                    react to changes in consumer use of the Internet and changing     customer demands, and develop new services as well as new     sources of revenues from our existing services;          15    Table of Contents                         manage the costs of our business, including the costs associated     with our workforce and with maintaining and enhancing our     websites, customer support, transaction loss rate, user     protection programs, product development and international     expansion;                    maintain sufficient transaction volume to attract buyers and     sellers;                    cost effectively increase the awareness of our brands; and                    provide our customers with superior community, customer support,     and trading, communication, and payment experiences.           We invest heavily in marketing and promotion, customer support,     and further development of the operating infrastructure for our     core and recently acquired operations. Some of this investment     entails long-term contractual commitments. As a result, we may     be unable to adjust our spending rapidly enough to compensate     for any unexpected revenue shortfall, which may harm our     profitability. Growth rates in our most established markets,     such as the U.S., Germany and the U.K., have continued to     decline. Despite our efforts to stem these declines, growth     rates in these and other markets may continue to decline and may     become negative. As our penetration in established markets     grows, we will increasingly need to focus on keeping existing     users, especially our top buyers and sellers, active and     increasing their activity level on our sites for growth. In     addition, our Marketplaces business is facing increased     competitive pressure. If we are unable to change our services in     ways that reflect the changing demands of the ecommerce     marketplace, particularly the higher growth of sales of     fixed-price, new in-season items, our business will suffer.         In January 2008, we announced significant changes to our     Marketplaces business in three major areas: fee structure,     seller incentives and standards, and feedback, as discussed     above under Item 1  Business. These     changes have been controversial with many of our sellers. If     these changes cause sellers to move their business away from our     websites or otherwise fail to improve gross merchandise volume     or the number of successful listings, our operating results and     profitability will be harmed.         In addition, because a large percentage of PayPal transactions     originate on the eBay platform, declines in growth rates in     major Marketplaces markets also adversely affect PayPals     growth rate. The growth in Skypes user activity has slowed     somewhat as Skype has increased its focus on monetization of     users. The expected future growth of our PayPal, Skype, StubHub,     Shopping.com, and other lower margin businesses may also cause     downward pressure on our profit margins because those businesses     have lower gross margins than our Marketplaces platforms.     We are     exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest     rates.         Because we conduct a significant and growing portion of our     business outside the United States but report our results in     U.S. dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in     currency exchange rates. In connection with its multi-currency     service, PayPal fixes exchange rates twice per day, and may face     financial exposure if it incorrectly fixes the exchange rate or     if exposure reports are delayed. PayPal also holds some     corporate and customer funds in     non-U.S. currencies,     and thus its financial results are affected by the translation     of these     non-U.S. currencies     into U.S. dollars. In addition, the results of operations     of many of our internationally focused websites are exposed to     foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of     the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local     currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. If the     U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the     translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions     will result in increased net revenues, operating expenses, and     net income. Similarly, our net revenues, operating expenses, and     net income will be negatively impacted if the U.S. dollar     strengthens against foreign currencies. Net revenues in the     fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 were positively     impacted by foreign currency translation of $276 million,     compared to the prior fiscal year. Operating income for the     fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 was positively impacted     by foreign currency translation of $146 million, compared     to the prior fiscal year. As exchange rates vary, net sales and     other operating results, when translated, may differ materially     from expectations. In particular, to the extent the     U.S. dollar strengthens against the Euro, British pound,     Australian dollar, and Canadian dollar, our foreign revenues and     profits will be reduced as a result of these translation     adjustments. While from time to time we enter into transactions     to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure,     it is impossible to perfectly predict or completely eliminate     the effects of this        16    Table of Contents       exposure. In addition, to the extent the U.S. dollar     strengthens against the Euro, the British pound, the Australian     dollar, and the Canadian dollar, cross-border trade related to     purchases of dollar-denominated goods by     non-U.S. purchasers     may decrease, and that decrease may not be offset by a     corresponding increase in cross-border trade involving purchases     by U.S. buyers of goods denominated in other currencies.         In addition, we face exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.     For example, reductions in U.S. interest rates may reduce     our investment income, which in turn would lower our net     interest income.     The     listing or sale by our users of pirated or counterfeit items may     harm our business.         We have received in the past, and we anticipate receiving in the     future, communications alleging that certain items listed or     sold through our service by our users infringe third-party     copyrights, trademarks and trade names, or other intellectual     property rights. Although we have sought to work actively with     the owners of intellectual property rights to eliminate listings     offering infringing items on our websites, some rights owners     have expressed the view that our efforts are insufficient.     Content owners and other intellectual property rights owners     have been active in asserting their rights against online     companies, including eBay. Allegations of infringement of     intellectual property rights have resulted in threats of     litigation and actual litigation against us from time to time,     including litigation brought by Tiffany & Co. in the     U.S., Rolex S.A. in Germany, Louis Vuitton Malletier and     Christian Dior Couture in France, LOréal SA,     Lancôme Parfums et Beauté & Cie, and Laboratoire     Garnier & Cie in several European countries, and a     number of other owners of intellectual property rights. The     plaintiffs in these cases seek to hold eBay liable for     counterfeit items listed on our sites by third parties, for     tester and other not for resale consumer products     listed on our sites by third parties, for the misuse of     trademarks in listings or in connection with paid search     advertisements, or for alleged violations of selective     distribution channel laws. Such plaintiffs seek, among other     things, injunctive relief and damages. In the aggregate, these     suits could result in significant damage awards and could     adversely affect our business. Other luxury brand owners have     also filed suit against us or have threatened to do so. In     addition to litigation from rights owners, we may be subject to     criminal penalties if the authorities feel we have aided in the     sale of counterfeit goods. While we have had some early success     in defending against such litigation, more recent cases have     been based, at least in part, on different legal theories than     those of earlier cases, and there is no guarantee that we will     continue to be successful in defending against such litigation.     For example, the German Federal Supreme Court has ruled against     us in the Rolex and IVD cases. Plaintiffs in     recent cases have argued that we are not entitled to safe     harbors under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the     U.S. or as a hosting provider in the European Union because     of the active nature of our involvement with our sellers, and     that, whether or not such safe harbors are available, we should     be found liable because we have not adequately removed     counterfeit listings or effectively suspended users who have     created such listings.         Content owners and other intellectual property rights owners may     also seek to bring legal action against entities that are     peripherally involved in the sale of infringing items, such as     payment companies. To the extent that intellectual property     rights owners bring legal action against PayPal based upon the     use of PayPals payment services in a transaction involving     the sale of infringing items, including on our websites, our     business could be harmed.         Litigation and negative publicity has increased as our websites     gain prominence in markets outside of the U.S., where the laws     may be unsettled or less favorable to us. Such litigation is     costly for us, could result in damage awards, injunctive relief,     or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or     settlement, could require us to change our business practices in     expensive ways, or could otherwise harm our business. Litigation     against other online companies could result in interpretations     of the law that could also require us to change our business     practices or otherwise increase our costs. In addition, a public     perception that counterfeit or pirated items are commonplace on     our site could damage our reputation and our business.     We are     subject to patent litigation.         We have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other     parties patents. Some of these ongoing suits are described     under the heading Item 3: Legal Proceedings,     below. We are a defendant in other patent suits and we have been     notified of several other potential patent disputes, and expect     that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement     claims as our services expand in scope and complexity. In     particular, we expect that we may face        17    Table of Contents       additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects     of our Marketplaces, Payments and Communications segments. These     claims, whether meritorious or not, are time consuming and     costly to resolve, and could require expensive changes in our     methods of doing business, could require us to enter into costly     royalty or licensing agreements, or could require us to cease     conducting certain operations.     Use of     our services for illegal purposes could harm our     business.         The law relating to the liability of providers of online     services for the activities of their users on their service is     often challenged in the U.S. and internationally. Certain     goods, such as weapons, adult material, tobacco products,     alcohol, and other goods that may be subject to regulation have     been listed and traded on our services. We may be unable to     prevent our users from selling unlawful goods or services or     selling goods or services in an unlawful manner, and we may be     subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for     unlawful activities carried out by users through our services.     We have been subject to several lawsuits based upon such     allegations. In December 2004, an executive of Baazee.com, our     Indian subsidiary, was arrested in connection with a users     listing of a pornographic video clip on that website. Similarly,     our Korean subsidiary and one of its employees were found     criminally liable for listings on the Korean subsidiarys     website. The German Federal Supreme Court has ruled that we may     have a duty to take reasonable measures to keep prohibited DVDs     from being sold on our site to minors and that competitors may     be able to enforce this duty. Although we have prohibited the     listing of certain items and implemented other protective     measures, in the future, we may be required to spend substantial     resources to take additional protective measures or discontinue     certain service offerings, any of which could harm our business.     Any costs incurred as a result of potential liability relating     to the sale of unlawful goods or the unlawful sale of goods     could harm our business. In addition, we have received     significant and continuing media attention relating to the     listing or sale of unlawful goods using our services. This     negative publicity could damage our reputation and diminish the     value of our brand names. It also could make users reluctant to     use our services.         PayPals payment system is also susceptible to potentially     illegal or improper uses. These may include illegal online     gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illicit sales     of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of     software and other intellectual property, money laundering, bank     fraud, child pornography trafficking, prohibited sales of     alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, and online securities     fraud. Recent changes in law have increased the penalties for     intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal     activities. Despite measures PayPal has taken to detect and     lessen the risk of this kind of conduct, including PayPals     ability to fine users in certain jurisdictions up to $500 or     take legal action to recover its losses for certain violations     of PayPals acceptable use policy, including online     gambling and illegal sales of prescription medications. Illegal     activities could still be funded using PayPal.         PayPal is subject to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist     financing laws and regulations that prohibit, among other     things, its involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal     activities. Although PayPal has adopted a program to comply with     these laws and regulations, any errors or failure to implement     the program properly could lead to lawsuits, administrative     action, and prosecution by the government. In July 2003, PayPal     agreed with the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of     Missouri that it would pay $10 million as a civil     forfeiture to settle allegations that its provision of services     to online gambling merchants violated provisions of the USA     PATRIOT Act and further agreed to have its compliance program     reviewed by an independent audit firm. PayPal is also subject to     regulations that require it to report suspicious activities     involving transactions of $2,000 or more and may be required to     obtain and keep more detailed records on the senders and     recipients in certain transfers of $3,000 or more. The     interpretation of suspicious activities in this context is     uncertain. Future regulations under the USA PATRIOT Act may     require PayPal to revise the procedures it uses to verify the     identity of its customers and to monitor international     transactions more closely. As PayPal localizes its service in     other countries, additional verification and reporting     requirements may apply, which in some cases are more stringent.     Several countries, including Australia, Canada and Luxembourg,     are in the process of implementing new anti-money laundering and     counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations, and the impact     of these laws and regulations on PayPals business is     uncertain. These regulations could impose significant costs on     PayPal and make it more difficult for new customers to join its     network. PayPal could be required to learn more about its     customers before opening an account, to obtain additional     verification of customers and to monitor its customers     activities more closely. These requirements, as well as any     additional restrictions imposed by credit card associations,     could raise PayPals costs        18    Table of Contents       significantly and reduce the attractiveness of its product.     Failure to comply with federal, state or foreign country money     laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws could result in     significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, and     forfeiture of significant assets.     We are     subject to risks associated with information disseminated     through our service.         The law relating to the liability of online services companies     for information carried on or disseminated through their     services is currently unsettled. Claims could be made against     online services companies under both U.S. and foreign law     for defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence,     copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on     the nature and content of the materials disseminated through     their services. Several private lawsuits seeking to impose     liability upon us under a number of these theories have been     brought against us. In addition, domestic and foreign     legislation has been proposed that would prohibit or impose     liability for the transmission over the Internet of certain     types of information. Our service features a Feedback Forum,     which includes information from users regarding other users.     Although all such feedback is generated by users and not by us,     claims of defamation or other injury have been made in the past     and could be made in the future against us for content posted in     the Feedback Forum. Several court decisions have narrowed the     scope of the immunity provided to Internet service providers     like us under the Communications Decency Act. This trend, if     continued, may increase our potential liability to third parties     for the user-provided content on our sites. Our liability for     such claims may be higher in jurisdictions outside the     U.S. where laws governing Internet transactions are     unsettled. If we become liable for information provided by our     users and carried on our service in any jurisdiction in which we     operate, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to     implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability.     This may require us to expend substantial resources or to     discontinue certain service offerings, which would negatively     affect our financial results. In addition, the increased     attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these     lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or     otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred     as a result of this potential liability could harm our business.     Government     inquiries may lead to charges or penalties.         A large number of transactions occur on our websites. Government     regulators have received a significant number of consumer     complaints about both eBay and PayPal, which, while small as a     percentage of our total transactions, are large in aggregate     numbers. As a result, from time to time we have been contacted     by various foreign and domestic governmental regulatory agencies     that have questions about our operations and the steps we take     to protect our users from fraud. PayPal has received inquiries     regarding its restriction and disclosure practices from the     Federal Trade Commission and regarding these and other business     practices from the attorneys general of a number of states. In     September 2006, PayPal entered into a settlement agreement with     the attorneys general of a number of states under which it     agreed to pay $1.7 million to the attorneys general,     shorten and streamline its user agreement, increase educational     messaging to users about funding choices, and communicate more     information regarding protection programs to users. We are     likely to receive additional inquiries from regulatory agencies     in the future, which may lead to action against us. We have     responded to all inquiries from regulatory agencies by     describing our current and planned antifraud efforts, customer     support procedures, operating procedures and disclosures. If one     or more of these agencies is not satisfied with our response to     current or future inquiries, we could be subject to enforcement     actions, fines or other penalties, or forced to change our     operating practices in ways that could harm our business.     We are     subject to general litigation and regulatory     disputes.         From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or     regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of     business. The number and significance of these disputes and     inquiries are increasing as our business expands and our company     grows larger. We have in the past been forced to litigate such     claims. We may also become more vulnerable to third-party claims     as laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Lanham     Act and the Communications Decency Act are interpreted by the     courts and as we expand geographically into jurisdictions where     the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of     online intermediaries such as ourselves are either unclear or     less favorable. In Germany, the German Federal Supreme Court has     ruled that we may owe duties, under certain circumstances, to     content owners and competitors relating to taking reasonable     steps to prevent the listing of        19    Table of Contents       illegal, counterfeit, and pirated items. Any claims or     regulatory actions against us, whether meritorious or not, could     be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require     significant amounts of management time, and result in the     diversion of significant operational resources.     Failure     to deal effectively with fraudulent transactions and customer     disputes would increase our loss rate and harm our     business.         PayPals highly automated and liquid payment service makes     PayPal an attractive target for fraud. In configuring its     service, PayPal continually strives to maintain the right     balance of appropriate measures to promote both convenience and     security for customers. Identity thieves and those committing     fraud using stolen credit card or bank account numbers can     potentially steal large amounts of money from businesses such as     PayPal. We believe that several of PayPals current and     former competitors in the electronic payments business have gone     out of business or significantly restricted their businesses     largely due to losses from this type of fraud. While PayPal uses     advanced anti-fraud technologies, we expect that technically     knowledgeable criminals will continue to attempt to circumvent     PayPals anti-fraud systems. In addition, PayPals     service could be subject to employee fraud or other internal     security breaches, and PayPal may be required to reimburse     customers for any funds stolen as a result of such breaches.     Merchants could also request reimbursement, or stop using     PayPal, if they are affected by buyer fraud.         PayPal incurs substantial losses from merchant fraud, including     claims from customers that merchants have not performed or that     their goods or services do not match the merchants     description. PayPal also incurs losses from claims that the     customer did not authorize the purchase, from buyer fraud, from     erroneous transmissions, and from customers who have closed bank     accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments.     In addition to the direct costs of such losses, if they are     related to credit card transactions and become excessive, they     could result in PayPal losing the right to accept credit cards     for payment. If PayPal were unable to accept credit cards, the     velocity of trade on eBay could decrease, in which case our     business would further suffer. PayPal was assessed substantial     fines for excess chargebacks in 2001, and excessive chargebacks     may arise in the future. PayPal has taken measures to detect and     reduce the risk of fraud, but these measures need to be     continually improved and may not be effective against new forms     of fraud or in connection with new product offerings. If these     measures do not succeed, our business will suffer.         PayPal offers a buyer protection program for transactions on     eBay.com that refunds up to $2,000 to buyers who used PayPal in     transactions with selected sellers if the buyer did not receive     the goods they purchased or if the goods differed significantly     from what was described by the seller and up to $200 in most     other eBay transactions. PayPal has expanded this program to     many eBay international marketplaces, in most cases with lower     reimbursement amounts. If PayPal makes such a refund, it may     seek to collect reimbursement from the seller, but may not be     able to receive any funds from the seller. The PayPal buyer     protection program has increased PayPals loss rate and     could cause future fluctuations in PayPals loss rate. For     the full years ended December 31, 2006 and     December 31, 2007, PayPals transaction loss     (including both direct losses and buyer protection payouts)     totaled $126.4 million and $139.3 million,     representing 0.35% and 0.29% of PayPals net Total     Payment Volume, respectively.         eBay faces similar risks with respect to fraudulent activities     on its websites. eBay periodically receives complaints from     users who may not have received the goods that they had     purchased. In some cases individuals have been arrested and     convicted for fraudulent activities using our websites. eBay     also receives complaints from sellers who have not received     payment for the goods that a buyer had contracted to purchase.     Non-payment may occur because of miscommunication, because a     buyer has changed his or her mind and decided not to honor the     contract to purchase the item, or because the buyer bid on the     item maliciously in order to harm either the seller or eBay. In     some European jurisdictions, buyers may also have the right to     withdraw from a sale made by a professional seller within a     specified time period.         While eBay can suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill     their payment or delivery obligations to other users, eBay does     not have the ability to require users to make payment or deliver     goods, or otherwise make users whole other than through our     limited buyer protection programs. Other than through these     programs, eBay does not compensate users who believe they have     been defrauded by other users, although users who pay through     PayPal may have reimbursement rights from their credit card     company or bank, which in turn will seek reimbursement        20    Table of Contents       from PayPal. eBay also periodically receives complaints from     buyers as to the quality of the goods purchased. We expect to     continue to receive communications from users requesting     reimbursement or threatening or commencing legal action against     us if no reimbursement is made. Our liability for these sort of     claims is only beginning to be clarified and may be higher in     some     non-U.S. jurisdictions     than it is in the U.S. Litigation involving liability for     third-party actions could be costly for us, divert management     attention, result in increased costs of doing business, lead to     adverse judgments, or otherwise harm our business. In addition,     affected users will likely complain to regulatory agencies that     could take action against us, including imposing fines or     seeking injunctions.         Negative publicity and user sentiment generated as a result of     fraudulent or deceptive conduct by users of our eBay and PayPal     services could damage our reputation, reduce our ability to     attract new users or retain our current users, and diminish the     value of our brand names. We believe that negative user     experiences are one of the primary reasons users stop using our     services.     Any     factors which reduce cross-border trade could harm our     business         Cross-border transactions using our websites generally provide     higher gross margins than similar transactions that take place     within a single country due to higher transaction fees we earn     for those transactions. To the extent that any factors,     including fluctuations in exchange rates or the application of     specific national laws to users in other countries, result in a     net reduction in cross-border trade, our business could suffer.     Our     business is subject to online security risks, including security     breaches and identity theft.         To succeed, online commerce and communications must provide a     secure transmission of confidential information over public     networks. Our security measures may not detect or prevent     security breaches that could harm our business. Currently, a     significant number of our users authorize us to bill their     credit card accounts directly for all transaction fees charged     by us. PayPals users routinely provide credit card and     other financial information. We rely on encryption and     authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide     the security and authentication to effect secure transmission of     confidential information, including customer credit card     numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in     the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a     compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect     transaction data. In addition, any party who is able to     illicitly obtain a users password could access the     users transaction data. An increasing number of websites     including, recently, our Korean subsidiary, have reported     breaches of their security. Any compromise of our security could     harm our reputation and, therefore, our business, and could     result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws. In     addition, a party that is able to circumvent our security     measures could misappropriate proprietary information, cause     interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of     our users, or otherwise damage our reputation and business.     Under credit card rules and our contract with our card     processors, if there is a breach of credit card information that     we store, or that is stored by PayPals direct credit card     processing customers, we could be liable to the credit card     issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related     expenses. In addition, if we fail to follow credit card industry     security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer     information, we could incur significant fines or lose our     ability to give customers the option of using credit cards to     fund their payments or pay their fees. If we were unable to     accept credit cards, our business would be seriously damaged.         Our servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or     electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions, and we have     experienced denial-of-service type attacks on our     system that have made all or portions of our websites     unavailable for periods of time. We may need to expend     significant resources to protect against security breaches or to     address problems caused by breaches. These issues are likely to     become more difficult as we expand the number of places where we     operate. Security breaches, including any breach that results in     the release of our users personal information, could     damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or     litigation and possible liability. Our insurance policies carry     low coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us     for losses caused by security breaches.         Our users, as well as those of other prominent Internet     companies, have been and will continue to be targeted by parties     using fraudulent spoof and phishing     emails to misappropriate passwords, credit card numbers, or     other personal information or to introduce viruses through     trojan horse programs to our users computers.     These emails appear to be legitimate emails sent by eBay,     PayPal, Skype, or a user of one of those businesses, but direct        21    Table of Contents       recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email     or request that the recipient send a password or other     confidential information via email or download a program.     Despite our efforts to mitigate spoof emails through     product improvements and user education, spoof and     phishing remain a serious problem that may damage     our brand, discourage use of our websites, and increase our     costs.     Changes     in regulations or user concerns regarding privacy and protection     of user data could adversely affect our business.         We are subject to laws relating to the collection, use,     retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable     information about our users, especially for financial     information and for users located outside of the U.S. In     many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party     transactions but also to transfers of information between     ourselves and our subsidiaries, and between ourselves, our     subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial     relations. New laws in this area have been passed by several     jurisdictions, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing     additional restrictions. The interpretation and application of     user data protection laws are in a state of flux. These laws may     be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to     country and our current data protection policies and practices     may not be consistent with those interpretations and     applications. Complying with these varying international     requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or     require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse     to our business. In addition, we have and post on our websites     our own privacy policies and practices concerning the     collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or     perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy     policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other     federal, state or international privacy or consumer     protection-related laws and regulations could result in     proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or     others, subject us to significant penalties and negative     publicity and adversely affect us. In addition, as noted above,     we are subject to the possibility of security breaches, which     themselves may result in a violation of these laws.     Our     revenue from advertising is subject to factors beyond our     control.         We derive an increasing portion of our revenues from advertising     on our websites. Revenues from online advertising are sensitive     to events and trends that affect advertising expenditures, such     as general changes in the economy and changes in consumer     spending, as well as the effectiveness of online advertising     versus offline advertising media and the value our websites     provide to advertisers relative to other websites. If we     experience a reduction in our advertising revenues due to     economic, competitive or other factors, including if we are     unable to provide value to our advertisers, our business and     financial results would suffer.     Our     growth will depend on our ability to develop our brands, and     these efforts may be costly.         Our historical growth has been largely attributable to word of     mouth, and to frequent and high visibility national and local     media coverage. We believe that continuing to strengthen our     brands will be critical to achieving widespread acceptance of     our services, and will require an increased focus on active     marketing efforts across all of our brands. The demand for and     cost of online and traditional advertising have been increasing,     and may continue to increase. Accordingly, we will need to spend     increasing amounts of money on, and devote greater resources to,     advertising, marketing, and other efforts to create and maintain     brand loyalty among users. Since 2004, we have significantly     increased the number of brands we are supporting, adding     Rent.com, Shopping.com, Kijiji, StubHub, and Skype, among     others. Each of these brands requires its own resources,     increasing the costs of our branding efforts. Brand promotion     activities may not yield increased revenues, and even if they     do, any increased revenues may not offset the expenses incurred     in building our brands. Also, major search engine operators that     we use to advertise our brands have frequently-changing rules     that govern their pricing, availability and placement of online     advertisement (e.g., paid search, keywords), and changes to     these rules could negatively affect our use of online     advertising to promote our brands. If we do attract new users to     our services, they may not conduct transactions using our     services on a regular basis. If we fail to promote and maintain     our brands, or if we incur substantial expenses in an     unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands, our     business would be harmed.        22    Table of Contents   New     and existing regulations could harm our business.         We are subject to the same foreign and domestic laws as other     companies conducting business on and off the Internet. It is not     clear how existing laws governing issues such as property     ownership, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual     property issues, parallel imports and distribution controls,     taxation, libel and defamation, obscenity, and personal privacy     apply to online businesses such as ours. The majority of these     laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and     related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or     address the unique issues of the Internet and related     technologies. Those laws that do reference the Internet, such as     the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the European     Unions Directive on Distance Selling and Electronic     Commerce, are being interpreted by the courts, but their     applicability and scope remain uncertain. Furthermore, as our     activities and the types of goods and services listed on our     websites expand, including through acquisitions such as our     acquisition of StubHub, an online ticket marketplace, in     February 2007, regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold     that we or our users are either subject to licensure or     prohibited from conducting our business in their jurisdiction,     either with respect to our services in general, or with respect     the sale of certain items, such as real estate, event tickets,     cultural goods, boats, and automobiles.         Our success and increased visibility has driven some existing     businesses that perceive our business model to be a threat to     their business to raise concerns about our business models to     policymakers and regulators, particularly in the U.S. and     Europe. These established businesses and their trade association     groups employ significant resources in their efforts to shape     the legal and regulatory regimes in countries where we have     significant operations. They may employ these resources in an     effort to change the legal and regulatory regimes in ways     intended to reduce the effectiveness of our businesses and the     ability of users to use our products and services. In     particular, these established businesses have raised concerns     relating to pricing, parallel imports, professional seller     obligations, stolen goods, copyrights, trademarks and other     intellectual property rights, and the liability of the provider     of an Internet marketplace for the conduct of its users related     to those and other issues. Success in changing the legal or     regulatory regimes in a manner that would increase our liability     for third party listings could negatively impact our business.         Over the last few years some large retailers and their trade     associations have sought legislation in numerous states and the     U.S. Congress that would make eBay liable for the sale of     stolen property or would ban certain categories of goods from     sale on our platform, including gift cards and health and beauty     products. No such legislation has passed. Nonetheless, the     proponents continue to seek passage of such legislation, and if     any of these laws are adopted it could harm our business.         Numerous states and foreign jurisdictions, including the State     of California, where our headquarters are located, have     regulations regarding auctions and the handling of     property by secondhand dealers or     pawnbrokers. Several states and some foreign     jurisdictions, including France, have attempted, and may attempt     in the future, to impose such regulations upon us or our users.     Attempted enforcement of these laws against some of our users     appears to be increasing and such attempted enforcements could     harm our business. In France, we have been sued by Conseil des     Ventes, the French auction regulatory authority. The agency     alleges that sales on our French website constitute illegal     auctions which cannot be performed without their consent. This     and other regulatory and licensure claims could result in costly     litigation or could require us to change the way we or our users     do business in ways that increase costs or reduce revenues or     force us to prohibit listings of certain items for some     locations. We could also be subject to fines or other penalties,     and any of these outcomes could harm our business.         A number of the lawsuits against us relating to trademark issues     seek to have our websites subject to unfavorable local laws. For     example, trademark exhaustion principles provide     trademark owners with certain rights to control the sale of a     branded product until it has been placed on the market by the     trademark holder or with the holders consent. The     application of trademark exhaustion principles is     largely unsettled outside of the EU, and if trademark owners are     able to force us to prohibit listings of certain items in one or     more locations, our business could be harmed.         As we expand and localize our international activities, we     become obligated to comply with the laws of the countries in     which we operate. In addition, because our services are     accessible worldwide, and we facilitate sales of goods to users     worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our     users are required to comply with their laws based on the     location of our servers or one or more of our users, or the     location of the product or service being        23    Table of Contents       sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction. Laws regulating     Internet and ecommerce companies outside of the U.S. may be     less favorable than those in the U.S., giving greater rights to     consumers, content owners, competitors, users and other third     parties. Compliance may be more costly or may require us to     change our business practices or restrict our service offerings,     and the imposition of any regulations on our users may harm our     business. In addition, we may be subject to overlapping legal or     regulatory regimes that impose conflicting requirements on us.     Our failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to     penalties ranging from criminal prosecution to significant fines     to bans on our services.     If     PayPal were found to be subject to or in violation of any U.S.     laws or regulations governing banking, money transmission, or     electronic funds transfers, it could be subject to liability and     forced to change its business practices.         Nearly all U.S. states and territories have enacted     legislation regulating money transmitters. To date, PayPal has     obtained licenses in 41 of these jurisdictions and     interpretations in six states that licensing is not required     under their existing statutes, and is applying for licenses in     two additional states. The remaining U.S states and territories     do not currently regulate money transmitters. As a licensed     money transmitter, Paypal is subject to bonding requirements,     restrictions on its investment of customer funds, reporting     requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. In     July 2005, PayPal entered into a settlement agreement and agreed     to pay $225,000 to the California Department of Financial     Institutions in connection with alleged violations of the     California Financial Code relating to the use of a receipt form     for international payments that had not been pre-approved by the     Department, and incomplete reporting to the Department. If     PayPal were found to be in violation of other money services     laws or regulations, PayPal could be subject to liability,     forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states,     or forced to change its business practices. Any change to     PayPals business practices that makes the service less     attractive to customers or prohibits its use by residents of a     particular jurisdiction could decrease the velocity of trade on     eBay, which would further harm our business. Even if PayPal is     not forced to change its business practices, it could be     required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals     that could impose a substantial cost on PayPal.         Although there have been no definitive interpretations to date,     PayPal has assumed that its service is subject to the Electronic     Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E of the Federal     Reserve Board. As a result, among other things, PayPal must     provide advance disclosure of changes to its service, follow     specified error resolution procedures and reimburse consumers     for losses above $50 from transactions not authorized by the     consumer. PayPal currently voluntarily reimburses consumers for     all financial losses from transactions not authorized by the     consumer, not just losses above $50. PayPal seeks to pass most     of these losses on to the relevant merchants, but PayPal incurs     losses if the merchant does not have sufficient funds in its     PayPal account. In addition, PayPal is subject to the financial     privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, state     financial privacy laws, and related regulations. As a result,     some customer financial information that PayPal receives is     subject to limitations on reuse and disclosure. Existing and     potential future privacy laws may limit PayPals ability to     develop new products and services that make use of data gathered     through its service. The provisions of these laws and related     regulations are complicated. Even technical violations of these     laws can result in penalties of up to $1,000 for each     non-compliant transaction. PayPal processed an average of     approximately 1.96 million transactions per day during the     year ended December 31, 2007, and any violations could     expose PayPal to significant liability. Any negative change in     the publics perception of PayPals compliance with     privacy laws and policies could also negatively impact     PayPals business.     PayPal     is subject to regulation as a bank in Luxembourg, and its status     under banking or financial services laws or other laws in     markets outside the U.S. is unclear.         PayPal currently allows its customers with credit cards to send     payments from 190 markets, and allows its customers to receive     payments in 65 of those markets (including the U.S.). Customers     can only withdraw funds electronically to local bank accounts in     35 of these 65 markets. In 26 of these 65 markets customers can     withdraw funds electronically to their credit or debit card. In     two of these 65 markets customers can only withdraw funds     locally by receiving a bank draft in the mail, and in another     two of these 65 markets, customers cannot withdraw locally and     can only withdraw funds if they have a U.S. bank account.     These limitations affect PayPals ability to grow in these     markets. PayPal also offers customers the ability to send or     receive payments denominated in        24    Table of Contents       17 currencies. Of the 190 markets whose residents can use     the PayPal service, 31 (27 countries plus four French overseas     departments) are members of the European Union. Previously,     PayPal delivered services in the EU through a subsidiary in the     United Kingdom licensed to operate as an Electronic Money     Institution. As of July 2007, PayPal provides localized versions     of its service to customers in the EU through PayPal (Europe)     S.A.R.L. et Cie, SCA., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PayPal that     is licensed as a bank in Luxembourg. Accordingly, PayPal     (Europe) is subject to significant fines or other enforcement     action if it violates the disclosure, reporting, anti-money     laundering, capitalization, funds management, corporate     governance or other requirements imposed on Luxembourg banks.     PayPal does not have experience in operating as a bank, and any     fines or other enforcement actions imposed by the Luxembourg     regulator could adversely affect PayPals business. PayPal     (Europe) implements its localized services in EU countries     through an expedited passport notification process     through the Luxembourg regulator to regulators in other EU     member states pursuant to EU Directives, and has completed the     passport notice process in all EU member countries.     The regulators in these countries could notify PayPal (Europe)     of local consumer protection laws that will apply to its     business, in addition to Luxembourg consumer protection law. The     regulators in these countries could also seek to persuade the     Luxembourg regulator to order PayPal (Europe) to conduct its     activities in the local country through a branch office. Any     such responses from these regulators could increase the cost of,     or delay, PayPals plans for expanding its business.         In markets other than the U.S., EU, Australia and China, PayPal     serves its customers through PayPal Singapore Private Ltd.,     a wholly-owned subsidiary of PayPal that is based in Singapore.     In many of these markets, it is not clear whether PayPals     Singapore-based service is subject to local law or, if it is     subject to local law, whether such local law requires a payment     processor like PayPal to be licensed as a bank or financial     institution or otherwise. Even if PayPal is not currently     required to obtain a license in those countries, future     localization or targeted marketing of PayPals service in     those countries could require licensure. PayPal could be     required to obtain licenses or regulatory approvals that could     impose a substantial cost on it and involve considerable delay     to the provision or development of its product. Delay or failure     to receive such a license would require PayPal to change its     business practices or features in ways that would adversely     affect PayPals international expansion plans and could     require PayPal to suspend providing services to customers in one     or more countries. PayPal may also be subject to other laws and     regulations of one or more countries in which it serves its     customers, such as data protection and anti-money laundering     laws, which vary from country to country and are subject to     change. In some cases, these laws may require expensive changes     to PayPals current business practices. If PayPal were     found to be subject to and in violation of any foreign laws or     regulations, it could be subject to liability, forced to change     its business practices or forced to suspend providing services     to customers in one or more countries.         In addition, if PayPal were to seek to expand the financial     products that it offers outside of the U.S., either alone,     through a commercial alliance, or through an acquisition, PayPal     could become subject to additional licensure requirements,     additional laws and regulations, or increased regulatory     scrutiny, which could impose substantial costs and delay the     introduction of any new products.     Changes     to credit card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could     harm PayPals business.         PayPal does not belong to or directly access credit card     networks, such as Visa and MasterCard. As a result, PayPal must     rely on banks or other payment processors to process     transactions, and must pay a fee for this service. From time to     time, credit card associations may increase the interchange fees     that they charge for each transaction using one of their cards.     PayPals credit card processors have the right to pass any     increases in interchange fees on to PayPal as well as increase     their own fees for processing. These increased fees increase     PayPals operating costs and reduce its profit margins.     PayPal is also required by its processors to comply with credit     card association operating rules, and PayPal has agreed to     reimburse its processors for any fines they are assessed by     credit card associations as a result of any rule violations by     PayPal or PayPals customers. The credit card associations     set and interpret the credit card rules. Credit card networks     could adopt new operating rules or re-interpret existing rules     that PayPal or its processors might find difficult or even     impossible to follow. As a result, PayPal could lose its ability     to give customers the option of using credit cards to fund their     payments. If PayPal were unable to accept credit cards, its     business would be seriously damaged. In addition, the velocity     of trade on eBay could decrease and our business would further     suffer.        25    Table of Contents       PayPal is required to comply with credit card networks special     operating rules for Internet payment services. PayPal and its     credit card processors have implemented specific business     processes for merchant customers in order to comply with these     rules, but any failure to comply could result in fines, the     amount of which would be within the credit card networks     discretion. PayPal also could be subject to fines from credit     card networks if it fails to detect that merchants are engaging     in activities that are illegal or that are considered high     risk, primarily the sale of certain types of digital     content. For high risk merchants, PayPal must either     prevent such merchants from using PayPal or register such     merchants with credit card networks and conduct additional     monitoring with respect to such merchants. PayPal has incurred     fines from its credit card processor relating to PayPals     failure to detect the use of its service by high     risk merchants. The amount of these fines has not been     material, but any additional fines in the future would likely be     for larger amounts, could become material, and could result in a     termination of PayPals ability to accept credit cards or     changes in PayPals process for registering new customers,     which would seriously damage PayPals business.     Changes     in PayPals funding mix could adversely affect     PayPals results.         PayPal pays significant transaction fees when senders fund     payment transactions using credit cards, nominal fees when     customers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of     funds from bank accounts, and no fees when customers fund     payment transactions from an existing PayPal account balance or     use buyer credit issued by GE Money Bank. Senders fund a     significant portion of PayPals payment volume using credit     cards, and PayPals financial success will remain highly     sensitive to changes in the rate at which its senders fund     payments using credit cards. Senders may prefer funding using     credit cards rather than bank account transfers for a number of     reasons, including the ability to dispute and reverse charges     directly with their credit card provider if merchandise is not     delivered or is not as described, the ability to earn frequent     flier miles or other incentives offered by credit card issuers,     the ability to defer payment, or a reluctance to provide bank     account information to PayPal. In addition, some of     PayPals newer offerings, including the ability to make a     limited number of payments without opening an account, have a     higher rate of credit card funding than PayPals basic     product offering. In September 2006, PayPal entered into a     settlement agreement with the attorneys general of a number of     states under which it agreed to pay $1.7 million to the     attorneys general, shorten and streamline its user agreement,     and communicate more information regarding protection programs     to users. Also in September 2006, PayPal announced that it had     reached a preliminary settlement agreement under which it agreed     to pay approximately $3.5 million into a settlement fund     for the benefit of a class represented by plaintiffs in a suit     that alleged, among other things, that PayPals disclosure     regarding the effects of users choice of funding mechanism     was deceptive. This settlement was rejected by the court.     Although PayPal did not admit any liability for any of the     allegations in the two cases, changes to our disclosure     practices could result in increased use of credit card funding,     which would harm PayPals business.     PayPals     failure to manage customer funds properly would harm its     business.         PayPals ability to manage and account accurately for     customer funds requires a high level of internal controls. In     some of the markets that PayPal serves and currencies that     PayPal offers, PayPal has a limited operating history and     limited management experience in managing these internal     controls. As PayPals business continues to grow, it must     strengthen its internal controls accordingly. PayPals     success requires significant public confidence in its ability to     handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of     customer funds. Any failure to maintain necessary controls or to     manage accurately customer funds could diminish customer use of     PayPals product severely.     System     failures could harm our business.         We have experienced system failures from time to time, and any     interruption in the availability of our websites will reduce our     current revenues and profits, could harm our future revenues and     profits, and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny. Our     eBay.com website has been interrupted for periods of up to     22 hours, and our PayPal website has suffered intermittent     unavailability for periods as long as five days. In August 2007,     Skype experienced an interruption during which the majority of     Skypes users were unable to use its products for     approximately two days. Any unscheduled interruption in our     services results in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss     of revenues. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our     services could cause current or potential users to believe that        26    Table of Contents       our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our     competitors or to avoid our sites, and could permanently harm     our reputation and brands. Reliability is particularly critical     for PayPal, especially as it seeks to expand its Merchant     Services business. Because PayPal is a regulated financial     entity, frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to     fines, penalties, or mandatory changes to PayPals business     practices, and ultimately could cause PayPal to lose existing     licenses it needs to operate or prevent it from obtaining     additional licenses that it needs to expand. Finally, because     our customers may use our products for critical transactions,     any system failures could result in damage to our     customers businesses. These customers could seek     significant compensation from us for their losses. Even if     unsuccessful, this type of claim likely would be time consuming     and costly for us to address.         Although our systems have been designed around industry-standard     architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or     catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to damage or     interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss,     telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses,     computer denial-of-service attacks, and similar events. Some of     our systems, including our Shopping.com and Skype websites, are     not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not     sufficient for all eventualities. Our systems are also subject     to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism.     Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural     disaster, a decision by any of our third-party hosting providers     to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial     or other reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our hosting     facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our     services. We do not carry business interruption insurance     sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from     interruptions in our service as a result of system failures.     There     are many risks associated with our international     operations.         Our international expansion has been rapid and our international     business, especially in Germany and the U.K., has also become     critical to our revenues and profits. Net revenues outside the     U.S. accounted for approximately 48% and 51%, respectively,     of our net revenues in fiscal year 2006 and fiscal 2007.     Expansion into international markets requires management     attention and resources and requires us to localize our services     to conform to local cultures, standards, and policies. The     commercial, Internet, and transportation infrastructure in     lesser-developed countries may make it more difficult for us to     replicate our traditional Marketplace business model. In many     countries, we compete with local companies that understand the     local market better than we do, and we may not benefit from     first-to-market advantages. We may not be successful in     expanding into particular international markets or in generating     revenues from foreign operations. For example, in 2002 we     withdrew our eBay marketplace offering from the Japanese market,     and in 2007 we contributed our business in China to a joint     venture with a local Chinese company. Even if we are successful     in developing new markets, we often expect the costs of     operating new sites to exceed our net revenues for at least     12 months in most countries.         As we continue to expand internationally, including through the     expansion of PayPal, Skype, Shopping.com, and our classified     businesses, we are increasingly subject to risks of doing     business internationally, including the following:                         strong local competitors;                    regulatory requirements, including regulation of Internet     services, communications, auctioneering, professional selling,     distance selling, data protection, banking, and money     transmitting, that may limit or prevent the offering of our     services in some jurisdictions, prevent enforceable agreements     between sellers and buyers, prohibit the listing of certain     categories of goods, require product changes, require special     licensure, subject us to various taxes, penalties or audits, or     limit the transfer of information between eBay and our     affiliates;                    greater liability or legal uncertainty regarding our liability     for the listings and other content provided by our users,     including uncertainty as a result of legal systems that are less     developed with respect to the Internet, unique local laws,     conflicting court decisions and lack of clear precedent or     applicable law;                    difficulties in integrating with local payment providers,     including banks, credit and debit card associations, and     electronic fund transfer systems or with the local     telecommunications infrastructure;                    differing levels of retail distribution, shipping,     communications, and Internet infrastructures;          27    Table of Contents                         different employee/employer relationships and the existence of     workers councils and labor unions;                    difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;                    challenges associated with joint venture relationships,     including dependence on our joint venture partners;                    difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal     controls;                    longer payment cycles, different accounting practices, and     greater problems in collecting accounts receivable;                    potentially adverse tax consequences, including local taxation     of our fees or of transactions on our websites;                    higher telecommunications and Internet service provider costs;                    different and more stringent user protection, data protection,     privacy and other laws;                    cultural ambivalence towards, or non-acceptance of, online     trading;                    seasonal reductions in business activity;                    expenses associated with localizing our products, including     offering customers the ability to transact business in the local     currency;                    laws and business practices that favor local competitors or     prohibit foreign ownership of certain businesses;                    profit repatriation restrictions, foreign currency exchange     restrictions, and exchange rate fluctuations;                    volatility in a specific countrys or regions     political, economic or military conditions; and                    differing intellectual property laws.           Some of these factors may cause our international costs of doing     business to exceed our comparable domestic costs. As we expand     our international operations and have additional portions of our     international revenues denominated in foreign currencies, we     also could become subject to increased difficulties in     collecting accounts receivable, repatriating money without     adverse tax consequences, and risks relating to foreign currency     exchange rate fluctuations. The impact of currency exchange rate     fluctuations is discussed in more detail under We are     exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest     rates, above.         In addition, we conduct certain functions, including product     development, customer support and other operations, in regions     outside the U.S., particularly in India and China. We are     subject to both U.S. and local laws and regulations     applicable to our offshore activities, and any factors which     reduce the anticipated benefits, including cost efficiencies and     productivity improvements, associated with providing these     functions outside of the U.S. could adversely affect our     business.         We are continuing to expand PayPals services     internationally. In some countries, expansion of PayPals     business may require a close commercial relationship with one or     more local banks, a shared ownership interest with a local     entity or registration as a bank under local law. Such     requirements may reduce our profitability or limit the scope of     our activities in particular countries. Any limitation on our     ability to expand PayPal internationally could harm our business.         We maintain a portion of Shopping.coms research and     development facilities and personnel in Israel, and in January     2008 we acquired Fraud Sciences Ltd., an Israeli company. As a     result, political, economic and military conditions in Israel     affect those operations. The future of peace efforts between     Israel and its neighboring countries remains uncertain.     Increased hostilities or terrorism within Israel or armed     hostilities between Israel and neighboring states could make it     more difficult for us to continue our operations in Israel,     which could increase our costs. In addition, many of our     employees in Israel could be required to serve in the military     for extended periods of time under emergency circumstances. Our     Israeli operations could be disrupted by the absence of     employees due to military service, which could adversely affect     our business.        28    Table of Contents   Acquisitions     and joint ventures could result in operating difficulties,     dilution, and other harmful consequences.         We have acquired a number of businesses in the past, including,     most recently, Fraud Sciences Ltd. and StumbleUpon. We expect to     continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential     strategic transactions, including business combinations,     acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, technologies,     services, products and other assets. At any given time we may be     engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or     more of these types of transactions. Any of these transactions     could be material to our financial condition and results of     operations. The process of integrating any acquired business may     create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is     itself risky. The areas where we may face difficulties include:                         diversion of management time, as well as a shift of focus from     operating the businesses to issues related to integration and     administration, particularly given the large number and size and     varying scope of our recent acquisitions;                    declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from     changes in, or acceleration of, compensation, or changes in     management, reporting relationships, future prospects, or the     direction of the business;                    the need to integrate each companys accounting,     management, information, human resource and other administrative     systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control     if such integration is delayed or not implemented;                    the need to implement controls, procedures and policies     appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior     to acquisition had lacked such controls, procedures and policies;                    in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate     operations across different cultures and languages and to     address the particular economic, currency, political, and     regulatory risks associated with specific countries;                    in some cases, the need to transition operations, users, and     customers onto our existing platforms; and                    liability for activities of the acquired company before the     acquisition, including violations of laws, rules and     regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other     known and unknown liabilities.           Moreover, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any or     all of our acquisitions, or may not realize them in the time     frame expected. For example, in connection with the Skype     transaction, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of     approximately $1.4 billion in our financial statements     during 2007. Future acquisitions or mergers may result in a need     to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur     debt, liabilities, amortization expenses related to intangible     assets or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could reduce our     profitability and harm our business.         In addition, we have made investments in certain joint ventures     in which we have a minority equity interest, and lack management     and operational control. These investments in joint ventures may     involve risks, including the risk that the controlling joint     venture partner may have business interests, strategies or goals     that are inconsistent with ours, and the risk that business     decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling joint     venture partner or the joint venture company may result in harm     to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our     investment in the joint venture.     Our     business and users may be subject to sales tax and other     taxes.         The application of indirect taxes (such as sales and use tax,     value-added tax, or VAT, goods and services tax, business tax,     and gross receipt tax) to ecommerce businesses such as eBay and     to our users is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the     fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes     were established before the growth of the Internet and     ecommerce. In many cases, it is not clear how existing statutes     apply to the Internet or electronic commerce or communications     conducted over the Internet. In addition, some jurisdictions     have implemented or may implement laws specifically addressing     the Internet or some aspect of electronic commerce or     communications on the Internet. From time to time, some taxing     authorities have notified us that they believe we owe them     certain taxes. The application of existing or future laws could     have adverse effects on our business.        29    Table of Contents       Several proposals have been made at the U.S. state and     local level that would impose additional taxes on the sale of     goods and services or communications through the Internet. These     proposals, if adopted, could substantially impair the growth of     ecommerce and our brands, and could diminish our opportunity to     derive financial benefit from our activities. The     U.S. federal governments moratorium on state and     local taxation of Internet access or multiple or discriminatory     taxes on ecommerce was extended through November 2014 through     legislation enacted in October 2007. This moratorium does not     prohibit federal, state, or local authorities from collecting     taxes on our income or from collecting certain taxes that were     in effect prior to the enactment of the moratorium     and/or one     of its extensions. If the moratorium were to expire there could     be an adverse effect on our business.         In conjunction with the Streamlined Sales Tax     Project  an ongoing, multi-year effort by U.S.,     state, and local governments to require collection and     remittance of distant sales tax by out-of-state     sellers  bills have been introduced in the     U.S. Congress to overturn the Supreme Courts Quill     decision, which limits the ability of state governments to     require sellers outside of their own state to collect and remit     sales taxes on goods purchased by in-state residents. An     overturning of the Quill decision without a robust small     business exemption would harm our users and our business.         We do not collect taxes on the goods or services sold by users     of our services. One or more states or the federal government or     foreign countries may seek to impose a tax collection or     reporting or record-keeping obligation on companies that engage     in or facilitate ecommerce. Such an obligation could be imposed     by legislation intended to improve tax compliance (and     legislation to such effect has been discussed in the     U.S. Congress, several states, and a number of foreign     jurisdictions) or if an eBay company was ever deemed to be the     legal agent of the users of our services by a jurisdiction in     which eBay operates. One or more jurisdictions may also seek to     impose tax-collection or reporting obligations based on the     location of the product or service being sold or provided in an     ecommerce transaction, regardless of where the respective users     are located. Imposition of a record keeping or tax collecting     requirement could decrease seller activity on our sites and     would harm our business. Foreign authorities may also require     eBay to help ensure compliance by our users with local laws     regulating professional sellers, including tax requirements. In     addition, we have periodically received requests from tax     authorities in many jurisdictions for information regarding the     transactions of large classes of sellers on our sites, and in     some cases we have been legally obligated to provide this data.     The imposition of any requirements on us to disclose transaction     records for all or a class of sellers to tax or other regulatory     authorities or to file tax forms on behalf of any sellers,     especially requirements that are imposed on us but not on     alternative means of ecommerce, and any use of those records to     investigate, collect taxes from, or prosecute sellers, could     decrease seller activity on our sites and harm our business.         We pay input VAT on applicable taxable purchases within the     various countries in which we operate. In most cases, we are     entitled to reclaim input VAT from the various countries.     However, because of our unique business model, the application     of the laws and rules that allow such reclamation is sometimes     uncertain. A successful assertion by one or more countries that     we are not entitled to reclaim VAT could harm our business.         We continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and     legislators to clarify eBays obligations under new and     emerging laws and regulations. Passage of new legislation and     the imposition of additional tax or tax-related reporting     requirements could harm our users and our business. There have     been, and will continue to be, substantial ongoing costs     associated with complying with the various indirect tax     requirements in the numerous markets in which eBay conducts or     will conduct business.     The     current regulatory environment for Voice over Internet Protocol     (VoIP) is uncertain, and Skypes business could be harmed     by new regulations or the application of existing regulations to     its products.         The current regulatory environment for VoIP is uncertain and     rapidly changing. Skypes voice communications products are     currently subject to few, if any, of the same regulations that     apply to traditional telephony and VoIP-based telephone     replacement services. VoIP companies are generally subject to     different regulatory regimes in different countries, and in most     cases are subject to lower, or no, regulatory fees and lesser,     or no, specific regulatory requirements. Regulatory agencies may     require Skype to conform to rules that are difficult or     impossible for it to comply with due to the nature of its     communications technologies, which could adversely affect its     business. For example, while suitable alternatives may be     developed in the future, Skype is currently unable to identify     the exact geographic origin of the traffic traversing the     Internet or to provide detailed calling information about     computer-to-        30    Table of Contents       computer communications, either of which may make complying with     future regulatory requirements, such as emergency service     requirements, difficult or impossible.         Governments may impose new or increased fees, taxes, and     administrative burdens on VoIP companies, or Skype may change     its product offerings in a manner that makes it become subject     to telecommunications regulations. Increased fees could include     access and other charges payable to local exchange carriers to     carry and terminate traffic, contributions to federal or state     Universal Service Funds in the United States and elsewhere, and     other charges. In addition, such fees may be assessed by     governments retroactively or prospectively. Skype may be     required to meet various emergency service requirements,     disability access requirements, user protection requirements,     number assignment and portability requirements, and interception     or wiretapping requirements, such as the Communications     Assistance for Law Enforcement Act in the U.S. and similar     laws in other jurisdictions. Such regulations could result in     substantial costs depending on the technical changes required to     accommodate the requirements, and any increased costs could     erode Skypes pricing advantage over competing forms of     communication. Regulations that decrease the degree of privacy     for users of Skypes products could also slow its adoption.     The increasing growth and popularity of the VoIP telephony and     Internet communications market heighten the risk that     governments will seek to regulate VoIP and Internet     communications, and Skype has received an increasing number of     inquiries from regulators about its products and services.     Competitors, including the incumbent telephone companies, may     devote substantial lobbying efforts to seek greater protection     for their existing businesses and increased regulation of VoIP.     In the United States, various state legislatures and regulatory     agencies are beginning to impose their own requirements and     taxes on VoIP. Some countries have prohibited Skype. In many     countries in which Skype products are available, the laws that     may relate to its offerings are unclear. We cannot be certain     that Skype or its customers are currently in full compliance     with regulatory or other legal requirements in all countries in     which Skype is used. Skypes failure or the failure of     those with whom Skype transacts business to comply with these     requirements could materially adversely affect our business,     financial condition and results of operations. In addition,     increased regulatory requirements on VoIP would increase     Skypes costs, and, as a result, our business would suffer.         New rules and regulations with respect to VoIP are being     considered in various countries around the world, and at least     some of these rules and regulations are likely to be adopted and     to be applicable to Skype. Such new rules and regulations are     likely to increase our costs of doing business and could prevent     us from delivering our products and offerings over the Internet,     which could adversely affect Skypes customer base, and     thus its revenue.     Skype     depends on key technology that is licensed from third     parties.         Skype licenses technology underlying certain key components of     its software from third parties it does not control, including     the technology underlying its peer-to-peer architecture and     firewall traversal technology, and the video     compression/decompression used to provide high video quality.     Although Skype has contracts in place with its third party     technology providers, there can be no assurance that the     licensed technology or other technology that we may seek to     license in the future will continue to be available on     commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The loss of, or     inability to maintain, existing licenses could result in a     decrease in service quality or loss of service until equivalent     technology or suitable alternatives can be developed,     identified, licensed and integrated. While we believe Skype has     the ability to either extend these licenses on commercially     reasonable terms or identify and obtain or develop suitable     alternative products, the costs associated with licensing or     developing such products could be high. Any failure to maintain     these licenses on commercially reasonable terms or license or     develop alternative technologies would harm Skypes     business.     Our     businesses depend on continued and unimpeded access to the     Internet. Internet service providers may be able to block,     degrade, or charge us or our users additional fees for our     offerings.         Our customers rely on access to the Internet to use our products     and services. In many cases that access is provided by companies     that compete with at least some of our offerings, including     incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile     communications companies, and large Internet service providers.     Some of these providers have stated that they may take measures     that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of     customers use of our offerings by restricting or     prohibiting the use of their lines for our offerings, by     filtering, blocking, delaying, or degrading the packets     containing the data associated with our products, or by charging     increased fees to us or our        31    Table of Contents       users for use of their lines to provide our offerings. Some of     these providers have contractually restricted their     customers access to VoIP offerings (which would include     Skype) through their terms of service with their customers.     These activities are technically feasible and may be permitted     by applicable law. In addition, Internet service providers could     attempt to charge us each time our customers use our offerings.     Worldwide, a number of companies have announced plans to take     such actions or are selling products designed to facilitate such     actions. Interference with our offerings or higher charges for     access to our offerings, whether paid by us or by our customers,     could cause us to lose existing customers, impair our ability to     attract new customers, and harm our revenue and growth.     Our     tickets business is subject to regulatory, competitive, and     other risks that could harm this business.         Our tickets business, which includes our StubHub business, is     subject to numerous risks. Many jurisdictions have laws and     regulations covering the resale of event tickets, and some     jurisdictions prohibit the resale of event tickets at prices     above the face value of the tickets. In addition, new laws and     regulations may be passed that would limit our or our     users ability to continue this business. Regulatory     agencies or courts may claim or hold that we are responsible for     ensuring that our users comply with these laws and regulations     or that we or our users are either subject to licensure or     prohibited from reselling event tickets in their jurisdictions.         Some event organizers and professional sports teams have     expressed concern about the resale of their event tickets on our     sites. In November 2006, the New England Patriots filed suit     against StubHub alleging that StubHubs resale activities     violate Massachusetts ticket resale laws and constitute     intentional interference with the teams relationship with     its season ticket holders. In April 2007, Ticketmaster filed     suit against eBay d/b/a StubHub alleging that StubHub had     improperly interfered with Ticketmasters contracts with     its clients by wrongfully obtaining tickets for sale in     violation of Ticketmasters exclusive contractual rights to     sell such tickets. Such litigation could result in damage     awards, could require us to change our business practices in     harmful ways, or could otherwise negatively affect our tickets     business. Our tickets business is also subject to seasonal     fluctuations and the general economic and business conditions     that impact the sporting events and live entertainment     industries. Our tickets business also faces significant     competition from a number of sources, including ticketing     service companies (such as TicketMaster and Tickets.com), event     organizers (such as professional sports teams and leagues),     ticket brokers, and other online and offline ticket resellers,     such as TicketsNow (which has entered into an agreement to be     acquired by TicketMaster) and RazorGator. If we are unable to     effectively compete with these competitors, our tickets business     could be harmed.     We     depend on key personnel.         Our future performance depends substantially on the continued     services of our senior management and other key personnel and     our ability to retain and motivate them. In January 2008, we     announced that Meg Whitman will be resigning as our president     and chief executive officer effective March 31, 2008, and     that John Donahoe has been named by our board of directors to     succeed Ms. Whitman as our president and chief executive     officer upon Ms. Whitmans resignation, as well as     other significant changes in our executive management. These     changes may result in increased attrition of our personnel as     new reporting relationships are established and as other     companies may increasingly target our executives. We do not have     long-term employment agreements with any of our key personnel,     we do not maintain any key person life insurance     policies, and many members of our senior management team have     fully vested the vast majority of their in-the-money equity     incentives. The loss of the services of any of our executive     officers or other key employees could harm our business. Our new     businesses all depend on attracting and retaining key personnel.     Our future success also will depend on our ability to attract,     train, retain and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial,     marketing, and customer support personnel. Competition for these     personnel is intense, and we may be unable to successfully     attract, integrate, or retain sufficiently qualified personnel.     In making employment decisions, particularly in the Internet and     high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the     value of the equity awards they are to receive in connection     with their employment. Fluctuations in our stock price may make     it more difficult to retain and motivate employees whose stock     option strike prices are substantially above current market     prices. Similarly, decreases in the number of unvested     in-the-money stock options held by existing employees, whether     because our stock price has declined, options have vested,        32    Table of Contents       or because the size of follow-on option grants has declined, may     make it more difficult to retain and motivate employees.     Problems     with or price increases by third parties who provide services to     us or to our users could harm our business.         A number of parties provide services to us or to our users that     benefit us. Such services include seller tools that automate and     manage listings, merchant tools that manage listings and     interface with inventory management software, storefronts that     help our users list items, caching services that make our sites     load faster, and shipping providers that deliver goods sold on     our platform, among others. In some cases we have contractual     agreements with these companies that give us a direct financial     interest in their success, while in other cases we have none.     PayPal is dependent on the processing companies and banks that     link PayPal to the credit card and bank clearing networks.     Financial, regulatory, or other problems that prevent these     companies from providing services to us or our users could     reduce the number of listings on our websites or make completing     transactions or payments on our websites more difficult, and     thereby harm our business. Price increases by companies that     provide services to our users could also reduce the number of     listings on our websites or make it more difficult for our users     to complete transactions, thereby harming our business. For     example, we believe recent changes in postal rates that affected     certain lower-weight packages and mailings between the     U.S. and Canada may have reduced listing volume on our     sites in certain categories. Any security breach at one of these     companies could also affect our customers and harm our business.     In addition, we have outsourced certain functions to third-party     outside providers, including customer support and product     development functions, which are critical to our operations. If     our service providers do not perform satisfactorily, our     operations could be disrupted, which could result in user     dissatisfaction and adversely affect our business, reputation     and operating results. Although we generally have been able to     renew or extend the terms of contractual arrangements with third     parties who provide services to us on acceptable terms, there     can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in     the future, and there can be no assurance that third parties who     provide services directly to our users will continue to do so at     reasonable rates or at all.     Customer     complaints or negative publicity about our customer support or     anti-fraud measures could diminish use of our     services.         Customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer     support could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use     of our services. Measures we sometimes take to combat risks of     fraud and breaches of privacy and security have the potential to     damage relations with our customers or decrease activity on our     sites by making our sites more difficult to use or restricting     the activities of certain users. These measures heighten the     need for prompt and accurate customer support to resolve     irregularities and disputes. Effective customer support requires     significant personnel expense, and this expense, if not managed     properly, could significantly impact our profitability. Failure     to manage or train our customer support representatives properly     could compromise our ability to handle customer complaints     effectively. If we do not handle customer complaints     effectively, our reputation may suffer and we may lose our     customers confidence.         Because it is providing a financial service and operating in a     more regulated environment, PayPal, unlike eBay, must provide     telephone as well as email customer support and must resolve     certain customer contacts within shorter time frames. As part of     PayPals program to reduce fraud losses and prevent money     laundering, it may temporarily restrict the ability of customers     to withdraw their funds if those funds or the customers     account activity are identified by PayPals risk models as     suspicious. PayPal has in the past received negative publicity     with respect to its customer support and account restrictions,     and has been the subject of purported class action lawsuits and     state attorney general inquiries alleging, among other things,     failure to resolve account restrictions promptly. If PayPal is     unable to provide quality customer support operations in a     cost-effective manner, PayPals users may have negative     experiences, PayPal may receive additional negative publicity,     its ability to attract new customers may be damaged, and it     could become subject to additional litigation. As a result,     current and future revenues could suffer, and its operating     margins may decrease. In addition, negative publicity about or     experiences with customer support for Marketplaces, PayPal or     Skype could cause eBays reputation to suffer or affect     consumer confidence in the eBay brands as a whole.        33    Table of Contents   Our     industry is intensely competitive, and other companies or     governmental agencies may allege that our behavior is     anti-competitive.     Marketplaces         Marketplaces businesses currently or potentially compete with a     number of companies providing both particular categories of     goods and broader ranges of goods. The Internet provides new,     rapidly evolving and intensely competitive channels for the sale     of all types of goods. We expect competition to intensify in the     future. The barriers to entry into these channels are relatively     low and current offline and new competitors can easily launch     online sites at a nominal cost using commercially available     software or partnering with any one of a number of successful     ecommerce companies.         Our broad-based competitors include the vast majority of     traditional department, warehouse, discount, and general     merchandise stores (as well as the online operations of these     traditional retailers), emerging online retailers, online     classified services, and other shopping channels such as offline     and online home shopping networks. These include most     prominently: Wal-Mart, Target, Sears, Macys, JC Penney,     Costco, Office Depot, Staples, OfficeMax, Sams Club,     Amazon.com, Buy.com, AOL.com, Yahoo! Shopping, MSN, QVC, and     Home Shopping Network.         A number of companies offer a variety of services that provide     channels for buyers to find and buy items from sellers of all     sizes, including online aggregation and classifieds websites     such as craigslist (in which we own a minority equity stake),     Google Base, Microsoft Live Expo, and Oodle.com. Our Kijiji     websites offers classifieds listings in a variety of local     international markets, and in July 2007, Kijiji launched local     classifieds websites in the U.S. In many markets in which     it operates, including in the U.S., our classified platforms     compete against more established online and offline classifieds     platforms.         In 2005, we acquired Shopping.com Ltd., an online shopping     comparison site. Shopping.com competes with sites such as     Buy.com, Googles Product Search, Nextag.com,     Pricegrabber.com, Shopzilla, and Yahoo! Product Search, which     offer shopping search engines that allow consumers to search the     Internet for specified products. Recent legal developments may     affect the utility of shopping comparison sites if manufacturers     begin requiring more uniformity in product pricing. In addition,     sellers are increasingly acquiring new customers by paying for     search-related advertisements on search engine sites such as     Google and Yahoo!. We use product search engines and paid search     advertising to channel users to our sites, but these services     also have the potential to divert users to other online shopping     destinations.         We also compete with many local, regional, and national     specialty retailers and exchanges in each of the major     categories of products offered on our websites. For example,     category-specific competitors to offerings in our Computers,     Consumer Electronics, and Cameras & Photo categories     include Abt Electronics, Amazon.com, Apple, Best Buy, Buy.com,     Circuit City, CNET, CompUSA, Computer Discount Warehouse, Dell,     Electronics Boutique, Frys Electronics, Gamestop, Gateway,     Hewlett Packard, Lenovo, MicroWarehouse, Overstock.com,     PC Connection, PCMall.com, Radio Shack, Ritz Camera, Tech     Depot, Tiger Direct, Tweeter Home Entertainment, uBid, major     wireless carriers, and computer, consumer electronics, and     photography retailers         Our international Marketplaces websites compete with similar     online and offline channels in each of their vertical categories     in most countries. In addition, they compete with general online     ecommerce sites, such as Quelle and Otto in Germany, Yahoo-Kimo     in Taiwan, Daum and Gmarket in South Korea, OZtion and Aussie     Bidder in Australia, and Amazon in the United Kingdom and other     countries. In some of these countries, there are online sites     that have much larger customer bases and greater brand     recognition than we do, and in certain of these jurisdictions     there are competitors that may have a better understanding of     local culture and commerce than we do.         The principal competitive factors for Marketplaces include the     following:                         ability to attract and retain buyers and sellers;                    volume of transactions and price and selection of goods;                    customer service; and                    brand recognition.          34    Table of Contents         With respect to our online competition, additional competitive     factors include:                         community cohesion, interaction and size;                    website ease-of-use and accessibility;                    system reliability;                    reliability of delivery and payment;                    level of service fees; and                    quality of search tools.           Some current and potential competitors have longer operating     histories, larger customer bases and greater brand recognition     in other business and Internet sectors than we do. Other online     trading services may be acquired by, receive investments from,     or enter into other commercial relationships with     well-established and well-financed companies. As a result, some     of our competitors with other revenue sources may be able to     devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns,     adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially     more resources to website and systems development than we can.     Some of our competitors have offered services for free and     others may do this as well. We may be unable to compete     successfully against current and future competitors. In     addition, certain offline competitors may encourage     manufacturers to limit or cease distribution of their products     to dealers who sell through online channels such as eBay, or may     attempt to use existing or future government regulation to     prohibit or limit online commerce in certain categories of goods     or services. The adoption by manufacturers or government     authorities of policies or regulations discouraging the sales of     goods or services over the Internet could force eBay users to     stop selling certain products on our websites. Increased     competition or anti-Internet distribution policies or     regulations may result in reduced operating margins, loss of     market share and diminished value of our brand.         Conversely, other companies and government agencies have in the     past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the     antitrust or competition laws of the U.S. or other     countries, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. Such     claims, even if without foundation, typically are very expensive     to defend, involve negative publicity and diversion of     management time and effort, and could result in significant     judgments against us.         In order to respond to changes in the competitive environment,     we may, from time to time, make pricing, service or marketing     decisions or acquisitions that could harm our profitability. In     January 2008, we announced significant changes to our     Marketplaces business in three major areas: fee structure,     seller incentives and standards, and feedback While these     changes are intended to improve our users buying     experience and increase activity on our sites, certain users may     be negatively affected by or react negatively to these changes,     which could harm our operating results and profitability. In     addition, certain competitors may offer or continue to offer     free shipping or other transaction related services, which could     be impractical or inefficient for eBay sellers to match. New     technologies may increase the competitive pressures by enabling     our competitors to offer a lower cost service.         Although we have established Internet traffic arrangements with     several large online services and search engine companies, these     arrangements may not be renewed on commercially reasonable terms     or these companies may decide to promote competitive services.     Even if these arrangements are renewed, they may not result in     increased usage of our services. In addition, companies that     control user access to transactions through network access,     Internet browsers, or search engines, could promote our     competitors, channel current or potential users to their     vertically integrated electronic commerce sites or their     advertisers sites, attempt to restrict our access, or     charge us substantial fees for inclusion. Search engines may     increasingly become a starting point for online shopping, and as     the costs of operating an online store decline, online sellers     may increasingly sell goods through multiple channels, which     could reduce the number and value of transactions these sellers     conduct through our sites.        35    Table of Contents   PayPal         The market for PayPals product is emerging, intensely     competitive, and characterized by rapid technological change.     PayPal competes with existing online and offline payment     methods, including, among others:                         credit card merchant processors that offer their services to     online merchants, including American Express, Cardservice     International, Chase Paymentech, First Data, and Wells Fargo;     and payment gateways, including CyberSource and Authorize.net     (which has merged with CyberSource);                    money remitters such as MoneyGram and Western Union;                    bill payment services, including CheckFree;                    processors that provide online merchants the ability to offer     their customers the option of paying for purchases from their     bank account, including Certegy, PayByTouch and TeleCheck, a     subsidiary of First Data, or to pay on credit, including Bill Me     Later;                    providers of traditional payment methods, particularly credit     cards, checks, money orders, and Automated Clearing House     transactions;                    issuers of stored value targeted at online payments, including     VisaBuxx, NetSpend and GreenDot (formerly known as Next Estate);                    Amazon Payments, which acts as a credit processor and can be     linked to a personal bank account; and                    Google Checkout, which enables the online payment of merchants     using credit cards.           Some of these competitors have longer operating histories,     significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, customer     service and other resources, greater name recognition, or a     larger base of customers in affiliated businesses than PayPal.     PayPals competitors may respond to new or emerging     technologies and changes in customer requirements faster and     more effectively than PayPal. Some of these competitors may also     be subject to lesser licensing, anti-money laundering, and other     regulatory requirements than PayPal, which is subject to     additional regulations based on its licensure as a bank in     Luxembourg. They may devote greater resources to the     development, promotion, and sale of products and services than     PayPal, and they may offer lower prices. For example, Google     Checkout extended its free payment processing promotion through     February 1, 2008, and currently offers free payments     processing on transactions in an amount proportionate to certain     advertising spending with Google. Competing services tied to     established banks and other financial institutions may offer     greater liquidity and engender greater consumer confidence in     the safety and efficacy of their services than PayPal.         Overseas, PayPal faces competition from similar channels and     payment methods. In each country, numerous banks provide     standard online credit card acquiring and processing services,     and these banks typically have leading market share. In     addition, PayPal faces competition from Visas Visa Direct,     MasterCards MoneySend, Royal Bank of Scotlands World     Pay and ClickandBuy in the EU, NOCHEX, Moneybookers, NETeller     and FirePay in the United Kingdom, CertaPay and HyperWallet in     Canada, Paymate and BPay in Australia, Alipay, YeePay, and     99Bill in China and Inicis in South Korea. In addition, in     certain countries, such as Germany and Australia, electronic     funds transfer is a leading method of payment for both online     and offline transactions. As in the U.S., established banks and     other financial institutions that do not currently offer online     payments could quickly and easily develop such a service.         Some of PayPals competitors, such as Wells Fargo, First     Data, American Express, and Royal Bank of Scotland, also provide     processing or foreign exchange services to PayPal. If PayPal     were to seek to expand the financial products that it offers,     either alone or through a commercial alliance or an acquisition,     these processing and foreign exchange relationships could be     negatively affected, or these competitors and other processors     could make it more difficult for PayPal to deliver its services.     Skype         The market for Skypes products is also emerging, intensely     competitive, and characterized by rapid technological change.     Many traditional telecommunications carriers, Internet     companies, and cable providers        36    Table of Contents       offer, or have indicated that they plan to offer, VoIP products     or services that compete with the software Skype provides.     Microsoft recently announced the expansion of its Office     communications suite to include VoIP. We expect competitors to     continue to improve the performance of their current products     and introduce new products, software, services, and     technologies. If Skypes competitors successfully introduce     new products or enhance their existing products, this could     reduce the market for Skypes products, increase price     competition, or make Skypes products obsolete, which could     lower Skypes adoption rates, decrease its ability to     attract new users or cause its current users to migrate to a     competing company. In addition, some of Skypes     competitors, such as telecommunications carriers and cable     television providers, are bundling services and products that     Skype does not offer. These include various forms of wireless     communications, voice and data services, Internet access, and     cable television. This form of bundling may put Skype at a     competitive disadvantage if these providers can combine a     variety of service offerings at a single attractive price.     Furthermore, competitors may choose to make their services     interoperable with one another, rather than proprietary, which     could increase the attractiveness of their services relative to     Skype and decrease the value of Skypes network of users.         Many of Skypes current and potential competitors have     longer operating histories, are substantially larger, and have     greater financial, marketing, technical, and other resources.     Some also have greater name recognition and a larger installed     base of customers than Skype has. As a result of their greater     resources, many current and potential competitors may be able to     lower their prices substantially, thereby eroding some or all of     Skypes cost advantage.     Our     business may be adversely affected by factors that cause our     users to spend less time on our websites, including seasonal     factors, national events and increased usage of other     websites.         Anything that diverts our users from their customary level of     usage of our websites could adversely affect our business. We     would therefore be adversely affected by geopolitical events     such as war, the threat of war, or terrorist activity, and     natural disasters, such as hurricanes or earthquakes. Similarly,     our results of operations historically have been seasonal     because many of our users reduce their activities on our     websites with the onset of good weather during the summer     months, and on and around national holidays. In addition,     increased usage of social networking or other entertainment     websites may decrease the amount of time users spend on our     websites, which could adversely affect our financial results.     Our     failure to manage growth could harm our business.         We have expanded our headcount, facilities, and infrastructure     in the U.S. and internationally, and anticipate that     further expansion will be required as we continue to expand into     new lines of business and geographic areas. This expansion has     placed, and we expect it will continue to place, a significant     strain on our management, operational, and financial resources.     The areas that are put under strain by our growth include the     following:                     Website Usability.  User activity rates on our     websites depend in part on the quality of our users     experiences on those sites. The rapid growth in the number and     complexity of products and features on our sites has     occasionally caused users to become confused or overwhelmed or     has otherwise impaired users experiences on those sites.     We are in the process of making numerous improvements to our     eBay websites, including an attempt to improve the user     experience on those websites. These attempts at improvement     could fail, or could decrease activity among users who had grown     used to or preferred the existing experience on our sites. Any     impairment of customer satisfaction as a result of site     usability issues could lead to a loss of customers or impair our     ability to add customers, either of which would harm our     business.                Website Stability.  We must constantly add new     hardware, update software and add new engineering personnel to     accommodate the increased use of our and our subsidiaries     websites and the new products and features we regularly     introduce. This upgrade process is expensive, and the increased     complexity of our websites and the need to support multiple     platforms as our portfolio of brands grows increases the cost of     additional enhancements. Failure to upgrade our technology,     features, transaction processing systems, security     infrastructure, or network infrastructure to accommodate     increased traffic or transaction volume could harm our business.     Adverse consequences could include unanticipated system     disruptions, slower response times, degradation in levels of     customer support, impaired quality of users experiences of     our          37    Table of Contents                  services, impaired quality of services for third-party     application developers using our externally accessible     Application Programming Interface, or API, and delays in     reporting accurate financial information. We may be unable to     effectively upgrade and expand our systems in a timely manner or     smoothly integrate any newly developed or purchased technologies     or businesses with our existing systems, and any failure to do     so could result in problems on our sites. For example, in     October 2004, we experienced unscheduled downtime on the PayPal     website over a period of five days related to system upgrades,     and in the second quarter of 2007, PayPal experienced an     interruption during which many of PayPals services were     unavailable for approximately four hours. In August 2007, Skype     experienced an interruption to its services during which the     majority of Skypes users were unable to use its products     for approximately two days. Despite our efforts to increase site     scalability and reliability, our infrastructure could prove     unable to handle a larger volume of customer transactions. Some     of our more recently acquired businesses may be particularly     subject to this risk given their shorter histories and, in some     cases, higher growth rates. Any failure to accommodate     transaction growth could impair customer satisfaction, lead to a     loss of customers, impair our ability to add customers, or     increase our costs, all of which would harm our business.     Further, steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our     systems are expensive, reduce our margins, and may not be     successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled     downtime.                       Customer Account Billing.  Our revenues depend     on prompt and accurate billing processes. Our failure to grow     our transaction-processing capabilities to accommodate the     increasing number of transactions that must be billed on any of     our websites would harm our business and our ability to collect     revenue.                Customer Support.  We are expanding our     customer support operations to accommodate the increased number     of users and transactions on our websites and the increased     level of user protection activity we provide worldwide. If we     are unable to provide these operations in a cost-effective     manner, users of our websites may have negative experiences,     current and future revenues could suffer, and our operating     margins may decrease.           We must continue to effectively hire, train, and manage new     employees. If our new hires perform poorly, if we are     unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating     these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining     our existing employees, our business may be harmed. To manage     the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will     need to improve our transaction processing, operational and     financial systems, procedures, and controls. This is a special     challenge as we acquire new operations with different systems.     Our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures, and     controls may not be adequate to support our future operations.     The additional headcount and capital investments we are adding     will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult     for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by expense     reductions in the short term.     We may     have exposure to greater than anticipated tax     liabilities.         The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes     and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant     judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where     the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our determination     of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable     domestic and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of     such a review could have a negative effect on our operating     results and financial condition. Although we believe our     estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ     from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may     materially affect our financial results in the period or periods     for which such determination is made.     We     depend on the continued growth of online commerce and     communications.         The business of selling goods over the Internet, particularly     through online trading, is dynamic and relatively new. Concerns     about fraud, privacy, and other problems may discourage     additional consumers from adopting the Internet as a medium of     commerce. In countries such as the U.S. and Germany, where     our services and online commerce generally have been available     for some time and the level of market penetration of our     services is high, acquiring new users for our services may be     more difficult and costly than it has been in the past. In order     to expand our user base, we must appeal to and acquire consumers     who historically have used traditional means of commerce to     purchase goods and may prefer Internet analogs to such     traditional retail means to our offerings, such as the        38    Table of Contents       retailers own website. If these consumers prove to be less     active than our earlier users, and we are unable to gain     efficiencies in our operating costs, including our cost of     acquiring new customers, our business could be adversely     impacted.     Our     business depends on the development and maintenance of the     Internet infrastructure.         The success of our services will depend largely on the     development and maintenance of the Internet infrastructure. This     includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the     necessary speed, data capacity, and security, as well as timely     development of complementary products, for providing reliable     Internet access and services. The Internet has experienced, and     is likely to continue to experience, significant growth in the     numbers of users and amount of traffic. The Internet     infrastructure may be unable to support such demands. In     addition, increasing numbers of users, increasing bandwidth     requirements, or problems caused by viruses,     worms, and similar programs may harm the performance     of the Internet. The backbone computers of the Internet have     been the targets of such programs. The Internet has experienced     a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to     portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and     delays in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the     level of Internet usage generally as well as the level of usage     of our services.     We may     be unable to protect or enforce our own intellectual property     rights adequately.         We regard the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents,     domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets as critical to our     success. We aggressively protect our intellectual property     rights by relying on a federal, state and common law rights, as     well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on     contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in     products and services. We have entered into confidentiality and     invention assignment agreements with our employees and     contractors, and confidentiality agreements with parties with     whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and     disclosure of our proprietary information. These contractual     arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our     intellectual property may not prevent misappropriation of our     technology or deter independent development of similar     technologies by others. We pursue the registration of our domain     names, trademarks, and service marks in the U.S. and     internationally. Effective trademark, copyright, patent, domain     name, trade dress, and trade secret protection is very expensive     to maintain and may require litigation. We must protect our     trademarks, patents, and domain names in an increasing number of     jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be     successful in every location. For example, Skype is in the     process of applying to register the Skype name as a trademark     worldwide. In the EU, Skypes application is being opposed.     If these oppositions to Skypes applications were to be     successful, Skypes ability to protect its brand against     third-party infringers would be compromised. We have licensed in     the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our     proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material,     to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the     value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation.     We are     subject to the risks of owning real property.         We own real property, including land and buildings related to     our operations. We have little experience in managing real     property. Ownership of this property subjects us to risks,     including:                         the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs     associated with fixing any environmental problems;                    adverse changes in the value of these properties, due to     interest rate changes, changes in the neighborhoods in which the     properties are located, or other factors;                    the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply     with zoning, seismic, disability act, or other     requirements; and                    possible disputes with tenants, neighboring owners, or others.       Some     anti-takeover provisions may affect the price of our common     stock.         Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to     10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the     preferences, rights and privileges of those shares without any     further vote or action by the stockholders. The        39    Table of Contents       rights of the holders of common stock may be harmed by rights     granted to the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued     in the future. Some provisions of our certificate of     incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more     difficult for a potential acquirer to acquire a majority of our     outstanding voting stock. These include provisions that provide     for a classified board of directors, prohibit stockholders from     taking action by written consent and restrict the ability of     stockholders to call special meetings. We are also subject to     provisions of Delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any     business combination with any interested stockholder for a     period of three years from the date the person became an     interested stockholder, unless certain conditions are met. This     restriction could have the effect of delaying or preventing a     change of control.           ITEM 1B:     UNRESOLVED     STAFF COMMENTS           Not applicable.           ITEM 2:     PROPERTIES           We own and lease various properties in the United States and in     23 other countries around the world. We use the properties for     executive and administrative offices, data centers, product     development offices and customer service offices. As of     December 31, 2007, our owned and leased properties provided     us with aggregate square footage of approximately     1.7 million and 1.9 million, respectively. Our     corporate headquarters of approximately 0.2 million square     feet are located in San Jose, California. As of     December 31, 2007, the total square footage generally used     by each of our Marketplaces, Payments and Communications     segments was approximately 1.8 million, 1.4 million     and 0.2 million, respectively.         From time to time we consider various alternatives related to     our long-term facilities needs. While we believe our existing     facilities are adequate to meet our immediate needs, it may     become necessary to lease or acquire additional or alternative     space to accommodate any future growth.           ITEM 3:     LEGAL     PROCEEDINGS           In April 2001, two of our European subsidiaries, eBay GmbH and     eBay International AG, were sued by Montres Rolex S.A. and     certain of its affiliates in the regional court of Cologne,     Germany. The suit subsequently was transferred to the regional     court in Düsseldorf, Germany. Rolex alleged that our     subsidiaries were infringing Rolexs trademarks as a result     of users selling counterfeit Rolex watches through our German     website. The suit also alleged unfair competition. Rolex sought     an order enjoining the sale of Rolex-branded watches on the     website as well as damages. In December 2002, a trial was held     in the matter, and the court ruled in favor of eBay on all     causes of action. Rolex appealed the ruling to the Higher     Regional Court of Düsseldorf, and the appeal was heard in     October 2003. In February 2004, the court rejected Rolexs     appeal and ruled in our favor. Rolex appealed the ruling to the     German Federal Supreme Court, a hearing took place before that     court in December 2006, and a written decision was issued in     June 2007. The courts decision found that eBay must take     reasonable measures to prevent recurrence once it is informed of     clearly identified infringement, and that eBay may in certain     circumstances be liable upon first notice of infringement. The     court referred the case back to the Higher Regional Court to     determine whether, in some circumstances, a low starting listing     price was sufficient to indicate that a listing was infringing.     In July 2007, the German Federal Supreme Court extended the     reach of the Rolex decision in IVD v. eBay.     The court held that (i) in certain circumstances, a duty of     care could be found to exist to competitors requiring eBay to     take reasonable measures to prevent illegal items from being     listed (even where the competitors were not directly harmed) and     (ii) such duty would extend to listings by the same seller     in the same category (not just identical listings). Prior to     these decisions, we had implemented proactive measures to find     and remove illegal listings from our websites; these decisions     may require us to undertake further efforts and will subject us     to liability if our efforts are deemed to be insufficient. We     expect that this ruling will likely result in increased costs     and litigation against us in Germany although we do not     currently believe that it will require a major change in our     business practices.         In August 2006, Louis Vuitton Malletier and Christian Dior     Couture filed two lawsuits in the Paris Court of Commerce     against eBay Inc. and eBay International AG. The complaint     alleges that we violated French tort law by negligently     broadcasting listings posted by third parties offering     counterfeit items bearing plaintiffs trademarks, and by     purchasing certain advertising keywords. The plaintiffs seek     approximately EUR 37 million in damages.        40    Table of Contents       Around September 2006, Parfums Christian Dior, Kenzo Parfums,     Parfums Givenchy, and Guerlain Société also filed a     lawsuit in the Paris Court of Commerce against eBay Inc. and     eBay International AG. The complaint alleges that we have     interfered with the selective distribution network the     plaintiffs established in France and the European Union by     allowing third parties to post listings offering genuine     perfumes and cosmetics for sale on our websites. The plaintiffs     in this suit seek approximately EUR 9 million in     damages and injunctive relief. We filed our initial briefs     responding to the first complaint in February 2007, and initial     briefs in response to the second complaint were filed in April     2007. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to these     suits and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. Other luxury     brand owners have also filed suit against us or have threatened     to do so, seeking to hold us liable for counterfeit items listed     on our websites by third parties, for tester and     other not for resale consumer products listed on our websites by     third parties, for the misuse of trademarks in listings, for     alleged violations of selective distribution channel laws, for     non-compliance of consumer protection laws or in connection with     paid search advertisements.         In September 2001, MercExchange LLC filed a complaint against     us, our Half.com subsidiary and ReturnBuy, Inc. in the     U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia     (No. 2:01-CV-736)     alleging infringement of three patents (relating to online     consignment auction technology, multiple database searching and     electronic consignment systems) and seeking a permanent     injunction and damages (including treble damages for willful     infringement). Following a trial in 2003, the jury returned a     verdict finding that we had willfully infringed the patents     relating to multiple database searching and electronic     consignment systems, and the court entered judgment for     MercExchange in the amount of approximately $30 million,     plus pre-judgment interest and post-judgment interest. The     U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit later reduced     the award to $25.5 million. In May 2006, following appeals     to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and     the U.S. Supreme Court, the Supreme Court remanded the case     back to the district court for further action. In parallel with     the federal court proceedings, at our request, the     U.S. Patent and Trademark Office agreed to reexamine each     of the patents in the suit, finding that substantial questions     existed regarding the validity of the claims contained in them.     In separate actions in 2005, the Patent and Trademark Office     initially rejected all of the claims contained in the three     patents in suit. In September 2007, the Patent and Trademark     Office tentatively approved some of the claims and rejected     others contained in the patent that underlies the jury verdict,     which relates to electronic consignment systems. We requested     that the district court stay all proceedings in the case pending     the final outcome of the reexamination proceedings, and     MercExchange has renewed its request that the district court     grant an injunction. In July 2007, the court denied     MercExchanges request for an injunction and ruled that the     proceedings related to one of the patents will be stayed and     another of the patents will not be stayed pending action by the     Patent and Trademark Office. MercExchange appealed the     courts order denying the injunction, and we filed a motion     seeking that the court find the non-stayed patent invalid. In     December 2007, the district court ruled that it could not     consider eBays motions for judgment as a matter of law and     a new trial, because it viewed the 2003 verdict for MercExchange     (amounting to approximately $30 million, plus interest) as     final, subject to an accounting. We have appealed that ruling.         With the appeals pending, in February 2008, the parties agreed     to settle to dismiss all claims and appeals stemming from the     lawsuit. As a part of the settlement, eBay will purchase all     three patents involved in the lawsuit, and related technology     and inventions, as well as a license to another search-related     patent portfolio that was not asserted in the lawsuit. These     assets will allow eBay to further enhance its operations and     trust and safety effort on its ecommerce sites. The reserves     recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly     reflect our liability as of December 31, 2007 in connection     with this settlement.         In June 2006, Net2Phone, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the     U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey     (No. 06-2469)     alleging that eBay Inc., Skype Technologies S.A., and Skype Inc.     infringed five patents owned by Net2Phone relating to     point-to-point Internet protocol. The suit seeks an injunction     against continuing infringement, unspecified damages, including     treble damages for willful infringement, and interest, costs,     and fees. We have filed an answer and counterclaims asserting     that the patents are invalid, unenforceable, and were not     infringed. The parties have completed fact discovery and claim     construction briefing. The pretrial conference is scheduled for     June 2008, and we expect a trial date to be scheduled for summer     2008. We believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to     defend ourselves vigorously.         In August 2006, Peer Communications Corporation filed a lawsuit     in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of     Texas     (No. 6-06CV-370)     alleging that eBay Inc., Skype Technologies S.A., and Skype Inc.     infringed two        41    Table of Contents       patents owned by Peer Communications relating to uniform network     access. The suit seeks an injunction against continuing     infringement, unspecified damages, and interest, costs, and     fees. The parties are in the process of conducting discovery and     claim construction briefing, and a trial date has been scheduled     for October 2008. We believe that we have meritorious defenses     and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.         In September 2006, Mangosoft Intellectual Property, Inc. filed a     lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District     of Texas     (No. 2-06CV-390)     alleging that eBay Inc., Skype Technologies S.A., and Skype     Software S.a.r.l. infringed a patent owned by Mangosoft relating     to dynamic directory services. The suit seeks an injunction     against continuing infringement, unspecified damages, and     interest, costs, and fees. We have filed an answer and     counterclaims asserting that the patents are invalid,     unenforceable, and not infringed. We received an initial     scheduling order from the court that sets some discovery     deadlines, but not a trial date. The parties are in the process     of conducting discovery. We believe that we have meritorious     defenses and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.         In February 2007, our StubHub subsidiary was sued in the     U.S. District Court for the Central District of California     (No. CV-07-1328)     in a purported class action lawsuit alleging that StubHub     violated the Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act by     allegedly printing receipts containing more than the last five     digits of a credit card number or the expiration date of a     credit card by showing the same on an on-screen receipt. The     complaint seeks compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys     fees. We believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to     defend ourselves vigorously.         In March 2007, a plaintiff filed a purported antitrust class     action lawsuit against eBay in the Western District of Texas     alleging that eBay and its wholly owned subsidiary PayPal     monopolized markets through various anticompetitive     acts and tying arrangements. The plaintiff alleges claims under     sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, as well as related     state law claims. The complaint seeks treble damages and an     injunction. In April 2007, the plaintiff re-filed the complaint     in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of     California     (No. 07-CV-01882-RS),     and dismissed the Texas action. In May 2007, the case was     consolidated with other similar lawsuits     (No. 07-CV-01882JF).     In June 2007, we filed a motion to dismiss the class action     complaint. We believe that we have meritorious defenses and     intend to defend ourselves vigorously.         In May 2007, Netcraft Corporation filed a lawsuit in the Western     District of Wisconsin     (No. 07-C-0254C)     alleging that eBay and PayPal infringed two of its patents     entitled Internet billing methods. The suit seeks an     injunction against continuing infringement, unspecified damages,     and interest, costs, and fees. In September 2007, we filed a     motion for summary judgment of noninfringement on both patents.     In December 2007, the U.S. District Court for the Western     District of Wisconsin entered a judgment granting our motion for     summary judgment of non-infringement on both of the patents that     Netcraft asserted against eBay and PayPal. Netcraft Corporation     has appealed the judgment.         In October 2007, PartsRiver filed a lawsuit in the Eastern     District of Texas     (No. 2-07CV-440-DF)     alleging that eBay, Microsoft, Yahoo!, Shopziila, PriceGrabber     and PriceRunner infringed its patent relating to search methods.     The suit seeks an injunction against continuing infringement,     unspecified damages, interest, costs, and fees. The defendants     have moved to transfer venue and the parties are conducting     discovery. Fact discovery cutoff is scheduled for July 2009, and     trial is tentatively scheduled for October 2009. We believe that     we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves     vigorously.         In October 2007, Flexiworld Technologies, Inc. filed a lawsuit     in Western District of Washington     (No. 3:07-CV-05565-BHS)     alleging that Skype infringed its patent titled Apparatus,     Methods, and Systems for Anonymous Communication. The suit     seeks an injunction against continuing infringement, unspecified     damages, and interest, costs, and fees. Flexiworld has not yet     served Skype. We believe that we have meritorious defenses and     intend to defend ourselves vigorously.         In December 2007, Klausner Technologies Inc. filed a lawsuit in     Eastern District of Texas     (No. 2-07CV-525)     alleging that eBay, Apple, AT&T Corp., AT&T Mobility,     Comcast Corp., CSC Holdings, GotVoice Inc. and Simulscribe     infringed Klausners patent titled Telephone     Answering Service Linking Displayed Data with Recorded Audio     Message (some of the defendants, but not eBay, are accused     of infringing a second Klausner patent). The suit seeks an     injunction against continuing infringement, unspecified damages,     and interest, costs, and        42    Table of Contents       fees. Klausner has served its complaint but agreed to an     extension of time to answer. We believe that we have meritorious     defenses and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.         Other third parties have from time to time claimed, and others     may claim in the future, that we have infringed their     intellectual property rights. We are subject to additional     patent disputes, and expect that we will increasingly be subject     to patent infringement claims as our services expand in scope     and complexity. In particular, we expect that we may face     additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects     of our Marketplaces, Payments and Communications businesses. We     have in the past been forced to litigate such claims. We may     also become more vulnerable to third-party claims as laws such     as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Lanham Act and the     Communications Decency Act are interpreted by the courts, and as     we become subject to laws in jurisdictions where the underlying     laws with respect to the potential liability of online     intermediaries like ourselves are either unclear or less     favorable. We believe that additional lawsuits alleging that we     have violated copyright or trademark laws will be filed against     us, especially in Europe. Intellectual property claims, whether     meritorious or not, are time consuming and costly to resolve,     could require expensive changes in our methods of doing     business, or could require us to enter into costly royalty or     licensing agreements.         From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or     regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of     business. The number and significance of these disputes and     inquiries are increasing as our business expands and our company     grows larger. Any claims or regulatory actions against us,     whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in     costly litigation, require significant amounts of management     time, and result in the diversion of significant operational     resources.           ITEM 4:     SUBMISSION     OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS           There were no submissions of matters to a vote of security     holders during the quarter ended December 31, 2007.        43    Table of Contents      PART II            ITEM 5:     MARKET     FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS     AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES       Price     Range of Common Stock         Our common stock has been traded on The Nasdaq Global Select     Market (formerly the Nasdaq National Market) under the symbol     EBAY since September 24, 1998. The following     table sets forth the high and low per share prices of our common     stock, as reported by The Nasdaq Global Select Market.

Dividend     Policy         We have never paid cash dividends on our stock and do not     anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future.     Equity     Compensation Plan Information         The following table gives information about shares of our common     stock that may be issued upon the exercise of options, warrants     and rights under all of our existing equity compensation plans     as of December 31, 2007, including our 1998 Employee Stock     Purchase Plan, 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, 1998 Directors     Stock Option Plan, 1999 Global Equity Incentive Plan, 2001     Equity Incentive Plan, and 2003 Deferred Stock Unit Plan, as     well as shares of our common stock that may be issued upon the     exercise of outstanding options under our 1997 Stock Option Plan     (which plan terminated in 2007) and shares of our common     stock that may be issued under an individual compensation     arrangement that was not approved by our stockholders, also     referred to as our non-plan grants. No warrants are outstanding     under any of the foregoing plans.

DSUs and restricted stock units represent an     unfunded, unsecured right to receive shares of eBay common stock     (or, in the case of DSUs, the equivalent value thereof in cash     or property), and the value of DSUs and restricted stock units     varies directly with the price of eBays common stock.          (2)        Because DSUs and restricted stock units do not have an exercise     price, the 47,481 shares of our common stock issuable     pursuant to DSUs under our 2003 Deferred Stock Unit Plan and     8,833,633 shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to     restricted stock units under our 1998 Equity Incentive Plan and     our 1999 Global Equity Incentive Plan are not included in the     calculation of weighted average exercise price.          (3)        Includes 5,212,281 shares of our common stock remaining     reserved for future issuance under our 1998 Employee Stock     Purchase Plan, or the ESPP, as of December 31, 2007. Our     ESPP contains an evergreen provision that     automatically increases, on each January 1, the number of     securities reserved for issuance under the ESPP by the number of     shares purchased under the ESPP in the preceding calendar year,     provided that the aggregate number of shares reserved for     issuance under the ESPP may not exceed 36,000,000 shares.     As of December 31, 2007, an aggregate amount of     11,772,941 shares had been purchased under the ESPP since     its inception. An aggregate amount of 1,987,719 shares was     purchased under the ESPP in 2007, and the number of securities     available for future issuance under the ESPP was increased by     that number on January 1, 2008, bringing the total number     of shares reserved for future issuance on January 1, 2008     to 7,200,000. None of our other equity compensation plans has an     evergreen provision.          (4)        Does not include: (i) 6,350 shares of our common     stock, with a weighted average exercise price of $1.26 per     share, to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options assumed     by us under the Half.com, Inc. 1999 Equity Compensation Plan;     (ii) 11,489 shares of our common stock, with a     weighted average exercise price of $0.77 per share, to be issued     upon exercise of outstanding options assumed by us under the     X.com Corporation 1999 Stock Plan;     (iii) 294,544 shares of our common stock, with a     weighted average exercise price of $10.29 per share, to be     issued upon exercise of outstanding options assumed by us under     the PayPal, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan;     (iv) 85,875 shares of our common stock, with a     weighted average exercise price of $10.24 per share, to be     issued upon exercise of outstanding options assumed by us under     the Shopping.com Ltd. 2003 Omnibus Stock Option and Restricted     Stock Incentive Plan; (v) 669,526 shares of our common     stock, with a weighted average exercise price of $36.03 per     share, to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options assumed     by us under the Shopping.com Ltd. 2004 Equity Incentive Plan;     (vi) 335,678 shares of our common stock, with a     weighted average exercise price of $4.15 per share, to be issued     upon exercise of outstanding options assumed by us under the     Skype Technologies S.A. Stock Option Plan Rules;     (vii) 364,267 shares of our common stock, with a     weighted average exercise price of $7.17 per share, to be issued     upon exercise of outstanding options assumed by us under the     StubHub, Inc. 2000 Stock Plan; or     (viii) 162,733 shares of our common stock, with a     weighted average exercise price of $0.93 per share, to be issued     upon exercise of outstanding options assumed by us under the     StumbleUpon, Inc. 2006 Stock Plan. All of the options and     related plans referenced above were assumed by us in connection     with acquisitions. We cannot make subsequent grants or awards of     our equity securities under any of these plans. Prior to each     acquisition, the stockholders of the acquired company approved     the acquired companys plan. Our stockholders, however, did     not approve any of the plans in connection with the acquisitions.          The only outstanding non-plan grant as of December 31, 2007     relates to an individual compensation arrangement that was made     prior to the initial public offering of our common stock in     1998. At the time of this non-plan grant, members of our Board     of Directors, or Board, and their affiliates beneficially owned     in excess of 90% of our then outstanding equity and voting     interests. This non-plan grant was initially disclosed in our     initial public offering prospectus filed with the SEC on     September 25, 1998 under the headings     Management  Director Compensation and      Compensation Arrangements. Except as set     forth below, the terms and conditions of this non-plan grant are     identical to the terms of options granted under our 1997 Stock     Option Plan, a copy of which was filed as an exhibit to our     S-1     Registration Statement     (No. 33-59097)     filed in connection with our initial public offering.        45    Table of Contents       The outstanding non-plan grant involved the Boards grant     of an option to purchase 3,600,000 shares of our common     stock at an exercise price of $0.39 to Scott Cook upon his     joining our Board in June 1998 as an independent director. These     options granted to Mr. Cook were non-qualified options and     were immediately exercisable, with a term of 10 years.     These options fully vested in June 2002. Mr. Cook exercised     options to purchase 480,000 shares in 2002, exercised     options to purchase 1,430,000 shares in 2003, exercised     options to purchase 307,272 shares during 2005, exercised     options to purchase 614,544 shares during 2006, and     exercised options to purchase 614,547 shares during 2007.     As of December 31, 2007, options to purchase     153,637 shares remain outstanding under the non-plan grant     and will expire on June 9, 2008.

We     were added to the S&P 500 Index on July 19, 2002.

In January 2007, our Board     authorized the expansion of this stock repurchase program to     provide for the repurchase of up to an additional     $2.0 billion of our common stock by January 2009. Under     this program, as of December 31, 2007, we had repurchased     in the aggregate approximately $3.2 billion of our common     stock at an average price of $31.84 per share. As of     December 31, 2007, $845.3 million remained available     for further purchases under this stock repurchase program. In     January 2008, our Board approved an additional stock repurchase     program for $2.0 billion having no expiration date, giving     us the ability to repurchase up to $2.85 billion of the     common stock under our combined stock repurchase programs.

Overview     Our     Business         We operate three primary business segments: Marketplaces,     Payments and Communications. Our Marketplaces segment provides     the infrastructure to enable global online commerce on a variety     of platforms, including the traditional eBay.com platform, and     our other online platforms, such as Shopping.com, StubHub,     classifieds, Half.com and Rent.com. Our Payments segment, which     consists of PayPal, enables individuals or businesses to     securely, easily and quickly send and receive payments online.     Our Communications segment, which consists of Skype, enables     VoIP calls between Skype users and provides low-cost     connectivity to traditional fixed-line and mobile telephones.         We generate revenues from our Marketplaces segment primarily     from listing, feature and final value fees paid by sellers and     lead referral fees. For our Payments segment, revenues are     generated primarily by fees from payment processing services.     Our Communications segment primarily generates revenues from     fees charged to users to connect them from Skypes VoIP     network to traditional telecommunication networks. These fees     are charged on a per minute basis and we refer to these minutes     as SkypeOut minutes. Revenues from advertising are derived     principally from the sale of advertisements and from revenue     sharing arrangements. Other revenues are derived principally     from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide     transaction services to eBay and PayPal users and interest     earned from banks on certain PayPal customer account balances.         Revenues are attributed to U.S. and international     geographies based upon the country in which, as the case may be,     the seller, payment recipient, Skype users Internet     protocol address, online property that generates advertising, or     other service provider, is located. Because we generate the     majority of our revenue internationally, fluctuations in foreign     currency exchange rates will impact the results of our     operations.     Key     Operating Metrics and Financial Information         Members of our senior management team regularly review key     operating metrics such as active users, listings, Gross     Merchandise Volume (GMV), net Total Payment     Volume (TPV), transaction loss rates, registered     users and SkypeOut Minutes. Members of our senior management     team also regularly review key financial information including     net revenues, operating margins, earnings per share, cash flows     and financial metrics that exclude certain non-cash items. These     financial measures allow us to monitor the profitability of our     business and to evaluate the effectiveness of investments that     we have made (and continue to make) in the areas of marketing,     product development, international expansion, customer support     and site operations. We believe that an understanding of these     key operating and financial measures and how they change over     time is important to investors, analysts and other parties     analyzing our business results and future market opportunities.     Financial     Summary         During 2007, our combined businesses generated net revenues     totaling $7.7 billion, representing a $1.7 billion, or     29%, year-over-year increase, with each of our segments     achieving double digit-growth. Overall, our operations were     favorably impacted by the weakening of the U.S. dollar     relative to foreign currencies, the geographic mix of taxable     income, a tax benefit from a favorable ruling issued by a tax     authority and more efficient use of our resources as     demonstrated by reducing our sales and marketing, product     development, and general and administrative expenses as a     percentage of revenues. Furthermore, our operating results were     negatively impacted by the $1.4 billion impairment charge     related to Skype goodwill.         Revenue generated by our Marketplaces segment increased 24% in     2007 as compared to 2006 as our core business generated     $59.4 billion in GMV in 2007, representing a 13% increase     over the prior year. Revenue growth was primarily driven by     StubHub (acquired in February 2007), advertising, and the     fixed-price format on eBay. Our        50    Table of Contents       Marketplaces segment represents approximately 70% of our total     net revenues and continues to drive the majority of our     consolidated net revenue increase in dollars.         Revenue generated by our Payments segment, PayPal, increased 34%     in 2007 as compared to 2006. PayPal represents approximately 25%     of our total net revenue and generated net TPV of     $47.5 billion in 2007, a 33% increase over the     $35.8 billion generated in 2006. PayPal continued to be a     popular payment vehicle on various Marketplaces platforms.     Revenue derived from our Merchant Services business increased by     approximately 51% in 2007 compared to 2006 and represented     approximately 42% of net TPV in 2007 compared to 35% in     2006.         Revenue generated by our Communications segment, Skype,     increased 96% in 2007 as compared to 2006. Revenue growth at     Skype was due primarily to the growth in SkypeOut minutes driven     by our expanding user base and the broadening of our product     offerings and various strategic relationships. Skype represents     approximately 5% of our total net revenue.         Our operating margin was 8% in 2007, which reflected the     significant impact of the goodwill impairment charge related to     Skype of $1.4 billion, which represented 18% of net     revenues. In 2006, our operating margin was 24%.         Our diluted earnings per share was $0.25 in 2007. The goodwill     impairment charge related to Skype of $1.4 billion reduced     our diluted earnings per share by $1.01. In 2006 our diluted     earnings per share was $0.79.         We generated operating cash flow of $2.6 billion in 2007,     which allowed us to repurchase approximately 44.6 million     shares of our common stock for approximately $1.5 billion.     As of December 31, 2007, our cash and cash equivalents     balance was approximately $4.2 billion.         We expect that our business will continue to grow; however, our     growth rate has declined over time and we expect that to     continue in 2008, primarily as a result of the following:                         we face challenges in the U.S., U.K. and Germany, which are our     three largest markets, as growth of listings, active users and     GMV on the eBay.com platform in those countries has slowed. In     January 2008, we announced our plan to implement changes to our     fee structure, seller incentives and standards and feedback     system, all of which may impact our Marketplaces revenue growth;                    consumer spending in our major markets, including the U.S.,     Germany and the U.K., is expected to be weaker in 2008; and                    we anticipate that ecommerce growth as a whole will decelerate     in 2008.           We believe that our operating margin percentage will be impacted     negatively by the growth of our lower gross margin businesses,     primarily PayPal and Skype, which are growing faster than our     Marketplaces business and investment in buyer and seller     initiatives, and may be affected by the other changes mentioned     above. To partially offset this trend, we intend to continue to     improve operating productivity to keep our operating expenses     growing at a slower pace than revenue.         We announced another stock repurchase program in January 2008     for $2.0 billion, giving us the ability to repurchase up to     $2.85 billion of our common stock under our combined stock     repurchase programs. Any repurchases of our common stock under     our combined stock repurchase programs may impact our liquidity.         In addition to the above, to the extent that the     U.S. dollar fluctuates against foreign currencies,     particularly the Euro, British pound, Korean won and Australian     Dollar, the translation of these foreign currency denominated     transactions into U.S. dollars will impact our consolidated     net revenues and, to the extent that they are not hedged     successfully, our net income.        51    Table of Contents   Seasonality         The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, our     total net revenues and the sequential quarterly growth of these     net revenues.

Marketplaces     Net Transaction Revenues         Total net transaction revenues from Marketplaces increased 22%     in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in net transaction     revenues was the result of growth in our GMV-based businesses as     well as growth in our non-GMV-based businesses (Shopping.com,     Rent.com and our classifieds websites), which continued to grow     faster than our overall Marketplaces businesses. GMV increased     13% during 2007 compared to 2006, and was due primarily to an     increase in conversion rates and average selling prices, a     weaker U.S. dollar, and inclusion of our StubHub results     (which we acquired in February 2007). GMV growth in 2007     occurred across all major categories, with the motors, consumer     electronics, home and garden, clothing and accessories and     tickets having the most significant positive dollar impact when     compared to 2006.         Total net transaction revenues from Marketplaces increased 24%     in 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in net transaction     revenues was due primarily to growth in our GMV-based businesses     as well as growth in our non-GMV-based businesses. GMV increased     18% during 2006 compared to 2005, primarily driven by an     increase in listings and higher average selling prices offset by     lower conversion rates. GMV growth in 2006 occurred across all     major categories, with the motors, consumer electronics,     clothing and accessories, computers, home and garden,     books/movies/music, sports, and collectibles categories having     the most significant dollar impact when compared to 2005.         Marketplaces net transaction revenues earned internationally     were $2.7 billion in 2007, $2.1 billion in 2006 and     $1.7 billion in 2005, representing 52%, 50% and 49% of     total Marketplaces net transaction revenues, respectively. Based     on changes in foreign currency rates year-over-year,     Marketplaces net revenues were positively impacted by foreign     currency translation of approximately $222.4 million,     $30.6 million and $6.7 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005     respectively. Changes in foreign currency rates will impact our     operating results and, to the extent that the U.S. dollar     strengthens, our foreign currency denominated net revenues will     be negatively impacted.         In 2008, we expect Marketplaces net transaction revenues to     continue to increase, driven by increased levels of GMV and     continued growth from our non-GMV-based businesses. In January     2008, we announced changes to our fee structure, as well as     changes to our seller incentives and standards and feedback     system, on the Marketplaces platforms in an effort to increase     user activity, particularly in our three largest markets, the     U.S., U.K. and Germany. The reaction of our community of buyers     and sellers to these changes, as well as the other factors     discussed above under Financial Summary could impact     our revenue growth and may affect future trends.     Payments     Net Transaction Revenues         Payments net transaction revenues increased 31% and 40% in 2007     and 2006, respectively, which was consistent with our     year-over-year increase in net TPV of 33% and 37%,     respectively, in those periods. Payments net transaction     revenues have grown primarily as a result of growth in our     Merchant Services business and the increase in PayPals     penetration of eBay Marketplaces GMV. Payments net transaction     revenues continue to be        54    Table of Contents       derived primarily from eBay Marketplaces transactions using     PayPal. Our Merchant Services net TPV experienced 59%     year-over-year growth in 2007 and 2006, and represented 42% and     35% of PayPals net TPV in 2007 and 2006,     respectively. The increase in Merchant Services business     resulted from more online merchants, both domestically and     internationally, adding PayPal as a payment option. Our payments     net transaction revenues as a percentage of net TPV was     approximately 4% in each of 2007, 2006 and 2005.         Payments net transaction revenues earned internationally totaled     $778.3 million in 2007, $533.2 million in 2006, and     $364.5 million in 2005, respectively representing 42%, 38%     and 36% of total Payments net transaction revenues,     respectively. International growth in our Payments segment     continues to benefit from the expansion of our geographical     footprint, the increase in the number of currencies supported by     PayPal over the last twelve months and the increase in     cross-border payments, which generate larger fees. Based on     changes in foreign currency rates year-over-year, Payments net     revenues were positively impacted by foreign currency     translation of approximately $21.4 million,     $4.3 million and $5.3 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,     respectively.         In 2008, we expect the Payments net transaction revenues to     increase in total and for net transaction revenues earned     internationally to increase in total and as a percentage of     Payments net transaction revenues. We expect continued growth in     our Merchant Services business as the number of merchants     integrating PayPal on their websites increases and as we build     consumer preference for PayPal. In addition, we expect our     Payments business to benefit from growth in Marketplaces GMV and     increased penetration of PayPal on eBay Marketplaces, each of     which may be impacted by, among other things, the factors     discussed above under Financial Summary.     Communications     Net Transaction Revenues         Communications net transaction revenues were $376.7 million     in 2007 compared to $192.8 million in 2006. The increase in     Communications net revenues was due primarily to an increase in     SkypeOut minutes to 5.6 billion in 2007 compared to     4.1 billion in 2006 and to pricing changes. The increase in     SkypeOut minutes was due primarily to the growth in the     cumulative number of Skype registered users to     276.3 million at December 31, 2007 from     171.2 million at December 31, 2006.         Communications net transaction revenues were $192.8 million     in 2006 compared to $24.8 million in 2005 (net revenues     from the acquisition date of October 14, 2005 through the     end of 2005). The increase in net revenues was due primarily to     a full year of revenues generated from our VoIP offerings in     2006. Skype registered users increased to 171.2 million at     December 31, 2006 from 74.7 million at     December 31, 2005.         Net transaction revenues from Communications earned     internationally totaled $315.4 million in 2007,     $163.7 million in 2006 and $21.4 million in 2005,     representing 84%, 85% and 87% of total Communications net     transaction revenues, respectively. Skype revenue is primarily     generated in Europe. Based on changes in foreign currency rates     year over year, Communications net revenue was positively     impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately     $32.2 million in 2007 and $5.1 million in 2006.         In 2008, we expect Communications net transaction revenues to     continue to increase, driven by our continued focus on     increasing user activity and expanding our products and features.     Advertising     and Other Net Revenues         Advertising and other net revenues totaled $321.7 million     in 2007, $171.8 million in 2006 and $123.4 million in     2005. Advertising and other net revenues represented 4% of total     net revenues during 2007 and 3% of total net revenues during     2006 and 2005. Advertising and other net revenues increased 87%     and 39% during 2007 and 2006, respectively, compared to the same     periods of the prior year due primarily to advertising     initiatives in our Marketplaces segment and interest earned from     banks on certain U.S. PayPal customer account balances.     Prior to the fourth quarter of 2006, certain U.S. PayPal     customer account balances were maintained in non-interest     bearing accounts. We expect advertising revenues to increase in     total as we continue to benefit from our strategic advertising     partnerships that leverage the significant number of users on     our Marketplaces platform. The decline in interest rates in the     U.S. may have a significant impact on the amount of     interest we earn from banks on certain U.S. PayPal account     balances.        55    Table of Contents   Summary     of Cost of Net Revenues, Operating Expenses, Non-Operating Items     and Provision for Income Taxes         The following table summarizes changes in cost of net revenues,     operating expenses, non-operating items and provision for income     taxes (note that 2007 and 2006 amounts reflect our adoption of     the modified prospective method under FAS 123(R)):                                                                                                                      Change from            Change from                  Year Ended December 31,           2005 to 2006           2006 to 2007                 2005           2006           2007           in Dollars           in %           in Dollars           in %                 (in thousands, except percentages)                   Cost of net revenues            $       818,104               $       1,256,792               $       1,762,972               $       438,688                   54       %               506,180                   40       %          Sales and marketing                1,185,929                   1,619,857                   1,925,393                   433,928                   37       %               305,536                   19       %          Product development                328,191                   494,695                   619,727                   166,504                   51       %               125,032                   25       %          General and administrative                649,529                   978,363                   1,156,015                   328,834                   51       %               177,652                   18       %          Amortization of acquired intangible assets                128,941                   197,078                   204,104                   68,137                   53       %               7,026                   4       %          Impairment of goodwill                                                      1,390,938                                                         1,390,938                   100       %          Interest and other income, net                111,099                   130,017                   154,271                   18,918                   17       %               24,254                   19       %          Interest expense                3,478                   5,916                   16,600                   2,438                   70       %               10,684                   181       %          Provision for income taxes                467,285                   421,418                   402,600                   (45,867       )               (10       )%               (18,818       )               (4       %)             As of January 1, 2006, we began accounting for stock-based     compensation under FAS 123(R), which requires the     recognition of the fair value of stock-based compensation. We     adopted FAS 123(R) using the modified prospective method,     which requires the application of the accounting standard as of     January 1, 2006. In accordance with the modified     prospective method, the consolidated financial statements for     2005 have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the     impact of FAS 123(R). Stock-based compensation expense     related to equity awards and employee stock purchases for 2005,     2006 and 2007 was allocated as follows (in thousands):                                                          2005           2006           2007                   Cost of net revenues            $       1,881               $       32,981               $       37,009              Sales and marketing                8,696                   96,547                   81,299              Product development                6,468                   81,489                   76,002              General and administrative                14,727                   106,393                   107,503                                                                    Total stock-based compensation expense                31,772                   317,410                   301,813              Tax benefit                (13,023       )               (97,572       )               (92,726       )                                                                Stock-based compensation expense, net of tax            $       18,749               $       219,838               $       209,087                                                                       As of December 31, 2007, there was approximately     $541.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost,     excluding tax benefits, related to stock-based incentive awards     granted under our equity incentive plans. That cost is expected     to be recognized over a weighted-average period of three years.         We continue to believe that employee stock-based incentive plans     represent an appropriate and essential component of our overall     compensation program. We grant stock-based awards to     substantially all employees and believe that this broad-based     program helps us to attract, motivate, and retain high quality     employees, to the ultimate benefit of our stockholders. We     granted restricted stock units as part of our annual employee     incentive compensation program for the first time in 2007. Stock     options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards     granted during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,     net of cancellations/forfeitures, represented approximately 1%     and 2% of our total common stock outstanding as of     December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A substantial     portion of our stock-based awards granted during 2007 were     granted to existing employees.        56    Table of Contents   Cost     of Net Revenues                                                          2005           2006           2007                 (In thousands, except percentages)                   Cost of net revenues            $       818,104               $       1,256,792               $       1,762,972              As a percentage of net revenues                18.0       %               21.1       %               23.0       %             Cost of net revenues consists primarily of costs associated with     payment processing, customer support and site operations, and     Skype telecommunications costs. Significant cost components     include bank transaction fees, credit card interchange,     assessments, other payment processing costs, employee     compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs for our     customer support and site operations, depreciation of equipment,     amortization of capitalized product development costs and     amortization of acquired developed technology.         The increase in cost of net revenues of $506.2 million     during 2007 was due primarily to an increase in payment     processing costs, Skype telecommunication costs, customer     support and site operations costs. Payment processing costs     increased approximately $200.1 million, or 40%, in 2007     compared to the prior year due primarily to the 33% increase in     PayPals net TPV, an increase in the proportion of     customer transactions funded with credit cards, which have     higher associated processing costs, and increased Marketplaces     transaction activity. Skype telecommunications costs increased     by $86.2 million, or 64%, in 2007 compared to the prior     year due to the increase of SkypeOut minutes. Aggregate customer     support and site operations costs increased approximately     $153.1 million, or 26%, in 2007 compared to the prior year     due to the development and expansion of our customer support and     site operations infrastructure to support our growth in     transaction volume as demonstrated through the increases in both     GMV and net TPV. Cost of net revenues increased as a     percentage of net revenues primarily as a result of the growth     of our lower gross margin businesses, particularly PayPal and     Skype.         The increase in cost of net revenues of $438.7 million     during 2006 was due primarily to an increase in payment     processing costs, Skype telecommunication costs, the development     and expansion of our customer support and site operations     infrastructure, and the effect of stock-based compensation     expense related to equity awards and employee stock purchases     under FAS 123(R). Payment processing costs increased     approximately $114.5 million, or 30%, in 2006 compared to     the prior year, due primarily to the 37% increase in     PayPals net TPV and increases in the proportion of     customer transactions funded with credit cards. Skype     telecommunications costs increased by $105.5 million in     2006 compared to the prior year due to the inclusion of a full     year of Skypes costs. Aggregate customer support and site     operations costs (including stock-based compensation) increased     approximately $202.8 million, or 52%, in 2006 compared to     the prior year, due primarily to expanding our global site and     support infrastructure. Stock-based compensation expense of     $33.0 million was included in cost of revenues in 2006     compared to $1.9 million in 2005. Stock-based compensation     expense increased due to our implementation of FAS 123(R)     at the beginning of 2006.         Costs of net revenues are expected to increase in total and as a     percentage of net revenues during 2008 due primarily to growth     in PayPal and Skype, each of which is growing faster and has a     lower gross margin than Marketplaces.     Sales     and Marketing                                                          2005           2006           2007                 (in thousands, except percentages)                   Sales and marketing            $       1,185,929               $       1,619,857               $       1,925,393              As a percentage of net revenues                26.1       %               27.1       %               25.1       %             Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising     costs, marketing programs and employee compensation for sales     and marketing staff.         Sales and marketing expenses increased in total due to our     continued investment in retaining and growing our active user     base. We direct customers to our websites primarily through a     number of online marketing channels such as sponsored search,     portal advertising, email campaigns and other initiatives. Our     marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in     sales and changes in rates. Growth in advertising and marketing     costs, as well as employee-related costs, comprised the majority     of the increases. Combined advertising and marketing costs        57    Table of Contents       increased $222.5 million in 2007 compared to the prior     year, due to an increase in global television and online     marketing campaigns. Employee-related costs and the use of     contractors increased by $48.7 million in 2007 as we     continued to expand our domestic and international operations.     Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues     decreased from 2006, due to more efficient spending within our     Marketplaces segment as we continued to refine our marketing     programs and the growth in our Payments and Communications     segments, each of which has lower relative sales and marketing     expenses than our Marketplaces segment.         Sales and marketing expenses increased in total and as a     percentage of total net revenues in 2006 due to our continued     investment in growing our global user base and the effect of     stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards and     employee stock purchases under FAS 123(R). Growth in     advertising and marketing costs as well as employee-related     costs comprised the majority of the increases. Combined     advertising and marketing costs increased $250.5 million in     2006 compared to the prior year, due to an increase in global     television and online marketing campaigns. Employee-related     costs, not including stock-based compensation expense, increased     by $69.3 million in 2006 as we continued to expand our     domestic and international operations. Stock-based compensation     expense of $96.5 million was included in sales and     marketing expense in 2006 compared to $8.7 million in 2005.     Stock-based compensation expense increased due to our     implementation of FAS 123(R) at the beginning of 2006.         For 2008, sales and marketing expense is expected to increase in     total due to our increased efforts to retain existing active     users and increase activity across all of our segments. However,     sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net revenues is     expected to decrease slightly due to improved sales and     marketing expense leverage in our Marketplaces segment and the     relative growth in our Payments and Communications segments     (each of which has lower sales and marketing expenses than our     Marketplaces segment).     Product     Development                                                          2005           2006           2007                 (in thousands, except percentages)                   Product development            $       328,191               $       494,695               $       619,727              As a percentage of net revenues                7.2       %               8.3       %               8.1       %             Product development expenses consist primarily of employee     compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs and     depreciation on equipment. Product development expenses are net     of required capitalization of major site and other product     development efforts, including the development of our next     generation platform architecture, migration of certain     platforms, seller tools and Payments services projects. These     capitalized costs totaled $81.2 million in 2007,     $67.9 million in 2006 and $37.1 million in 2005, and     are reflected as a cost of net revenues when amortized in future     periods.         The increase in product development expense of     $125.0 million during 2007 was due primarily to an increase     in staffing and consultant costs to support several platform     development initiatives to enhance the user experience and     expand our existing product offerings primarily across our     Marketplaces and Payments segments. Employee-related and     consultant costs increased by approximately $89.0 million     in 2007 compared to the prior year. Depreciation and facilities     expense incurred to support our development efforts increased by     approximately $15.6 million in 2007 as compared to the     prior year. Product development expense as a percentage of net     revenues decreased slightly from 2006 as we continued to add     capacity at a slower rate than we generate revenue.         The increase in product development expense of     $166.5 million during 2006 was due primarily to the     addition of employees, contractors and consultants to support     various platform and software development initiatives in our     Marketplaces, Payments and Communications segments and the     effect of stock-based compensation expense related to equity     awards and employee stock purchases under FAS 123(R).     Employee-related and consultant costs, excluding stock-based     compensation, increased by approximately $61.5 million in     2006 compared to the prior year. Stock-based compensation     expense of $81.5 million was included in product     development expense in 2006 compared to $6.5 million in     2005. Stock-based compensation expense increased due to our     implementation of FAS 123(R) at the beginning of 2006.         For 2008, product development expense is expected to increase in     total and as a percentage of net revenues as we develop new site     features and functionality and invest in strategic product-based     initiatives.        58    Table of Contents   General     and Administrative                                                          2005           2006           2007                 (in thousands, except percentages)                   General and administrative            $       649,529               $       978,363               $       1,156,015              As a percentage of net revenues                14.3       %               16.4       %               15.1       %             General and administrative expenses consist primarily of     employee compensation, contractor costs, provisions for     transaction losses associated with PayPal, facilities costs,     depreciation of equipment, provision for doubtful accounts,     employer payroll taxes on employee stock-based compensation,     insurance and professional fees.         The increase in general and administrative expenses of     $177.7 million during 2007 was due primarily to an increase     in employee-related costs, facilities costs, professional     services, and transaction loss expense. Employee-related costs,     consultant costs and facilities costs increased by approximately     $111.6 million during 2007 as compared to the prior year     due primarily to our continued focus on consumer protection     programs. Professional services costs increased     $35.7 million during 2007 compared to the prior year.     PayPals transaction loss rate, which is the transaction     loss expense as a percentage of PayPals net TPV,     decreased to 0.29% during 2007, compared to 0.35% during 2006;     however, transaction loss expense still increased by     approximately $12.8 million because of the increase in     net TPV. We continue to expect our transaction loss rate to     fluctuate depending on many factors, including historical     experience of losses, protection programs, funding mix and     net TPV. The funding mix reflects how senders fund their     payment transactions (through credit cards, electronic funds     transfers, buyer credit, or existing PayPal account balances).     General and administrative expense as a percentage of net     revenue decreased from 2006 due to our continued leverage of our     existing infrastructure.         The increase in general and administrative expenses of     $328.8 million during 2006 was due primarily to increased     employee-related costs, consultant costs, higher Payments     transaction loss expenses, and the effect of stock-based     compensation expense related to equity awards and employee stock     purchases under FAS 123(R). Employee-related costs and     consultant costs increased by approximately $112.6 million     during 2006 as compared to the prior year due to our continued     focus on user protection programs. The transaction loss rate in     our Payments segment increased to 0.35% in 2006 compared to     0.28% in 2005, causing an increase in expense of approximately     $52.7 million. The increase in the transaction loss rate     were due primarily to higher levels of credit card chargebacks     from unauthorized credit card transactions, which resulted from     our decision to strategically enter into new customer segments     (new countries and direct card processing) having higher loss     rates.         For 2008, we expect general and administrative expense to     increase in total due to our continued investment across all     areas of our business and related corporate functions,     particularly in our consumer protection programs, as well as     costs associated with transaction losses. However, general and     administrative expenses are expected to decrease as a percentage     of net revenues due to increased efficiency in our general and     administrative functions, which we expect will be partially     offset by investments in our consumer protection programs.     Amortization     of Acquired Intangible Assets                                                          2005           2006           2007                 (in thousands, except percentages)                   Amortization of acquired intangible assets            $       128,941               $       197,078               $       204,104              As a percentage of net revenues                2.8       %               3.3       %               2.7       %             From time to time we have purchased, and we expect to continue     the purchase of, assets or businesses to accelerate category and     geographic expansion, increase the features, functions, and     formats available to our users and maintain a leading role in     online ecommerce, payments and communications. These purchase     transactions generally result in the creation of acquired     intangible assets with finite lives and lead to a corresponding     increase in the amortization expense in future periods. We     amortize intangible assets over the period of estimated benefit,     using the straight-line method and estimated useful lives     ranging from one to eight years. The increase in amortization of     acquired amortizable intangibles during 2007 and 2006 compared     to prior years is due to the business acquisitions consummated     during 2007, 2006 and 2005.         Amortization of acquired intangible assets will increase as we     make additional acquisitions in the future.        59    Table of Contents   Impairment     of Goodwill                                                          2005           2006           2007                 (in thousands, except percentages)                   Impairment of goodwill            $                       $                       $       1,390,938              As a percentage of net revenues                                                      18.1       %             Impairment of goodwill was $1.4 billion for the year ended     December 31, 2007. We conducted our annual impairment test     of goodwill as of August 31 in accordance with     SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible     Assets. As a result of this test, we concluded that the     carrying amount of our Communications reporting unit exceeded     its fair value and recorded an impairment loss of approximately     $1.4 billion (including a $530.3 million payment     related to the earn out settlement agreement with certain former     shareholders of Skype) during the year ended December 31,     2007. The impairment resulted from an updated long-term     financial outlook for the Skype business developed as part of     our strategic planning cycle conducted annually during our third     quarter. Our estimates of future operating results for our     Communications reporting unit are for an early stage business     with limited financial history, as well as developing revenue     models. These factors increase the risk of differences between     projected and actual performance that could impact future     estimates of fair value of the Communications reporting unit.     See Note 3  Business Combinations,     Goodwill and Intangible Assets in the consolidated     financial statements included elsewhere in this report for     further details. We have determined that there were no events or     circumstances from August 31 through December 31, 2007 that     would indicate a further assessment was necessary. We had no     impairment charges in the years ended December 31, 2006 or     2005.     Interest     and Other Income, Net                                                          2005           2006           2007                 (in thousands, except percentages)                   Interest and other income, net            $       111,099               $       130,017               $       154,271              As a percentage of net revenues                2.4       %               2.2       %               2.0       %             Interest and other income, net consists primarily of interest     earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments as well as     foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, our portion of     unconsolidated joint venture and minority equity investment     results and other miscellaneous transactions not related to our     primary operations.         Interest and other income, net increased in 2007 as compared to     the prior year due primarily to higher cash, cash equivalents,     and investments balances and higher interest rates, partially     offset by losses from our portion of unconsolidated joint     ventures and minority equity investments. The weighted-average     interest rate of our cash and interest bearing investments     portfolio increased to 4.2% in 2007 from 3.8% in 2006.         Our interest and other income, net increased in total and     remained relatively constant as a percentage of net revenues     during 2006 as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result     of increased interest income due to increased cash, cash     equivalents and investments balances and higher interest rates,     offset by the lower cash balances due to our stock repurchase     activity in 2006. The weighted-average interest rate of our cash     and interest bearing investments portfolio increased to 3.8% in     2006 from 2.9% in 2005.         We expect that interest and other income, net, in 2008 will vary     primarily based on future interest rates and the level of     invested assets, which will be impacted by the extent of our     stock repurchase activity, as well as the results of our portion     of unconsolidated joint ventures and our minority equity     investments.

The increase in interest expense during 2007     compared to the prior year is due primarily to interest charges     associated with our borrowings under our credit agreement. In     2008, interest expense may be        60    Table of Contents       impacted by our decision to access the available credit under     our credit agreement.

Provision     for Income Taxes                                                          2005           2006           2007                 (In thousands, except percentages)                   Provision for income taxes            $       467,285               $       421,418               $       402,600              As a percentage of net revenues                10.3       %               7.1       %               5.2       %          Effective tax rate                30       %               27       %               54       %             The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed     by applying the statutory U.S. federal rate principally due     to foreign income with lower tax rates and from tax credits that     lower the effective tax rate, offset by state taxes, subsidiary     losses and an impairment charge for which we have not provided a     benefit and other factors that impact the effective tax rate.         Our effective tax rate in 2007 was 54%, compared to 27% in 2006.     The increase was due to the goodwill impairment charge with     respect to our Communications reporting unit which is     non-deductible for tax purposes, partially offset by a tax     benefit from a ruling issued by a tax authority related to prior     periods. The lower effective tax rates in 2006 as compared to     2005 resulted primarily from the expansion of our international     businesses and from changes in our operations in international     markets. We expect our effective tax rate for 2008 to be     significantly lower than in 2007.

Non-cash charges to earnings included depreciation     and amortization on our long-term assets, stock-based     compensation, provision for doubtful accounts and authorized     credits resulting from increasing revenues and the provision for     transaction losses resulting from increased net TPV     processed by PayPal. Non-cash charges in 2007 also included a     $1.4 billion goodwill impairment charge, whereas there was     no impairment charge in the prior years. We expect net cash     provided by operating activities to increase due primarily to     higher net income.         Cash paid for income taxes in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was     $363.0 million, $179.2 million and $40.3 million,     respectively, as a substantial portion of our net operating     losses and tax credits were utilized in 2005. Beginning in 2006,     we were required to make cash payments for U.S. taxes.         Prior to adopting FAS 123(R), we presented all tax benefits     resulting from the exercise of equity awards as operating cash     flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows.     FAS 123(R) requires cash flows resulting from excess tax     benefits to be classified as a part of cash flows from financing     activities. Excess tax benefits represent tax benefits related     to exercised options in excess of the associated deferred tax     asset for such options. As a result of        61    Table of Contents       adopting FAS 123(R), $84.8 million and     $92.4 million of excess tax benefits for 2007 and 2006,     respectively, have been reported as a cash inflow from financing     activities.         The net cash used in investing activities in 2007 was due     primarily to cash paid for acquisitions and the purchase of     property and equipment, partially offset by cash generated by     our net investment activity. The net cash provided by investing     activities in 2006 reflected the cash generated from our net     investment activity offset by the purchase of property and     equipment. The net cash used in investing activities in 2005 was     due primarily to cash paid for acquisitions and the purchase of     property and equipment, offset by cash generated by our net     investment activity. Purchases of property and equipment, net     totaled $454.0 million in 2007, $515.4 million in     2006, and $338.3 million in 2005 related mainly to     purchases of computer equipment and software to support our site     operations, customer support and international expansion. Cash     expended for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, totaled     approximately $863.6 million in 2007, $45.5 million in     2006, and $2.7 billion in 2005. In 2007, acquisition     activity primarily consisted of $530.3 million earn out     payment related to our 2005 Skype acquisition and our 2007     acquisition of StubHub. In 2006, we acquired Tradera.com. In     2005, acquisition activity primarily consisted of Rent.com,     certain international classifieds websites, Shopping.com, Skype     and VeriSigns payment gateway business. In 2008, we expect     to continue to purchase property and equipment and expect such     purchases to total between 6.5% and 7.0% of revenue. Also, we     may acquire businesses with cash, which would impact our     investing cash flows.         The net cash flows used in financing activities of     $693.4 million in 2007 were due primarily to the repurchase     of approximately 44.6 million shares of our common stock     for an aggregate purchase price of approximately     $1.5 billion, offset by the proceeds from stock option     exercises totaling $507.0 million and $200.2 million     of proceeds from borrowings under our credit agreement. The net     cash flows used in financing activities of $1.3 billion in     2006 were due primarily to the repurchase of approximately     54.5 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate     purchase price of approximately $1.7 billion, offset by the     proceeds from stock option exercises of $313.5 million. The     net cash flows provided by financing activities in 2005 were due     primarily to proceeds from stock option exercises of     $599.8 million. Prior to 2006, we had not repurchased our     common stock under a stock repurchase program. Our future cash     flows from equity awards are difficult to project as such     amounts are a function of our stock price, the number of options     outstanding and the decisions by employees to exercise equity     awards. In general, we expect proceeds from stock option     exercises to increase during periods in which our stock price     has increased relative to historical levels.         In July 2006, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to     $2.0 billion of our common stock within two years from the     date of authorization. During 2006, we repurchased approximately     54.5 million shares of our common stock at an average price     of $30.56 per share for an aggregate purchase price of     $1.7 billion. In January 2007, our Board authorized, and we     announced, an expansion of the stock repurchase program to     provide for the repurchase of up to an additional     $2.0 billion of our common stock over the next two years.     During 2007, we repurchased approximately 44.6 million     shares of our common stock at an average price of $33.42 per     share for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion,     under this stock repurchase program. In January 2008, our Board     authorized, and we announced, another stock repurchase program     of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock, giving us the     ability to repurchase up to $2.85 billion of our common     stock under our combined stock repurchase programs. Share     repurchases under our repurchase programs may take a variety of     forms, including structured stock repurchase programs and other     derivative transactions. We expect to continue to repurchase our     common stock in 2008, which would reduce financing cash flows or     increase financing cash usage.         The positive effect of exchange rates on cash and cash     equivalents during 2007 and 2006 was due to the weakening of the     U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, primarily the     Euro. The negative effect of exchange rates on cash and cash     equivalents during 2005 was due to the strengthening of the     U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, primarily the     Euro.         In August 2007, we entered into an amendment to our 2006 credit     agreement. The amendment agreement increased the lender     commitments and borrowing capacity under the 2006 credit     agreement from its prior level of $1.0 billion to     $2.0 billion, maintained an option to increase borrowing     capacity by an additional $1.0 billion (after giving effect     to the $1.0 billion increase described above) and extended     the maturity date by an additional year to November 7,     2012. As of December 31, 2007, $1.8 billion was     available under the credit agreement.        62    Table of Contents       We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents and investments     of approximately $5.0 billion, together with cash generated     from operations and cash available through our credit agreement,     will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital     expenditures, stock repurchases and other obligations for the     foreseeable future.     Commitments     and Contingencies         We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments     that include future estimated payments. Changes in our business     needs, contractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest     rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing     from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the     timing and amounts of these payments. We have presented below a     summary of the most significant assumptions used in our     determination of amounts presented in the tables, in order to     assist in the review of this information within the context of     our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and     cash flows. The following table summarizes our fixed contractual     obligations and commitments (in thousands):                                                          Operating            Purchase                       Payments Due By Year Ending December 31,        Leases           Obligations           Total                   2008            $       64,870               $       372,157               $       437,027              2009                59,221                   105,099                   164,320              2010                45,960                   58,786                   104,746              2011                32,342                   45,019                   77,361              2012                27,940                   42,563                   70,503              Thereafter                87,688                   643                   88,331                                                                           $       318,021               $       624,267               $       942,288                                                                       Operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under     our non-cancelable operating leases for office facilities, as     well as limited computer and office equipment that we utilize     under lease arrangements. The amounts presented are consistent     with contractual terms and are not expected to differ     significantly, unless a substantial change in our headcount     needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office     facility early.         Purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments     for advertising, capital expenditures (computer equipment,     software applications, engineering development services,     construction contracts) and other goods and services that were     entered into through our ordinary course of business. For those     contractual arrangements in which there are significant     performance requirements, we have developed estimates to project     expected payment obligations. These estimates have been     developed based upon historical trends, when available, and our     anticipated future obligations. Given the significance of such     performance requirements within our advertising and other     arrangements, actual payments could differ significantly from     these estimates.         The table above does not include liabilities related to     unrecognized tax benefits under FASB Interpretation No. 48,     Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes     (FIN 48). As we are unable to reasonably     predict the timing of settlement of such FIN 48     liabilities, the table does not include $494.3 million of     such non-current liabilities recorded on our consolidated     balance sheet as of December 31, 2007.     Off-Balance     Sheet Arrangements         As of December 31, 2007, we had no off-balance sheet     arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a     current or future material effect on our consolidated financial     condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital     expenditures or capital resources. Customer funds held by PayPal     as an agent or custodian on behalf of our customers are not     reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. These funds     include funds on behalf of U.S. customers that are     deposited in bank accounts insured by the Federal Deposit     Insurance Corporation and funds that U.S. customers choose     to invest in the PayPal Money Market Fund, which totaled     approximately $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion as of     December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The PayPal Money     Market Fund is invested in a portfolio managed by Barclays     Global Fund Advisors.        63    Table of Contents   Indemnification     Provisions         In the ordinary course of business, we have included limited     indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with     parties with whom we have commercial relations, including our     standard marketing, promotions and     application-programming-interface license agreements. Under     these contracts, we generally indemnify, hold harmless, and     agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or     incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by a     third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos     and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are     applicable to our performance under the subject agreement. In a     limited number of agreements, we have provided an indemnity for     other types of third-party claims, which are indemnities mainly     related to various intellectual property rights. In our PayPal     business, we have provided an indemnity to our payment     processors in the event of certain third-party claims or card     association fines against the processor arising out of conduct     by PayPal or PayPal customers. It is not possible to determine     the maximum potential loss under these indemnification     provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification     claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each     particular provision. To date, no significant costs have been     incurred, either individually or collectively, in connection     with our indemnification provisions.     Critical     Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates     General         The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and     related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and     assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,     liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of     contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates     on historical experience and on various other assumptions that     are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the     results of which form the basis for making judgments about the     carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily     apparent from other sources. Our senior management has discussed     the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates     with the Audit Committee of our Board. Actual results may differ     from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.         An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires     an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about     matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is     made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been     used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably     likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the     consolidated financial statements. We believe the following     critical accounting policies reflect the more significant     estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our     consolidated financial statements. The following descriptions of     critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates should be     read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements     and other disclosures included in this report.     Provisions     for Doubtful Accounts and Authorized Credits         We are exposed to losses due to uncollectible accounts and     credits to sellers. Provisions for these items represent our     estimate of actual losses and credits based on our historical     experience, are monitored monthly, and are made at the time the     related revenue is recognized. The provision for doubtful     accounts is recorded as a charge to operating expense, while the     authorized credits are recorded as a reduction of revenues. The     following table illustrates the provision related to doubtful     accounts and authorized credits as a percentage of net revenues     for 2005, 2006, and 2007 (in thousands, except percentages):                                                          Year Ended December 31,                 2005           2006           2007                   Net revenues            $       4,552,401               $       5,969,741               $       7,672,329              Provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits            $       89,499               $       100,729               $       96,461              Provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits as     a % of net revenues                1.97       %               1.69       %               1.26       %             Historically, our actual losses and credits have been consistent     with these provisions. However, future changes in trends could     result in a material impact to future consolidated statements of     income and cash flows. Based on our results for the year ended     December 31, 2007, a 25 basis point deviation from our     estimates would have resulted in        64    Table of Contents       an increase or decrease in operating income of approximately     $19.2 million. The following analysis demonstrates, for     illustrative purposes only, the potential effect a 25 basis     point deviation from our estimates would have upon our     consolidated financial statements and is not intended to provide     a range of exposure or expected deviation (in thousands,     except per share data):                                                          −25 Basis                        +25 Basis                  Points           2007           Points                   Provision for doubtful accounts and related authorized credits            $       77,280               $       96,461               $       115,642              Income from operations                632,361                   613,180                   593,999              Net income                367,432                   348,251                   329,070              Diluted earnings per share            $       0.27               $       0.25               $       0.24             Provision     for Transaction Losses         Our Payments segment is exposed to transaction losses due to     credit card and other payment misuse, as well as non-performance     of and credit losses from sellers who accept payment through     PayPal. We establish allowances for estimated losses arising     from processing customer transactions, such as chargebacks for     unauthorized credit card use and merchant-related chargebacks     due to non-delivery of goods or services, Automated Clearing     House (ACH) returns, buyer protection program claims     and debit card overdrafts. These allowances represent an     accumulation of the estimated amounts necessary to provide for     transaction losses incurred as of the reporting date, including     those of which we have not yet been notified. The allowances,     which involve the use of actuarial techniques, are monitored     monthly and are updated based on actual claims data reported by     our claims processors. The allowances are based on known facts     and circumstances, internal factors including our experience     with similar cases, historical trends involving loss payment     patterns and the mix of transaction and loss types. The     provision for transaction losses is reflected as a general and     administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income.     At December 31, 2007, the allowance for PayPal transaction     losses totaled $80.1 million.         The following table illustrates the provision for transaction     losses as a percentage of net TPV from PayPal operations     for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007 (in     thousands, except percentages):                                                          Year Ended December 31,                 2005           2006           2007                   Total payment volume            $       27,485,000               $       37,752,000               $       47,470,000              Transaction loss expense            $       73,773               $       126,439               $       139,255              As a % of total payment volume                0.27       %               0.33       %               0.29       %             Determining appropriate allowances for transaction losses is an     inherently uncertain process, and ultimate losses may vary from     the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance     estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may     impact the settlement or recovery of losses. The allowances are     maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide     for losses incurred at the balance sheet date. Based on our     results for the year ended December 31, 2007, a five basis     point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an     increase or decrease in our operating expenses of approximately     $23.7 million. The following analysis demonstrates, for     illustrative purposes only, the potential effect a five basis     point deviation from our estimates would have upon our     consolidated financial statements for the year ended     December 31, 2007, and is not intended to provide a range     of exposure or expected deviation (in thousands, except per     share data):                                                          −5 Basis                        +5 Basis                  Points           2007           Points                   Transaction loss expense            $       115,520               $       139,255               $       162,990              Income from operations                636,915                   613,180                   589,444              Net income                371,986                   348,251                   324,515              Diluted earnings per share            $       0.27               $       0.25               $       0.24                65    Table of Contents   Legal     Contingencies         In connection with certain pending litigation and other claims,     we have estimated the range of probable loss and provided for     such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of     income. These estimates have been based on our assessment of the     facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are     subject to change based upon new information and future events.         From time to time, we are involved in disputes that arise in the     ordinary course of business, and we do not expect this trend to     change in the future. We are currently involved in certain legal     proceedings as discussed in Item 3: Legal     Proceedings and Note 8  Commitments     and Contingencies  Litigation and Other Legal     Matters to our consolidated financial statements included     elsewhere in this Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims     against us, and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously.     However, even if successful, our defense against certain actions     will be costly and could divert our managements time. If     the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims, we might be     forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees, modify our     business practices or even be prohibited from conducting a     significant part of our business. Any such results could     materially harm our business and could result in a material     adverse impact on the financial position, results of operations     or cash flows of all or any of our three businesses.     Accounting     for Income Taxes         We are required to recognize a provision for income taxes based     upon the taxable income and temporary differences for each of     the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires     a calculation of taxes payable under currently enacted tax laws     around the world and an analysis of temporary differences     between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities,     including various accruals, allowances, depreciation and     amortization. The tax effect of these temporary differences are     reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our     consolidated balance sheet. We also assess the likelihood that     our net deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable     income. To the extent we believe that it is more likely than not     that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be     realized, we establish a valuation allowance. At     December 31, 2007, we had a valuation allowance on certain     foreign net operating losses based on our assessment that it is     more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be     realized. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or     change the allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a     corresponding increase or decrease in our tax provision in our     consolidated statement of income or against additional     paid-in-capital     in our consolidated balance sheet to the extent any tax benefits     would have otherwise been allocated to equity.         Our U.S. businesses generate sufficient cash flow to fully     fund their operating requirements, and we expect that profits     earned outside the U.S. will be fully utilized to fund our     continued international expansion. Accordingly, we have not     provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding     taxes on     non-U.S. subsidiaries     undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2007, because     such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. In the     event that our future international expansion plans change and     such amounts are not reinvested indefinitely, we would be     subject to U.S. income taxes partially offset by foreign     tax credits.         The following table illustrates the effective tax rates for     2005, 2006, and 2007 (in thousands, except percentages):                                                          Year Ended December 31,                 2005           2006           2007                   Provision for income taxes            $       467,285               $       421,418               $       402,600              As a % of income before income taxes                30       %               27       %               54       %             Historically, these provisions have adequately provided for our     actual income tax liabilities. Our future effective tax rates     could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than     anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and     higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher     statutory rates, by changes in the valuations of our deferred     tax assets or liabilities, or by changes or interpretations in     tax laws, regulations or accounting principles. In addition, we     are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax     returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax     authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse     outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the     adequacy of our provision for income taxes.        66    Table of Contents       Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2007,     a one-percentage point change in our provision for income taxes     as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an     increase or decrease in the provision of approximately     $7.5 million. The following analysis demonstrates, for     illustrative purposes only, the potential effect such a     one-percentage point deviation change would have upon our     consolidated financial statements and is not intended to provide     a range of exposure or expected deviation (in thousands, except     per share data):                                                          −100 Basis                        +100 Basis                  Points           2007           Points                   Provision for income taxes            $       395,091               $       402,600               $       410,109              Net income                355,760                   348,251                   340,742              Diluted earnings per share            $       0.26               $       0.25               $       0.25                 We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 as of the beginning of     2007. Prior to adoption, our policy was to establish reserves     that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies.     The effects of final resolution, if any, were recognized as     changes to the effective income tax rate in the period of     resolution. FIN 48 requires application of a more likely     than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of     uncertain tax positions. If the recognition threshold is met,     FIN 48 permits us to recognize a tax benefit measured at     the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgement, is     more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement.     It further requires that a change in judgment related to the     expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be     recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change.         We file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing     jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse     before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally     resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final     outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain     tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes     reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these reserves, as     well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and     circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could     require the use of cash.     Advertising     and Other Revenues         A portion of our net revenues result from fees associated with     advertising and other services. Net revenues from advertising     are derived principally from the sale of online advertisements     for cash and through barter arrangements. Other net revenues are     derived principally from contractual arrangements with third     parties that provide transaction services to eBay and PayPal     users and interest earned from banks on certain PayPal customer     account balances. Advertising and other net revenues, including     barter transactions, totaled 4% of our consolidated net revenues     for 2007 and 3% in 2005 and 2006, and were primarily generated     by our Marketplaces segment. Revenue from barter arrangements     totaled $1.4 million in 2006 and $6.7 million in 2005.     Revenue from barter arrangements was not significant in 2007.     Certain judgments are involved in the determination of the     appropriate revenue recognition, including, but not limited to,     the assessment and allocation of fair values in multiple element     arrangements, the appropriateness of gross or net revenue     recognition and, for barter transactions, the existence of     comparable cash transactions to establish fair values. We     evaluate whether payments made to customers or revenues earned     from vendors have a separate identifiable benefit and whether     they are fairly valued in determining the appropriate     classification of the related revenues and expense.     Goodwill     and Intangible Assets         The purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between     intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired     business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as     goodwill. The determination of the value of the intangible     assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates. These     judgments can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows     that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the     appropriate weighted average cost of capital.         At December 31, 2007, our goodwill totaled     $6.3 billion and our identifiable intangible assets totaled     $596.0 million. We assess the impairment of goodwill of our     reportable units annually, or more often if events or changes in     circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be     recoverable. This assessment is based upon a discounted cash     flow analysis and analysis of our market capitalization. The     estimate of cash flow is based upon, among other things, certain     assumptions about expected future operating performance and an     appropriate discount        67    Table of Contents       rate determined by our management. Our estimates of discounted     cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other     things, economic conditions, changes to its business model or     changes in operating performance. Additionally, certain     estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses with     limited financial history and developing revenue models, which     increase the risk of differences between the projected and     actual performance. Significant differences between these     estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our     future financial results. These factors increase the risk of     differences between projected and actual performance that could     impact future estimates of fair value of all reporting units,     particularly, our Communications reporting unit. We conducted     our annual impairment test of goodwill as of August 31,     2007 in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill     and Other Intangible Assets. As a result of this test, we     concluded that the carrying amount of our Communications     reporting unit exceeded its fair value and recorded an     impairment loss of approximately $1.4 billion during the     year ended December 31, 2007. The impairment charge     includes the impact of the earn out settlement payment with     certain former shareholders of Skype and was determined by     comparing the carrying value of goodwill in our Communications     reporting unit with the implied fair value of the goodwill. See     Note 3  Business Combinations, Goodwill     and Intangible Assets in the consolidated financial     statements included elsewhere in this report for further     details. There was no impairment of goodwill or identifiable     intangible assets in 2006 and 2005.     Stock-Based     Compensation         On January 1, 2006, we adopted FAS 123(R), which     requires a fair value measurement and recognition of     compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to     our employees and directors, including employee stock options,     employee stock purchases and restricted stock awards.     Stock-based compensation expense recognized for 2007 and 2006     was $301.8 million and $317.4 million, respectively.     For 2005, stock-based compensation expense of $31.8 million     was recognized under previous accounting standards. See     Note 12  Benefit Plans in the     consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this     report for additional information.         We calculated the fair value of each option award on the date of     grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The     determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the     date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our     stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly     complex and subjective variables. The use of a Black-Scholes     model requires extensive actual employee exercise behavior data     and a number of complex assumptions including expected life,     expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield.     As a result, the future stock-based compensation expense may     differ from our historical amounts. The weighted-average     grant-date fair value of stock options granted during 2007 and     2006 was $10.60 and $10.47 per share, respectively, using the     Black-Scholes model with the following weighted-average     assumptions:                                  Year Ended              December 31,             2006       2007               Risk-free interest rate            4.7%           4.5%          Expected life            3 years           3.5 years          Dividend yield            0%           0%          Expected volatility            36%           37%             Our computation of expected volatility for 2007 and 2006 was     based on a combination of historical and market-based implied     volatility from traded options on our stock. Prior to 2006, our     computation of expected volatility was based on historical     volatility. Our computation of expected life was determined     based on historical experience of similar awards, giving     consideration to the contractual terms of the stock-based     awards, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee     behavior. The interest rate for periods within the contractual     life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve     in effect at the time of grant.     Recent     Accounting Pronouncements         In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board     (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting     Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value     Measurements (FAS 157). FAS 157     defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair     value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements.     FAS 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that     require or permit fair value measurements and, accordingly,        68    Table of Contents       does not require any new fair value measurements. FAS 157     is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,     2007. However on December 14, 2007, the FASB issued a     proposed staff position that would delay the effective date of     FAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial     liabilities to fiscal years beginning after November 15,     2008. We do not believe that the adoption of FAS 157 will     materially impact our financial position, cash flows or results     of operations.         In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,     The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial     Liabilities  Including an Amendment of FASB Statement     No. 115, (FAS 159) which is     effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,     2007. This statement permits an entity to choose to measure many     financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at     specified election dates. Subsequent unrealized gains and losses     on items for which the fair value option has been elected will     be reported in earnings. We do not believe that the adoption of     FAS 159 will materially impact our financial position, cash     flows or results of operations.         In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141     (Revised 2007), Business Combinations     (FAS 141(R)). FAS 141(R) establishes     principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business     combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements     the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any     noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, as well as the     goodwill acquired. Significant changes from current practice     resulting from FAS 141(R) include the expansion of the     definitions of a business and a business     combination. For all business combinations (whether     partial, full or step acquisitions), the acquirer will record     100% of all assets and liabilities of the acquired business,     including goodwill, generally at their fair values; contingent     consideration will be recognized at its fair value on the     acquisition date and, for certain arrangements, changes in fair     value will be recognized in earnings until settlement; and     acquisition-related transaction and restructuring costs will be     expensed rather than treated as part of the cost of the     acquisition. FAS 141(R) also establishes disclosure     requirements to enable users to evaluate the nature and     financial effects of the business combination. FAS 141(R)     applies prospectively to business combinations for which the     acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first     annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,     2008. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this     statement.         In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,     Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial     Statements  An Amendment of ARB No. 51     (FAS 160). FAS 160 amends ARB 51 to     establish accounting and reporting standards for the     noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the     deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a     noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, which is sometimes     referred to as minority interest, is a third-party ownership     interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as a     component of equity in the consolidated financial statements.     Among other requirements, FAS 160 requires consolidated     statement of operations to be reported at amounts that include     the amounts attributable to both the parent and the     noncontrolling interest. FAS 160 also requires disclosure,     on the face of the consolidated income statement, of the amounts     of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the     noncontrolling interest. FAS 160 is effective for fiscal     years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning     on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is     prohibited. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of     this statement.           ITEM 7A:     QUANTITATIVE     AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Interest     Rate Risk         The primary objective of our investment activities is to     preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields     without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this     objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and     short-term and long-term investments in a variety of securities,     including government and corporate securities and money market     funds. These securities are generally classified as available     for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at     fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a     separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income     (loss), net of estimated tax.         Investments in both fixed-rate and floating-rate     interest-earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest     rate risk. The fair market value of our fixed-rate securities     may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. In     general, securities with longer maturities are subject to     greater interest-rate risk than those with shorter maturities.     While floating rate securities generally are subject to less     interest-rate risk than fixed-rate securities, floating-rate     securities may produce less income than expected if interest     rates decrease. Due in part to these factors, our investment     income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in     principal if securities are sold that        69    Table of Contents       have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.     As of December 31, 2007, our fixed income investments     earned a pretax yield of approximately 5.3%, with a weighted     average maturity of one month. If interest rates were to     instantaneously increase (decrease) by 100 basis points,     the fair market value of our total fixed-income investment     portfolio could decrease (increase) by approximately     $0.1 million.         As of December 31, 2007, the carrying value of our cash and     cash equivalents approximated fair value and represented     approximately 84% of our total cash and investment portfolio,     the majority of which were held in bank deposits. We held no     direct investments in auction rate securities, collateralized     debt obligations, structured investment vehicles or     mortgaged-backed securities.     Equity     Price Risk         We are exposed to equity price risk on the marketable portion of     equity instruments and equity method investments we hold,     typically as the result of strategic investments in third     parties that are subject to considerable market risk due to     their volatility. We typically do not attempt to reduce or     eliminate our market exposure in these equity investments. We     did not record an impairment charge during the years ended     December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005 relating to the     other-than-temporary impairment in the fair value of equity     investments. At December 31, 2007, the total fair value of     our equity instruments and equity method investments was     $711.2 million, which represented approximately 14% of our     total cash and investment portfolio. As of January 31,     2008, the value of an equity instrument had diminished by     approximately $297.3 million due to fluctuations in market     value.     Foreign     Currency Exposures         We are a growing company, with an increasing proportion of our     operations conducted outside the U.S. Our foreign currency     exposure continues to evolve as we grow internationally. The     objective of our foreign exchange exposure management program is     to identify material foreign currency exposures and to manage     these exposures to minimize the potential effects of currency     fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flow and results     of operations.         International net revenues result from transactions by our     foreign operations and are typically denominated in the local     currency of each country. These operations also incur most of     their expenses in the local currency. Accordingly, certain     foreign operations use the local currency, which is primarily     the Euro, and to a lesser extent, the British pound and Korean     won, as their functional currency. Our international operations     are subject to risks typical of international operations,     including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions,     changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other     regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate     volatility. Accordingly, our future results could be materially     adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors. In     addition, at December 31, 2007, we held balances in cash     and cash equivalents outside the U.S. totaling     approximately $4.0 billion.         Our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction, economic     and translation:     Transaction     Exposure         Around the world, we have certain assets and liabilities,     primarily receivables, investments and accounts payable     (including inter-company transactions) that are denominated in     currencies other than the relevant entitys functional     currency. In certain circumstances, changes in the functional     currency value of these assets and liabilities create     fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position,     results of operations and cash flows. We may enter into foreign     exchange contracts or other instruments to minimize the     short-term foreign currency fluctuations on such assets and     liabilities. The gains and losses on the foreign exchange     contracts offset the transaction gains and losses on certain     foreign currency receivables, investments and payables     recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2007, we had     outstanding foreign exchange hedge contracts with notional     values equivalent to approximately $171.8 million with     maturity dates within 31 days. The hedge contracts are used     to offset changes in the functional currency value of assets and     liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as a result of     currency fluctuations. Transaction gains and losses on the     contracts and the assets and liabilities are recognized each     period in our consolidated statement of income.        70    Table of Contents   Economic     Exposure         We transact business in various foreign currencies and have     significant international revenues as well as costs denominated     in foreign currencies, subjecting us to foreign currency risk.     In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries on a     monthly basis for their use of intellectual property and     technology and for certain corporate services provided by eBay     and by PayPal. These charges are denominated in Euros and these     forecasted inter-company transactions represent a foreign     currency cash flow exposure. We purchase foreign exchange     contracts, generally with maturities of 12 months or less,     to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to     forecasted revenue and intercompany transactions denominated in     certain foreign currencies. The objective of the foreign     exchange contracts is to better ensure that the     U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are not adversely     affected by changes in the U.S. dollar/foreign currency     exchange rate. Pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards     No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and     Hedging Activities (FAS 133), we expect     the hedge of certain of these forecasted transactions to be     highly effective in offsetting potential changes in cash flows     attributed to a change in the U.S. dollar/foreign currency     exchange rate. Accordingly, the effective portion of the     derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a     component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and     subsequently reclassified into the financial statements line     item in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the     forecasted transaction affects earnings.         During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,     the realized gains and losses related to these hedges were not     significant. The notional amount of our economic hedges     receiving hedge accounting treatment was $515.7 million and     $203.0 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2005,     respectively. The loss, net of gains, recorded to accumulated     other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2007 and 2005     was not significant. We did not have any economic hedges in     place as of December 31, 2006.     Translation     Exposure         As our international operations grow, fluctuations in the     foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of     operations because we are required to consolidate the results of     operations of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries. We     may decide to purchase foreign exchange contracts or other     instruments to offset the earnings impact of currency     fluctuations. Such contracts will be marked-to-market on a     monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss will be recorded     in interest and other income, net.         Foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our     financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign     operations are translated into U.S. dollars in preparing     our consolidated balance sheet. The effect of foreign exchange     rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position for the     year ended December 31, 2007, was a net translation gain of     approximately $645.2 million. This gain is recognized as an     adjustment to stockholders equity through accumulated     other comprehensive income. Additionally, foreign exchange rate     fluctuations may adversely impact our operating results as the     revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated     into U.S. dollars in preparing our consolidated statement     of income. The effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations     positively impacted our consolidated net revenues and operating     income for the year ended December 31, 2007 by     approximately $276.2 million and $145.7 million,     respectively, compared to the prior year.         We consolidate the earnings of our international subsidiaries by     converting them into U.S. dollars in accordance with     SFAS No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation     (FAS 52). Such earnings will fluctuate when     there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates. We enter     into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency     denominated earnings translation exposure using either exchange     contracts or other instruments. All contracts that hedge     translation exposure mature ratably over the quarter in which     they are executed. During the year ended December 31, 2007,     the realized gains and losses related to these hedges were not     significant.         A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening or weakening in the     value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro, British     pound and Korean won in which our revenues and profits are     denominated would result in a decrease/increase to operating     income of approximately $13.7 million. There are inherent     limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented, due primarily     to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are     linear and instantaneous. As a result, the analysis is unable to     reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes     that could arise, which may positively or negatively affect     income.        71    Table of Contents         ITEM 8:     FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA           The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes     listed in Part IV, Item 15(a)(1) of this Annual Report     on     Form 10-K     are included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

ITEM 9A:     CONTROLS     AND PROCEDURES       Evaluation of disclosure controls and     procedures.  Based on the evaluation of our     disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the     Rules 13a-15(e)     and     15d-15(e)     under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act)     required by Exchange Act     Rules 13a-15(b)     or     15d-15(b),     our principal executive officer and our principal financial     officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered     by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were     effective.     Changes in internal controls.  There were no     changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as     defined in Exchange Act     Rule 13a-15(f)     that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter     that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to     materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.     Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial     Reporting.  Our management is responsible for     establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over     financial reporting. Our management, including our principal     executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an     evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over     financial reporting based on the framework in Internal     Control  Integrated Framework issued by the     Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway     Commission. Based on its evaluation under the framework in     Internal Control  Integrated Framework, our     management concluded that our internal control over financial     reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007.         The effectiveness of our internal control over financial     reporting as of December 31, 2007 has been audited by     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public     accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in     Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on     Form 10-K.

(c)        The financial statement schedules required by this item are     listed under Item 15 (a) (2) above.        77    Table of Contents      Report of     Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm          To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of eBay Inc.:         In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in     the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in     all material respects, the financial position of eBay Inc. and     its subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and December 31,     2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows     for each of the three years in the period ended     December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles     generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,     in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the     index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all     material respects, the information set forth therein when read     in conjunction with the related consolidated financial     statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all     material respects, effective internal control over financial     reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria     established in Internal Control  Integrated     Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring     Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The     Companys management is responsible for these financial     statements and the financial statement schedule, for maintaining     effective internal control over financial reporting and for its     assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over     financial reporting, included in Managements Report on     Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under     Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these     financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and     on the Companys internal control over financial reporting     based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in     accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting     Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we     plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about     whether the financial statements are free of material     misstatement and whether effective internal control over     financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our     audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test     basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the     financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used     and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the     overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal     control over financial reporting included obtaining an     understanding of internal control over financial reporting,     assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing     and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of     internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also     included performing such other procedures as we considered     necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits     provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.         As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial     statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts     for stock-based compensation in 2006. As discussed in     Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the     Company changed the manner in which it accounts for uncertainty     in income taxes in 2007.         A companys internal control over financial reporting is a     process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the     reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of     financial statements for external purposes in accordance with     generally accepted accounting principles. A companys     internal control over financial reporting includes those     policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the     maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately     and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the     assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance     that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit     preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally     accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and     expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance     with authorizations of management and directors of the company;     and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention     or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or     disposition of the companys assets that could have a     material effect on the financial statements.         Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over     financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.     Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future     periods are subject to the risk that controls may become     inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree     of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.     /s/  Pricewaterhouse     Coopers LLP         San Jose, California     February 28, 2008        78    Table of Contents   eBay     Inc.

Contents   eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      Note 1  The     Company and Summary of Significant Accounting     Policies:     The     Company         eBay Inc. (eBay) was incorporated in California in     May 1996, and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.     eBays purpose is to pioneer new communities around the     world, built on commerce, sustained by trust, and inspired by     opportunity. eBay brings together millions of buyers and sellers     every day on a local, national and international basis through     an array of websites. eBay provides online marketplaces for the     sale of goods and services, online payment services and online     communication offerings to a diverse community of individuals     and businesses.         eBay has three operating segments: Marketplaces, Payments and     Communications. The Marketplaces segment enables online commerce     through a variety of different platforms, including the     traditional eBay website, our classifieds websites, Half.com,     our comparison shopping site (Shopping.com), our secondary     tickets platform (StubHub), and Rent.com. The Payments segment,     which consists of our PayPal, Inc. (PayPal)     business, enables individuals or businesses to securely, easily     and quickly send and receive payments online. The Communications     segment, which consists of our Skype Technologies SA     (Skype) business, enables Voice over Internet     Protocol (VoIP) calls between Skype users, as well as provides     low-cost connectivity to traditional fixed-line and mobile     telephones.         When we refer to we, our, us     or eBay in this document, we mean the current     Delaware corporation (eBay Inc.) and its California predecessor,     as well as all of our consolidated subsidiaries.     Use of     estimates         The preparation of consolidated financial statements in     conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting     principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions     that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and     disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of     the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts     of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an     ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those     related to provisions for doubtful accounts and authorized     credits, the provision for transaction losses, legal     contingencies, income taxes, advertising and other net revenues,     stock-based compensation and goodwill and intangible assets. We     base our estimates on historical experience and on various other     assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the     circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.     Principles     of consolidation and basis of presentation         The accompanying financial statements are consolidated and     include the financial statements of eBay and our majority-owned     subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and     transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.         The consolidated financial statements include 100% of the assets     and liabilities of these majority-owned subsidiaries and the     ownership interests of minority investors are recorded as     minority interests. Investments in private entities where we     hold more than a 20% but less than a 50% ownership interest are     accounted for using the equity method of accounting and the     investment balance is included in long-term investments, while     our share of the investees results of operations is     included in interest and other income, net. Investments in     private entities where we hold less than a 20% ownership     interest and where we do not have the ability to significantly     influence the operations of the investee are accounted for using     the cost method of accounting and are included in long-term     investments.         Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform     to the current period presentation.     Fair     value of financial instruments         Cash and cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid     investments with original or remaining maturities of three     months or less when purchased. Our financial instruments,     including cash, cash equivalents, accounts        84    Table of Contents   eBay Inc.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)         receivable, funds receivable, accounts payable, funds payable     and amounts due to customers are carried at cost, which     approximates their fair value because of the short-term maturity     of these instruments.         Short and long-term investments, which include marketable equity     securities and government and corporate bonds, are classified as     available-for-sale and reported at fair value using the specific     identification method. Unrealized gains and losses are excluded     from earnings and reported as a component of other comprehensive     income (loss), net of related estimated tax provisions or     benefits. Additionally, we assess whether an     other-than-temporary impairment loss on our investments has     occurred due to declines in fair value or other market     conditions. Declines in fair value that are considered other     than temporary are recorded as an impairment of investments in     the consolidated statement of income.     Derivative     instruments         We use derivative financial instruments primarily foreign     exchange currency contracts to hedge foreign currency risk. We     also may use other derivative instruments not designated as     hedges such as forwards to hedge foreign currency balance sheet     exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for     speculative purposes. We account for our derivative and hedging     activities pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards     No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and     Hedging Activities (FAS 133). The assets     or liabilities associated with our derivative instruments and     hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current     assets or other current liabilities, respectively, in our     consolidated balance sheet. See Note 6      Derivative Instruments for a full description of our     derivative financial instrument activities and related     accounting policies     Concentrations     of credit risk         Our cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and funds     receivable are potentially subject to concentration of credit     risk. Cash and cash equivalents are placed with financial     institutions that management believes are of high credit     quality. Our accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned     from customers located in the U.S. and internationally.     Accounts receivable balances are settled through customer credit     cards, debit cards, and PayPal accounts, with the majority of     accounts receivable collected upon processing of credit card     transactions. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts     receivable and authorized credits based upon our historical     experience. Historically, such losses have been within our     expectations. However, unexpected or significant future changes     in trends could result in a material impact to future statements     of income or cash flows. Due to the relatively small dollar     amount of individual accounts receivable, we generally do not     require collateral on these balances. The provision for doubtful     accounts is recorded as a charge to general and administrative     expense, while the provision for authorized credits is     recognized as a reduction of net revenues.         During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006, and 2007,     no customers accounted for more than 10% of net revenues. As of     December 31, 2006 and 2007, no customers accounted for more     than 10% of net accounts receivable.     Allowances     for transaction losses         Our Payments segment is exposed to transaction losses due to     credit card and other payment misuse, as well as non-performance     of and credit losses from sellers who accept payment through     PayPal. We establish allowances for estimated losses arising     from processing customer transactions, such as chargebacks for     unauthorized credit card use and merchant related chargebacks     due to non-delivery of goods or services, Automated Clearing     House (ACH) returns, buyer protection program claims     and debit card overdrafts. These allowances represent an     accumulation of the estimated amounts necessary to provide for     transaction losses incurred as of the reporting date, including     those of which we have not yet been notified. The allowances,     which involve the use of actuarial techniques, are monitored     monthly and are updated based on actual claims data reported by     our claims processors. The allowances are based on known facts     and circumstances, internal factors including our experience     with similar cases, historical trends involving loss payment     patterns and the mix of transaction and loss types. Additions to     the        85    Table of Contents   eBay Inc.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)         allowance, in the form of provisions, are reflected as a general     and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of     income. At December 31, 2006 and 2007, the allowance for     transaction losses totaled $79.5 million and     $80.1 million, respectively, and was included as an offset     to other current assets and accrued expenses and other current     liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.     Foreign     currency         Certain of our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency of     their respective countries as their functional currency. Assets     and liabilities are translated at exchange rates prevailing at     the balance sheet dates. Revenues, costs and expenses are     translated into United States dollars at average exchange rates     for the period. Gains and losses resulting from translation are     recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive     income (loss).         Realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are     recognized as interest and other income, net.     Funds     receivable and funds payable         Funds receivable and payable relate to our Payments segment and     arise due to the time taken to clear transactions through     external payment networks. When customers fund their account     using their bank account or credit card, or withdraw money to     their bank account or through a debit card transaction, there is     a clearing period before the cash is received or settled by     PayPal, usually one to three business days for     U.S. transactions, and up to five business days for     international transactions. Hence, these funds are treated as a     receivable or payable, as the case may be, until the cash is     settled.     Customer     accounts         Based on differences in regulatory requirements and commercial     law in the jurisdictions where PayPal operates, PayPal holds     customer balances either as direct claims against PayPal or as     an agent or custodian on behalf of PayPals customers.     Customer balances held as direct claims against PayPal are     included on our consolidated balance sheet as customer accounts     with an offsetting current liability in funds payable and     amounts due to customers. The customer accounts can be invested     only in specified types of liquid assets.         All customer funds held by PayPal as an agent or custodian on     behalf of our customers are not reflected in our consolidated     balance sheet. These off-balance sheet funds totaled     approximately $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion as of     December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. These off-balance     sheet funds include funds held in the U.S. that are     deposited in bank accounts insured by the Federal Deposit     Insurance Corporation and funds that customers choose to invest     in the PayPal Money Market Fund. The PayPal Money Market Fund is     invested in a portfolio managed by Barclays Global     Fund Advisors.     Property     and equipment         Property and equipment are stated at historical cost less     accumulated depreciation. Depreciation and amortization are     computed using the straight-line method over the estimated     useful lives of the assets, generally, one to three years for     computer equipment and software, up to 30 years for     buildings and building improvements, ten years for aviation     equipment, the shorter of five years or the term of the lease     for leasehold improvements, three years for furniture and     fixtures and three years for vehicles.     Goodwill     and intangible assets         Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the     fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible     assets acquired in a business combination. Intangible assets     resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using     the purchase method of accounting are estimated by management     based on the fair value of assets received. Identifiable     intangible assets are comprised of purchased customer lists and     user base, trademarks and trade names, developed technologies,     and other intangible assets. Identifiable intangible assets are     being        86    Table of Contents   eBay Inc.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)         amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the     straight-line method and estimated useful lives ranging from one     to eight years. Goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is     subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment,     applying a fair-value based test.         We evaluate goodwill, at a minimum, on an annual basis and     whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the     carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment of goodwill     is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting     units carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair     value of the reporting unit. The fair values of the reporting     units are estimated using a combination of the income or     discounted cash flows approach and the market approach, which     utilizes comparable companies data. If the carrying amount     of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is     considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure     the amount of impairment loss, if any. We conducted our annual     impairment test as of August 31, 2007. As a result of this     test, we concluded that the carrying amount of our     Communications reporting unit exceeded its fair value and     recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion     during the year ended December 31, 2007. The impairment     charge includes the impact of the earn out settlement payment to     certain former shareholders of Skype and was determined by     comparing the carrying value of goodwill in our Communications     reporting unit with the implied fair value of the goodwill. See     Note 3  Business Combinations, Goodwill     and Intangible Assets for further details. There were no     events or circumstances from that date through December 31,     2007 that would impact this assessment.     Impairment     of long-lived assets         We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or     changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a     long-lived asset may not be recoverable. An asset is considered     impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future net cash flow     the asset is expected to generate. If an asset is considered to     be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the     amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its     fair market value. We assess the recoverability of our     long-lived and intangible assets by determining whether the     unamortized balances can be recovered through undiscounted     future net cash flows of the related assets. The amount of     impairment, if any, is measured based on projected discounted     future net cash flows.     Revenue     recognition         Our net revenues result from transaction, advertising and other     fees generated in our Marketplaces, Payments and Communications     segments. Revenues are recognized when evidence of an     arrangement exists, the fee is fixed and determinable, no     significant obligation remains and collection of the receivable     is reasonably assured.         Our Marketplaces segment generates transaction revenues for     listing, final value fee and feature fees and lead referral     fees. Listing and feature fee revenues are recognized ratably     over the estimated period of the listing, while revenues related     to final value fees are recognized at the time that the     transaction is successfully concluded. A transaction is     considered successfully concluded when at least one buyer has     bid above the sellers specified minimum price or reserve     price, whichever is higher, at the end of the transaction term.     Lead referral fee revenue is generated from lead referral fees     based on the number of times a user clicks through to a     merchants website from our websites. Lead referral fees     are recognized in the period in which the user clicks through to     the merchants website.         Our Payments segment earns transaction revenues from processing     transactions for certain customers. Revenues resulting from a     payment processing transaction are recognized once the     transaction is complete.         Our Communications segment revenues are recognized when the     related service offering is provided. The majority of     Communications segment transaction revenues are prepaid. We     record customer advances for prepaid amounts in excess of     revenues recognized as a current liability.         Our advertising revenues are derived principally from the sale     of online advertisements. To date, the duration of our     advertising contracts has ranged from one week to five years,     but is generally one week to one year. Advertising revenues on     contracts are recognized as impressions (i.e., the     number of times that an advertisement        87    Table of Contents   eBay Inc.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)         appears in pages viewed by users of our websites) are delivered;     as clicks (which are generated each time users on     our websites click through our text-based advertisements to an     advertisers designated website) are provided to     advertisers; or ratably over the term of the agreement where     such agreements provide for minimum monthly or quarterly     advertising commitments or where such commitments are fixed     throughout the term. Barter transactions are valued on amounts     realized in similar cash transactions occurring within six     months prior to the date of the barter transaction. To the     extent that significant delivery obligations remain at the end     of a period or collection of the resulting account receivable is     not considered probable, revenues are deferred until the     obligation is satisfied or the uncertainty is resolved. These     amounts are included in deferred revenues in our consolidated     balance sheet. Revenue from barter arrangements totaled     $6.7 million and $1.4 million for the years ended     December 31, 2005 and 2006 respectively, with the     reciprocal arrangements being recognized as an operating     expense. Revenue from barter arrangements was not significant in     2007. The services are normally received in the same period in     which the reciprocal services are provided. In certain     circumstances, we are required to record, as a reduction of     revenue, payments to a party who is also a customer. These     payments primarily consist of certain promotional activities     which result in payments to our users.         Our other revenues are derived principally from contractual     arrangements with third parties that provide transaction     services to eBay and PayPal users and interest earned from banks     on certain PayPal customer account balances. Revenues from     contractual arrangements with third parties are recognized as     the contracted services are delivered to end users. Revenues     from interest income are recognized when earned.         We evaluate whether payments made to customers or revenues     earned from vendors have a separate identifiable benefit and     whether they are fairly valued in determining the appropriate     classification of the related revenues and expense. For revenue     agreements with multiple deliverables we ensure all undelivered     elements are accounted for at fair value and recognized as     revenue when delivered.         Provisions for doubtful accounts, transaction losses and     authorized credits are made at the time of revenue recognition     based upon our historical experience. The provision for doubtful     accounts and transaction losses are recorded as charges to     operating expense, while the provision for authorized credits is     recognized as a reduction of net revenues.     Product     development costs         Costs related to the planning and post implementation phases of     our website development efforts are recorded as an operating     expense. Direct costs incurred in the development phase are     capitalized and amortized over the products estimated     useful life of one to three years as charges to cost of net     revenues.     Advertising     expense         We expense the costs of producing advertisements at the time     production occurs and expense the cost of communicating     advertising in the period during which the advertising space or     airtime is used. Internet advertising expenses are recognized     based on the terms of the individual agreements, which is     generally over the greater of the ratio of the number of     impressions delivered over the total number of contracted     impressions,     pay-per-click,     or on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.     Advertising expenses totaled $665.1 million,     $871.0 million and $1.0 billion during the years ended     December 31, 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively.     Stock-based     compensation         We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards     (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share     Based Payment (FAS 123(R)) using the     modified prospective transition method beginning January 1,     2006. Accordingly, during 2006 and 2007, we recorded stock-based     compensation expense for awards granted prior to, but not yet     vested, as of January 1, 2006, as if the fair value method     required for pro forma disclosure under FAS 123 were in     effect for expense recognition purposes, adjusted for estimated     forfeitures. For these awards, we have continued to        88    Table of Contents   eBay Inc.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)         recognize compensation expense using the accelerated     amortization method under FIN 28. For stock-based awards     granted after January 1, 2006, we have recognized     compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair     value method using the Black-Scholes valuation model. For these     awards, we have recognized compensation expense using a     straight-line amortization method. As FAS 123(R) requires     that stock-based compensation expense be based on awards that     are ultimately expected to vest, stock-based compensation for     2006 and 2007 has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. When     estimating forfeitures, we consider voluntary termination     behaviors as well as trends of actual option forfeitures. We     recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in equity if     an incremental tax benefit is realized by following the ordering     provisions of the tax law. In addition, we account for the     indirect effects of stock-based compensation on the research tax     credit and the foreign tax credit through the income statement.     Income     taxes         We account for income taxes using an asset and liability     approach, which requires the recognition of taxes payable or     refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and     assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been     recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. The     measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities     is based on provisions of enacted tax laws; the effects of     future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. If     necessary, the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by     the amount of any tax benefits that are not expected to be     realized based on available evidence.         We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with     Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)     Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in     Income Taxes (FIN 48). Accordingly, we     report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from     uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax     return. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to     unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.     Recent     accounting pronouncements         In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial     Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair     Value Measurements (FAS 157).     FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for     measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value     measurements. FAS 157 applies under other accounting     pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements     and, accordingly, does not require any new fair value     measurements. FAS 157 is effective for fiscal years     beginning after November 15, 2007. However on     December 14, 2007, the FASB issued a proposed staff     position that would delay the effective date of FAS 157 for     nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities to fiscal years     beginning after November 15, 2008. We do not believe that     the adoption of FAS 157 will materially impact our     financial position, cash flows or results of operations.         In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,     The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial     Liabilities  Including an Amendment of FASB Statement     No. 115 (FAS 159), which is     effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,     2007. This statement permits an entity to choose to measure many     financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at     specified election dates. Subsequent unrealized gains and losses     on items for which the fair value option has been elected will     be reported in earnings. We do not believe that the adoption of     FAS 159 will materially impact our financial position, cash     flows or results of operations.         In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141     (Revised 2007), Business Combinations     (FAS 141(R)). FAS 141(R) establishes     principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business     combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements     the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any     noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, as well as the     goodwill acquired. Significant changes from current practice     resulting from FAS 141(R) include the expansion of the     definitions of a business and a business     combination. For all business combinations (whether     partial, full or step acquisitions), the acquirer will record     100% of all assets and liabilities of the acquired business,     including goodwill, generally at their fair values; contingent     consideration will be recognized at its fair value on the     acquisition date and, for certain arrangements, changes in fair     value will be recognized in earnings until settlement; and     acquisition-related transaction and restructuring costs will be     expensed rather than        89    Table of Contents   eBay Inc.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)         treated as part of the cost of the acquisition. FAS 141(R)     also establishes disclosure requirements to enable users to     evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business     combination. FAS 141(R) applies prospectively to business     combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the     beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or     after December 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the     potential impact of this statement.         In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,     Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial     Statements  An amendment of ARB No. 51     (FAS 160). FAS 160 amends ARB 51 to     establish accounting and reporting standards for the     noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the     deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a     noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, which is sometimes     referred to as minority interest, is a third-party ownership     interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as a     component of equity in the consolidated financial statements.     Among other requirements, FAS 160 requires consolidated     statement of operations to be reported at amounts that include     the amounts attributable to both the parent and the     noncontrolling interest. FAS 160 also requires disclosure,     on the face of the consolidated income statement, of the amounts     of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the     noncontrolling interest. FAS 160 is effective for fiscal     years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning     on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is     prohibited. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of     this statement.     Note 2  Net     Income Per Share:         Basic net income per share is computed by dividing the net     income for the period by the weighted average number of common     shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per     share is computed by dividing the net income for the period by     the weighted average number of shares of common stock and     potentially dilutive common stock outstanding during the period.     The dilutive effect of outstanding options, restricted stock     units and nonvested stock is reflected in diluted earnings per     share by application of the treasury stock method, which     starting on January 1, 2006, includes consideration of     stock-based compensation required by FAS 123(R).

Note 3         Business     Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets:           Our purchase acquisitions in 2007, 2006 and 2005 with aggregate     purchase prices in excess of $100 million were as follows:     StubHub,     Inc.         On February 13, 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding     shares of StubHub, Inc. (StubHub) for a total     purchase price of $292.4 million. The purchase price was     comprised of cash totaling $283.2 million,     $1.1 million in estimated acquisition-related expenses and     the assumption of StubHubs outstanding common stock     options, valued at approximately $8.1 million. The fair     value of StubHub stock options assumed was determined using a     Black-Scholes model. StubHub is an online marketplace that     facilitates the resale of event tickets and is included within     our Marketplaces segment.         We accounted for the acquisition as a taxable purchase     transaction and, accordingly, the purchase price has been     allocated to the tangible assets, liabilities assumed, and     identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated     fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase     price over the aggregate fair values was recorded as goodwill.     The fair value assigned to identifiable intangible assets     acquired is determined using the income approach, which     discounts expected future cash flows to present value using     estimates and assumptions determined by management. Purchased     intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over     the respective useful lives. Our preliminary allocation of the     purchase price is summarized below (in thousands):                               Net liabilities assumed, net of cash of $25,780            $       (15,663       )          Goodwill                221,604              Trade name                44,400              User base                29,000              Developed technology                13,100                                    Total            $       292,441                                       The estimated useful economic lives of the identifiable     intangible assets acquired are three years for the trade name     and developed technology and five years for the user base.         The results of operations for periods prior to our acquisition     of StubHub, were not material to our consolidated statement of     income and, accordingly, pro forma results of operations have     not been presented.         In 2006, we did not make any acquisitions with a total aggregate     purchase price in excess of $100 million.         In 2005, we acquired Rent.com, Shopping.com, Skype and     VeriSigns payment gateway business for an aggregate     purchase price of approximately $4.1 billion, resulting in     goodwill of $3.4 billion and identifiable intangible assets     of $0.6 billion.        91    Table of Contents   eBay Inc.

Such investments include identifiable intangible assets,     deferred tax liabilities and goodwill. Goodwill related to our     equity method investments, included above, was approximately     $27.4 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2007.         The changes in goodwill during the year ended December 31,     2007 were substantially due to the recording of goodwill for     completed acquisitions, the earn out settlement with certain     former shareholders of Skype, impairment charges related to     Skype and foreign currency translation adjustments.         We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of     August 31, 2007 in accordance with SFAS No. 142,     Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As a result of     this test, we concluded that the carrying amount of our     Communications reporting unit exceeded its fair value and     recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion     during the year ended December 31, 2007. The impairment     charge includes the impact of the earn out settlement payment     described below and was determined by comparing the carrying     value of goodwill in our Communications reporting unit with the     implied fair value of the goodwill. We determined the fair value     of the Communications reporting unit using the income approach,     which requires estimates of future operating results and cash     flows discounted using an estimated discount rate. Our estimates     resulted from an updated long-term financial outlook developed     as part of our strategic planning cycle conducted annually     during our third quarter. Our estimates of future operating     results for our Communications reporting unit are for an early     stage business with limited financial history, as well as     developing revenue models. These factors increase the risk of     differences between projected and actual performance that could     impact future estimates of fair value of the Communications     reporting unit.         In conjunction with our acquisition of Skype in 2005, we agreed     to certain performance-based earn out payments. During the year     ended December 31, 2007, we entered into an earn out     settlement agreement with each of the former shareholders of     Skype who had elected the earn out alternative at the time of     the acquisition, under which we were relieved of all obligations     under the original earn out agreement in exchange for an     aggregate cash payment of 375.1 million, or     approximately $530.3 million. Goodwill was recorded because     the earn out settlement amount was considered additional     purchase price.        92    Table of Contents   eBay Inc.

The increase in intangible assets during the year ended     December 31, 2007 resulted primarily from certain     intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisition of the     outstanding shares of StubHub as well as other acquisitions     completed during the year. The net carrying amount of intangible     assets related to our equity investments, included above,     totaled approximately $2.5 million and $1.4 million,     as of December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. Aggregate     amortization expense for intangible assets totaled     $136.4 million, $220.0 million and $229.2 million     for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007,     respectively. Included in amortization of intangibles for the     year ended December 31, 2006, is a charge of     $10.9 million for in-process research and development     related to an asset purchase completed during the period.

The corporate and government securities that we invest in     are generally deemed to be low risk, based on their credit     rating from the major rating agencies. The longer the duration     of these securities, the more susceptible they are to changes in     market interest rates and bond yields. As interest rates     increase, those securities purchased at a lower yield show a     mark-to-market unrealized loss. The unrealized losses are due     primarily to changes in ratings and interest rates. We expect to     realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity or     sale. As of December 31, 2007, the losses on these     securities have an average remaining duration of approximately     one month. Restricted cash is held primarily in money market     funds and interest bearing accounts for letters of credit     related primarily to various lease arrangements.         Effective during 2007, we began to account for our investment in     MercadoLibre as an available-for-sale marketable equity security     due to MercadoLibres initial public offering of its common     stock in August of 2007. As of December 31, 2007, our     investment was recorded at fair value and reported as a     short-term investment with unrealized gains, net of tax,     excluded from earnings and reported as a component of     accumulated other comprehensive income.       96    Table of Contents   eBay Inc.

The total of these investments,     including identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax     liabilities and goodwill, are classified on our balance sheet as     long-term investments. Our consolidated results of operations     include, as a component of other income, our share of the net     income or loss of the equity method investments together with     amortization expense relating to acquired intangible assets. Our     share of the results of investees results of operations is     not significant for any period presented.           Note 6         Derivative     Instruments:           We recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at     fair value. Changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of     the derivatives are recorded each period in the consolidated     statement of income or accumulated other comprehensive income     (loss). For derivative instruments that are designated and     qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the     derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a     component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and     subsequently reclassified into the financial statements line     item in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the     forecasted transaction affects earnings.     Transaction     Exposure         As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding foreign     exchange hedge contracts with notional values equivalent to     approximately $171.8 million with maturity dates within     31 days. The hedge contracts are used to offset changes in     non-US dollar denominated functional currency value of assets     and liabilities as a result of foreign exchange rate     fluctuations. Transaction gains and losses on the contracts and     the assets and liabilities are recognized each period in     interest and other income, net.     Translation     Exposure         We consolidate the earnings of our international subsidiaries by     converting them into U.S. dollars in accordance with     Financial Accounting Standards No. 52 Foreign     Currency Translation (FAS 52). Such     earnings will fluctuate when there is a change in foreign     currency exchange rates. We enter into transactions to hedge     portions of our foreign currency denominated earnings     translation exposure using foreign exchange contracts. All     contracts that hedge translation exposure mature ratably over     the quarter in which they are executed. Translation gains and     losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other     comprehensive income (loss). During the years ended     December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, the realized gains and     losses related to these hedges were not significant.        97    Table of Contents   eBay Inc.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)     Economic     Exposure         We transact business in various foreign currencies and have     significant international revenues as well as costs denominated     in foreign currencies, subjecting us to foreign currency risk.     In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries on a     monthly basis for their use of intellectual property and     technology and for certain corporate services provided by eBay     and by PayPal. These charges are denominated in Euros and these     forecasted inter-company transactions represent a foreign     currency cash flow exposure. We purchase foreign currency     exchange contracts, generally with maturities of 12 months     or less, to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily     related to forecasted revenue and intercompany transactions     denominated in certain foreign currencies. The objective of the     foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that the     U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are not adversely     affected by changes in the U.S. dollar/foreign currency     exchange rate. Pursuant to FAS 133, we expect the hedge of     certain of these forecasted transactions to be highly effective     in offsetting potential changes in cash flows attributed to a     change in the U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate.     Accordingly, we record as a component of accumulated other     comprehensive income all unrealized gains and losses related to     the foreign exchange contracts that receive hedge accounting     treatment. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and     2007, the realized gains and losses related to these hedges were     not significant. For derivative instruments designated as     hedges, hedge ineffectiveness, determined in accordance with     FAS 133, did not have a significant impact on earnings for     years ended December 31, 2005, 2006, or 2007. The notional     amount of our economic hedges receiving cash flow hedge     accounting treatment was $515.7 million as of     December 31, 2007. The losses, net of gains, recorded to     accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31,     2007 were not significant. Amounts included in accumulated other     comprehensive income at December 31, 2007 will be     subsequently reclassified into the financial statements line     item in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the     forecasted transaction affects earnings.

There were no material capital leases at     December 31, 2006 or 2007.     Credit     Agreement         In November 2006, we entered into a credit agreement which     provided for an unsecured $1.0 billion five-year revolving     credit facility. Loans under the credit agreement bore interest     at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from     0.25 percent to 0.45 percent or (ii) a formula     based on the Bank of America, or Agents, prime rate or on     the federal funds effective rate.         In August 2007, we entered into an amendment to our 2006 credit     agreement. The amendment increased the lender commitments and     borrowing capacity under the 2006 credit agreement from its     prior level of $1.0 billion to $2.0 billion,     maintained an option to increase borrowing capacity by an     additional $1.0 billion (after giving effect to the     $1.0 billion increase described above) and extended the     maturity date by an additional year to November 7, 2012.     Loans under the amended credit agreement will bear interest at     LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.20 percent to     0.50 percent. Subject to certain conditions stated in the     credit agreement, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts     under the credit facility at any time during the term of the     credit agreement. Funds borrowed        100    Table of Contents   eBay Inc.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)         under the credit agreement may be used for working capital,     capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate     purposes of eBay and its subsidiaries. We entered into the 2006     credit agreement in order to enhance our financial flexibility.     As of December 31, 2007, we had $200.2 million     outstanding under our credit agreement and these amounts were     included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities     on the consolidated balance sheet. The interest rate as of     December 31, 2007 was 5.06%. As of December 31, 2007,     we were in compliance with the financial covenants associated     with the credit agreement.     Litigation     and Other Legal Matters         In April 2001, two of our European subsidiaries, eBay GmbH and     eBay International AG, were sued by Montres Rolex S.A. and     certain of its affiliates in the regional court of Cologne,     Germany. The suit subsequently was transferred to the regional     court in Düsseldorf, Germany. Rolex alleged that our     subsidiaries were infringing Rolexs trademarks as a result     of users selling counterfeit Rolex watches through our German     website. The suit also alleged unfair competition. Rolex sought     an order enjoining the sale of Rolex-branded watches on the     website as well as damages. In December 2002, a trial was held     in the matter, and the court ruled in favor of eBay on all     causes of action. Rolex appealed the ruling to the Higher     Regional Court of Düsseldorf, and the appeal was heard in     October 2003. In February 2004, the court rejected Rolexs     appeal and ruled in our favor. Rolex appealed the ruling to the     German Federal Supreme Court, a hearing took place before that     court in December 2006, and a written decision was issued in     June 2007. The courts decision found that eBay must take     reasonable measures to prevent recurrence once it is informed of     clearly identified infringement, and that eBay may in certain     circumstances be liable upon first notice of infringement. The     court referred the case back to the Higher Regional Court to     determine whether, in some circumstances, a low starting listing     price was sufficient to indicate that a listing was infringing.     In July 2007, the German Federal Supreme Court extended the     reach of the Rolex decision in IVD v. eBay.     The court held that (i) in certain circumstances, a duty of     care could be found to exist to competitors requiring eBay to     take reasonable measures to prevent illegal items from being     listed (even where the competitors were not directly harmed) and     (ii) such duty would extend to listings by the same seller     in the same category (not just identical listings). Prior to     these decisions, we had implemented proactive measures to find     and remove illegal listings from our websites; these decisions     may require us to undertake further efforts and will subject us     to liability if our efforts are deemed to be insufficient. We     expect that this ruling will likely result in increased costs     and litigation against us in Germany although we do not     currently believe that it will require a major change in our     business practices.         In August 2006, Louis Vuitton Malletier and Christian Dior     Couture filed two lawsuits in the Paris Court of Commerce     against eBay Inc. and eBay International AG. The complaint     alleges that we violated French tort law by negligently     broadcasting listings posted by third parties offering     counterfeit items bearing plaintiffs trademarks, and by     purchasing certain advertising keywords. The plaintiffs seek     approximately EUR 37 million in damages. Around     September 2006, Parfums Christian Dior, Kenzo Parfums, Parfums     Givenchy, and Guerlain Société also filed a lawsuit in     the Paris Court of Commerce against eBay Inc. and eBay     International AG. The complaint alleges that we have interfered     with the selective distribution network the plaintiffs     established in France and the European Union by allowing third     parties to post listings offering genuine perfumes and cosmetics     for sale on our websites. The plaintiffs in this suit seek     approximately EUR 9 million in damages and injunctive     relief. We filed our initial briefs responding to the first     complaint in February 2007, and initial briefs in response to     the second complaint were filed in April 2007. We believe that     we have meritorious defenses to these suits and intend to defend     ourselves vigorously. Other luxury brand owners have also filed     suit against us or have threatened to do so, seeking to hold us     liable for counterfeit items listed on our websites by third     parties, for tester and other not for resale     consumer products listed on our websites by third parties, for     the misuse of trademarks in listings, for alleged violations of     selective distribution channel laws, for non-compliance of     consumer protection laws or in connection with paid search     advertisements.         In September 2001, MercExchange LLC filed a complaint against     us, our Half.com subsidiary and ReturnBuy, Inc. in the     U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia     (No. 2:01-CV-736)     alleging infringement of three patents (relating to online     consignment auction technology, multiple database searching and     electronic        101    Table of Contents   eBay Inc.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)         consignment systems) and seeking a permanent injunction and     damages (including treble damages for willful infringement).     Following a trial in 2003, the jury returned a verdict finding     that we had willfully infringed the patents relating to multiple     database searching and electronic consignment systems, and the     court entered judgment for MercExchange in the amount of     approximately $30 million, plus pre-judgment interest and     post-judgment interest. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the     Federal Circuit later reduced the award to $25.5 million.     In May 2006, following appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals     for the Federal Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court, the     Supreme Court remanded the case back to the district court for     further action. In parallel with the federal court proceedings,     at our request, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office agreed     to reexamine each of the patents in the suit, finding that     substantial questions existed regarding the validity of the     claims contained in them. In separate actions in 2005, the     Patent and Trademark Office initially rejected all of the claims     contained in the three patents in suit. In September 2007, the     Patent and Trademark Office tentatively approved some of the     claims and rejected others contained in the patent that     underlies the jury verdict, which relates to electronic     consignment systems. We requested that the district court stay     all proceedings in the case pending the final outcome of the     reexamination proceedings, and MercExchange has renewed its     request that the district court grant an injunction. In July     2007, the court denied MercExchanges request for an     injunction and ruled that the proceedings related to one of the     patents will be stayed and another of the patents will not be     stayed pending action by the Patent and Trademark Office.     MercExchange appealed the courts order denying the     injunction, and we filed a motion seeking that the court find     the non-stayed patent invalid. In December 2007, the district     court ruled that it could not consider eBays motions for     judgment as a matter of law and a new trial, because it viewed     the 2003 verdict for MercExchange (amounting to approximately     $30 million, plus interest) as final, subject to an     accounting. We have appealed that ruling.         With the appeals pending, in February 2008, the parties agreed     to settle to dismiss all claims and appeals stemming from the     lawsuit. As a part of the settlement, eBay will purchase all     three patents involved in the lawsuit, and related technology     and inventions, as well as a license to another search-related     patent portfolio that was not asserted in the lawsuit. These     assets will allow eBay to further enhance its operations and     trust and safety effort on its ecommerce sites. The reserves     recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly     reflect our liability as of December 31, 2007 in connection     with this settlement.         In June 2006, Net2Phone, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the     U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey     (No. 06-2469)     alleging that eBay Inc., Skype Technologies S.A., and Skype Inc.     infringed five patents owned by Net2Phone relating to     point-to-point Internet protocol. The suit seeks an injunction     against continuing infringement, unspecified damages, including     treble damages for willful infringement, and interest, costs,     and fees. We have filed an answer and counterclaims asserting     that the patents are invalid, unenforceable, and were not     infringed. The parties have completed fact discovery and claim     construction briefing. The pretrial conference is scheduled for     June 2008, and we expect a trial date to be scheduled for summer     2008. We believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to     defend ourselves vigorously.         In August 2006, Peer Communications Corporation filed a lawsuit     in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of     Texas     (No. 6-06CV-370)     alleging that eBay Inc., Skype Technologies S.A., and Skype Inc.     infringed two patents owned by Peer Communications relating to     uniform network access. The suit seeks an injunction against     continuing infringement, unspecified damages, and interest,     costs, and fees. The parties are in the process of conducting     discovery and claim construction briefing, and a trial date has     been scheduled for October 2008. We believe that we have     meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.         In September 2006, Mangosoft Intellectual Property, Inc. filed a     lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District     of Texas     (No. 2-06CV-390)     alleging that eBay Inc., Skype Technologies S.A., and Skype     Software S.a.r.l. infringed a patent owned by Mangosoft relating     to dynamic directory services. The suit seeks an injunction     against continuing infringement, unspecified damages, and     interest, costs, and fees. We have filed an answer and     counterclaims asserting that the patents are invalid,     unenforceable, and not infringed. We received an initial     scheduling order from the court that sets some discovery     deadlines, but not a trial date. The parties are in the process     of conducting discovery We believe that we have meritorious     defenses and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.        102    Table of Contents   eBay Inc.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)         In February 2007, our StubHub subsidiary was sued in the     U.S. District Court for the Central District of California     (No. CV-07-1328)     in a purported class action lawsuit alleging that StubHub     violated the Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act by     allegedly printing receipts containing more than the last five     digits of a credit card number or the expiration date of a     credit card by showing the same on an on-screen receipt.

In March 2007, a plaintiff filed a purported antitrust class     action lawsuit against eBay in the Western District of Texas     alleging that eBay and its wholly owned subsidiary PayPal     monopolized markets through various anticompetitive     acts and tying arrangements. The plaintiff alleges claims under     sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, as well as related     state law claims. The complaint seeks treble damages and an     injunction. In April 2007, the plaintiff re-filed the complaint     in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of     California     (No. 07-CV-01882-RS),     and dismissed the Texas action. In May 2007, the case was     consolidated with other similar lawsuits     (No. 07-CV-01882JF).     In June 2007, we filed a motion to dismiss the class action     complaint. We believe that we have meritorious defenses and     intend to defend ourselves vigorously.         In May 2007, Netcraft Corporation filed a lawsuit in the Western     District of Wisconsin     (No. 07-C-0254C)     alleging that eBay and PayPal infringed two of its patents     entitled Internet billing methods. The suit seeks an     injunction against continuing infringement, unspecified damages,     and interest, costs, and fees. In September 2007, we filed a     motion for summary judgment of noninfringement on both patents.     In December 2007, the U.S. District Court for the Western     District of Wisconsin entered a judgment granting our motion for     summary judgment of non-infringement on both of the patents that     Netcraft asserted against eBay and PayPal. Netcraft Corporation     has appealed the judgment.         In October 2007, PartsRiver filed a lawsuit in the Eastern     District of Texas     (No. 2-07CV-440-DF)     alleging that eBay, Microsoft, Yahoo!, Shopziila, PriceGrabber     and PriceRunner infringed its patent relating to search methods.     The suit seeks an injunction against continuing infringement,     unspecified damages, interest, costs, and fees. The defendants     have moved to transfer venue and the parties are conducting     discovery. Fact discovery cutoff is scheduled for July 2009, and     trial is tentatively scheduled for October 2009. We believe that     we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves     vigorously.         In October 2007, Flexiworld Technologies, Inc. filed a lawsuit     in Western District of Washington     (No. 3:07-CV-05565-BHS)     alleging that Skype infringed its patent titled Apparatus,     Methods, and Systems for Anonymous Communication. The suit     seeks an injunction against continuing infringement, unspecified     damages, and interest, costs, and fees. Flexiworld has not yet     served Skype. We believe that we have meritorious defenses and     intend to defend ourselves vigorously.         In December 2007, Klausner Technologies Inc. filed a lawsuit in     Eastern District of Texas     (No. 2-07CV-525)     alleging that eBay, Apple, AT&T Corp., AT&T Mobility,     Comcast Corp., CSC Holdings, GotVoice Inc. and Simulscribe     infringed Klausners patent titled Telephone     Answering Service Linking Displayed Data with Recorded Audio     Message (some of the defendants, but not eBay, are accused     of infringing a second Klausner patent). The suit seeks an     injunction against continuing infringement, unspecified damages,     and interest, costs, and fees. Klausner has served its complaint     but agreed to an extension of time to answer. We believe that we     have meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves     vigorously.         Other third parties have from time to time claimed, and others     may claim in the future, that we have infringed their     intellectual property rights. We are subject to additional     patent disputes, and expect that we will increasingly be subject     to patent infringement claims as our services expand in scope     and complexity. In particular, we expect that we may face     additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects     of our Marketplaces, Payments and Communications businesses. We     have in the past been forced to litigate such claims. We may     also become more vulnerable to third-party claims as laws such     as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Lanham Act and the     Communications Decency Act are interpreted by the courts, and as     we become subject to laws in jurisdictions where        103    Table of Contents   eBay Inc.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)         the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of     online intermediaries like ourselves are either unclear or less     favorable. We believe that additional lawsuits alleging that we     have violated copyright or trademark laws will be filed against     us, especially in Europe. Intellectual property claims, whether     meritorious or not, are time consuming and costly to resolve,     could require expensive changes in our methods of doing     business, or could require us to enter into costly royalty or     licensing agreements.         From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or     regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of     business. The number and significance of these disputes and     inquiries are increasing as our business expands and our company     grows larger. Any claims or regulatory actions against us,     whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in     costly litigation, require significant amounts of management     time, and result in the diversion of significant operational     resources.         As part of the earn out settlement agreement with the former     shareholders of Skype who had elected the earn out alternative     at the time of the acquisition (See Note 3      Business Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible     Assets in these consolidated financial statements for     further details), we agreed that if, on or prior to     March 31, 2008, eBay sells or transfers to an unaffiliated     third party securities representing greater than 50% of the     outstanding voting power of, or economic interest in, Skype or     all or substantially all of the assets of Skype and its     subsidiaries, taken as a whole, we would pay up to an additional     138.4 million, or approximately $195.2 million,     in the aggregate, to these former shareholders of Skype.     Indemnification     Provisions         In the ordinary course of business, we have included limited     indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with     parties with whom we have commercial relations, including our     standard marketing, promotions and     application-programming-interface license agreements. Under     these contracts, we generally indemnify, hold harmless, and     agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or     incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by a     third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos     and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are     applicable to our performance under the subject agreement. In a     limited number of agreements, we have provided an indemnity for     other types of third-party claims, which are indemnities mainly     related to various intellectual property rights. In our PayPal     business, we have provided an indemnity to our payment     processors in the event of certain third-party claims or card     association fines against the processor arising out of conduct     by PayPal or PayPals customers. It is not possible to     determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification     provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification     claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each     particular provision. To date, no significant costs have been     incurred, either individually or collectively, in connection     with our indemnification provisions.           Note 9         Related     Party Transactions:           We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our     directors, executive officers and certain other officers. These     agreements require us to indemnify such individuals, to the     fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain     liabilities to which they may become subject as a result of     their affiliation with us.         All contracts with related parties are at rates and terms that     we believe are comparable with those entered into with     independent third parties. There were no material related party     transactions in 2005, 2006 and 2007. As of December 31,     2007, there were no significant amounts payable or amounts     receivable from related parties.           Note 10         Preferred     Stock:           We are authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware     law: to issue Preferred Stock in one or more series; to     establish the number of shares included within each series; to     fix the rights, preferences and privileges of the shares of each     wholly unissued series and any related qualifications,     limitations or restrictions; and to increase or decrease the     number of shares of any series (but not below the number of     shares of a series then outstanding) without        104    Table of Contents   eBay Inc.

At     December 31, 2006 and 2007, there were 10 million     shares of $0.001 par value Preferred Stock authorized for     issuance, and no shares issued or outstanding.           Note 11         Common     Stock:           Our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, authorizes us to     issue 3,580 million shares of common stock. A portion of     the shares outstanding are subject to repurchase or forfeiture     over a four-year period from the earlier of the issuance date or     employee hire date, as applicable. At December 31, 2006 and     2007 there were 551,676 and 431,202 shares subject to     repurchase rights or forfeiture, respectively.         At December 31, 2007, we had reserved 210.9 million     shares of common stock available for future issuance under our     stock option plans, including 126.7 million shares related     to outstanding stock options and restricted stock units and     84.2 million shares available for future grant. In     addition, as of December 31, 2007, we had reserved     approximately 4.0 million shares of common stock available     for future issuance under our deferred stock unit plan, and     approximately 5.2 million shares of common stock available     for future issuance under our employee stock purchase plan.     Treasury     Stock         In June 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a stock     repurchase program for $2.0 billion of our common stock,     excluding broker commissions. In January 2007, our Board     authorized an expansion of the stock repurchase program to     provide for the repurchase of up to an additional     $2.0 billion of our common stock by January 2009. In     January 2008, our Board approved an additional stock repurchase     program, for further details see     Note 14  Subsequent Events. The     stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase program     during 2007 is summarized as follows (in thousands, except     per-share amounts):                                                                                  Average            Value of            Remaining                  Shares            Price per            Shares            Amount                  Repurchased           Share           Repurchased           Authorized                   Balance at January 1, 2007                54,526               $       30.54               $       1,665,450               $       334,550              Additional authorization in January 2007                                                                         2,000,000              Repurchase of common stock                44,558               $       33.42                   1,489,232                   (1,489,232       )                                                                                Balance at December 31, 2007                99,084               $       31.84               $       3,154,682               $       845,318                                                                                       These repurchased shares are recorded as treasury stock and are     accounted for under the cost method. No repurchased shares have     been retired.         During the year ended December 31, 2007, we entered into     structured equity hedging transactions. According to the terms     of the transactions, on the maturity date, if the market price     of our common stock exceeded a pre-determined price, we had the     option to settle the transaction in cash or shares of our common     stock. If the market price of our common stock was below that     pre-determined price, we were required to settle the     transactions in shares of our common stock. The structured     equity transaction activity during 2007 is summarized as follows     (in million, except per-share amounts):                                                                                              Settlement        Transaction        Cash Settlement        Cash Premium        Shares of Stock        Effective Price              Date       Amount       Amount       Received       Repurchased       per Share               Q107                3/30/07               $       99.6               $       102.3               $       2.7                                                    Q207                6/29/07               $       93.7                                                         3.0               $       31.40              Q307                9/28/07               $       98.2               $       103.1               $       5.0                                                    Q407                12/21/07               $       47.7                                                         1.4               $       33.42              Q407                12/28/07               $       47.6                                                         1.4               $       33.33                105    Table of Contents   eBay Inc.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)         Our stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at     any time without prior notice. Stock repurchases under these     programs may be made through a variety of open market and     privately negotiated transactions, including structured stock     repurchase transactions or other derivative transactions, at     times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and     will be funded from the companys working capital or other     financing alternatives. The timing and actual number of shares     repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including     corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market     conditions. The programs are intended to comply with the volume,     timing and other limitations set forth in     Rule 10b-18     under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.         During 2007, we entered into a $200 million volume weighted     average price share repurchase agreement. As a result of this     agreement, we repurchased approximately 5.8 million shares     of our common stock at an effective price per share of $34.24.         In addition to the above mentioned stock repurchases, shares of     stock were returned to us as part of certain agreements that we     entered into with certain of Skypes former shareholders.     We did not pay any monetary consideration for the return of     these shares. We have also repurchased shares of stock from     employees.           Note 12         Benefit     Plans:       Equity     Incentive Plans         We have equity incentive plans for directors, officers and     employees that consist of stock options, restricted stock units,     nonvested shares and performance based restricted stock units.     At December 31, 2007, 614.8 million shares were     authorized under our equity incentive plans and     84.2 million shares were available for future grant.         All stock options granted under these plans generally vest 25%     one year from the date of grant (or 12.5% six months from the     date of grant for grants to existing employees) and the     remainder vest at a rate of 2.08% per month thereafter, and     generally expire seven to 10 years from the date of grant.     The cost of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes     option pricing model on the date of grant.         Restricted stock units and nonvested shares are granted to     eligible employees under our equity incentive plans. In general,     restricted stock units and nonvested shares vest over one to     five years, are subject to the employees continuing     service to the company and do not have an expiration date. The     cost of restricted stock units and nonvested shares is     determined using the fair value of our common stock on the date     of grant.         In 2007, certain executives were eligible for performance based     restricted stock units. The number of restricted stock units     ultimately received depends on our business performance against     specified performance targets set by the Compensation Committee.     If the performance criteria are satisfied, the performance based     restricted stock units will be granted and one-half of the grant     will vest in March following the end of the performance period     and the remaining half will vest one year later.     Employee     Stock Purchase Plan         We have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible     employees. Under the plan, shares of our common stock may be     purchased over an offering period with a maximum duration of two     years at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first     day of the applicable offering period or on the last day of the     six-month purchase period. Employees may purchase shares having     a value not exceeding 10% of their gross compensation during an     offering period. During the years ended December 31, 2005,     2006, and 2007, employees purchased approximately     1.4 million, 1.6 million, and 2.0 million shares     at average prices of $25.55, $27.32 and $26.84 per share,     respectively. At December 31, 2007, approximately     5.2 million shares of common stock were reserved for future     issuance. Our employee stock purchase plan contains an     evergreen provision that automatically increases, on     each January 1, the number of shares reserved for issuance     under the employee stock purchase plan by the number of shares     purchased under this plan in the preceding calendar year.        106    Table of Contents   eBay Inc.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)     Employee     Savings Plans         We have a savings plan, which qualifies under     Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participating     employees may contribute up to 25% of their annual salary, but     not more than statutory limits. In 2005 and 2006, we contributed     one dollar for each dollar a participant contributed, with a     maximum contribution of $1,500 per employee. In 2007, we     contributed one dollar for each dollar a participant     contributed, with a maximum contribution of $2,000 per employee.     Our     non-U.S. employees     are covered by various other savings plans. Our expenses for     these plans were $8.6 million in 2005, $14.9 million     in 2006 and $20.4 million in 2007.     Deferred     Stock Unit Plan         We have a deferred stock unit plan under which deferred stock     units have to date, been granted non-employee directors elected     to our Board of Directors after December 31, 2002. Under     this plan, each new director receives a one-time grant of     deferred stock units equal to the result of dividing $150,000 by     the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant.     Each deferred stock unit constitutes an unfunded and unsecured     promise by us to deliver one share of our common stock (or the     equivalent value thereof in cash or property at our election).     Each deferred stock unit award granted to a new non-employee     director upon election to the Board vests 25% one year from the     date of grant, and at a rate of 2.08% per month thereafter. If     the services of the director are terminated at any time, all     rights to the unvested deferred stock units shall also     terminate. In addition, directors may elect to receive, in lieu     of annual retainer and committee chair fees and at the time     these fees would otherwise be payable (i.e., on a quarterly     basis in arrears for services provided), fully vested deferred     stock units with an initial value equal to the amount based on     the fair market value of common stock at the date of grant.     Deferred stock units are payable following the termination of a     directors tenure as a director. All eBay officers,     directors and employees are eligible to receive awards under the     plan, although, to date, awards have been made only to new     non-employee directors. As of December 31, 2007,     47,481 units have been awarded under this plan.     Valuation     Assumptions         We calculated the fair value of each option award on the date of     grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The     following weighted-average assumptions were used for each     respective period:                                        Year Ended December 31,             2005       2006       2007               Risk-free interest rates            3.8%           4.7%           4.5%          Expected life            3 years           3 years           3.5 years          Dividend yield            0%           0%           0%          Expected volatility            36%           36%           37%             Our computation of expected volatility for 2006 and 2007 was     based on a combination of historical and market-based implied     volatility from traded options on our stock. Prior to 2006, our     computation of expected volatility was based on historical     volatility. Our computation of expected life was determined     based on historical experience of similar awards, giving     consideration to the contractual terms of the stock-based     awards, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee     behavior. The interest rate for periods within the contractual     life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve     in effect at the time of grant.        107    Table of Contents   eBay Inc.

As of December 31, 2007, there was     approximately $327.4 million of total unrecognized     compensation cost related to stock options granted under our     equity incentive plans.

There were no awards vesting in 2005.     As of December 31, 2007, there was approximately     $5.9 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to     nonvested shares granted under our equity incentive plans. That     cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period     of two years.     Non-stockholder     approved stock option grants         Prior to our initial public offering in 1998, our Board of     Directors approved three stock option grants outside of formally     approved stockholder plans to two independent directors upon     their joining our Board of Directors and to an executive officer     upon his hiring. All of such option grants vested 25% one year     from the date of grant, and the remainder vested at a rate of     2.08% per month thereafter and expire 10 years from the     date of grant. The options granted to the independent directors     were immediately exercisable, subject to repurchase rights held     by us, which lapsed over the vesting period. The terms and     conditions of such grants are otherwise identical to     nonqualified option grants made under the stock option plan in     effect at that time. At the time of such grants, members of our     Board of Directors (and their affiliates) beneficially owned in     excess of 90% of our then outstanding voting interests. We have     previously disclosed such option grants in our Prospectus filed     with the Securities and Exchange Commission on     September 25, 1998 in connection with our initial public     offering under the headings Management      Director Compensation and Management      Compensation Arrangements. Prior to 2004, one director and     the executive officer had exercised all available options under     their respective grants. At December 31, 2007, one grant     remained outstanding to one independent director, with     153,637 shares to be issued upon exercise of the     outstanding options at an average exercise price of $0.39.

The utilization of a portion     of the NOLs is subject to an annual limitation under     Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code due to a change of     ownership. However, we do not believe such annual limitation     will impact our realization of the NOLs. If not utilized, the     federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in     2019, the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to     expire in 2009, and the foreign net operating loss carryforwards     will begin to expire in 2009. As of December 31, 2007, our     state tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were     approximately $7.9 million. If not utilized, the state tax     credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2015.         We have not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign     withholding taxes on $3.8 billion of     non-U.S. subsidiaries     undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2007, because     such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the     operations and potential acquisitions of our International     operations. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of     dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to U.S. income     taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits). It is     not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might     be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed.         On January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of     FIN 48. The adoption of FIN 48 resulted in a $145,000     adjustment to beginning retained earnings.         The following table reflects changes in the unrecognized tax     benefits since January 1, 2007:                                  (in thousands)                   Gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 1,     2007            $       385,700              Gross amounts over increases in unrecognized tax benefits for     tax positions taken during 2007                108,553                                    Gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits as of     December 31, 2007            $       494,253                                      112    Table of Contents   eBay Inc.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)         The total liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, and the     increase in these liabilities in 2007 relates primarily to the     allocations of revenue and costs among our global operations.     Our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as     deferred and other tax liabilities, net in our consolidated     balance sheet. If recognized, the portion of liabilities for     unrecognized tax benefits that would decrease our provision for     income taxes and increase our net income is $328.8 million.     The impact on net income reflects the liabilities for     unrecognized tax benefits net of certain deferred tax assets and     the federal tax benefit of state income tax items.         Over the next twelve months, our existing tax positions will     continue to generate an increase in liabilities for unrecognized     tax benefits. We recognize interest     and/or     penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax     expense. The amount of interest and penalties net of tax     benefits, accrued as of January 1, 2007 and     December 31, 2007 was approximately $7.7 million and     $16.3 million, respectively.         We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various states     and foreign jurisdictions. We are under examination by certain     tax authorities for the 2003 tax year. The material     jurisdictions that are subject to potential examination by tax     authorities for tax years after 2002 primarily include the U.S.,     California, France, Germany, Switzerland, and Singapore.           Note 14         Subsequent     Events:           In January 2008, our Board authorized another stock repurchase     program to provide for the repurchase of up to an additional     $2.0 billion of our common stock with no expiration from     the date of authorization. See discussion of our stock     repurchase programs at     Note 11  Common Stock.         On January 30, 2008, we completed the acquisition of all of     the equity securities of Fraud Sciences Ltd., a company with     expertise in online risk tools, in a cash transaction with an     aggregate transaction value of approximately $169 million.
