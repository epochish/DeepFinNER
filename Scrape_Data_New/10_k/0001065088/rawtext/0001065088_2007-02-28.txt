ITEM 1:  BUSINESS      Overview         eBay Inc. was formed as a sole proprietorship in September 1995     and was incorporated in California in May 1996. In April 1998,     we reincorporated in Delaware and in September 1998 we completed     the initial public offering of our common stock. Our principal     executive offices are located at 2145 Hamilton Avenue,     San Jose, California 95125, and our telephone number is     (408) 376-7400.     When we refer to we, our or     eBay in this Annual Report on     Form 10-K,     we mean the current Delaware corporation (eBay Inc.) and its     California predecessor, as well as all of our consolidated     subsidiaries. When we refer to eBay.com we mean the     online marketplace located at www.ebay.com and its     localized counterparts. When we refer to PayPal we     mean the online payments platform located at     www.paypal.com.  When we refer to     Skype we mean the Voice over Internet Protocol, or     VoIP, offerings provided by our subsidiary Skype Technologies     S.A.         Our purpose is to pioneer new communities around the world built     on commerce, sustained by trust and inspired by opportunity. To     achieve our purpose, we operate three primary business segments:     Marketplaces, Payments and Communications. We provide online     marketplaces for the sale of goods and services, online payments     services and online communication offerings to a diverse     community of individuals and businesses. Our Marketplaces     segment enables online commerce through a variety of platforms,     including the traditional eBay.com platform and our other online     platforms, such as Shopping.com, classifieds websites and     Rent.com. The wide array of websites that comprise our     Marketplaces segment bring together millions of buyers and     sellers every day on a local, national and international basis.     Our Payments segment, which consists of PayPal, enables     individuals and businesses to securely, easily and quickly send     and receive payments online. Our Communications segment, which     consists of Skype, enables VoIP calls between Skype users, and     also provides Skype users low-cost connectivity to traditional     fixed-line and mobile telephones.     Marketplaces         Our Marketplaces segment is comprised of online commerce     platforms that enable a global community of buyers and sellers     to interact and trade with one another. Our goal is to create,     maintain, and expand the functionality, safety,     ease-of-use     and reliability of our online commerce platforms while, at the     same time, supporting the growth and success of our community of     users. On any given day, there are more than a hundred million     items available through auction-style and fixed-price trading.     Marketplaces     Value Proposition         We seek to attract buyers and sellers to our community by     offering:                    Buyers         Sellers             Selection              Access to broad markets            Value              Cost effective     marketing and distribution            Convenience              Ability to maximize     selling prices            Entertainment              Opportunity to     increase sales                 1    Table of Contents       We believe our Marketplaces segment websites make inefficient     markets more efficient because:                         Our global community of users can easily and inexpensively     communicate, exchange information and complete transactions;                    Our Marketplaces include more than a hundred million items,     creating a wide variety and selection of goods;                    We bring buyers and sellers together for lower fees than     traditional intermediaries; and                    Our Marketplaces provide for efficient information exchange.           In particular, large markets with broad buyer and seller bases,     wide product ranges, and moderate shipping costs have been     successful on our Marketplaces platforms. Generally speaking,     our marketplaces are most effective, relative to available     alternatives, at addressing markets of new and scarce goods,     end-of-life     products and used and vintage items.     Global     Community of Buyers and Sellers         We have aggregated a significant number of buyers, sellers, and     items listed for sale, which, in turn, has resulted in a vibrant     online commerce environment. Our sellers generally enjoy high     conversion rates and our buyers enjoy an extensive selection of     broadly-priced goods and services. Key components of our     community philosophy are maintaining honest and open     marketplaces and treating individual users with respect. We seek     to maintain the satisfaction and loyalty of our buyers and     sellers by offering a variety of community and support features,     such as announcement and bulletin boards, customer support     boards and personal pages, as well as other topical or     category-specific information exchanges. By applying a     consistent set of policies to our community, we seek to create a     level playing field that lets individuals and businesses of all     types and sizes access broad markets and compete equally.         Our success has resulted largely from the growth of our     community of confirmed registered users, which has increased in     size from approximately two million at the end of 1998 to     approximately 222 million as of  December 31, 2006. As     of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 82 million     active users on the eBay.com platforms, compared to     approximately 72 million at the end of 2005. We define an     active user as any user who bid on, bought, or listed an item     during the most recent     12-month     period.     Marketplaces     Platforms         Our Marketplaces platforms are fully automated, topically     arranged, and     easy-to-use     online services that seek to provide availability 24 hours     a day, seven days a week, enabling sellers to list items for     sale and buyers to bid for and purchase items of interest, and     all users to browse through listed items from any place in the     world at any time. The platforms include software tools and     services, available either for no charge or for a fee, that     allow buyers and sellers to trade with one another more easily     and efficiently. The Marketplaces platforms consist of our core     online commerce platform, eBay.com, and adjacent platforms     consisting of Shopping.com, our classifieds websites and     Rent.com. Marketplaces earns revenue from listing, feature and     final value fees paid by sellers, lead referral fees and     advertising fees.     eBay.com     Platform         Our Marketplaces core platform, eBay.com, includes our     traditional auction format, fixed price format and eBay Stores.     We offer the core platform on localized sites in 24 countries.     Auction     Listing Format         At the core of our Marketplaces platform are our traditional     auction format listings, in which a seller will select a minimum     price for opening bids, with the option to set a reserve price     for the item, which is the minimum price at which the seller is     willing to sell the item. A seller with appropriate feedback     ratings can also sell in a Multiple     Item Auction format, which allows a seller to sell     multiple identical items to the highest bidders.        2    Table of Contents     Fixed     Price Listing Format         Our fixed price format allows for a faster selling and buying     experience as opposed to waiting for the auction period to     expire. Sellers with appropriate feedback ratings can choose to     use the Buy-It-Now feature at the time of the listing, which     allows sellers to name a price at which they would be willing to     sell the item to any buyer. Our Half.com subsidiary also     provides a fixed price, person-to person     e-commerce     website that allows people to buy and sell previously owned     books, movies, music and games at discounted prices. In 2006,     all fixed priced trading accounted for approximately 36% of     eBays gross merchandise volume, or GMV, which is the total     value of all successfully closed listings on eBay.coms     trading platforms.     eBay     Stores         eBay Stores enables sellers to show all of their listings and to     describe their respective businesses through customized pages.     eBay Stores provide useful tools for sellers to build, manage,     promote, and track their business. Store Inventory     Format listings allow sellers to list items at a lower     insertion fee and higher final value fee than regular auction     and fixed price listings, for a minimum 30-day listing duration.     As of December 31, 2006, there were nearly 600,000 online     storefronts established by users in locations around the world.     Other     Marketplaces Platforms     Shopping.com         Shopping.com is a comparison shopping website that allows     shoppers to compare millions of products from thousands of     stores and helps merchants increase their sales. Shopping.com     offers one of the largest product catalogs on the     Internet  searchable by thousands of     attributes  along with a consumer review service     through Epinions.com, which helps users make informed buying     decisions.     Classifieds     Websites         Our classifieds websites are available in hundreds of cities and     regions around the world and are designed to help people meet,     share ideas and trade on a local level. Our classifieds websites     include Kijiji, Gumtree.com, LoQUo.com, Intoko, Marktplaats.nl     and mobile.de. In addition, we have a minority equity investment     in craigslist, Inc., which operates the craigslist     classifieds websites around the world.     Rent.com         Rent.com is a leading U.S. Internet listing website in the     apartment and rental housing industry. The website is designed     as a more effective means of bringing apartments seekers and     apartment managers together.     Key     Services for Buyers and Sellers         We have developed a number of features in our eBay.com platform     in the areas of Trust and Safety, Customer Support and     Value-Added Tools and Services, as well as a Loyalty Program.     These features are designed to make users more comfortable     dealing with unknown trading partners and completing commerce     transactions on the Internet.     Trust and     Safety     Feedback Forum:  Our Feedback Forum encourages     each user to provide comments on other users with whom he or she     trades and lets every user view other users profiles,     which include feedback ratings and comments by other users.     Every registered user has a feedback profile that may contain     compliments, criticisms and other comments by users who have     conducted business with that person. The Feedback Forum requires     feedback to be related to specific transactions and provides an     easy tool for users to match specific transactions with the user     names of their trading partners. This information is recorded in     a profile that includes a feedback rating for the person with     feedback sorted according to whether it was given over the past     month, six months, or twelve months. Users who develop positive     reputations have color-coded star symbols displayed next to     their user names to indicate the number of positive feedback     ratings they have received. The Feedback Forum has several     automated features        3    Table of Contents       designed to detect and prevent some forms of abuse, such as a     user leaving positive feedback about himself or herself through     multiple accounts.     SafeHarbor Program:  We also offer the     SafeHarbor program, which provides guidelines for trading,     provides information to resolve user disputes and responds to     reports of misuse of the eBay service. eBays SafeHarbor     staff investigates users complaints of possible misuse of     the eBay service and takes appropriate action, including issuing     warnings to users, ending and removing listings, or suspending     users from bidding on or listing items for sale. The complaints     the SafeHarbor staff investigates include various forms of bid     manipulation, malicious posting of negative feedback and posting     of illegal items for sale.     Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) Program:  The     Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) Program lets intellectual property     rights owners request the removal of listings that offer items     or contain materials that infringe on their rights. This helps     protect community members from purchasing items that may be     counterfeit or otherwise unauthorized.     Customer     Support         We devote resources to providing personalized, accurate and     timely support services to our community of users. Buyers and     sellers can contact us through a variety of means, including     email, online text chat and, in certain circumstances,     telephone. We are focusing our resources on increasing our     accessibility and capacity, expanding our category-specific     support, extending our online self-help features, and improving     our systems and processes to allow us to provide the most     efficient and effective support possible.     Value-Added     Tools and Services         eBay users have access to a variety of pre-trade and     post-trade tools and services to enhance their user     experience and to make trading faster, easier and safer for     them. Pre-trade tools and services are intended to     simplify the listing process. Post-trade tools and     services are designed to make transactions easier and more     convenient to complete.         These tools and services include: Turbo Lister, eBay     Blackthorne, ProStores, Selling Manager and Selling Manager Pro,     which help automate the selling process; Picture Services, which     enables sellers to include pictures in their listings; the     Shipping Calculator, which makes it easier for buyers and     sellers to calculate shipping costs; Shipping Labels, which     allows sellers to print certain postage and UPS labels; Shipment     Tracking, which enables sellers to track their shipped packages;     the eBay Toolbar, which helps eBay users stay connected with     eBay wherever they are on the Internet; eBay Sales Reports and     eBay Sales Reports Plus, which provide sales and fee information     to sellers; eBay Market Research, which enables sellers to     analyze sales in categories across the site; Reviews and Guides,     which assists shoppers in making more informed choices; and     PayPal, which facilitates the online exchange of funds. We     currently provide these services directly or through contractual     arrangements with third parties.     Loyalty     Program     PowerSeller program:  PowerSellers are     eBays top sellers who have sustained a consistent high     volume of monthly sales and who have a high level of positive     feedback. Members of the PowerSeller program get a range of     special benefits, including prioritized customer support,     promotional offers, eBay promotional merchandise, advanced     selling education, opportunities to participate in research, and     other special rewards. The PowerSeller program is free of charge     and a special PowerSeller icon is located next to the     sellers user name if the seller qualifies for the program.     Marketplaces     Growth Strategy         We intend to achieve our mission of creating the worlds     leading     e-commerce     franchise by building upon our core Marketplaces business and     building our adjacent businesses.         We will continue to grow our core Marketplaces business by     enhancing our products, improving Trust and Safety and extending     our product offerings into new formats, categories and     geographies. Our product        4    Table of Contents       enhancements are focused on improving the user experience to     increase buyer satisfaction and activity levels which we believe     will improve our conversion rates and, in turn, lead to higher     GMV. For example, in 2006, we introduced eBay Express, a     specialty destination site for buyers looking to purchase new     merchandise at fixed prices. eBay Express targets existing     registered users in an effort to increase their purchasing     activity. Improvements to our Trust and Safety policies are     designed to ensure that buyers have a safe trading experience to     drive repeat business.         Another element of our growth strategy is to build adjacent     businesses. These adjacencies, which offer opportunities for     growth beyond our core GMV businesses, include new formats and     new monetization models. We will continue to grow our     alternative format businesses  Shopping.com and our     classifieds websites. In addition, we intend to expand our     monetization models through advertising partnerships and the     development of a     pay-per-call     platform.     Payments         Our global payments platform, PayPal, enables any individual or     business with an email address to securely, easily and quickly     send and receive payments online. We believe our global payments     platform makes online commerce more efficient compared to     traditional payment methods such as checks, money orders, and     credit cards via merchant accounts. These traditional payment     methods present various obstacles to the online commerce     experience, including lengthy processing time, inconvenience,     and high costs. PayPal delivers a product well-suited for all     online merchants and individuals by allowing them to send and     receive online payments securely, conveniently and     cost-effectively. The PayPal network builds on the existing     financial infrastructure of bank accounts and credit cards to     create a global, real-time payment solution.     PayPal     Value Proposition         Providing more efficient and effective payment methods is     essential to creating a faster, easier and safer online commerce     experience. Traditional payment methods such as checks, money     orders and credit cards processed through merchant accounts, all     present various obstacles to the online commerce experience,     including lengthy processing time, inconvenience and high costs.     Our PayPal online payments solution allows its account holders,     as well as users of other online businesses, to pay for their     transactions securely, easily and quickly.     Buyer     Value Proposition         PayPal enables buyers to pay merchants without sharing their     sensitive financial information with them. To make payments,     buyers need to disclose only their email addresses to     recipients. Many buyers wary of disclosing financial information     online find this high level of personal privacy attractive.     Buyers also benefit from PayPals buyer protection program.     Seller     Value Proposition         PayPal offers online merchants an     all-in-one     payment processing solution that is less expensive than most     merchant accounts, offers industry-leading fraud prevention, and     enables merchants to conduct business with approximately     133 million PayPal customer accounts in over 100 markets.     PayPal also offers merchants the ability to maintain a direct     relationship with their customers.         A merchant can open a PayPal account and begin accepting credit     card payments within a few minutes. Merchants are approved     instantly for a PayPal account, and do not need to provide a     personal guaranty, acquire any specialized hardware, prepare an     application, contact a payment gateway or encrypt customer data.     Furthermore, PayPal charges lower transaction fees than most     merchant accounts, and charges no setup fees and no recurring     monthly fees.         The account-based nature of PayPals network helps us to     detect and prevent fraud when funds enter the PayPal network, as     funds move within the network, and when they leave. Sellers can     also reduce the risk of transaction losses due to unauthorized     credit card use and fraudulent chargebacks, if they comply with     PayPals Seller Protection Policy.        5    Table of Contents     PayPal     Overview     Joining     the Network         PayPal offers three types of accounts: Personal, Business, and     Premier. A new account holder typically opens an account to send     money for an eBay purchase or a purchase on another website, a     payment for services rendered, or for a payment to an individual     in lieu of cash. Allowing new account holders to join the     network when they make or receive payments encourages     PayPals natural, user-driven growth. PayPals account     sign-up     process asks each new account holder to provide PayPal his or     her name, street address, phone number, and email address. The     account holders email address serves as the unique account     identifier. PayPal also offers customers who sell on their own     websites the ability to accept credit card payments from buyers     without requiring the buyer to open a PayPal account.         Buyers make payments at the PayPal website, at an item listing     on eBay.com or another online business or platform where the     seller has integrated PayPals Instant Purchase Feature, or     at the sites of merchants that have integrated PayPals     Website Payments feature. To make a payment at PayPals     website, a buyer logs in to his or her account and enters the     recipients email address and the amount of the payment. To     make a payment through Instant Purchase or Website Payments, a     buyer selects an item for purchase, confirms the payment     information and enters his or her email address and password to     authorize the payment. PayPal debits the money from the     buyers PayPal balance, credit card, or bank account and     credits it to the recipients PayPal balance. In the case     of an eCheck payment, the transaction is held until the funds     have cleared the senders bank, which typically takes three     to five business days. In turn, the recipient can make payments     to others or withdraw his or her funds at any time via check (in     the U.S.), electronic funds transfer, or via a PayPal-branded     debit card (which is only available to U.S. users).         PayPal earns revenues in five ways. First, PayPal earns     transaction fees when a Business or Premier account receives a     payment. Second, PayPal earns a foreign exchange fee when an     account holder converts a balance from one currency to another.     Third, PayPal may earn fees when a user withdraws money to a     non-U.S. bank     account, depending on the amount of the withdrawal. Fourth,     PayPal earns a return on certain customer balances. Finally,     PayPal may earn ancillary revenues from a suite of financial     products, including the PayPal-branded debit card, the     PayPal-branded credit card and the PayPal Buyer Credit offering.         We incur funding costs on payments at varying levels based on     the source of the payment, with costs associated with credit     card and debit card funded payments being significantly higher     than bank account or balance-funded payments. U.S. account     holders who choose to maintain PayPal balances in     U.S. dollars have the ability to sweep balances into the     PayPal Money Market Fund. This Money Market Fund, which is     invested in a portfolio managed by Barclays Global     Fund Advisors, bore a current compound annual yield of     5.02% as of January 3, 2007.     Verification     of Account Holders         To fund payments from their bank accounts in the United States,     account holders must first become verified by PayPal. The     primary method for verification is our Random Deposit technique.     Under this technique, PayPal makes two deposits ranging from 1     to 99 cents to the account holders bank account. To verify     ownership of the account, the account holder then enters the two     amounts as a four-digit code at the PayPal website. In addition     to allowing funding through bank accounts, verification also     removes some spending limits on account holders accounts     and gives them reputational advantages when transacting with     other members of the PayPal community.     Withdrawing     Money         Each account holder in the U.S. and, as of December 31,     2006, in 34 other markets, may withdraw money from his or her     PayPal account through an electronic fund transfer to his or her     bank account or, in the U.S., by a mailed check from PayPal.     Automated Clearing House, or ACH, withdrawals may take three to     five business days to arrive in the account holders bank     account, depending on the bank. However, everyone who can     receive funds can withdraw to a U.S. bank account. Mailed     checks may take one to two weeks to arrive, and PayPal charges     $1.50 per check. Qualifying PayPal business users in the     U.S. can receive a PayPal ATM/debit card, which provides     instant liquidity to their PayPal account balances. ATM/debit     cardholders can withdraw cash, for a $1.00 fee per        6    Table of Contents       transaction, from any ATM connected to the Cirrus or Maestro     networks and can make purchases at any merchant accepting     MasterCard.     PayPals     Trust and Safety Programs         We have developed a number of PayPal trust and safety programs,     including PayPals Seller Protection and Buyer Protection     Programs. These programs provide additional protection to     certain account holders who pay, or receive payment, for their     transactions through PayPal. PayPals Seller Protection     Program covers sellers for up to $5,000 per year on certain     reversed transactions. PayPals Buyer Protection Program     covers qualified purchases on eBay.com for up to $2,000 coverage     at no cost (with different terms for transactions denominated in     non-U.S. currencies).     In addition, our Fraud Investigation Team focuses on identifying     and preventing fraud before it occurs, detecting fraud in     process, mitigating loss if fraud does occur and delivering     information to law enforcement around the world to better combat     online fraud.     PayPal     Growth Strategy         We seek to extend our leading position and become the online     payment network of choice around the world. To establish PayPal     as the global payment standard in online payments, we intend to     focus on, among other things, increased adoption of PayPal on     Marketplaces, expansion of PayPals Merchant Services,     which are services for merchants who sell through their own     websites, and further development of online financial products.     Marketplaces         PayPals services are integrated into the checkout flow of     the eBay.com platform in our key markets, including the U.S.,     Germany, the U.K. and Canada. In 2006, eBay.com generated more     than $52 billion in GMV. PayPal, in turn, generated over     $24 billion of total payment volume from eBay.com     transactions.         We intend to increase PayPals penetration of GMV on the     eBay.com platform through product innovation, integrate PayPal     onto the other platforms within our Marketplaces segment and     expand PayPals global presence. We intend to strengthen     PayPals penetration into the payments area on the     Marketplaces platforms by continuing to integrate with eBay     listings and new formats, focus on buyer protection programs and     adding product features important to the Marketplaces community.     Our expansion into an increased number of international markets     and currencies makes cross-border transactions easier and more     efficient, benefiting both Marketplaces and PayPal.     Merchant     Services         We intend to continue to market our global payments solution to     spur our growth as a payment solution for sole proprietors and     small, medium, and large businesses. Our Merchant Services     business offers a differentiated product solution for each     merchant segment  sole proprietor, small and medium     businesses, and large merchants  while providing a     cost-effective and safe payment solution in all segments.         We intend to grow our global Merchant Services business by     enhancing our product offering, leveraging our multiple sales     channels to expand our network of merchants and developing our     global footprint.     Financial     Products         We will continue to identify transactions and markets not served     adequately by existing payment systems and seek to develop     product features that improve upon those legacy systems. In     addition, we will seek to expand the breadth of products and     services available to our account holders and have begun     offering financial products like the PayPal branded debit card,     PayPal branded credit card and the PayPal Buyer Credit Offering.     Furthermore, we are developing a mobile payments solution and     launched Go Mobile with PayPal during 2006 as a foundation for     our mobile platform.     Communications         We added the Communications segment upon our acquisition of     Skype in October 2005. Skype is a Luxembourg-based company that     was established in 2003.        7    Table of Contents     Skype     Value Proposition         Our vision is to give our users the ability to communicate     freely at home, at work and on the move. Skype offers a simple,     convenient and cost-effective way for people anywhere in the     world to call landlines and mobile phones over the Internet.     People around the world using Skype can make free voice and     video calls to anyone else on Skype, as well as send instant     messages, transfer files and participate in Skypecasts, which     are live, moderated conversations with up to 100 people.     Skype     Overview         Skype is one of the worlds fastest-growing Internet     communication products, providing free and unlimited voice,     video and instant messaging conversations between people using     the Skype software. Skype earns revenues from premium features     such as making and receiving calls to and from landline and     mobile phones, voicemail, call forwarding and personalization     including ringtones and avatars. Skype is available in     28 languages.     User     Base         As of December 31, 2006, Skype had approximately     171 million registered users and is used in almost every     country around the world. The Skype software is easy to download     and install, and enables people to make free voice and video     calls to any other person on Skype, as well as send instant     messages and transfer files.         In addition to free calls to other registered Skype users,     people can also take advantage of Skypes premium features,     including SkypeOut (calls from Skype to traditional landlines or     mobile phones), SkypeIn (a number which can be called from a     normal phone anywhere in the world) and Skype Voicemail (takes     calls when users are busy or offline).         In 2006, we launched several promotions globally as well as     locally, and they drove significant user growth in registered     users, especially in Asia. We intend to migrate users to higher     value premium offerings.     Ecosystem         Skype has a large and expanding ecosystem of hardware and     software products created by third parties that extend, enable     or improve the experience of using Skype. We are focused on     further developing this ecosystem of more than 50 hardware     partners and more than 150 Skype Certified devices to broaden     the appeal of Skype to a wider group of people who want to use     Skype away from the computer, no matter where they happen to be.     This is especially true for people who want to take advantage of     the mobile Skype experience, which has already been downloaded     more than five million times and is available on more than 120     different models of mobile devices.     Skype     Growth Strategy         To expand upon Skypes position as a leading, global     Internet communications company, we will continue to focus on     new user acquisition and conversion of users to premium     offerings, while further developing around two broad areas of     Skypes business: existing telephony products and new     e-commerce     opportunities. Part of our strategy to acquire new users is to     achieve a desktop presence. In order to do this, we have     partnered with certain computer manufacturers to include Skype     in their new computers.     Existing     Telephony Products         Our strategy for driving growth from existing telephony products     relies on new user acquisition, a better product and innovative     new features. In 2007, we launched a new global pricing     structure that gives users an     easy-to-understand all-in-one     Skype package. This packages offers a simple, convenient and     cost-effective way for consumers worldwide to call landlines and     mobile phones over the Internet.         To continue growing the number of people using Skype, and to     improve the Skype experience, we will work with our partners to     introduce new Skype Certified devices and accessories, many of     which eliminate the need for a computer to make Skype calls over     the Internet.        8    Table of Contents         In addition to working with our partners we will continue to     make Skype Certified products available directly to our users     through Skypes webstore as well as through other retail     channels.     New     E-Commerce     Opportunities         We plan on expanding Skypes presence within our existing     businesses because communication via     e-mail      the traditional way for buyers and sellers to     communicate  can be a source of friction in the     online shopping experience, primarily because of delays in     response time. Skype enables us to create new channels for     e-commerce     activity by reducing friction in the online shopping experience.     Communication via Skype allows buyers and sellers to benefit     from being able to communicate directly with each other in an     instantaneous and private environment.     Other     Items     Employees         As of December 31, 2006, eBay Inc. and its subsidiaries     employed approximately 13,200 people (including     approximately 600 temporary employees), approximately 7,900 of     whom were located in the U.S. (including approximately 300     temporary employees).     Competition         We encounter vigorous competition in our businesses from     numerous sources. Our users can find, buy, sell, and pay for     similar items through a variety of competing channels. These     include, but are not limited to, online and offline retailers,     distributors, liquidators, import and export companies,     auctioneers, catalog and mail-order companies, classifieds,     directories, search engines, products of search engines,     virtually all online and offline commerce participants     (consumer-to-consumer, business-to-consumer     and     business-to-business),     online and offline shopping channels and networks. As our     product offerings continue to broaden into new categories of     items and new commerce formats, we expect to face additional     competition from other online and offline channels for those new     offerings. We also compete on the basis of price, product     selection, and services. For our PayPal service, our users may     choose to pay through a variety of alternative means, including     other online payment services, offline payment methods such as     cash, check or money order, and traditional online or offline     credit card merchant accounts. For our Communications segment,     our users may choose to use their local telephone companies,     cable providers, and other VoIP providers. To compete     effectively, we may need to expend significant resources in     technology and marketing. These efforts may be expensive and     could reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on     our business, financial position, operating results, and cash     flows and reduce the trading price of our stock. We believe that     we will be able to maintain profitability by preserving and     expanding the abundance and diversity of our users online     community and enhancing our user experience, but we may not be     able to continue to manage our operating expenses to mitigate a     decline in consolidated net income. For more information     regarding these risks, see the information in     Item 1A: Risk Factors under the caption     Our industry is intensely competitive.     Seasonality         We have historically experienced our strongest quarter of     sequential growth in our fourth quarter. We expect transaction     activity patterns on our websites to increasingly mirror general     consumer buying patterns as our business continues to mature.     Our expectation is that Skypes business will experience     seasonally slower growth during holiday and vacation periods.     Technology     Marketplaces     and Payments         Our Marketplaces and Payments platforms utilize a combination of     proprietary technologies and services as well as technologies     and services provided by others, We have developed intuitive     user interfaces, customer tools and transaction processing,     database and network applications that enable our users to     reliably and securely complete transactions on our sites. Our     technology infrastructure simplifies the storage and processing     of large        9    Table of Contents       amounts of data, eases the deployment and operation of     large-scale global products and services and automates much of     the administration of large-scale clusters of computers. Our     infrastructure has been designed around industry-standard     architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or     catastrophic occurrences. We are continually improving our     technology to enhance the customer experience and to increase     efficiency, scalability and security. For information regarding     technology related risks, see the information in     Item 1A: Risk Factors under the caption     Our failure to manage growth could harm our business.     Communications         Skypes VoIP communications and other services are     delivered through a     peer-to-peer     network architecture whereby users joining the network provide     much of the technology resources that enable the Skype services.     To access Skypes services, users download Skype software     over the Internet. Skype utilizes a combination of proprietary     technologies and services as well as technologies and services     provided by others to design, develop and support its software     products. For more information regarding Skypes technology     risks, see the information in Item 1A: Risk     Factors under the caption Skype depends on key     technology that is licensed from third parties.     Intellectual     Property         We regard the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents,     domain names, trade dress and trade secrets as critical to our     success. We have entered into confidentiality and invention     assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and     nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct     business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our     proprietary information.         We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by     relying on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, trade     dress and trade secret laws and by using the domain name dispute     resolution system. As a result, we actively pursue the     registration of our trademarks, copyrights, patents and domain     names in the U.S. and other major countries. The expansion of     our business has required us to protect our trademarks, patents     and domain names in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a     process that is expensive, may require litigation, and may not     be successful in every location. We have registered or applied     to register for our eBay trademark in the U.S. and     over 50     non-U.S. jurisdictions     and have in place an active program to continue securing the     eBay, PayPal, and Skype     domain names in major     non-U.S. jurisdictions.     If we are unable to secure our trademarks or domain names, we     could be adversely affected in any jurisdiction in which our     trademarks or domain names we are not registered.         Third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may     claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual     property rights. We currently are involved in several such legal     proceedings. Please see the information in Item 3:     Legal Proceedings and in Item 1A: Risk     Factors under the captions We are subject to patent     litigation and We may be unable to protect or     enforce our own intellectual property rights adequately.     Segments     and Geographic Information         For an analysis of financial information about our segments as     well as our geographic areas, see Note 4      Segments to our consolidated financial statements included     elsewhere in this Annual Report on     Form 10-K.

ITEM 1A:  RISK     FACTORS      The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only     ones we face. Other events that we do not currently anticipate     or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results     of operations and financial condition.        10    Table of Contents     Our     operating results may fluctuate.         Our operating results have varied on a quarterly basis during     our operating history. Our operating results may fluctuate     significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which     are outside our control. Factors that may affect our operating     results include the following:                         our ability to retain an active user base, to attract new users,     and to encourage existing users to list items for sale, purchase     items through our websites, or use our payment service or     communication software and products;                    the volume, size, timing, and completion rate of transactions     using our websites or technology;                    the amount and timing of operating costs and capital     expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our     businesses, operations, and infrastructure;                    our ability to integrate, manage, and profitably expand and     further monetize the Skype business;                    our ability to successfully integrate and manage other recent     and prospective acquisitions;                    regulatory actions imposing obligations on our businesses or our     users;                    the actions of our competitors, including the introduction of     new sites, services, and products;                    consumer confidence in the safety and security of transactions     using our websites or technology and our ability to manage the     costs of our user protection programs;                    the costs and results of litigation that involves us;                    the cost and availability of online and traditional advertising,     and the success of our brand building and marketing campaigns;                    new laws or regulations, or interpretations of existing laws or     regulations, that harm our business models or restrict the     Internet, electronic commerce, online payments, or online     communications;                    our ability to comply with the requirements of entities whose     services are required for our operations, such as credit card     associations;                    our ability to develop product enhancements at a reasonable cost     and to develop programs and features in a timely manner;                    our ability to upgrade and develop our systems, infrastructure,     and customer service capabilities to accommodate growth and to     improve our websites at a reasonable cost while maintaining 24/7     operations;                    technical difficulties or service interruptions involving our     websites or services provided to us or our users by third     parties;                    our ability to increase the acceptance of PayPal by online     merchants outside of the eBay Marketplaces;                    our ability to expand PayPals product offerings outside of     the U.S. (including our ability to obtain any necessary     regulatory approvals);                    our ability to manage PayPals transaction loss and credit     card chargeback rates and payment funding mix;                    our ability to continue Skypes growth and to find     mechanisms to more effectively monetize it;                    our ability to attract new personnel in a timely and effective     manner and to retain key employees;                    the continued financial strength of our technology suppliers and     other parties with whom we have commercial relations;                    continued consumer acceptance of the Internet as a medium for     commerce and communication in the face of increasing publicity     about fraud, spoofing, viruses, and other dangers of the     Internet;          11    Table of Contents                         general economic conditions and those economic conditions     specific to the Internet and     e-commerce     industries; and                    geopolitical events such as war, threat of war, or terrorist     actions.           The increased variety of services offered on our websites makes     it difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our     revenues or earnings accurately. In view of the rapidly evolving     nature of our business and our limited operating history, we     believe that     period-to-period     comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and     you should not rely upon them as an indication of future     performance. We do not have backlog, and substantially all of     our net revenues each quarter come from transactions involving     sales or payments during that quarter. Due to the inherent     difficulty in forecasting revenues it is also difficult to     forecast income statement expenses as a percentage of net     revenues. Quarterly and annual income statement expenses as a     percentage of net revenues may be significantly different from     historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or     more future quarters may fall below the expectations of     securities analysts and investors. In that event, the trading     price of our common stock would almost certainly decline.     We may     not maintain our level of profitability or rates of     growth.         We believe that our continued profitability and growth will     depend in large part on our ability to do the following:                         attract new users, keep existing users active on our websites     and services, and increase the activity levels of our active     users;                    react to changes in consumer use of the Internet and develop new     services, as well as new sources of revenues from our existing     services;                    manage the costs of our business, including the costs associated     with maintaining and enhancing our websites, customer support,     transaction and chargeback rates, user protection programs, and     international and product expansion;                    maintain sufficient transaction volume to attract buyers and     sellers;                    cost effectively increase the awareness of our brands; and                    provide our customers with superior community, customer support,     and trading, communication, and payment experiences.           We invest heavily in marketing and promotion, customer support,     and further development of the operating infrastructure for our     core and recently acquired operations. Some of this investment     entails long-term contractual commitments. As a result, we may     be unable to adjust our spending rapidly enough to compensate     for any unexpected revenue shortfall, which may harm our     profitability. In addition, we are spending in advance of     anticipated growth, which may also harm our profitability.     Growth rates in our most established markets, such as Germany     and the U.S., have declined over time and may continue to do so     as the existing base of users and transactions becomes larger.     As our penetration in established markets grows, we will     increasingly need to rely on keeping existing users active and     increasing their activity level on our sites for growth in those     markets. In addition, our Marketplaces business is facing     increased competitive pressure, particularly in Asia. Because a     large percentage of PayPal transactions originate on the eBay     platform, declines in growth rates in major eBay Marketplace     markets also adversely affect PayPals growth rate. The     expected future growth of our PayPal, Skype, and Shopping.com     businesses may also cause downward pressure on our profit margin     because those businesses have lower gross margins than our eBay     trading platforms.     There     are many risks associated with our international     operations.         Our international expansion has been rapid and our international     business, especially in Germany, the U.K., and South Korea, has     also become critical to our revenues and profits. Net revenues     outside the United States accounted for approximately 46% and     48%, respectively, of our net revenues in 2005 and 2006.     Expansion into international markets requires management     attention and resources and requires us to localize our services     to        12    Table of Contents       conform to local cultures, standards, and policies. The     commercial, Internet, and transportation infrastructure in     lesser-developed countries may make it difficult for us to     replicate our business model. In many countries, we compete with     local companies that understand the local market better than we     do, and we may not benefit from     first-to-market     advantages. We may not be successful in expanding into     particular international markets or in generating revenues from     foreign operations. For example, in 2002 we withdrew our eBay     marketplace offering from the Japanese market, and in late 2006     we announced a change to our strategy in China by entering into     a joint venture with a local Chinese company. Even if we are     successful in developing new markets, we expect the costs of     operating new sites to exceed our net revenues for at least     12 months in most countries. As we continue to expand     internationally, including through the expansion of PayPal,     Skype, Shopping.com, and Kijiji, we are subject to risks of     doing business internationally, including the following:                         regulatory requirements, including regulation of Internet     services, communications, auctioneering, professional selling,     distance selling, banking, and money transmitting, that may     limit or prevent the offering of our services in some     jurisdictions, prevent enforceable agreements between sellers     and buyers, prohibit the listing of certain categories of goods,     require product changes, require special licensure, subject us     to special taxes, or limit the transfer of information between     eBay and our affiliates;                    legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the listings and     other content provided by our users, including uncertainty as a     result of legal systems that are less developed with respect to     the Internet, unique local laws, and lack of clear precedent or     applicable law;                    difficulties in integrating with local payment providers,     including banks, credit and debit card associations, and     electronic fund transfer systems or with the local     telecommunications infrastructure;                    differing levels of retail distribution, shipping,     communications, and Internet infrastructures;                    different employee/employer relationships and the existence of     workers councils and labor unions;                    difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;                    challenges associated with joint venture relationships,     including dependence on our joint venture partners;                    difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal     controls;                    longer payment cycles, different accounting practices, and     greater problems in collecting accounts receivable;                    potentially adverse tax consequences, including local taxation     of our fees or of transactions on our websites;                    higher telecommunications and Internet service provider costs;                    strong local competitors;                    different and more stringent user protection, data protection,     and other laws;                    cultural ambivalence towards, or non-acceptance of, online     trading;                    seasonal reductions in business activity;                    expenses associated with localizing our products, including     offering customers the ability to transact business in the local     currency;                    laws and business practices that favor local competitors or     prohibit foreign ownership of certain businesses;                    profit repatriation restrictions, foreign currency exchange     restrictions, and exchange rate fluctuations;                    volatility in a specific countrys or regions     political or economic conditions; and                    differing intellectual property laws.           Some of these factors may cause our international costs of doing     business to exceed our comparable domestic costs. As we expand     our international operations and have additional portions of our     international revenues denominated in foreign currencies, we     also could become subject to increased difficulties in     collecting accounts        13    Table of Contents       receivable, repatriating money without adverse tax consequences,     and risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate     fluctuations. The impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations     is discussed in more detail under We are exposed to     fluctuations in currency exchange rates, below.         We are continuing to expand PayPals services     internationally. We have limited experience with the payments     business outside of the U.S. In some countries, expansion     of PayPals business may require a close commercial     relationship with one or more local banks or a shared ownership     interest with a local entity. We do not know if these or other     factors may prevent, delay, or limit PayPals expansion or     reduce its profitability. Any limitation on our ability to     expand PayPal internationally could harm our business.         We maintain a portion of Shopping.coms research and     development facilities and personnel in Israel, and as a result,     political, economic and military conditions in Israel affect     those operations. During 2006, hostilities escalated between     Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip and between Israel and     Hezbollah, based in Lebanon. The future of peace efforts between     Israel and its neighboring countries remains uncertain.     Increased hostilities or terrorism within Israel or armed     hostilities between Israel and neighboring states could make it     more difficult for us to continue our operations in Israel,     which could increase our costs. In addition, many of     Shopping.coms employees in Israel could be required to     serve in the military for extended periods of time under     emergency circumstances. Shopping.coms Israeli operations     could be disrupted by the absence of employees due to military     service, which could adversely affect its business.     We are     exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange     rates.         Because we conduct a significant and growing portion of our     business outside the United States but report our results in     U.S. dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in     currency exchange rates. In connection with its multi-currency     service, PayPal fixes exchange rates twice per day, and may face     financial exposure if it incorrectly fixes the exchange rate or     if exposure reports are delayed. PayPal also holds some     corporate and customer funds in     non-U.S. currencies,     and thus its financial results are affected by the translation     of these     non-U.S. currencies     into U.S. dollars. In addition, the results of operations     of many of our internationally focused websites are exposed to     foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of     the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local     currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. If the     U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the     translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions     will result in increased net revenues, operating expenses, and     net income. Similarly, our net revenues, operating expenses, and     net income will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens     against foreign currencies. Net revenues in the twelve-month     period ended December 31, 2006 were positively impacted by     foreign currency translation of $40 million, compared to     the same period of the prior year. Operating income in the     twelve-month period ended December 31, 2006 was positively     impacted by foreign currency translation of $14 million,     compared to the same period of the prior year. As exchange rates     vary, net sales and other operating results, when translated,     may differ materially from expectations. In particular, to the     extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against the Euro and     British Pound, our European revenues and profits will be reduced     as a result of these translation adjustments. In addition, to     the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against the Euro and     the British Pound, cross-border trade related to purchases of     dollar-denominated goods by     non-U.S. purchasers     may decrease, and that decrease may not be offset by a     corresponding increase in cross-border trade involving purchases     by U.S. buyers of goods denominated in other currencies.     While we from time to time enter into transactions to hedge     portions of our foreign currency translation exposure, it is     impossible to perfectly predict or completely eliminate the     effects of this exposure.     We are     subject to patent litigation.         We have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other     parties patents. Some of these suits are ongoing, as     described under the heading Item 3: Legal     Proceedings, below. We have been notified of several other     potential patent disputes, and expect that we will increasingly     be subject to patent infringement claims as our services expand     in scope and complexity. In particular, we expect that we may     face additional patent infringement claims involving various     aspects of our Payments and Communications businesses. These     claims, whether meritorious or not, are time consuming and     costly to resolve, and could require expensive changes in our     methods of doing business, or could require us to enter into     costly royalty or licensing agreements.        14    Table of Contents     Government     inquiries may lead to charges or penalties.         A large number of transactions occur on our websites. We believe     that government regulators have received a substantial number of     consumer complaints about both eBay and PayPal, which, while     small as a percentage of our total transactions, are large in     aggregate numbers. As a result, we have from time to time been     contacted by various foreign and domestic governmental     regulatory agencies that have questions about our operations and     the steps we take to protect our users from fraud. PayPal has     received inquiries regarding its restriction and disclosure     practices from the Federal Trade Commission regarding these and     other business practices from the attorneys general of a number     of states. In September 2006, PayPal entered into a settlement     agreement with the attorneys general of a number of states under     which it agreed to pay $1.7 million to the attorneys     general, shorten and streamline its user agreement, increase     educational messaging to users about funding choices, and     communicate more information regarding protection programs to     users. Both eBay and PayPal are likely to receive additional     inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future, which may lead     to action against either company. We have responded to all     inquiries from regulatory agencies by describing our current and     planned antifraud efforts, customer support procedures,     operating procedures and disclosures. If one or more of these     agencies is not satisfied with our response to current or future     inquiries, we could be subject to enforcement actions, fines or     other penalties, or forced to change our operating practices in     ways that could harm our business.         We are subject to laws relating to the use and transfer of     personally identifiable information about our users, especially     for financial information and for users located outside of the     U.S. New laws in this area have been passed by several     jurisdictions, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing     additional restrictions. Violation of these laws, which in many     cases apply not only to third-party transactions but also to     transfers of information between ourselves and our subsidiaries,     and between ourselves, our subsidiaries, and other parties with     which we have commercial relations, could subject us to     significant penalties and negative publicity and could adversely     affect us.     The     listing or sale by our users of pirated or counterfeit items may     harm our business.         We have received in the past, and we anticipate receiving in the     future, communications alleging that certain items listed or     sold through our service by our users infringe third-party     copyrights, trademarks and trade names, or other intellectual     property rights. Although we have sought to work actively with     the owners of intellectual property rights to eliminate listings     offering infringing items on our websites, some rights owners     have expressed the view that our efforts are insufficient.     Content owners and other intellectual property rights owners     have been active in asserting their rights against online     companies, including eBay. Allegations of infringement of     intellectual property rights have resulted in litigation against     us from time to time, including litigation brought by     Tiffany & Co. and Robespierre, Inc. (doing business as     Nanette Lepore) in the U.S., Rolex S.A. in Germany, Louis     Vuitton Malletier and Christian Dior Couture in France, and a     number of other owners of intellectual property rights. The     plaintiffs in these cases seek to hold eBay liable for     counterfeit items listed on our sites by third parties, for the     misuse of trademarks in listings or in connection with paid     search advertisements, or for alleged violations of selective     distribution channel laws. Tiffany seeks, among other things,     injunctive relief and damages. A trial in the Tiffany case has     been scheduled for May 2007. Nanette Lepore sought, among other     things, to require eBay to block all listings offering Nanette     Lepore items, as well as damages. The court denied Nanette     Lepores request for a preliminary injunction, and found     that eBays process for addressing the listing of     counterfeit items by third parties on its site was both     reasonable and adequate. Nanette Lepore initially appealed the     ruling, but subsequently abandoned its appeal. Other luxury     brand owners have also filed suit against us or have threatened     to do so. In addition, we may be subject to criminal penalties     if the authorities feel we have aided in the sale of counterfeit     goods. While to date we have been largely successful in     defending against such litigation, more recent cases have been     based, at least in part, on different legal theories than those     of earlier cases, and there is no guarantee that we will     continue to be successful in defending against such litigation.     In particular, plaintiffs in recent cases have argued that we     are not entitled to safe harbors under the Digital Millennium     Copyright Act in the U.S. or as a hosting provider in the     European Union because of the active nature of our involvement     with our sellers, and that, whether or not such safe harbors are     available, we should be found liable because we have not     adequately removed counterfeit listings or effectively suspended     users who have created such listings. In addition, a public     perception that counterfeit or pirated items are commonplace on     our site could damage our reputation and our business.     Litigation and negative publicity may increase as our sites gain     prominence in markets outside of the U.S., where        15    Table of Contents       the laws may be unsettled or less favorable to us. Such     litigation is costly for us, could result in damage awards or     increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or     settlement, could require us to change our business practices in     expensive ways, or could otherwise harm our business. Litigation     against other online companies could result in interpretations     of the law that could also require us to change our business     practices or otherwise increase our costs.     We are     subject to general litigation and regulatory     disputes.         From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or     regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of     business. The number and significance of these disputes and     inquiries are increasing as our business expands and our company     grows larger. We have in the past been forced to litigate such     claims. We may also become more vulnerable to third-party claims     as laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Lanham     Act and the Communications Decency Act are interpreted by the     courts and as we expand geographically into jurisdictions where     the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of     online intermediaries such as ourselves are either unclear or     less favorable. Any claims or regulatory actions against us,     whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in     costly litigation, require significant amounts of management     time, and result in the diversion of significant operational     resources.     Acquisitions     could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other     harmful consequences.         We have acquired a number of businesses in the past, and we     expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of     potential strategic transactions, including business     combinations, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses,     technologies, services, products and other assets. At any given     time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with     respect to one or more of these types of transactions. Any of     these transactions could be material to our financial condition     and results of operations. The process of integrating any     acquired business may create unforeseen operating difficulties     and expenditures and is itself risky. The areas where we may     face difficulties include:                         diversion of management time, as well as a shift of focus from     operating the businesses to issues related to integration and     administration, particularly given the large number and size and     varying scope of our recent acquisitions, and, in the case of     Skype, the complex earn-out structure associated with the     transaction;                    declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from     changes in, or acceleration of, compensation, or changes in     management, reporting relationships, future prospects, or the     direction of the business;                    the need to integrate each companys accounting,     management, information, human resource and other administrative     systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control     if such integration is delayed or not implemented;                    the need to implement controls, procedures and policies     appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior     to acquisition had lacked such controls, procedures and     policies; and                    in some cases, the need to transition operations, users, and     customers onto our existing platforms.           Foreign acquisitions involve special risks, including those     related to integration of operations across different cultures     and languages, currency risks, and the particular economic,     political, and regulatory risks associated with specific     countries. Moreover, we may not realize the anticipated benefits     of any or all of our acquisitions, or may not realize them in     the time frame expected. For example, we have yet to realize     significant revenue benefits from the integration of Skype into     listings on eBay sites. Future acquisitions or mergers may     result in a need to issue additional equity securities, spend     our cash, or incur debt, liabilities, or amortization expenses     related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our     profitability and harm our business.     System     failures could harm our business.         We have experienced system failures from time to time, and any     interruption in the availability of our websites will reduce our     current revenues and profits, could harm our future revenues and     profits, and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny.     eBays primary website has been interrupted for periods of     up to 22 hours, and our PayPal site        16    Table of Contents       has suffered intermittent unavailability for periods as long as     five days. Any unscheduled interruption in our services results     in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenues.     Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause     current or potential users to believe that our systems are     unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to     avoid our sites, and could permanently harm our reputation and     brands. Reliability is particularly critical for PayPal,     especially as it seeks to expand its Merchant Services business.     Because PayPal is a regulated financial entity, frequent or     persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory     inquiries. These inquiries could result in fines, penalties, or     mandatory changes to PayPals business practices, and     ultimately could cause PayPal to lose existing licenses it needs     to operate or prevent it from obtaining additional licenses that     it needs to expand. Finally, because our customers may use our     products for critical transactions, any system failures could     result in damage to our customers businesses. These     customers could seek significant compensation from us for their     losses. Even if unsuccessful, this type of claim likely would be     time consuming and costly for us to address.         Although our systems have been designed around industry-standard     architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or     catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to damage or     interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss,     telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses,     computer     denial-of-service     attacks, and similar events. Some of our systems, including our     Shopping.com and Skype websites, are not fully redundant, and     our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all     eventualities. Our systems are also subject to break-ins,     sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism. Despite any     precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster, a     decision by any of our third-party hosting providers to close a     facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other     reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our hosting     facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our     services. We do not carry business interruption insurance     sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from     interruptions in our service as a result of system failures.     Our     growth will depend on our ability to develop our brands, and     these efforts may be costly.         Our historical growth has been largely attributable to word of     mouth, and to frequent and high visibility national and local     media coverage. We believe that continuing to strengthen our     brands will be critical to achieving widespread acceptance of     our services, and will require an increased focus on active     marketing efforts across all of our brands. The demand for and     cost of online and traditional advertising have been increasing,     and may continue to increase. Accordingly, we will need to spend     increasing amounts of money on, and devote greater resources to,     advertising, marketing, and other efforts to create and maintain     brand loyalty among users. During 2004 and 2005, we     significantly increased the number of brands we are supporting,     adding Rent.com, Shopping.com, Kijiji, and Skype, among others.     Each of these brands requires its own resources, increasing the     costs of our branding efforts. Brand promotion activities may     not yield increased revenues, and even if they do, any increased     revenues may not offset the expenses incurred in building our     brands. If we do attract new users to our services, they may not     conduct transactions using our services on a regular basis. If     we fail to promote and maintain our brands, or if we incur     substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and     maintain our brands, our business would be harmed.     Our     business and users may be subject to sales tax and other     taxes.         The application of indirect taxes (such as sales and use tax,     value-added tax, or VAT, goods and services tax, business tax,     and gross receipt tax) to     e-commerce     businesses such as eBay and to our users is a complex and     evolving issue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations     that impose these taxes were established before the growth of     the Internet and     e-commerce.     In many cases, it is not clear how existing statutes apply to     the Internet or electronic commerce or communications conducted     over the Internet. In addition, some jurisdictions have     implemented or may implement laws specifically addressing the     Internet or some aspect of electronic commerce or communications     on the Internet. The application of existing, new, or future     laws could have adverse effects on our business.         Several proposals have been made at the U.S. state and     local level that would impose additional taxes on the sale of     goods and services through the Internet. These proposals, if     adopted, could substantially impair the growth of     e-commerce,     and could diminish our opportunity to derive financial benefit     from our activities. The U.S. federal governments     moratorium on states and other local authorities imposing access     or discriminatory taxes on the Internet is scheduled to expire     in November 2007. This moratorium does not prohibit federal,     state, or local authorities from collecting taxes on our income     or from collecting taxes that are due under existing tax rules.        17    Table of Contents         In conjunction with the Streamlined Sales Tax     Project  an ongoing, multi-year effort by U.S.,     state, and local governments to require collection and     remittance of distant sales tax by     out-of-state     sellers  bills have been introduced in the     U.S. Congress to overturn the Supreme Courts Quill     decision, which limits the ability of state governments to     require sellers outside of their own state to collect and remit     sales taxes on goods purchased by in-state residents. An     overturning of the Quill decision would harm our users     and our business.         We do not collect taxes on the goods or services sold by users     of our services. One or more states or the federal government or     foreign countries may seek to impose a tax collection or     reporting or record-keeping obligation on companies such as eBay     and PayPal that engage in or facilitate     e-commerce.     Such an obligation could be imposed by legislation intended to     improve tax compliance or if eBay were ever deemed to be the     legal agent of eBay sellers by a jurisdiction in which eBay     operates. Imposition of a record keeping or tax collecting     requirement would harm our business. Foreign authorities may     also require eBay to help ensure compliance by our users with     local laws regulating professional sellers, including tax     requirements. In addition, we have periodically received     requests from tax authorities in some foreign jurisdictions for     information regarding the transactions of large classes of     sellers on our sites, and in some cases we may be legally     obligated to provide this data. Requirements that we disclose     sellers transaction records to tax authorities, and any     use of those records to investigate, collect taxes from, or     prosecute sellers, could decrease seller activity on our sites     and harm our business.         In July 2003, in compliance with the changes brought about by     the European Union, or EU, VAT directive on electronically     supplied services, eBay began collecting VAT on the fees     charged to EU sellers on eBay sites catering to EU residents.     eBay also pays input VAT to suppliers within the various     countries the company operates. In most cases, eBay is entitled     to reclaim input VAT from the various countries with regard to     our own payments to suppliers or vendors. However, because of     our unique business model, the application of the laws and rules     that allow such reclamation is sometimes uncertain. A successful     assertion by one or more countries that eBay is not entitled to     reclaim VAT would harm our business.         We continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and     legislators to clarify eBays obligations under new and     emerging laws and regulations. Passage of new legislation and     the imposition of additional tax or tax-related reporting     requirements could harm our users and our business. There have     been, and will continue to be, substantial ongoing costs     associated with complying with the various indirect tax     requirements in the numerous markets in which eBay conducts or     will conduct business.     Failure     to deal effectively with fraudulent transactions and customer     disputes would increase our loss rate and harm our     business.         PayPals highly automated and liquid payment service makes     PayPal an attractive target for fraud. In configuring its     service, PayPal faces an inherent trade-off between customer     convenience and security. Identity thieves and those committing     fraud using stolen credit card or bank account numbers can     potentially steal large amounts of money from businesses such as     PayPal. We believe that several of PayPals current and     former competitors in the electronic payments business have gone     out of business or significantly restricted their businesses     largely due to losses from this type of fraud. While PayPal uses     advanced anti-fraud technologies, we expect that technically     knowledgeable criminals will continue to attempt to circumvent     PayPals anti-fraud systems. In addition, PayPals     service could be subject to employee fraud or other internal     security breaches, and PayPal would be required to reimburse     customers for any funds stolen as a result of such breaches.     Merchants could also request reimbursement, or stop using     PayPal, if they are affected by buyer fraud.         PayPal incurs substantial losses from merchant fraud, including     claims from customers that merchants have not performed or that     their goods or services do not match the merchants     description. PayPal also incurs losses from claims that the     customer did not authorize the purchase, from buyer fraud, from     erroneous transmissions, and from customers who have closed bank     accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments.     In addition to the direct costs of such losses, if they are     related to credit card transactions and become excessive they     could result in PayPal losing the right to accept credit cards     for payment. If PayPal were unable to accept credit cards, the     velocity of trade on eBay could decrease, in which case our     business would further suffer. PayPal has been assessed     substantial fines for excess charge-backs in the past, and     excessive charge-backs may arise in the future. PayPal has taken     measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, but these     measures need to be continually improved and may        18    Table of Contents       not be effective against new forms of fraud or in connection     with new product offerings. If these measures do not succeed,     our business will suffer. PayPals fraud loss rate     increased significantly in the second half of 2006.         PayPal offers a buyer protection program that refunds to buyers     up to $1,000 in certain eBay transactions if they do not receive     the goods they purchased or if the goods differ significantly     from what was described by the seller. In January 2007, this     program was revised to refund buyers who use PayPal up to $200     in most eBay transactions, and up to $2,000 in certain eBay     transactions, if they do not receive the goods they purchased or     if the goods differ significantly from what was described by the     seller. If PayPal makes such a refund, it may seek to collect     reimbursement from the seller, but may not be able to receive     any funds from the seller. The PayPal buyer protection program     has increased PayPals loss rate and could cause future     fluctuations in PayPals loss rate. For the years ended     December 31, 2005 and 2006, PayPals transaction loss     totaled $73.8 million and $126.4 million, representing     0.27% and 0.33% of PayPals total payment volume,     respectively.         eBay faces similar risks with respect to fraudulent activities     on its websites. eBay periodically receives complaints from     users who may not have received the goods that they had     purchased. In some cases individuals have been arrested and     convicted for fraudulent activities using our websites. eBay     also receives complaints from sellers who have not received     payment for the goods that a buyer had contracted to purchase.     Non-payment may occur because of miscommunication, because a     buyer has changed his or her mind and decided not to honor the     contract to purchase the item, or because the buyer bid on the     item maliciously, in order to harm either the seller or eBay. In     some European jurisdictions, buyers may also have the right to     withdraw from a sale made by a professional seller within a     specified time period.         While eBay can suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill     their payment or delivery obligations to other users, eBay does     not have the ability to require users to make payment or deliver     goods, or otherwise make users whole other than through our     limited buyer protection programs. Other than through these     programs, eBay does not compensate users who believe they have     been defrauded by other users, although users who pay through     PayPal may have reimbursement rights from their credit card     company or bank, which in turn will seek reimbursement from     PayPal. eBay also periodically receives complaints from buyers     as to the quality of the goods purchased. We expect to continue     to receive communications from users requesting reimbursement or     threatening or commencing legal action against us if no     reimbursement is made. Our liability for these sort of claims is     only beginning to be clarified and may be higher in some     non-U.S. jurisdictions     than it is in the U.S. Litigation involving liability for     third-party actions could be costly for us, divert management     attention, result in increased costs of doing business, lead to     adverse judgments, or otherwise harm our business. In addition,     affected users will likely complain to regulatory agencies that     could take action against us, including imposing fines or     seeking injunctions.         Negative publicity and user sentiment generated as a result of     fraudulent or deceptive conduct by users of our eBay and PayPal     services could damage our reputation, reduce our ability to     attract new users or retain our current users, and diminish the     value of our brand names.     The     current regulatory environment for Voice over Internet Protocol     (VoIP) is uncertain, and Skypes business could be harmed     by new regulations or the application of existing regulations to     its products.         The current regulatory environment for VoIP is uncertain and     rapidly changing. Skypes voice communications products are     currently subject to very few, if any, of the same regulations     that apply to traditional telephony and to     VoIP-based     telephone replacement services. VoIP companies are generally     subject to different regulatory regimes in different countries,     and in most cases are subject to lower, or no, regulatory fees     and lesser, or no, specific regulatory requirements. Governments     may impose new or increased fees, taxes, and administrative     burdens on VoIP companies, or Skype may change its product     offerings in a manner that makes it become subject to     telecommunications regulations. Increased fees could include     access and other charges payable to local exchange carriers to     carry and terminate traffic, contributions to federal or state     Universal Service Funds in the United States and elsewhere, and     other charges. New laws and regulations may require Skype to     meet various emergency service requirements, disability access     requirements, user protection requirements, number assignment     and portability requirements, and interception or wiretapping     requirements, such as the Communications Assistance for Law     Enforcement Act in the U.S. and similar laws in other     jurisdictions. Such regulations could result in substantial     costs depending on the technical changes required to accommodate     the requirements, and any increased costs could erode        19    Table of Contents       Skypes pricing advantage over competing forms of     communication. Regulations that decrease the degree of privacy     for users of Skypes products could also slow its adoption.     The increasing growth and popularity of the VoIP telephony and     Internet communications market heighten the risk that     governments will seek to regulate VoIP and Internet     communications. Competitors, including the incumbent telephone     companies, may devote substantial lobbying efforts to seek     greater protection for their existing businesses and increased     regulation of VoIP. In the United States, various state     legislatures and regulatory agencies are considering whether to     impose their own requirements and taxes on VoIP. Increased     regulatory requirements on VoIP would increase Skypes     costs, and, as a result, our business would suffer.         Regulatory agencies may require Skype to conform to rules that     are difficult or impossible for it to comply with due to the     nature of its communications technologies, which could adversely     affect its business. For example, while suitable alternatives     may be developed in the future, Skype is currently unable to     identify the exact geographic origin of the traffic traversing     the Internet or to provide detailed calling information about     computer-to-computer     communications, either of which may make complying with future     regulatory requirements, such as emergency service requirements,     difficult or impossible.         In many countries in which Skype operates or provides VoIP     products, the laws that may relate to its offerings are unclear.     We cannot be certain that Skype or its customers are currently     in full compliance with regulatory or other legal requirements     in all countries in which Skype is used. Skypes failure or     the failure of those with whom Skype transacts business to     comply with these requirements could materially adversely affect     our business, financial condition and results of operations.         New rules and regulations with respect to VoIP are being     considered in various countries around the world. Such new rules     and regulations could increase our costs of doing business or     prevent us from delivering our products and offerings over the     Internet, which could adversely affect Skypes customer     base, and thus its revenue.     Skype     depends on key technology that is licensed from third     parties.         Skype licenses technology underlying certain key components of     its software from third parties it does not control, including     the technology underlying its     peer-to-peer     architecture and firewall traversal technology, and the audio     and video compression/decompression used to provide high sound     and video quality. Although Skype has contracts in place with     its third party technology providers, there can be no assurance     that the licensed technology or other technology that we may     seek to license in the future will continue to be available on     commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The loss of, or     inability to maintain, existing licenses could result in a     decrease in service quality until equivalent technology or     suitable alternatives can be developed, identified, licensed and     integrated. While we believe Skype has the ability to either     extend these licenses on commercially reasonable terms or     identify and obtain or develop suitable alternative products,     the costs associated with licensing or developing such products     could be high. Any failure to maintain these licenses on     commercially reasonable terms or to license or develop     alternative technologies would harm Skypes business.     Our     businesses depend on continued and unimpeded access to the     Internet. Internet service providers may be able to block,     degrade, or charge us for our users additional fees for     our offerings.         Our customers rely on access to the Internet to use our products     and services. In many cases that access is provided by companies     that compete with at least some of our offerings, including     incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile     communications companies, and large Internet service providers.     Some of these providers have stated that they may take measures     that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of     customers use of our offerings by restricting or     prohibiting the use of their lines for our offerings, by     filtering, blocking, delaying, or degrading the packets     containing the data associated with our products, or by charging     increased fees to us or our users for use of their lines to     provide our offerings. Some of these providers have     contractually restricted their customers access to     Skypes offerings through their terms of service with their     customers. These activities are technically feasible and may be     permitted by applicable law. In addition, Internet service     providers could attempt to charge us each time our customers use     our offerings. Worldwide, a number of companies have announced     plans to take such actions or are selling products designed to     facilitate such actions. Interference with our offerings or     higher        20    Table of Contents       charges for access to our offerings, whether paid by us or by     our customers, could cause us to lose existing customers, impair     our ability to attract new customers, and harm our revenue and     growth.     Changes     to credit card association fees, rules, or practices could harm     PayPals business.         Because PayPal is not a bank, it cannot belong to or directly     access credit card associations, such as Visa and MasterCard. As     a result, PayPal must rely on banks or payment processors to     process transactions, and must pay a fee for this service. From     time to time, credit card associations may increase the     interchange fees that they charge for each transaction using one     of their cards. MasterCard and Visa each implemented increases     in their interchange fees for credit cards in April 2005.     PayPals credit card processors have the right to pass any     increases in interchange fees on to PayPal as well as increase     their own fees for processing. These increased fees increase     PayPals operating costs and reduce its profit margins.     PayPal is also required by its processors to comply with credit     card association operating rules, and PayPal has agreed to     reimburse its processors for any fines they are assessed by     credit card associations as a result of any rule violations by     PayPal. The credit card associations and their member banks set     and interpret the credit card rules. Some of those member banks     compete with PayPal. Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or     Discover could adopt new operating rules or re-interpret     existing rules that PayPal or its processors might find     difficult or even impossible to follow. As a result, PayPal     could lose its ability to give customers the option of using     credit cards to fund their payments. If PayPal were unable to     accept credit cards, its business would be seriously damaged. In     addition, the velocity of trade on eBay could decrease and our     business would further suffer.         PayPal is required to comply with credit card associations     special operating rules for Internet payment services. PayPal     and its credit card processors have implemented specific     business processes for merchant customers in order to comply     with these rules, but any failure to comply could result in     fines, the amount of which would be within Visas and     MasterCards discretion. PayPal also could be subject to     fines from MasterCard and Visa if it fails to detect that     merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or that     are considered high risk, primarily the sale of     certain types of digital content. For high risk     merchants, PayPal must either prevent such merchants from using     PayPal or register such merchants with MasterCard and Visa and     conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants.     PayPal has incurred fines from its credit card processor     relating to PayPals failure to detect the use of its     service by high risk merchants. The amount of these     fines has not been material, but any additional fines in the     future would likely be for larger amounts, could become     material, and could result in a termination of PayPals     ability to accept credit cards or changes in PayPals     process for registering new customers, which would seriously     damage PayPals business.     Changes     in PayPals funding mix could adversely affect     PayPals results.         PayPal pays significant transaction fees when senders fund     payment transactions using credit cards, nominal fees when     customers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of     funds from bank accounts, and no fees when customers fund     payment transactions from an existing PayPal account balance.     Senders fund a significant portion of PayPals payment     volume using credit cards, and PayPals financial success     will remain highly sensitive to changes in the rate at which its     senders fund payments using credit cards. Senders may prefer     funding using credit cards rather than bank account transfers     for a number of reasons, including the ability to dispute and     reverse charges if merchandise is not delivered or is not as     described, the ability to earn frequent flier miles or other     incentives offered by credit cards, the ability to defer     payment, or a reluctance to provide bank account information to     PayPal. In addition, some products that PayPal is introducing as     it expands its business are expected to have a higher rate of     credit card funding than PayPals current rate. In     September 2006, PayPal entered into a settlement agreement with     the attorneys general of a number of states under which it     agreed to pay $1.7 million to the attorneys general,     shorten and streamline its user agreement, and communicate more     information regarding protection programs to users. Also in     September 2006, PayPal announced that it had reached a     preliminary settlement agreement under which it agreed to pay     approximately $3.5 million into a settlement fund for the     benefit of a class represented by plaintiffs in a suit that     alleged, among other things, that PayPals disclosure     regarding the effects of users choice of funding mechanism     was deceptive. Although PayPal did not admit any liability for     any of the allegations in the two cases, the required changes to     our disclosure practices under the settlement agreements could     result in increased use of credit card funding, which would harm     PayPals business.        21    Table of Contents     If     PayPal were found to be subject to or in violation of any     U.S. laws or regulations governing banking, money     transmission, or electronic funds transfers, it could be subject     to liability and forced to change its business     practices.         A number of U.S. states have enacted legislation regulating     money transmitters. To date, PayPal has obtained licenses in 36     of these jurisdictions and interpretations in nine states that     licensing is not required under their existing statutes. As a     licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to bonding     requirements, restrictions on its investment of customer funds,     reporting requirements, and inspection by state regulatory     agencies. In July 2005, PayPal entered into a settlement     agreement and agreed to pay $225,000 to the California     Department of Financial Institutions in connection with alleged     violations of the California Financial Code relating to the use     of a receipt form for international payments that had not been     pre-approved by the Department, and incomplete reporting to the     Department. If PayPal were found to be in violation of other     money services laws or regulations, PayPal could be subject to     liability, forced to cease doing business with residents of     certain states, or forced to change its business practices. Any     change to PayPals business practices that makes the     service less attractive to customers or prohibits its use by     residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease the     velocity of trade on eBay, which would further harm our     business. Even if PayPal is not forced to change its business     practices, it could be required to obtain additional licenses or     regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on     PayPal.         We believe that the licensing or approval requirements of the     U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal     Reserve Board, and other federal or state agencies that regulate     banks, bank holding companies, or other types of providers of     e-commerce     services do not apply to PayPal, except for certain money     transmitter licenses mentioned above. However, one or more     states may conclude that PayPal is engaged in an unauthorized     banking business. If PayPal is found to be engaged in an     unauthorized banking business in one or more states, it might be     subject to monetary penalties and adverse publicity and might be     required to cease doing business with residents of those states     or could be subject to fines and penalties. The need to comply     with state laws prohibiting unauthorized banking activities     could also limit PayPals ability to enhance its services     in the future. Any change to PayPals business practices     that makes the service less attractive to customers or prohibits     its use by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease     the velocity of trade on eBay, which would further harm our     business.         Although there have been no definitive interpretations to date,     PayPal has assumed that its service is subject to the Electronic     Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E of the Federal     Reserve Board. As a result, among other things, PayPal must     provide advance disclosure of changes to its service, follow     specified error resolution procedures and absorb losses above     $50 from transactions not authorized by the consumer. In     addition, PayPal is subject to the financial privacy provisions     of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, state financial privacy laws, and     related regulations. As a result, some customer financial     information that PayPal receives is subject to limitations on     reuse and disclosure. Existing and potential future privacy laws     may limit PayPals ability to develop new products and     services that make use of data gathered through its service. The     provisions of these laws and related regulations are     complicated, and PayPal does not have extensive experience in     complying with them. Even technical violations of these laws can     result in penalties of up to $1,000 for each non-compliant     transaction. PayPal processed an average of approximately     1.7 million transactions per day during the year ended     December 31, 2006, and any violations could expose PayPal     to significant liability. Any negative change in the     publics perception of PayPals compliance with     privacy laws and policies could also negatively impact     PayPals business.     PayPals     status under banking or financial services laws or other laws in     markets outside the U.S. is unclear.         PayPal currently allows its customers with credit cards to send     payments from 103 markets, and to receive payments in 49 of     those markets. In 35 of these 49 markets, customers can withdraw     funds to local bank accounts, and in eight of these markets     customers can withdraw funds by receiving a bank draft in the     mail. PayPal offers customers the ability to send or receive     payments denominated in 17 currencies. 25 of the 103 markets     whose residents can use the PayPal service are members of the     European Union, and PayPal provides localized versions of its     service to customers in the EU through PayPal (Europe) Ltd., a     wholly-owned subsidiary of PayPal that is licensed in the United     Kingdom to operate as an Electronic Money Institution. PayPal     (Europe) implements its localized services in EU countries     through an expedited passport notification process     through the United Kingdom regulator to regulators in other EU     member states, pursuant to EU Directives. PayPal (Europe) has        22    Table of Contents       completed the passport notice process in all EU     member countries. The regulators in these countries could notify     PayPal (Europe) of local consumer protection laws that will     apply to its business, in addition to United Kingdom consumer     protection law. Any such responses from these regulators could     increase the cost of, or delay, PayPals plans for     expanding its business. PayPal (Europe) is subject to     significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the     disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization,     funds management or other requirements imposed on electronic     money institutions.         In markets other than the U.S., European Union, Australia and     China, PayPal serves its customers through PayPal Private Ltd.,     a wholly-owned subsidiary of PayPal that is based in Singapore.     In many of these markets, it is not clear whether PayPals     Singapore-based service is subject to local law or, if it is     subject to local law, whether such local law requires a payment     processor like PayPal to be licensed as a bank or financial     institution or otherwise. Even if PayPal is not currently     required to obtain a license in those countries, future     localization or targeted marketing of PayPals service in     those countries could require licensure and other laws of those     countries (such as data protection and anti-money laundering     laws) may apply. If PayPal were found to be subject to and in     violation of any foreign laws or regulations, it could be     subject to liability, forced to change its business practices or     forced to suspend providing services to customers in one or more     countries. Alternatively, PayPal could be required to obtain     licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial     cost on it and involve considerable delay to the provision or     development of its product. Delay or failure to receive such a     license would require PayPal to change its business practices or     features in ways that would adversely affect PayPals     international expansion plans and could require PayPal to     suspend providing services to customers in one or more countries.     PayPals     failure to manage customer funds properly would harm its     business.         PayPals ability to manage and account accurately for     customer funds requires a high level of internal controls.     PayPal has a limited operating history and management experience     in managing these internal controls. As PayPals business     continues to grow, it must strengthen its internal controls     accordingly. PayPals success requires significant public     confidence in its ability to handle large and growing     transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure     to maintain necessary controls or to manage accurately customer     funds could diminish customer use of PayPals product     severely.     New     and existing regulations could harm our business.         We are subject to the same foreign and domestic laws as other     companies conducting business on and off the Internet. Today,     there are still relatively few laws specifically directed     towards online services. However, due to the increasing     popularity and use of the Internet and online services, many     laws relating to the Internet are being debated at all levels of     government around the world. Adopted and proposed laws and     regulations cover issues such as user privacy, freedom of     expression, pricing, fraud, content and quality of products and     services, taxation, tax-related reporting of business activity,     advertising, intellectual property rights, and information     security. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues     such as property ownership, copyrights and other intellectual     property issues, taxation, libel and defamation, obscenity, and     personal privacy apply to online businesses. The majority of     these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and     related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or     address the unique issues of the Internet and related     technologies. Those laws that do reference the Internet, such as     the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the European     Unions Directive on Distance Selling and Electronic     Commerce, have begun to be interpreted by the courts and     implemented by the EU Member States, but their applicability and     scope remain somewhat uncertain. As our activities and the types     of goods listed on our websites expand, including through     acquisitions such as our recent acquisition of StubHub, an     online ticket marketplace, regulatory agencies or courts may     claim or hold that we or our users are either subject to     licensure or prohibited from conducting our business in their     jurisdiction, either with respect to our services in general, or     in order to allow the sale of certain items, such as real     estate, event tickets, cultural goods, boats, and automobiles.         Numerous states and foreign jurisdictions, including the State     of California, where our headquarters are located, have     regulations regarding auctions and the handling of     property by secondhand dealers or     pawnbrokers. No final legal determination has been     made as to whether the California regulations apply to our     business (or that of our users) and little precedent exists in     this area. Several states and some foreign jurisdictions have     attempted, and may attempt in the future, to impose such     regulations upon us or our users. Attempted enforcement        23    Table of Contents       of these laws against some of our users appears to be increasing     and such attempted enforcements could harm our business. In     2002, Illinois amended its auction law to provide for a special     regulatory regime for Internet auction listing     services, and we have registered as an Internet auction     listing service in Illinois. Although this registration has not     had a negative impact on our business to date, other regulatory     and licensure claims could result in costly litigation or could     require us to change the way we or our users do business in ways     that increase costs or reduce revenues or force us to prohibit     listings of certain items for some locations. We could also be     subject to fines or other penalties, and any of these outcomes     could harm our business.         In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide, and     we facilitate sales of goods to users worldwide, foreign     jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with     their laws. For example, the Australian high court has ruled     that a U.S. website in certain circumstances must comply     with Australian laws regarding libel. A number of the lawsuits     against us relating to trademark issues seek to have our     websites subject to unfavorable local laws. As we expand and     localize our international activities, we become obligated to     comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate. Laws     regulating Internet companies outside of the U.S. may be     less favorable than those in the U.S., giving greater rights to     consumers, content owners, and users. Compliance may be more     costly or may require us to change our business practices or     restrict our service offerings relative to those in the     U.S. In addition, we may be subject to overlapping legal or     regulatory regimes that impose conflicting requirements on us.     Our failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to     penalties ranging from criminal prosecution to bans on our     services.     Our     tickets business is subject to regulatory, competitive, and     other risks that could harm this business.         Our tickets business, which includes our recently-acquired     StubHub business, is subject to numerous risks. Many     jurisdictions have laws and regulations covering the resale of     event tickets, and some jurisdictions prohibit the resale of     event tickets at prices above the face value of the tickets. In     addition, new laws and regulations may be passed that would     limit our or our users ability to continue this business.     Regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we are     responsible for ensuring that our users comply with these laws     and regulations or that we or our users are either subject to     licensure or prohibited from reselling event tickets in their     jurisdictions.         Some event organizers and professional sports teams have     expressed concern about the resale of their event tickets on our     sites, and in November 2006 the New England Patriots filed suit     against StubHub alleging that StubHubs resale activities     violate Massachusetts ticket resale laws and constitute     intentional interference with the teams relationship with     its season ticket holders. Such litigation could result in     damage awards, could require us to change our business practices     in harmful ways, or could otherwise negatively affect our     tickets business. Our tickets business is also subject to     seasonal fluctuations and the general economic and business     conditions that impact the sporting events and live     entertainment industries. Our tickets business also faces     significant competition from a number of sources, including     ticketing service companies (such as TicketMaster and     Tickets.com), event organizers (such as professional sports     teams and leagues), ticket brokers, and other online and offline     ticket resellers (such as TicketsNow and RazorGator). If we are     unable to effectively compete with these competitors, our     tickets business could be harmed.     Our     business is subject to online security risks, including security     breaches and identity theft.         To succeed, online commerce and communications must provide a     secure transmission of confidential information over public     networks. Our security measures may not detect or prevent     security breaches that could harm our business. Currently, a     significant number of our users authorize us to bill their     credit card accounts directly for all transaction fees charged     by us. PayPals users routinely provide credit card and     other financial information. We rely on encryption and     authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide     the security and authentication to effect secure transmission of     confidential information, including customer credit card     numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in     the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a     compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect     transaction data. In addition, any party who is able to     illicitly obtain a users password could access the     users transaction data. An increasing number of websites     have reported breaches of their security. Any compromise of our     security could harm our reputation and, therefore, our business.     In addition, a party that is able to circumvent our security     measures could misappropriate proprietary information, cause     interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of     our users, or otherwise damage        24    Table of Contents       our reputation and business. Under credit card rules and our     contract with our card processors, if there is a breach of     credit card information that we store, or that is stored by     PayPals direct credit card processing customers, we could     be liable to the credit card issuing banks for their cost of     issuing new cards and related expenses.         Our servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or     electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions, and we have     experienced     denial-of-service     type attacks on our system that have made all or portions of our     websites unavailable for periods of time. We may need to expend     significant resources to protect against security breaches or to     address problems caused by breaches. These issues are likely to     become more difficult as we expand the number of places where we     operate. Security breaches could damage our reputation and     expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible     liability. Our insurance policies carry low coverage limits,     which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by     security breaches.         Our users, as well as those of other prominent Internet     companies, have been and will continue to be targeted by parties     using fraudulent spoof emails to misappropriate     passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal information or     to introduce viruses through trojan horse programs     to our users computers. These emails appear to be     legitimate emails sent by eBay, PayPal, Skype, or a user of one     of those businesses, but direct recipients to fake websites     operated by the sender of the email or request that the     recipient send a password or other confidential information via     email or download a program. Despite our efforts to mitigate     spoof     e-mails     through product improvements and user education,     spoof remains a serious problem that may damage our     brand, discourage use of our websites, and increase our costs.         Some businesses and security consultants have expressed concern     over the potential for Skypes software to create security     vulnerabilities on its users computers. While we believe     Skypes software is safe and does not pose a security risk     to its users, the perception that Skypes software is     unsafe could hamper its adoption, and any actual security breach     could damage Skypes reputation and expose us to a risk of     loss or litigation and possible liability.     Our     failure to manage growth could harm our business.         We are currently expanding our headcount, facilities, and     infrastructure in the U.S. and internationally. We anticipate     that further expansion will be required as we continue to expand     into new lines of business and geographic areas. This expansion     has placed, and we expect it will continue to place, a     significant strain on our management, operational, and financial     resources. The areas that are put under strain by our growth     include the following:                     Our Websites.  We must constantly add new     hardware, update software and add new engineering personnel to     accommodate the increased use of our and our subsidiaries     websites and the new products and features we regularly     introduce. This upgrade process is expensive, and the increased     complexity of our websites and the need to support multiple     platforms as our portfolio of brands grows increases the cost of     additional enhancements. Failure to upgrade our technology,     features, transaction processing systems, security     infrastructure, or network infrastructure to accommodate     increased traffic or transaction volume could harm our business.     Adverse consequences could include unanticipated system     disruptions, slower response times, degradation in levels of     customer support, impaired quality of users experiences of     our services, impaired quality of services for third-party     application developers using our externally accessible     Application Programming Interface, or API, and delays in     reporting accurate financial information. We may be unable to     effectively upgrade and expand our systems in a timely manner or     smoothly integrate any newly developed or purchased technologies     or businesses with our existing systems, and any failure to do     so could result in problems on our sites. For example, in     October 2004, we experienced unscheduled downtime on the PayPal     website over a period of five days related to system upgrades.     Despite our efforts to increase site scalability and     reliability, our infrastructure could prove unable to handle a     larger volume of customer transactions. Some of our more     recently acquired businesses may be particularly subject to this     risk given their shorter histories and, in some cases, higher     growth rates. Any failure to accommodate transaction growth     could impair customer satisfaction, lead to a loss of customers,     impair our ability to add customers, or increase our costs, all     of which would harm our business. Further, steps to increase the     reliability and redundancy of our systems are expensive, reduce     our margins, and may not be successful in reducing the frequency     or duration of unscheduled downtime.          25    Table of Contents                     Customer Account Billing.  Our revenues     depend on prompt and accurate billing processes. Problems with     our conversion to a new billing system during the second and     third quarters of 2004 caused incorrect account balance totals     to be displayed for some users. While these problems have been     corrected and we believe that no users were overcharged, our     failure to grow our transaction-processing capabilities to     accommodate the increasing number of transactions that must be     billed on any of our websites would harm our business and our     ability to collect revenue.                Customer Support.  We are expanding our     customer support operations to accommodate the increased number     of users and transactions on our websites and the increased     level of user protection activity we provide worldwide. If we     are unable to provide these operations in a cost-effective     manner, users of our websites may have negative experiences,     current and future revenues could suffer, and our operating     margins may decrease.           We must continue to hire, train, and manage new employees at a     rapid rate. If our new hires perform poorly, if we are     unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating     these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining     our existing employees, our business may be harmed. To manage     the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will     need to improve our transaction processing, operational and     financial systems, procedures, and controls. This is a special     challenge as we acquire new operations with different systems.     Our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures, and     controls may not be adequate to support our future operations.     The additional headcount and capital investments we are adding     increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us     to offset any future revenue shortfalls by expense reductions in     the short term.     Use of     our services for illegal purposes could harm our     business.         The law relating to the liability of providers of online     services for the activities of their users on their service is     currently unsettled in the United States and internationally. We     are aware that certain goods, such as weapons, adult material,     tobacco products, alcohol, and other goods that may be subject     to regulation, have been listed and traded on our service. We     may be unable to prevent our users from selling unlawful goods     or selling goods in an unlawful manner, and we may be subject to     allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful     activities carried out by users through our service. We have     been subject to several lawsuits based upon such allegations. In     December 2004, an executive of Baazee.com, our Indian     subsidiary, was arrested in connection with a users     listing of a pornographic video clip on that site. Similarly,     our Korean subsidiary and one of its employees were found     criminally liable for listings on the Korean subsidiarys     website. In order to reduce our exposure to this liability, we     have prohibited the listing of certain items and increased the     number of personnel reviewing questionable items. In the future,     we may implement other protective measures that could require us     to spend substantial resources or discontinue certain service     offerings. Any costs incurred as a result of potential liability     relating to the sale of unlawful goods or the unlawful sale of     goods could harm our business. In addition, we have received     significant and continuing media attention relating to the     listing or sale of unlawful goods using our services. This     negative publicity could damage our reputation and diminish the     value of our brand names. It also could make users reluctant to     continue to use our services.         PayPals payment system is also susceptible to potentially     illegal or improper uses. These may include illegal online     gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illicit sales     of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of     software and other intellectual property, money laundering, bank     fraud, child pornography trafficking, prohibited sales of     alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, and online securities     fraud. PayPals acceptable use policy enables PayPal to     fine users in certain jurisdictions up to $500 or take legal     action to recover its losses for certain violations of that     policy, including online gambling and illegal sales of     prescription medications. Despite measures PayPal has taken to     detect and lessen the risk of this kind of conduct, illegal     activities could still be funded using PayPal.         PayPal is subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations     that prohibit, among other things, its involvement in     transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. Although     PayPal has adopted a program to comply with these laws and     regulations, any errors or failure to implement the program     properly could lead to lawsuits, administrative action, and     prosecution by the government. In July 2003, PayPal agreed with     the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri that     it would pay $10 million as a civil forfeiture to settle     allegations that its        26    Table of Contents       provision of services to online gambling merchants violated     provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act and further agreed to have its     compliance program reviewed by an independent audit firm. PayPal     is also subject to regulations that require it to report     suspicious activities involving transactions of $2,000 or more     and may be required to obtain and keep more detailed records on     the senders and recipients in certain transfers of $3,000 or     more. The interpretation of suspicious activities in this     context is uncertain. Future regulations under the USA PATRIOT     Act may require PayPal to revise the procedures it uses to     verify the identity of its customers and to monitor     international transactions more closely. As PayPal localizes its     service in other countries, additional verification and     reporting requirements could apply. These regulations could     impose significant costs on PayPal and make it more difficult     for new customers to join its network. PayPal could be required     to learn more about its customers before opening an account, to     obtain additional verification of customers and to monitor its     customers activities more closely. These requirements, as     well as any additional restrictions imposed by credit card     associations, could raise PayPals costs significantly and     reduce the attractiveness of its product. Failure to comply with     federal, state or foreign country money laundering laws could     result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties,     and forfeiture of significant assets.     We are     subject to risks associated with information disseminated     through our service.         The law relating to the liability of online services companies     for information carried on or disseminated through their     services is currently unsettled. Claims could be made against     online services companies under both U.S. and foreign law for     defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or     trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature     and content of the materials disseminated through their     services. Several private lawsuits seeking to impose liability     upon us under a number of these theories have been brought     against us. In addition, domestic and foreign legislation has     been proposed that would prohibit or impose liability for the     transmission over the Internet of certain types of information.     Our service features a Feedback Forum, which includes     information from users regarding other users. Although all such     feedback is generated by users and not by us, claims of     defamation or other injury have been made in the past and could     be made in the future against us for content posted in the     Feedback Forum. Several recent court decisions have narrowed the     scope of the immunity provided to Internet service providers     like us under the Communications Decency Act. This trend, if     continued, may increase our potential liability to third parties     for the user-provided content on our site. Our liability for     such claims may be higher in jurisdictions outside the     U.S. where laws governing Internet transactions are     unsettled. If we become liable for information provided by our     users and carried on our service in any jurisdiction in which we     operate, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to     implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability.     This may require us to expend substantial resources or to     discontinue certain service offerings, which would negatively     affect our financial results. In addition, the increased     attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these     lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or     otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred     as a result of this potential liability could harm our business.     Customer     complaints or negative publicity about our customer service     could diminish use of our services.         Customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer     service could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use     of our services. Measures we sometimes take to combat risks of     fraud and breaches of privacy and security can damage relations     with our customers. These measures heighten the need for prompt     and accurate customer service to resolve irregularities and     disputes. Effective customer service requires significant     personnel expense, and this expense, if not managed properly,     could significantly impact our profitability. Failure to manage     or train our customer service representatives properly could     compromise our ability to handle customer complaints     effectively. If we do not handle customer complaints     effectively, our reputation may suffer and we may lose our     customers confidence.         Because it is providing a financial service and operating in a     more regulated environment, PayPal, unlike eBay, must provide     telephone as well as email customer service and must resolve     certain customer contacts within shorter time frames. As part of     PayPals program to reduce fraud losses, it may temporarily     restrict the ability of customers to withdraw their funds if     those funds or the customers account activity are     identified by PayPals anti-fraud models as suspicious.     PayPal has in the past received negative publicity with respect     to its customer service and account restrictions, and has been     the subject of purported class action lawsuits and state     attorney general inquiries alleging,        27    Table of Contents       among other things, failure to resolve account restrictions     promptly. If PayPal is unable to provide quality customer     support operations in a cost-effective manner, PayPals     users may have negative experiences, PayPal may receive     additional negative publicity, its ability to attract new     customers may be damaged, and it could become subject to     additional litigation. As a result, current and future revenues     could suffer, or its operating margins may decrease. In     addition, negative publicity about or experiences with     PayPals customer support could cause eBays     reputation to suffer or affect consumer confidence in the eBay     brands as a whole.     Problems     with third parties who provide services to us or to our users     could harm our business.         A number of parties provide services to us or to our users that     benefit us. Such services include seller tools that automate and     manage listings, merchant tools that manage listings and     interface with inventory management software, storefronts that     help our users list items, and caching services that make our     sites load faster, among others. In some cases we have     contractual agreements with these companies that give us a     direct financial interest in their success, while in other cases     we have none. PayPal is dependent on the processing companies     and banks that link PayPal to the credit card and bank clearing     networks. Financial, regulatory, or other problems that prevent     these companies from providing services to us or our users could     reduce the number of listings on our websites or make completing     transactions or payments on our websites more difficult, and     thereby harm our business. Any security breach at one of these     companies could also affect our customers and harm our business.     Although we generally have been able to renew or extend the     terms of contractual arrangements with these third party service     providers on acceptable terms, there can be no assurance that we     will continue to be able to do so in the future.     We     depend on key personnel.         Our future performance depends substantially on the continued     services of our senior management and other key personnel and     our ability to retain and motivate them. The loss of the     services of any of our executive officers or other key employees     could harm our business. We do not have long-term employment     agreements with any of our key personnel, we do not maintain any     key person life insurance policies, and our Chief     Executive Officer and many other members of our senior     management team have fully vested the vast majority of their     in-the-money     equity incentives. Our new businesses all depend on attracting     and retaining key personnel. Our future success also will depend     on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate highly     skilled technical, managerial, marketing, and customer support     personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, and we     may be unable to successfully attract, integrate, or retain     sufficiently qualified personnel. In making employment     decisions, particularly in the Internet and high-technology     industries, job candidates often consider the value of the stock     options they are to receive in connection with their employment.     Fluctuations in our stock price may make it more difficult to     retain and motivate employees whose stock option strike prices     are substantially above current market prices. Similarly,     decreases in the number of unvested     in-the-money     stock options held by existing employees, whether because our     stock price has declined, options have vested, or because the     size of follow-on option grants has declined, may make it more     difficult to retain and motivate employees.         Skypes future success depends substantially upon the     continued services of its senior management and key personnel,     and the loss of their services could harm our business. Several     key members of Skypes engineering team are consultants,     not full-time employees, who provide services to us and third     parties. A number of Skypes employees had equity in Skype     prior to its acquisition by eBay. Skype equity holders were     given the option of receiving their portion of the acquisition     consideration in the form of a lump-sum up- front payment or     receiving a lower up-front payment in exchange for the     possibility of receiving additional consideration in the form of     potential earn-out payments tied to the achievement of certain     performance targets prior to June 30, 2009. Several key     members of Skypes senior management and key employees     chose to receive less up-front consideration in exchange for the     possibility of receiving the performance-based earn-out     payments. Although eligible Skype employees have also been     granted eBay stock options, the earn-out payments are not tied     to continued employment with Skype or eBay, and key Skype     employees may choose to depart because of differences in     corporate culture, because they believe the earn-out targets     will be achieved without their contributions, or because they     believe the earn-out targets are not achievable. The loss of the     services of any of Skypes senior management or key     personnel could delay the development and introduction of new     features and products, and could harm our ability to grow     Skypes business.        28    Table of Contents     Our     industry is intensely competitive, and other companies or     governmental agencies may allege that our behavior is     anti-competitive.     Marketplaces         Marketplaces businesses currently or potentially compete with a     number of companies providing both particular categories of     goods and broader ranges of goods. The Internet provides new,     rapidly evolving and intensely competitive channels for the sale     of all types of goods. We expect competition to intensify in the     future. The barriers to entry into these channels are relatively     low, and current offline and new competitors can easily launch     online sites at a nominal cost using commercially available     software or partnering with any one of a number of successful     e-commerce     companies.         Our broad-based competitors include the vast majority of     traditional department, warehouse, discount, and general     merchandise stores (as well as the online operations of these     traditional retailers), emerging online retailers, online     classified services, and other shopping channels such as offline     and online home shopping networks. These include most     prominently: Wal-Mart, Target, Sears, Macys, JC Penney,     Costco, Office Depot, Staples, OfficeMax, Sams Club,     Amazon.com, Buy.com, AOL.com, Yahoo! Shopping, MSN, QVC, and     Home Shopping Network.         A number of companies have launched a variety of services that     provide new channels for buyers to find and buy items from     sellers of all sizes, including online aggregation and     classifieds sites such as Oodle.com, Google Base, and Microsoft     Live Expo. In 2005, we acquired Shopping.com Ltd., an online     shopping comparison site. Shopping.com competes with sites such     as Buy.com, Googles Froogle, Nextag.com, Pricegrabber.com,     Shopzilla, and Yahoo! Product Search, which offer shopping     search engines that allow consumers to search the Internet for     specified products. Similarly, sellers are increasingly     acquiring new customers by paying for search-related     advertisements on search engine sites such as Google and Yahoo!.     We use product search engines and paid search advertising to     channel users to our sites, but these services also have the     potential to divert users to other online shopping destinations.         We also compete with many local, regional, and national     specialty retailers and exchanges in each of the major     categories of products offered on our site. For example,     category-specific competitors to offerings in our     Home & Garden category include: Ace Hardware, Baby     Style, Baby Universe, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Brookstone,     Burpee.com, Crate & Barrel, Do-It-Best Hardware, Ethan     Allen, Frontgate, Harbor Freight, IKEA, HomeBase, Home Depot,     Kohls, Lamps Plus, Lowes, Linens n Things, OSH,     Pier One, Pottery Barn, Restoration Hardware, Smith &     Hawken, Spiegel, Tuesday Morning, True Value Hardware, and     Williams-Sonoma.         Our international Marketplaces websites compete with similar     online and offline channels in each of their vertical categories     in most countries. In addition, they compete with general online     e-commerce     sites, such as Quelle and Otto in Germany, Yahoo-Kimo in Taiwan,     Daum and Gmarket in South Korea, and Amazon in the United     Kingdom and other countries. In some of these countries, there     are online sites that have much larger customer bases and     greater brand recognition than we do, and in certain of these     jurisdictions there are competitors that may have a better     understanding of local culture and commerce than we do.         The principal competitive factors for Marketplaces include the     following:                         ability to attract buyers and sellers;                    volume of transactions and price and selection of goods;                    customer service; and                    brand recognition.           With respect to our online competition, additional competitive     factors include:                         community cohesion, interaction and size;                    website     ease-of-use     and accessibility;                    system reliability;                    reliability of delivery and payment;          29    Table of Contents                         level of service fees; and                    quality of search tools.           Some current and potential competitors have longer operating     histories, larger customer bases and greater brand recognition     in other business and Internet sectors than we do. Other online     trading services may be acquired by, receive investments from,     or enter into other commercial relationships with larger,     well-established and well-financed companies. As a result, some     of our competitors with other revenue sources may be able to     devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns,     adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially     more resources to website and systems development than we can.     Some of our competitors have offered services for free and     others may do this as well. We may be unable to compete     successfully against current and future competitors. In     addition, certain offline competitors may encourage     manufacturers to limit or cease distribution of their products     to dealers who sell through online channels such as eBay, or may     attempt to use existing or future government regulation to     prohibit or limit online commerce in certain categories of goods     or services. The adoption by manufacturers or government     authorities of policies or regulations discouraging the sales of     goods or services over the Internet could force eBay users to     stop selling certain products on our websites. Increased     competition or anti-Internet distribution policies or     regulations may result in reduced operating margins, loss of     market share and diminished value of our brand.         Conversely, other companies and government agencies have in the     past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the     antitrust or competition laws of the U.S. or other     countries, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. Such     claims, even if without foundation, typically are very expensive     to defend, involve negative publicity and diversion of     management time and effort, and could result in significant     judgments against us.         In order to respond to changes in the competitive environment,     we may, from time to time, make pricing, service or marketing     decisions or acquisitions that could harm our profitability. For     example, PayPal has implemented a buyer protection program     generally covering losses for eBay transactions paid with PayPal     up to $200 and covering losses from selected eBay sellers up to     $2,000, with no deductible. Depending on the amount and size of     claims we receive under these programs, these product offerings     could harm our profitability. Similarly, in July 2006 we     announced pricing and product changes related to our store     inventory format that may reduce the revenue and profits of that     format. In addition, certain competitors may offer or continue     to offer free shipping or other transaction related services,     which could be impractical or inefficient for eBay users to     match. New technologies may increase the competitive pressures     by enabling our competitors to offer a lower cost service.         Although we have established Internet traffic arrangements with     several large online services and search engine companies, these     arrangements may not be renewed on commercially reasonable terms     or these companies may decide to promote competitive services.     Even if these arrangements are renewed, they may not result in     increased usage of our services. In addition, companies that     control user access to transactions through network access,     Internet browsers, or search engines, could promote our     competitors, channel current or potential users to their     vertically integrated electronic commerce sites or their     advertisers sites, attempt to restrict our access, or     charge us substantial fees for inclusion. Search engines may     increasingly become a starting point for online shopping, and as     the costs of operating an online store decline, online sellers     may increasingly sell goods through multiple channels, which     could reduce the number and value of transactions these sellers     conduct through our sites.     PayPal         The market for PayPals product is emerging, intensely     competitive, and characterized by rapid technological change.     PayPal competes with existing online and off-line payment     methods, including, among others:                         credit card merchant processors that offer their services to     online merchants, including Cardservice International, Chase     Paymentech, First Data, iPayment and Wells Fargo; and payment     gateways, including CyberSource and Authorize.net;                    money remitters such as MoneyGram and Western Union;                    bill payment services, including CheckFree;          30    Table of Contents                         processors that provide online merchants the ability to offer     their customers the option of paying for purchases from their     bank account, including Certegy, PayByTouch and TeleCheck, a     subsidiary of First Data, or to pay on credit, including Bill Me     Later;                    providers of traditional payment methods, particularly credit     cards, checks, money orders, and Automated Clearing House     transactions;                    issuers of stored value targeted at online payments, including     VisaBuxx, NetSpend and Next Estate; and                    Google Checkout, which enables the online payment of merchants     using credit cards.           Some of these competitors have longer operating histories,     significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, customer     service and other resources, greater name recognition, or a     larger base of customers in affiliated businesses than PayPal.     PayPals competitors may respond to new or emerging     technologies and changes in customer requirements faster and     more effectively than PayPal. They may devote greater resources     to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services     than PayPal, and they may offer lower prices. For example,     Google Checkout recently extended its free payment processing     promotion through the end of 2007. Promotions such as this may     force PayPal to lower its prices in response. Competing services     tied to established banks and other financial institutions may     offer greater liquidity and engender greater consumer confidence     in the safety and efficacy of their services than PayPal.         Overseas, PayPal faces competition from similar channels and     payment methods. In each country, numerous banks provide     standard online credit card acquiring and processing services,     and these banks typically have leading market share. In     addition, PayPal faces competition from Visas Visa Direct,     MasterCards MoneySend, and Royal Bank of Scotlands     World Pay and Webpay Internationals Click & Buy     in the European Community, NOCHEX, Moneybookers, NETeller and     FirePay in the United Kingdom, CertaPay and HyperWallet in     Canada, Paymate in Australia, Alipay and 99Bill in China and     Inicis in South Korea. In addition, in certain countries, such     as Germany and Australia, electronic funds transfer is a leading     method of payment for both online and offline transactions. As     in the U.S., established banks and other financial institutions     that do not currently offer online payments could quickly and     easily develop such a service.     Skype         The market for Skypes products is also emerging, intensely     competitive, and characterized by rapid technological change.     Many traditional telecommunications carriers and cable providers     offer, or have indicated that they plan to offer, VoIP products     or services that compete with the software Skype provides. In     addition, many established Internet companies, including AOL,     Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo, as well as newer companies, offer,     or have indicated that they plan to offer in the near future,     products that are similar to Skypes. We expect competitors     to continue to improve the performance of their current products     and introduce new products, software, services, and     technologies. If Skypes competitors successfully introduce     new products or enhance their existing products, this could     reduce the market for Skypes products, increase price     competition, or make Skypes products obsolete, which could     lower Skypes adoption rates, decrease its ability to     attract new users or cause its current users to migrate to a     competing company. In addition, some of Skypes     competitors, such as telecommunications carriers and cable     television providers, may be able to bundle services and     products that Skype does not offer. These could include various     forms of wireless communications, voice and data services,     Internet access, and cable television. This form of bundling     would put Skype at a competitive disadvantage if these providers     can combine a variety of service offerings at a single     attractive price. Furthermore, competitors may choose to make     their services interoperable with one another, rather than     proprietary, which could increase the attractiveness of their     services relative to Skype and decrease the value of     Skypes network of users.         Many of Skypes current and potential competitors have     longer operating histories, are substantially larger, and have     greater financial, marketing, technical, and other resources.     Some also have greater name recognition and a larger installed     base of customers than Skype has. As a result of their greater     resources, many current and potential competitors may be able to     lower their prices substantially, thereby eroding some or all of     Skypes cost advantage.        31    Table of Contents     Our     operations in China are subject to risks and uncertainties     relating to the laws and regulations of the Peoples     Republic of China.         Our operations in the Peoples Republic of China, or PRC,     are conducted through our EachNet subsidiary, a recently     announced joint venture between EachNet and Tom Online, and a     PayPal subsidiary. EachNet and PayPal are Delaware corporations     and foreign persons under the laws of the PRC are subject to     many of the risks of doing business internationally described     above in There are many risks associated with our     international operations. The PRC currently regulates its     Internet sector through regulations restricting the scope of     foreign investment and through the enforcement of content     restrictions on the Internet. While many aspects of these     regulations remain unclear, they purport to limit and require     licensing of various aspects of the provision of Internet     information services. These regulations have created substantial     uncertainties regarding the legality of foreign investments in     PRC Internet companies, including the entities through which we     do business in the PRC, and the business operations of such     companies. In order to meet local ownership and regulatory     licensing requirements, EachNet is operated through a     foreign-owned enterprise indirectly owned by eBays     European operating entity, which acts in cooperation with a     local PRC company owned by certain local employees. The PayPal     China website is operated through a foreign-owned enterprise     owned by a PayPal subsidiary, which acts in cooperation with a     local PRC company owned by certain local employees. We believe     the current ownership structures of EachNet, the joint venture     between EachNet and Tom Online, and PayPal comply with all     existing PRC laws, rules, and regulations. There are, however,     substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of     current PRC laws and regulations, and it is possible that the     PRC government will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. The     Peoples Bank of China, or PBOC, has recently proposed     guidelines for payment settlement organizations which may     require PayPal to identify and negotiate a new business     relationship to act in cooperation with a local PRC entity that     is not owned by local employees and has a substantial operating     history, and to obtain prior approval of the relationship from     the PBOC. There are also uncertainties regarding EachNets     and PayPals ability to enforce contractual relationships     they have entered into with respect to management and control of     the companys business. If any of the entities through     which we do business in the PRC were found to be in violation of     any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, they could be     subject to fines and other financial penalties, have their     business and Internet content provider licenses revoked, or be     forced to discontinue business entirely. In addition, any     finding of a violation of PRC laws or regulations by any of the     entities through which we do business in the PRC could make it     more difficult for us to launch new or expanded services in the     PRC.         Although Skype does not conduct operations in the PRC directly,     it makes its software available through a joint venture with Tom     Online and its software is used by residents of the PRC. PRC     regulations surrounding VoIP telephony are unclear and the PRC     or one or more of its provinces may adopt regulations or enforce     existing regulations that restrict or prohibit the use of     Skypes software.     Our     business may be adversely affected by factors that cause our     users to spend less time on our websites, including seasonal     factors, national events and increased usage of other     websites.         Anything that diverts our users from their customary level of     usage of our websites could adversely affect our business. We     would therefore be adversely affected by geopolitical events     such as war, the threat of war, or terrorist activity, and     natural disasters, such as hurricanes or earthquakes. Similarly,     our results of operations historically have been seasonal     because many of our users reduce their activities on our     websites with the onset of good weather during the summer     months, and on and around national holidays. In addition,     increased usage of social networking or other entertainment     websites may decrease the amount of time users spend on our     websites, which could adversely affect our financial results.     We     depend on the continued growth of online commerce and     communications.         The business of selling goods over the Internet, particularly     through online trading, is dynamic and relatively new. Concerns     about fraud, privacy, and other problems may discourage     additional consumers from adopting the Internet as a medium of     commerce. In countries such as the U.S. and Germany, where our     services and online commerce generally have been available for     some time and the level of market penetration of our services is     high, acquiring new users for our services may be more difficult     and costly than it has been in the past. In order to expand our     user base, we must appeal to and acquire consumers who     historically have used traditional means of commerce        32    Table of Contents       to purchase goods. If these consumers prove to be less active     than our earlier users, and we are unable to gain efficiencies     in our operating costs, including our cost of acquiring new     customers, our business could be adversely impacted.         The success of Skype depends on continued growth in its number     of users, which in turn depends on wider public acceptance of     VoIP. The VoIP communications medium is still in its early     stages, and it may not develop a broad audience. Skype users may     be required to purchase computer headsets, or leave a personal     computer on to communicate, and they may believe that the price     advantage for VoIP is insufficient to justify the perceived     inconvenience. Potential users may also view more familiar     online communication methods, such as     e-mail or     instant messaging, as sufficient for their communications needs.     Managers of some large private branch exchange, or PBX, systems     in businesses, universities, government agencies, and other     institutions may refuse to allow the use of Skype due to     concerns over security, server usage, or for other reasons. If     VoIP does not achieve wide public acceptance, our Skype business     will be adversely affected.     Our     business depends on the development and maintenance of the     Internet infrastructure.         The success of our services will depend largely on the     development and maintenance of the Internet infrastructure. This     includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the     necessary speed, data capacity, and security, as well as timely     development of complementary products, for providing reliable     Internet access and services. The Internet has experienced, and     is likely to continue to experience, significant growth in the     numbers of users and amount of traffic. The Internet     infrastructure may be unable to support such demands. In     addition, increasing numbers of users, increasing bandwidth     requirements, or problems caused by viruses,     worms, and similar programs may harm the performance     of the Internet. The backbone computers of the Internet have     been the targets of such programs. The Internet has experienced     a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to     portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and     delays in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the     level of Internet usage generally as well as the level of usage     of our services.     We may     be unable to protect or enforce our own intellectual property     rights adequately.         We regard the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents,     domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets as critical to our     success. We aggressively protect our intellectual property     rights by relying on a combination of trademark, copyright,     patent, trade dress and trade secret laws, and through the     domain name dispute resolution system. We also rely on     contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in     products and services. We have entered into confidentiality and     invention assignment agreements with our employees and     contractors, and confidentiality agreements with parties with     whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and     disclosure of our proprietary information. These contractual     arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our     intellectual property may not prevent misappropriation of our     technology or deter independent development of similar     technologies by others. We pursue the registration of our domain     names, trademarks, and service marks in the U.S. and     internationally. Effective trademark, copyright, patent, domain     name, trade dress, and trade secret protection is very expensive     to maintain and may require litigation. We must protect our     trademarks, patents, and domain names in an increasing number of     jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be     successful in every location. For example, Skype is in the     process of applying to register the Skype name as a trademark     worldwide. In the EU, Skypes application is being opposed.     If this opposition to Skypes application were to be     successful, Skype might be forced to apply for trademark     registration in each individual EU country, resulting in     increased expenditures and damage to its business if its     application were rejected in individual countries. We have     licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future,     certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or     copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take     actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or     harm our reputation.        33    Table of Contents     We are     subject to the risks of owning real property.         We own real property, including land and buildings related to     our operations. We have little experience in managing real     property. Ownership of this property subjects us to risks,     including:                         the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs     associated with fixing any environmental problems;                    adverse changes in the value of these properties, due to     interest rate changes, changes in the neighborhoods in which the     properties are located, or other factors;                    the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply     with zoning, seismic, disability act, or other     requirements; and                    possible disputes with tenants, neighboring owners, or others.       Some     anti-takeover provisions may affect the price of our common     stock.         Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to     10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the     preferences, rights and privileges of those shares without any     further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the     holders of common stock may be harmed by rights granted to the     holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future.     Some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws     could have the effect of making it more difficult for a     potential acquirer to acquire a majority of our outstanding     voting stock. These include provisions that provide for a     classified board of directors, prohibit stockholders from taking     action by written consent and restrict the ability of     stockholders to call special meetings. We are also subject to     provisions of Delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any     business combination with any interested stockholder for a     period of three years from the date the person became an     interested stockholder, unless certain conditions are met. This     restriction could have the effect of delaying or preventing a     change of control.      ITEM 1B:  UNRESOLVED     STAFF COMMENTS          Not applicable.      ITEM 2:  PROPERTIES          We own and lease various properties in the United States and in     24 other countries around the world. We use the properties for     executive and administrative offices, data centers, product     development offices and customer service offices. Our corporate     headquarters of approximately 150,000 square feet are     located in San Jose, California. As of December 31,     2006, our owned and leased properties provided us with aggregate     square footage of approximately 1.5 million and     1.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2006,     the total square footage generally used by our Marketplaces,     Payments and Communications segments was approximately     1.7 million, 1.1 million and 100,000 respectively.         From time to time we consider various alternatives related to     our long-term facilities needs. While we believe our existing     facilities are adequate to meet our immediate needs, it may     become necessary to lease or acquire additional or alternative     space to accommodate any future growth.      ITEM 3:  LEGAL     PROCEEDINGS          In April 2001, two of our European subsidiaries, eBay GmbH and     eBay International AG, were sued by Montres Rolex S.A. and     certain of its affiliates in the regional court of Cologne,     Germany. The suit subsequently was transferred to the regional     court in Düsseldorf, Germany. Rolex alleged that our     subsidiaries were infringing Rolexs trademarks as a result     of users selling counterfeit Rolex watches through our German     website. The suit also alleged unfair competition. Rolex sought     an order enjoining the sale of Rolex-branded watches on the     website as well as damages. In December 2002, a trial was held     in the matter and the court ruled in favor of eBay on all causes     of action. Rolex appealed the ruling to the Higher Regional     Court of Düsseldorf, and the appeal was heard in October     2003. In February 2004, the court rejected Rolexs appeal     and ruled in our favor. Rolex appealed the ruling to the German     Federal Supreme Court, a hearing took place before that court in     December 2006, and a decision is        34    Table of Contents       expected in the first half of 2007. In September 2004, the     German Federal Supreme Court issued its written opinion in favor     of Rolex in a case involving an unrelated company, ricardo.de     AG, but somewhat comparable legal theories. Although it is not     yet clear what the ultimate effect of the reasoning of the     German Federal Supreme Courts ricardo.de decision will     have when applied to eBay, we believe the Courts decision     has resulted in an increase in similar litigation against us in     Germany, although we do not currently believe that it will     require a significant change in our business practices.         In August 2006, Louis Vuitton Malletier and Christian Dior     Couture filed two lawsuits in the Paris Court of Commerce     against eBay Inc. and eBay International AG. The complaint     alleges we have violated French tort law by negligently     broadcasting listings posted by third parties offering     counterfeit items bearing plaintiffs trademarks, and by     purchasing certain advertising keywords. The plaintiffs seek     approximately EUR 35 million in damages. In or about     September 2006 Parfums Christian Dior, Kenzo Parfums, Parfums     Givenchy, and Guerlain Société also filed a lawsuit in     the Paris Court of Commerce against eBay Inc. and eBay     International AG. The complaint alleges that we have interfered     with the selective distribution network plaintiffs have     set up in France and the European Union by allowing third     parties to post listings offering genuine perfumes and cosmetics     for sale on our sites. The plaintiffs in this suit seek     approximately EUR 9 million in damages and injunctive     relief. We filed our initial briefs responding to the first     complaint in February 2007, and initial briefs in response to     the second complaint are due in April 2007. We believe that we     have meritorious defenses to these suits and intend to defend     ourselves vigorously. Other luxury brand owners have also filed     suit against us or have threatened to do so.         In September 2001, MercExchange LLC filed a complaint against     us, our Half.com subsidiary and ReturnBuy, Inc. in the     U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia     (No. 2:01-CV-736)     alleging infringement of three patents (relating to online     consignment auction technology, multiple database searching and     electronic consignment systems) and seeking a permanent     injunction and damages (including treble damages for willful     infringement). Following a trial in 2003, the jury returned a     verdict finding that we had willfully infringed the patents     relating to multiple database searching and electronic     consignment systems, and the court entered judgment for     MercExchange in the amount of approximately $30 million,     plus pre-judgment interest and post-judgment interest. In May     2006, following appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals for     the Federal Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court, the Supreme     Court remanded the case back to the district court for further     action. In parallel with the federal court proceedings, at our     request, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office agreed to     reexamine each of the patents in suit, finding that substantial     questions existed regarding the validity of the claims contained     in them. In separate actions in 2005, the Patent and Trademark     Office initially rejected all of the claims contained in the     three patents in suit. In March 2006, the Patent and Trademark     Office reiterated its earlier ruling rejecting the claims     contained in the patent that underlies the jury verdict, which     relates to electronic consignment systems. We have requested     that the district court stay all proceedings in the case pending     the final outcome of the reexamination proceedings, and     MercExchange has renewed its request that the district court     grant an injunction. The district court recently allowed     additional discovery regarding these matters, and final briefs     regarding both claims are due in March 2007. Even if successful,     our litigation of these matters will continue to be costly. As a     precautionary measure, we have modified certain functionality of     our websites and business practices in a manner which we believe     avoids any infringement of the consignment patent. For this     reason, we believe that any injunction that might be issued by     the district court will not have any impact on our business. We     also believe we have appropriate reserves for this litigation.     Nonetheless, if the modifications to the functionality of our     websites and business practices are not sufficient to make them     non-infringing, we would likely be forced to pay significant     additional damages and licensing fees     and/or     modify our business practices in an adverse manner.         In June 2006, Net2Phone, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the     U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey     (No. 06-2469)     alleging that eBay Inc., Skype Technologies S.A., and Skype Inc.     infringed five patents owned by Net2Phone relating to     point-to-point     Internet protocol. The suit seeks an injunction against     continuing infringement, unspecified damages, including treble     damages for willful infringement, and interest, costs, and fees.     We have filed an answer and counterclaims asserting that the     patents are invalid, unenforceable, and not infringed. The     parties are in the process of conducting discovery, and we     expect a trial date to be scheduled for 2008. We believe that we     have meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves     vigorously.         In August 2006, Peer Communications Corporation filed a lawsuit     in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of     Texas     (No. 6-06CV-370)     alleging that eBay Inc., Skype Technologies S.A., and Skype Inc.     infringed two        35    Table of Contents       patents owned by Peer Communications relating to uniform network     access. The suit seeks an injunction against continuing     infringement, unspecified damages, and interest, costs, and     fees. The parties are in the process of conducting discovery,     and a trial date has been scheduled for October 2008. We believe     that we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves     vigorously.         In September 2006, Mangosoft Intellectual Property, Inc. filed a     lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District     of Texas     (No. 2-06CV-390)     alleging that eBay Inc., Skype Technologies S.A., and Skype     Software S.a.r.l. infringed a patent owned by Mangosoft relating     to dynamic directory services. The suit seeks an injunction     against continuing infringement, unspecified damages, and     interest, costs, and fees. We have filed an answer and     counterclaims asserting that the patents are invalid,     unenforceable, and not infringed. We expect to receive the     courts scheduling order shortly. We believe that we have     meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.         Other third parties have from time to time claimed, and others     may claim in the future, that we have infringed their     intellectual property rights. We are subject to additional     patent disputes, and expect that we will increasingly be subject     to patent infringement claims as our services expand in scope     and complexity. In particular, we expect that we may face     additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects     of our Payments and Communications businesses. We have in the     past been forced to litigate such claims. We may also become     more vulnerable to third-party claims as laws such as the     Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Lanham Act and the     Communications Decency Act are interpreted by the courts, and as     we expand geographically into jurisdictions where the underlying     laws with respect to the potential liability of online     intermediaries like ourselves are either unclear or less     favorable. We believe that additional lawsuits alleging that we     have violated copyright or trademark laws will be filed against     us, especially in Europe. Intellectual property claims, whether     meritorious or not, are time consuming and costly to resolve,     could require expensive changes in our methods of doing     business, or could require us to enter into costly royalty or     licensing agreements.         From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or     regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of     business. The number and significance of these disputes and     inquiries are increasing as our business expands and our company     grows larger. Any claims or regulatory actions against us,     whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in     costly litigation, require significant amounts of management     time, and result in the diversion of significant operational     resources.

The following     table sets forth the high and low per share prices of our common     stock (after giving retroactive effect to all previous stock     splits for the periods indicated), as reported by The Nasdaq     Global Select Market.

Dividend     Policy         We have never paid cash dividends on our stock and currently     anticipate that we will continue to retain any future earnings     for the foreseeable future.     Equity     Compensation Plan Information         The following table gives information about shares of our common     stock that may be issued upon the exercise of options, warrants     and rights under all of our existing equity compensation plans     as of December 31, 2006, including our 1996 Stock Option     Plan, 1997 Stock Option Plan, 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan,     1998 Equity Incentive Plan, 1998 Directors Stock Option     Plan, 1999 Global Equity Incentive Plan, 2001 Equity Incentive     Plan, and 2003 Deferred Stock Unit Plan, as well as shares of     our common stock that may be issued under individual     compensation arrangements that were not approved by our     stockholders, also referred to as our non-plan grants. No     warrants are outstanding under any of the foregoing plans.

DSUs and restricted stock units represent     an unfunded, unsecured right to receive shares of eBay common     stock (or, in the case of DSUs, the equivalent value thereof in     cash or property), and the value of DSUs and restricted stock     units varies directly with the price of eBays common stock.          (2)        Because DSUs and restricted stock units  do not have an exercise     price, the 36,056 shares of our common stock issuable     pursuant to DSUs under our 2003 Deferred Stock Unit Plan and     508,150 shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to     restricted stock units under our 1998 Equity Incentive Plan are     not included in the calculation of weighted average exercise     price.          (3)        Includes 5,575,774 shares of our common stock remaining     reserved for future issuance under our 1998 Employee Stock     Purchase Plan, or the ESPP, as of December 31, 2006. Our     ESPP contains an evergreen provision that     automatically increases, on each January 1, the number of     securities reserved for issuance under the ESPP by the number of     shares purchased under the ESPP in the preceding calendar year,     provided that the aggregate number of shares reserved for     issuance under the ESPP may not exceed 36,000,000 shares.     As of December 31, 2006, an aggregate amount of     9,785,222 shares had been purchased under the ESPP since     its inception. An aggregate amount of 1,624,226 shares was     purchased under the ESPP in 2006, and the number of securities     available for issuance under the ESPP was increased by that     number on January 1, 2007, bringing the total number of     shares reserved for future issuance on January 1, 2007 to     7,200,000. None of our other equity compensation plans has an     evergreen provision.          (4)        Does not include: (i) 7,050 shares of our common     stock, with a weighted average exercise price of $2.73 per     share, to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options assumed     by us under the Half.com, Inc. 1999 Equity Compensation Plan;     (ii) 37,726 shares of our common stock, with a     weighted average exercise price of $0.77 per share, to be     issued upon exercise of outstanding options assumed by us under     the X.com Corporation 1999 Stock Plan;     (iii) 494,108 shares of our common stock, with a     weighted average exercise price of $9.14 per share, to be     issued upon exercise of outstanding options assumed by us under     the PayPal, Inc. 2001 Equity Incentive Plan;     (iv) 184,562 shares of our common stock, with a     weighted average exercise price of $9.47 per share, to be     issued upon exercise of outstanding options assumed by us under     the Shopping.com Ltd. 2003 Omnibus Stock Option and Restricted     Stock Incentive Plan; (v) 944,682 shares of our common     stock, with a weighted average exercise price of $36.30 per     share, to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options assumed     by us under the Shopping.com Ltd. 2004 Equity Incentive Plan; or     (vi) 1,118,794 shares of our common stock, with a     weighted average exercise price of $3.88 per share, to be     issued upon exercise of outstanding options assumed by us under     the Skype Technologies S.A. Stock Option Plan Rules. All of the     options and related plans referenced above were assumed by us in     connection with acquisitions. We cannot make subsequent grants     or awards of our equity securities under any of these plans.     Prior to each acquisition, the stockholders of the acquired     company approved the acquired companys plan. Our     stockholders, however, did not approve any of the plans in     connection with the acquisitions.          The only outstanding non-plan grant as of December 31, 2006     relates to an individual compensation arrangement that was made     prior to the initial public offering of our common stock in     1998. At the time of this non-plan grant, members of our Board     of Directors, or Board, and their affiliates beneficially owned     in excess of 90% of our then outstanding equity and voting     interests. This non-plan grant was initially disclosed in our     initial public offering prospectus filed with the SEC on     September 25, 1998 under the headings     Management  Director Compensation and      Compensation Arrangements. Except as set     forth below, the terms and conditions of this non-plan grant are     identical to the terms of options granted under our 1997 Stock     Option Plan, a copy of which was filed as an exhibit to our     S-1     Registration Statement     (No. 33-59097)     filed in connection with our initial public offering.         The outstanding non-plan grant involved the Boards grant     of an option to purchase 3,600,000 shares of our common     stock at an exercise price of $0.39 to Scott Cook upon his     joining our Board in June 1998 as an independent director. These     options granted to Mr. Cook were non-qualified options and     were immediately exercisable, with a term of 10 years.     These options fully vested in June 2002. Mr. Cook exercised     options to purchase 480,000 shares in        38    Table of Contents       2002, exercised options to purchase 1,430,000 shares in     2003, exercised options to purchase 307,272 shares during     2005 and exercised options to purchase 614,544 shares     during 2006. As of December 31, 2006, options to purchase     768,184 shares remain outstanding under the non-plan grant.     Performance     Measurement Comparison         The graph below shows the cumulative total stockholder return of     an investment of $100 (and the reinvestment of any dividends     thereafter) on December 31, 2001 in (i) our common     stock, (ii) the Nasdaq National Market Index,     (iii) the S&P 500 Index and (iv) the GSTI Internet     Index. We were added to the S&P 500 Index on July 19,     2002. The GSTI Internet Index is a modified-capitalization     weighted index of 14 stocks representing the Internet industry,     including Internet content and access providers, Internet     software and service companies and     e-commerce     companies.

The stock repurchase program was     announced in July 2006. Under this program, in 2006, we     repurchased approximately 54.5 million shares at an average     price of $30.56 per share. As of December 31, 2006,     $333 million remained available for further purchases under     this program. In January 2007, our Board authorized the     expansion of the stock repurchase program to provide for the     repurchase of up to an additional $2.0 billion of our     common stock by January 2009.

These results include acquired company results of operations     beginning on the date of acquisition. See Note 3 in the     notes to the consolidated financial statements, included     elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form     10-K, for a     summary of recent significant acquisitions. Certain prior year     amounts have been reclassified to conform to current years     presentation.          (2)        Net income for 2006 included stock-based compensation expense     under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards     (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004),     Share-Based Payment (FAS 123(R)) of     $219.8 million, net of tax. Because we implemented     FAS 123(R) as of January 1, 2006, prior periods do not     reflect stock-based compensation expense related to this new     accounting standard. See Note 12      Stock-Based Plans to the consolidated financial statements     included in this report.          (3)        The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle     arises from the adoption of FIN 46, Consolidation of     Variable Interest Entities.          (4)        Includes a lease obligation totaling $122.5 million that     was reclassified as short-term in 2004 as the lease expired on     March 1, 2005, at which time we purchased the facility.          (5)        Working capital is calculated as the difference between total     current assets and total current liabilities.

We operate three primary business segments, Marketplaces,     Payments and Communications. We provide online marketplaces for     the sale of goods and services, online payments services and     online communication offerings to a diverse community of     individuals and businesses. Our Marketplaces segment provides     the infrastructure to enable online commerce in a variety of     platforms, including the traditional eBay.com platform, along     with our other online platforms, such as Shopping.com,     classifieds websites and Rent.com. Our wide array of     marketplaces websites brings together millions of buyers and     sellers every day on a local, national and international basis.     Our Payments segment, which consists of PayPal, enables     individuals or businesses to securely, easily and quickly send     and receive payments online. Our Communications segment, which     consists of Skype, enables VoIP calls between Skype users, and     also provides Skype users low-cost connectivity to traditional     fixed-line and mobile telephones.     Executive     Operating and Financial Summary     Our focus     is on key operating and financial metrics         Members of our senior management team regularly review key     operating metrics such as registered users, active users,     listings, gross merchandise volume, eBay stores, total accounts,     active accounts, total number of payments, total payment volume,     and transaction rates. Members of our senior management also     regularly review key financial information including net     revenues, operating income margins, earnings per share, cash     flows from operations and free cash flows, which we define as     operating cash flows less purchases of property and equipment,     net. These operating and financial measures allow us to monitor     the health and vibrancy of our Marketplaces, Payments, and     Communications segments and the profitability of our business     and to evaluate the effectiveness of investments that we have     made and continue to make in the areas of marketing, product     development, international expansion, customer support and site     operations. We believe that an understanding of these key     operating and financial measures and how they change over time     is important to investors, analysts and other parties analyzing     our business results and future market opportunities.     2006     summary         In 2006, we generated nearly $6.0 billion in net revenues,     representing a 31%     year-over-year     growth rate; we earned nearly $1.4 billion in operating     income; and we closed the year with $3.5 billion in cash,     cash equivalents and investments after taking into account the     repurchase of approximately 54.5 million shares of our     common stock for an aggregate purchase price of     $1.7 billion. During 2006, we focused on integrating the     businesses we acquired in 2005, which allowed us to strengthen     our leadership position in each of our three key business areas     in the U.S. and abroad. We expanded our user base in all three     business segments, and as of December 31, 2006 we had     222 million eBay registered users; 133 million PayPal     accounts; and 171 million Skype registered users.     Our     expectations for growth         We expect that growth in our net revenues during 2007 will     result primarily from increased net transaction revenues across     our Marketplaces, Payments and Communications segments. We     expect to continue our investments in the areas of product     development, customer support and international expansion across     all segments. We believe these investments are necessary to     support the long-term demands of our growing business. In     addition, to the extent that the U.S. dollar fluctuates     against foreign currencies, and, in particular, the Euro,     British pound and Korean won, the remeasurement of these foreign     currency denominated transactions into U.S. dollars will     impact our consolidated net revenues and, to the extent that     they are not hedged successfully, our net income.         The discussion of our consolidated financial results contained     herein is intended to assist those reading this report to better     understand the key operating and financial measures summarized     above as well as the changes in our consolidated results of     operations from year to year, and the primary factors that     accounted for those changes.        43    Table of Contents     Seasonality         The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, our     total net revenues and the sequential quarterly growth of these     net revenues.

(10)        Cumulative number of unique user accounts created on Skype.          Our net transaction revenues from our Marketplaces segment are     derived primarily from listing, feature and final value fees     paid by sellers and lead referral fees. For our Payments     segment, net transaction revenues are generated primarily by     fees from payment processing services. Our Communications     segment primarily generates net transaction revenues from fees     charged to users to connect Skypes VoIP network to     traditional telecommunication networks. These fees are charged     on a per minute basis and we refer to these minutes as SkypeOut     minutes. Net revenues from advertising are derived principally     from the sale of advertisements for cash and through barter     arrangements. Other net revenues are derived principally from     contractual arrangements with third parties that provide     transaction services to eBay and PayPal users and interest     earned from banks on certain PayPal customer account balances.       46    Table of Contents   Marketplaces     Net Transaction Revenues         Total net transaction revenues from Marketplaces increased 24%     in 2006 and 36% in 2005, compared to the respective prior year.     The growth in net transaction revenues was the result of     increased auction transaction activity, reflected in the growth     of the number of registered users, active users, listings and     gross merchandise volume.         The number of registered users increased 23% during 2006 to     221.6 million at December 31, 2006. The number of     registered users increased 33% during 2005 to 180.6 million at     December 31, 2005. The number of active users on eBay.com     increased 14% during 2006 to 81.8 million at     December 31, 2006. Active users increased 28% during 2005     to 71.8 million at December 31, 2005. We believe that     increases in user activity are largely the result of our     promotional efforts, our emphasis on helping our user community     be successful through the introduction of new site features and     functionality, our international expansion, and expanded trust     and safety programs.         The number of items listed on eBay.coms platforms     increased 26% to 2.4 billion in 2006, from 1.9 billion     in 2005, and increased 33% in 2005 from 1.4 billion in     2004. This percentage growth in listings was experienced across     our U.S. and international platforms. The number of stores     increased by 55% and 51% in 2006 and 2005, compared to the     respective prior year, due to the cost effective nature for     sellers to list items on our eBay Stores format.         Gross merchandise volume increased 18% in 2006 and 30% in 2005,     compared to the respective prior year. The increases in 2006 and     2005 resulted from the domestic and international growth in the     number of registered users, active users and listings. In     addition, there was gross merchandise volume growth across all     major categories, with the motors, consumer electronics,     clothing & accessories, computers, home &     garden, books/movies/music, sports, and collectibles categories     having the most significant dollar impact.         Marketplaces net transaction revenues earned internationally     totaled $2.1 billion in 2006, $1.7 billion in 2005 and     $1.2 billion in 2004, representing 50%, 49% and 46% of     total Marketplaces net transaction revenues, respectively.     Marketplaces net revenues were positively impacted by foreign     currency translation of approximately $30.6 million and     $6.7 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Changes in     foreign currency rates will impact our operating results and, to     the extent that the U.S. dollar strengthens, our foreign     currency denominated net revenues will be negatively impacted.         In 2007, we expect Marketplaces net transaction revenues to     continue to increase due to continued growth in the global     e-commerce     market.     Payments     Net Transaction Revenues         Payments net transaction revenues increased 40% in 2006 and 47%     in 2005, compared to the respective prior year. Payments net     transaction revenues as a percentage of total net transaction     revenues were 24% in 2006, 23% in 2005, and 21% in 2004. During     2006, over $37.8 billion in total payment volume was     transacted on the PayPal platform as compared to     $27.5 billion during 2005 and $18.9 billion during     2004. As of December 31, 2006, PayPal had     133.0 million accounts, compared to 96.2 million at     December 31, 2005 and 63.8 million accounts at     December 31, 2004. Net transaction revenues as a percentage     of total payment volume was 4% in all years presented.         The growth in our Payments net transaction revenues, in all     years, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total net     transaction revenues, was primarily the result of increases in     PayPal transaction volume driven by the growth in PayPal     Merchant Services transactions, the higher penetration of PayPal     in the Marketplaces platforms and growth in gross merchandise     volume in the Marketplaces segment.         In 2006, our global Merchant Services total payment volume     increased 59% compared to 2005, generating total payment volume     of $13.3 billion. In 2005, our global Merchant Services     total payment volume increased 48% compared to 2004, generating     total payment volume of $8.4 billion. Furthermore, the growth in     Payments net transactions revenues in 2006 was positively     affected by PayPals continued penetration of Marketplaces     transactions which increased to 57.2% in 2006 from 52.7% in 2005     and 46.7% in 2004. Payments net transaction revenues have grown     in connection with the increase in our Marketplaces gross     merchandise volume which increased to $52.5 billion in 2006     compared to $44.3 billion in 2005 and $34.2 billion in 2004.        47    Table of Contents         Net transaction revenues from Payments earned internationally     totaled $533.2 million in 2006, $364.5 million in 2005     and $207.6 million in 2004, representing 38.0%, 36.4% and     30.5% of total Payments segment net transaction revenues,     respectively. Payments net revenues were positively impacted by     foreign currency translation of approximately $4.3 million     and $5.3 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Changes in     foreign currency rates will impact our operating results and, to     the extent that the U.S. dollar strengthens, our foreign     currency denominated net revenues will be negatively impacted.         In 2007, we expect the Payments net transaction revenues to     increase in total and for net transaction revenues earned     internationally to increase in total and as a percentage of     Payments net transaction revenues. We expect to grow our     merchant service business and continue to drive higher     penetration rates on Marketplaces platforms. We also expect that     Payments net transaction revenues will increase as a percentage     of total net transaction revenues in 2007.     Communications     Net Transaction Revenues         Communications net transaction revenues were $192.8 million     in 2006 as compared to $24.8 million in 2005 (net revenues     from the acquisition date of October 14, 2005 through the     end of 2005). The increase in net revenues was primarily due to     a full year of revenues generated from our VoIP offerings in     2006. The cumulative number of Skype registered users increased     to 171.2 million at December 31, 2006 from     74.7 million at December 31, 2005. Additionally,     SkypeOut minutes increased to 4.1 billion, which resulted     in $177.7 million in revenue in 2006. The growth was due to     rapid user expansion.         Net transaction revenues from Communications earned     internationally totaled $163.7 million in 2006 and     $21.4 million in 2005, representing 85% and 87% of total     Communications net transaction revenues, respectively.     Communications net revenue was positively impacted by foreign     currency translation of approximately $5.1 million in 2006.     Changes in foreign currency rates will impact our operating     results and, to the extent that the U.S. dollar     strengthens, our foreign currency denominated net revenues will     be negatively impacted.         We expect Communications net transaction revenues to increase     during 2007 as we expect to continue to increase both our user     base and product offerings.     Advertising     and Other Net Revenues         Advertising and other net revenues totaled $171.8 million     in 2006, $123.4 million in 2005 and $94.3 million in     2004. These amounts represented 3% of total net revenues for all     years presented. We continue to view our business as primarily     transaction-driven and we expect advertising and other net     revenues to continue to represent a relatively small proportion     of total net revenues during 2007.        48    Table of Contents     Summary     of cost of net revenues, operating expenses, non-operating items     and provision for income taxes         The following table summarizes changes in cost of net revenues,     sales and marketing expense, product development expense,     general and administrative expense, amortization of acquired     intangible assets, interest and other income, net, interest     expense, provision for income taxes and minority interest (note     that 2006 amounts reflect the modified prospective adoption of     FAS 123(R)):                                                                                                                     Change from            Change from                  Year Ended December 31,           2004 to 2005           2005 to 2006                 2004           2005           2006           In dollars           In %           In dollars           In %                 (In thousands, except percentages)               Cost of net revenues                 $       614,415               $       818,104               $       1,256,792               $       203,689                   33       %               438,688                   54       %      Sales and marketing                     815,464                   1,185,929                   1,619,857                   370,465                   45       %               433,928                   37       %      Product development                     240,647                   328,191                   494,695                   87,544                   36       %               166,504                   51       %      General and administrative                     475,614                   649,529                   978,363                   173,915                   37       %               328,834                   51       %      Amortization of acquired     intangible assets                     65,927                   128,941                   197,078                   63,014                   96       %               68,137                   53       %      Interest and other income, net                     77,867                   111,148                   130,021                   33,281                   43       %               18,873                   17       %      Interest expense                     8,879                   3,478                   5,916                   (5,401       )               −61       %               2,438                   70       %      Provision for income taxes                     343,885                   467,285                   421,418                   123,400                   36       %               (45,867       )               −10       %      Minority interests                     6,122                   49                   4                   (6,073       )               −99       %               (45       )               −92       %             As of January 1, 2006, we began accounting for stock-based     compensation under FAS 123(R), which requires the     recognition of the fair value of stock-based compensation. We     adopted FAS 123(R) using the modified prospective method     which requires the application of the accounting standard as of     January 1, 2006. In accordance with the modified     prospective method, the consolidated financial statements for     2004 and 2005 have not been restated to reflect, and do not     include, the impact of FAS 123(R). Stock-based compensation     expense related to stock options and employee stock purchases     for 2004, 2005 and 2006 was allocated as follows (in thousands):                                                         2004           2005           2006               Cost of net revenues                 $       233               $       1,881               $       32,981          Sales and marketing                     136                   8,696                   96,547          Product development                     654                   6,468                   81,489          General and administrative                     4,809                   14,727                   106,393                                                                Total stock-based compensation     expense                     5,832                   31,772                   317,410          Tax benefit                     (4,117       )               (13,023       )               (97,572       )                                                            Stock-based compensation expense,     net of tax                 $       1,715               $       18,749               $       219,838                                                                       As of December 31, 2006, there was approximately     $418.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost,     excluding tax benefits, related to stock-based incentive awards     granted under our equity incentive plans. That cost is expected     to be recognized over a weighted-average period of three years.     Cost     of Net Revenues                                                         2004           2005           2006                 (In thousands, except percentages)               Cost of net revenues                 $       614,415               $       818,104               $       1,256,792          As a percentage of net revenues                     18.8       %               18.0       %               21.1       %             Cost of net revenues consists primarily of costs associated with     payment processing, customer support and site operations, and     Skype telecommunications costs. Significant cost components     include bank charges, credit card interchange and assessments,     other payment processing costs, employee compensation,     consultant costs and        49    Table of Contents       facilities costs for our customer support and site operations,     depreciation of equipment and amortization of capitalized     product development costs and telecommunication costs.         The increase in cost of net revenues of $438.7 million     during 2006 was primarily due to an increase in payment     processing costs, Skype telecommunication costs, the development     and expansion of our customer support and site operations     infrastructure, and the effect of stock-based compensation     expense related to employee stock options and employee stock     purchases under FAS 123(R). Payment processing costs     increased approximately $114.5 million, or 30%, in 2006     compared to the prior year, due to the 37% increase in     PayPals total payment volume and increases in the     proportion of customer transactions funded with credit cards.     Skype telecommunications costs increased by $105.5 million     in 2006 compared to the prior year due to the inclusion of a     full year of Skypes costs. Aggregate customer support and     site operations costs (including stock-based compensation)     increased approximately $202.8 million, or 52%, in 2006     compared to the prior year. Expanding our global site and     support infrastructure contributed $161.2 million of this     increase as employee costs increased approximately     $44.7 million; we increased the use of contractors and     consultants by approximately $32.9 million; facility costs     increased approximately $28.9 million; and depreciation     expense associated with computer equipment and capitalized     software increased approximately $54.7 million. Stock-based     compensation expense of $33.0 million was included in cost     of revenues in 2006 compared to $1.9 million in 2005.     Stock-based compensation expense increased due to our     implementation of FAS 123(R) at the beginning of 2006.         The increase in cost of net revenues during 2005 was primarily     due to an increase in the volume of transactions on the     Marketplaces and Payments websites and continued development and     expansion of our customer support and site operations     infrastructure. Payment processing costs increased to     $403.1 million in 2005 from $305.1 million in 2004,     due to the increase in PayPals total payment volume and     increased payment processing costs related to the growth of our     Marketplaces activity. Aggregate customer support and site     operations costs increased approximately $88.4 million     during 2005, compared to the prior year.         Costs of net revenues are expected to increase in total and as a     percentage of net revenues during 2007 primarily due to growth     in Payments and Communications, each of which is growing faster     and has a lower gross margin than Marketplaces.     Sales     and Marketing                                                         2004           2005           2006                 (In thousands, except percentages)               Sales and marketing                 $       815,464               $       1,185,929               $       1,619,857          As a percentage of net revenues                     24.9       %               26.1       %               27.1       %             Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising     costs, marketing programs and employee compensation for sales     and marketing staff.         Sales and marketing expenses increased in total and increased as     a percentage of total net revenues in 2006 due to our continued     investment in growing our global user base and the effect of     stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock     options and employee stock purchases under FAS 123(R).     Growth in advertising and marketing costs as well as     employee-related costs comprised the majority of the increases.     Combined advertising and marketing costs increased     $250.5 million in 2006, compared to the prior year, due to     an increase in global television and online marketing campaigns.     Employee-related costs, not including stock-based compensation     expense, increased by $69.3 million in 2006 as we continued     to expand our domestic and international operations. Sales and     marketing staff increased from approximately 2,500 at     December 31, 2005 to approximately 2,700 at     December 31, 2006. Stock-based compensation expense of     $96.5 million was included in sales and marketing expense     in 2006 compared to $8.7 million in 2005. Stock-based     compensation expense increased due to our implementation of     FAS 123(R) at the beginning of 2006.         Sales and marketing expenses increased in total and increased as     a percentage of total net revenues in 2005 due to our continued     investment in growing our global user base. Growth in     advertising and marketing costs as well as employee-related     costs comprised the majority of the increases. Combined     advertising and marketing costs increased $228.8 million in     2005, compared to the prior year. This increase, both in dollars     and as a percentage of net revenues, was primarily the result of     international expansion and industry-wide increases in Internet        50    Table of Contents       marketing rates, partially offset by marketing efficiencies.     Employee-related costs increased by $97.4 million in 2005     as we continued to expand our domestic and international     operations.         Sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase in total     during 2007 because of expected increases in our online     marketing expense to attract new customers and increase user     activity across our businesses. Sales and marketing expenses as     a percentage of net revenues are expected to decrease during     2007 due to the growth in Payments and Communications, each of     which, has lower sales and marketing expenses than Marketplaces.     Product     Development                                                         2004           2005           2006                 (In thousands, except percentages)               Product development                 $       240,647               $       328,191               $       494,695          As a percentage of net revenues                     7.4       %               7.2       %               8.3       %             Product development expenses consist primarily of employee     compensation, consultant costs, facilities costs and     depreciation on equipment. Product development expenses are net     of required capitalization of major site and other product     development efforts, including the development of our next     generation platform architecture, migration of certain     platforms, seller tools and PayPal services integration     projects. These capitalized costs totaled $67.9 million in     2006, $37.1 million in 2005 and $41.3 million in 2004,     and are reflected as a cost of net revenues when amortized in     future periods.         The increase in product development expense of     $166.5 million during 2006 was primarily due to employees     added, including contractors and consultants, to support various     platform and software development initiatives in our     Marketplaces, Payments and Communications segments and the     effect of stock-based compensation expense related to employee     stock options and employee stock purchases under     FAS 123(R). Employee related and consultant costs,     excluding stock-based compensation, increased by approximately     $61.5 million in 2006 compared to the prior year. Our     product development staff increased from approximately 2,200 at     December 31, 2005 to approximately 2,500 at     December 31, 2006. Stock-based compensation expense of     $81.5 million was included in product development expense     in 2006 compared to $6.5 million in 2005. Stock-based     compensation expense increased due to our implementation of     FAS 123(R) at the beginning of 2006.         The increase in product development expenses in 2005, as     compared to the prior year, was primarily the result of     increased headcount to support various platform development     initiatives in our Marketplaces, Payments and Communications     segments. Employee related costs increased by $63.9 million     compared to the prior year. Our product development staff     increased nearly 50% from approximately 1,500 at     December 31, 2004 to approximately 2,200 at     December 31, 2005.         Product development expenses are expected to increase in total     and remain consistent as a percentage of net revenues in 2007,     as we develop new site features and functionality and continue     to improve and expand operations across all businesses.     General     and Administrative                                                         2004           2005           2006                 (In thousands, except percentages)               General and administrative                 $       475,614               $       649,529               $       978,363          As a percentage of net revenues                     14.5       %               14.3       %               16.4       %             General and administrative expenses consist primarily of     employee compensation, consultant costs, provisions for     transaction losses associated with our Payments segment,     facilities costs, depreciation of equipment, provision for     doubtful accounts, payroll taxes on employee stock options,     insurance and professional fees.         The increase in general and administrative expenses of     $328.8 million during 2006 was primarily due to increased     employee-related costs, consultant costs, higher Payments     transaction loss expenses, and the effect of stock-based     compensation expense related to employee stock options and     employee stock purchases under FAS 123(R). Employee-related     costs and consultant costs increased by approximately     $112.6 million during 2006 as compared to the prior year     due to our continued focus on user protection programs. We     increased our general and administrative employee headcount from     approximately 4,200 at December 31, 2005 to 4,900 at        51    Table of Contents       December 31, 2006, of which, approximately 450 employees     were added to support our consumer protection programs.     Transaction loss rate in our Payments segment, which is the     transaction loss expense as a percentage of total payment     volume, increased to 0.33% in 2006 compared to 0.27% in 2005,     causing an increase in expense of approximately     $52.7 million. The increase in the transaction loss rate     was primarily due to higher levels of credit card chargebacks     from unauthorized credit card transactions. The higher levels of     credit card chargebacks is due to strategically entering into     new customer segments (new countries and direct card processing)     which have higher loss rates. Stock-based compensation expense     of $106.4 million was included in general and     administrative expense in 2006 compared to $14.7 million in     2005. Stock-based compensation expense increased due to our     implementation of FAS 123(R) at the beginning of 2006.         General and administrative expenses increased in total and     remained consistent as a percentage of net revenues in 2005 as     compared to the prior year. The dollar increase was due     primarily to employee related and facilities costs.     Employee-related costs increased by approximately     $111.3 million during 2005 as compared to the prior year.     We increased our general and administrative employees from     approximately 2,700 at December 31, 2004 to approximately     4,200 at December 31, 2005. This increase related primarily     to the addition of employees in our trust and safety and     corporate functions. Facilities costs increased by approximately     $48.2 million during 2005 as compared to the prior year.     PayPals transaction loss expense increased by     approximately $23.3 million, to $73.8 million during     the year ended December 31, 2005, reflecting the increase     in activity in the Payments segment in addition to the expansion     of our PayPal Buyer Protection Program. PayPals     transaction loss expense rate, which is the transaction loss     expense as a percentage of PayPals total payment volume,     was constant at 0.27% in 2005 and 2004.         With our continued investment across all areas of our business     and related corporate functions, particularly in our consumer     protection programs, we expect general and administrative     expenses to increase during 2007, but decrease as a percentage     of net revenues as general and administrative expenses are     expected to grow slower than net revenues.     Amortization     of Acquired Intangible Assets                                                         2004           2005           2006                 (In thousands, except percentages)               Amortization of acquired     intangible assets                 $       65,927               $       128,941               $       197,078          As a percentage of net revenues                     2.0       %               2.8       %               3.3       %             From time to time we have purchased, and we expect to continue     purchasing, assets or businesses to accelerate category and     geographic expansion, increase the features, functions, and     formats available to our users and maintain a leading role in     online     e-commerce,     payments and communications. These purchase transactions     generally result in the creation of acquired intangible assets     with finite lives and lead to a corresponding increase in the     amortization expense in future periods. We amortize intangible     assets over the period of estimated benefit, using the     straight-line method and estimated useful lives ranging from one     to eight years. The increase in amortization of acquired     amortizable intangibles during 2006 and 2005 compared to prior     years is due to the business acquisitions consummated during     2006, 2005 and 2004.         Amortization of acquired intangible assets may increase should     we make additional acquisitions in the future.     Interest     and Other Income, Net                                                         2004           2005           2006                 (In thousands, except percentages)               Interest and other income, net                 $       77,867               $       111,148               $       130,021          As a percentage of net revenues                     2.4       %               2.4       %               2.2       %             Interest and other income, net consists primarily of interest     earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments as well as     foreign exchange transaction gains and losses and other     non-operating transactions.         Our interest and other income, net increased in total and     remained relatively constant as a percentage of net revenues     during 2006 as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result     of increased interest income due to increased cash, cash     equivalents and investments balances and higher interest rates     offset by the lower cash balances        52    Table of Contents       due to our stock repurchase activity in 2006. The     weighted-average interest rate of our portfolio increased to     3.8% in 2006 from 2.9% in 2005.         Our interest and other income, net increased in total and     remained consistent as a percentage of net revenues during 2005     as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of     increased interest income due to increased cash, cash     equivalents and investments balances and higher interest rates.     The weighted-average interest rate of our portfolio increased to     2.9% in 2005 from 1.7% in 2004.         We expect that interest and other income, net, will decline     slightly during 2007 compared to 2006, as a result of lower cash     balances due to our stock repurchase program. Our expectation     for interest and other income, net, for 2007 excludes the     potential effects from any future acquisitions we may make.     Interest     Expense                                                         2004           2005           2006                 (In thousands, except percentages)               Interest expense                 $       8,879               $       3,478               $       5,916          As a percentage of net revenues                     0.3       %               0.1       %               0.1       %             Interest expense consists of interest charges on tax     contingencies, legal accruals, capital leases and our     consolidated lease arrangement related to our San Jose     headquarters office facilities. In 2007, interest expense may be     impacted by our decision to utilize our line of credit. See     additional discussion of our line of credit in     Note 8  Commitments and     Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements     included elsewhere in this Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     Provision     for Income Taxes                                                         2004           2005           2006                 (In thousands, except percentages)               Provision for income taxes                 $       343,885               $       467,285               $       421,418          As a percentage of net revenues                     10.5       %               10.3       %               7.1       %      Effective tax rate                     30       %               30       %               27       %             The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed     by applying the statutory U.S. federal rate principally due     to state taxes, subsidiary losses for which we have not provided     a benefit and other factors that increase the effective tax     rate, offset by decreases resulting from foreign income with     lower effective tax rates and tax credits.         The lower effective tax rates in 2006 as compared to 2005 and     2004 resulted primarily from the expansion of our international     businesses and from changes in our operations in international     markets. We expect the effective tax rate for 2007 to be     consistent with 2006.     Impact     of Foreign Currency Translation         During 2006, 2005 and 2004, our international net revenues,     based upon the country in which the seller, payment recipient,     Skype users Internet protocol address, advertiser or other     service provider is located, accounted for approximately 48%,     46% and 42%, of our consolidated net revenues, respectively. The     growth in our international operations has increased our     exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Net revenues and     related expenses generated from most international locations are     denominated in the functional currencies of the local countries,     and primarily include Euros, British pounds, Korean won,     Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Chinese renminbi, and     Indian rupees. Our results of operations and certain of our     inter-company balances associated with our international     locations are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The     statements of income of our international operations are     translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates     in each applicable period. If the U.S. dollar weakens     against foreign currencies, the translation of these     foreign-currency-denominated transactions will result in     increased consolidated net revenues, operating expenses, and net     income. Similarly, our net revenues, operating expenses, and net     income will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against     foreign currencies.        53    Table of Contents         Net revenues were positively impacted by foreign currency     translation by approximately $40.1 million in 2006 and     $12.0 million in 2005 as compared to the same periods of     the prior year. Operating income was positively impacted by     foreign currency translation by approximately $14.4 million     in 2006 and $5.6 million in 2005, as compared to the same     periods of the prior year.         We expect our international operations will continue to grow in     significance. As a result, the impact of foreign currency     fluctuations in future periods could become more significant and     may have a negative impact on our consolidated net revenues and     net income in the event the U.S. dollar strengthens     relative to other currencies. See the information in     Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure     About Market Risk under the caption Foreign Currency     Risk for additional discussion of the impact of foreign     currency translation and related hedging activities.     Foreign     Currency Exposures         We are a rapidly growing company, with an increasing proportion     of our operations outside the United States. Accordingly, our     foreign currency exposures have increased substantially and are     expected to continue to grow. The objective of our foreign     exchange exposure management program is to identify material     foreign currency exposures and to manage these exposures to     minimize the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our     reported consolidated cash flow and results of operations.         Our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction, economic     and translation:     Transaction Exposure:  Around the world, we     have certain assets and liabilities, primarily receivables,     investments and accounts payable (including inter-company     transactions) that are denominated in currencies other than the     relevant entitys functional currency. In certain     circumstances, changes in the functional currency value of these     assets and liabilities create fluctuations in our reported     consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash     flows. We may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or     other instruments to minimize the short-term foreign currency     fluctuations on such assets and liabilities. The gains and     losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts offset the     transaction gains and losses on certain foreign currency     receivables, investments and payables recognized in earnings.     Economic Exposure:  We also have anticipated     future cash flows, including revenues and expenses, denominated     in currencies other than the relevant entitys functional     currency. Our primary economic exposures include future royalty     receivables, customer collections, and vendor payments. Changes     in the relevant entitys functional currency value will     cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive when     these cash flows are realized or settled. We may enter into     foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivatives to hedge     the value of a portion of these cash flows. We account for these     foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges. The effective     portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially     reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive     income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when     the transaction is settled.     Earnings Translation Exposure:  As our     international operations grow, fluctuations in the foreign     currencies create volatility in our reported results of     operations because we are required to consolidate the results of     operations of our foreign denominated subsidiaries. We may     decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other     instruments to offset the earnings impact of currency     fluctuations. Such contracts will be     marked-to-market     on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss will be     recorded in interest and other income, net.     Employee     Stock-Based Incentive Plans         We continue to believe that employee stock-based incentive plans     represent an appropriate and essential component of our overall     compensation program. We grant stock-based awards to     substantially all employees and believe that this broad-based     program helps us to attract, motivate, and retain high quality     employees, to the ultimate benefit of our stockholders. We     granted a limited number of restricted stock units and     restricted stock awards to employees during 2006. Stock options,     restricted stock units and restricted stock awards granted     during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, net of     cancellations/forfeitures, represented less than 2% of our total     common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2006 and 2005.     A substantial portion of our stock-based awards granted during     the year were granted to existing employees.        54    Table of Contents     Liquidity     and Capital Resources     Cash     Flows                                                         Year Ended December 31,                 2004           2005           2006                 (In thousands)               Consolidated Cash Flow     Data:                                                       Net cash provided by (used in):                                                            Operating activities                 $       1,285,315               $       2,009,891               $       2,247,791          Investing activities                     (2,013,220       )               (2,452,731       )               228,853          Financing activities                     647,669                   471,606                   (1,260,687       )      Effect of exchange rates on cash     and cash equivalents                     28,768                   (45,231       )               133,255                                                                Net increase (decrease) in cash     and cash equivalents                 $       (51,468       )           $       (16,465       )           $       1,349,212                                                                       We have generated annual cash provided by operating activities     in amounts greater than net income in 2006, 2005 and 2004 due     primarily to non-cash charges to earnings and the tax benefit on     the exercise of stock options. Non-cash charges to earnings     included stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization     on our long-term assets, provision for doubtful accounts and     authorized credits resulting from increasing revenues and the     provision for transaction losses related to PayPal.         Prior to adopting FAS 123(R), we presented all tax benefits     resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash     flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows.     FAS 123(R) requires cash flows resulting from excess tax     benefits to be classified as a part of cash flows from financing     activities. Excess tax benefits represent tax benefits related     to exercised options in excess of the associated deferred tax     asset for such options. As a result of adopting FAS 123(R),     $92.4 million of excess tax benefits for 2006 have been     reported as a cash inflow from financing activities. In     addition, as a substantial portion of the companys net     operating losses and carryforward credits have now been     utilized, cash will be required for tax payments in the     U.S. going forward. Total U.S. and foreign income tax     payments will be dependent on our taxable income and are     estimated to be in the range of $650-$700 million in 2007.     In 2007, we expect operating cash flows to increase, primarily     driven by higher net income.         The net cash provided by investing activities in 2006 was     primarily due to the movement of investments to cash and cash     equivalents to fund our stock repurchase program. The net cash     used in investing activities in 2005 and 2004 reflected     primarily the movement of cash and cash equivalents between cash     and cash equivalents and investments, the purchase of property     and equipment, and acquisitions. Purchases of property and     equipment, net totaled $515.4 million in 2006,     $338.3 million in 2005, and $292.8 million in 2004.     Purchases of property and equipment in 2006, 2005 and 2004     related mainly to purchases of computer equipment and software     to support our site operations, customer support and     international expansion. Cash expended for acquisitions, net of     cash acquired, totaled approximately $45.5 million in 2006,     $2.7 billion in 2005, and $1.0 billion in 2004. In     2006, net cash payments for acquisitions consisted of the cash     payment, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of     Tradera.com. In 2005, net cash payments for acquisitions     consisted primarily of the cash payment, net of cash acquired     for the acquisition of Rent.com, certain international     classifieds websites, Shopping.com, Skype and the payment     gateway business acquired from VeriSign. In 2004, our cash     acquisitions included the acquisition of mobile.de, Baazee.com,     and Marktplaats.nl, as well as an additional ownership interest     in Internet Auction Co. In 2007, we expect to continue to     purchase property and equipment and we may acquire businesses     with cash that would impact investing cash flows.         The net cash flows used in financing activities of     $1.3 billion in 2006 was primarily due to the repurchase of     approximately 54.5 million shares of common stock for an     aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.7 billion,     offset by the proceeds from stock options totaling     $313.5 million. Prior to 2006, we had not repurchased our     common stock under a stock repurchase program. The net cash     flows provided by financing activities in 2005 and 2004 were due     primarily to proceeds from stock option exercises. Proceeds from     stock option exercises totaled $599.8 million in 2005 and     $650.6 million in 2004. Our future cash flows from stock     options are difficult to project        55    Table of Contents       as such amounts are a function of our stock price, the number of     options outstanding and the decisions by employees to exercise     stock options. In general, we expect proceeds from stock option     exercises to increase during periods in which our stock price     has increased relative to historical levels. In July 2006, our     Board authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of     the companys common stock within two years from the date     of authorization. During 2006, we repurchased approximately     54.5 million shares of our common stock at an average price     of $30.56 per share for an aggregate purchase price of     $1.7 billion. As of December 31, 2006,     $0.3 billion remained available for further purchases under     this program. In January 2007, our Board authorized, and the     Company announced, an expansion of the stock repurchase program     to provide for the repurchase of up to an additional     $2.0 billion of our common stock over the next two years.     Share repurchases under our repurchase program may take a     variety of forms, including structured stock repurchase programs     and other derivative transactions. We expect to continue to     repurchase our common stock in 2007, thereby impacting financing     cash flows.         The positive effect of exchange rates on cash and cash     equivalents during 2006 and 2004 was due to the weakening of the     U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, primarily the     Euro. The negative effect of exchange rates on cash and cash     equivalents during 2005 was due to the strengthening of the     U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, primarily the     Euro.         In November 2006, we entered into a credit agreement which     provides for an unsecured $1 billion five-year revolving     credit facility. Loans under the credit agreement will bear     interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from     0.25 percent to 0.45 percent or (ii) a formula     based on the prime rate or on the federal funds effective rate.     Subject to certain conditions stated in the credit agreement, we     may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under the credit     facility at any time during the term of the credit agreement.     Funds borrowed under the credit agreement may be used for     working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other     general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we borrowed     against the line of credit in the amount of $160 million.         We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents and investments     of approximately $3.5 billion, together with cash generated     from operations and cash available through the existing credit     agreement, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities,     capital expenditures, stock repurchases and other obligations     for the foreseeable future.     Commitments     and Contingencies         We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments     that include future estimated payments. Changes in our business     needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates, and     other factors may result in actual payments differing from the     estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and     amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the     most significant assumptions used in our determination of     amounts presented in the tables, in order to assist in the     review of this information within the context of our     consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash     flows. The following table summarizes our fixed contractual     obligations and commitments (in thousands):                                                         Operating            Purchase                       Payments Due By Year Ending December 31,        Leases           Obligations           Total               2007                 $       44,178               $       180,633               $       224,811          2008                     41,536                   64,908                   106,444          2009                     35,637                   29,436                   65,073          2010                     29,476                   16,396                   45,872          2011                     25,420                   19,347                   44,767          Thereafter                     102,094                                      102,094                                                                           $       278,341               $       310,720               $       589,061                                                                       Operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under     our non-cancelable operating leases for office facilities, as     well as limited computer and office equipment that we utilize     under lease arrangements. The amounts presented are consistent     with contractual terms and are not expected to differ     significantly, unless a substantial change in our headcount     needs requires us to exit an office facility early or expand our     occupied space.        56    Table of Contents         Purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments     for advertising, capital expenditures (computer equipment,     software applications, engineering development services,     construction contracts) and other goods and services that were     entered into through our ordinary course of business. For those     contractual arrangements in which there are significant     performance requirements, we have developed estimates to project     expected payment obligations. These estimates have been     developed based upon historical trends, when available, and our     anticipated future obligations. Given the significance of such     performance requirements within our advertising and other     arrangements, actual payments could differ significantly from     these estimates.         In conjunction with our Skype acquisition, we have certain     earn-out payment commitments, not included in table above, that     are contingent upon Skype achieving certain net revenues, gross     profit margin-based targets and active user targets. See     Note 3  Business Combinations, Goodwill     and Intangible Assets of the consolidated financial     statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     Off-Balance     Sheet Arrangements         As of December 31, 2006, we had no off-balance sheet     arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a     current or future material effect on our consolidated financial     condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital     expenditures or capital resources. All customer funds held by     PayPal as an agent or custodian on behalf of our customers are     not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. These funds     include funds held in the U.S. that are deposited in bank     accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation     and funds that customers choose to invest in PayPals Money     Market Fund totaling approximately $1.5 billion and     $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,     respectively.     Indemnification     Provisions         In the ordinary course of business we have included limited     indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with     parties with whom we have commercial relations, including our     standard marketing, promotions and     application-programming-interface license agreements. Under     these contracts, we generally indemnify, hold harmless, and     agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or     incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by     any third party with respect to domain names, trademarks, logos     and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are     applicable to our performance under the subject agreement. In a     limited number of agreements, we have provided an indemnity for     other types of third-party claims, substantially all of which     are indemnities related to copyrights, trademarks, and patents.     In our PayPal business, we have provided an indemnity to our     payment processors in the event of certain third-party claims or     card association fines against the processor arising out of     conduct by PayPal. It is not possible to determine the maximum     potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to our     limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique     facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision.     To date, no significant costs have been incurred, either     individually or collectively, in connection with our     indemnification provisions.     Critical     Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates     General         The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and     related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and     assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,     liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of     contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates     on historical experience and on various other assumptions that     are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the     results of which form the basis for making judgments about the     carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily     apparent from other sources. Our senior management has discussed     the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates     with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Actual     results may differ from these estimates under different     assumptions or conditions.         An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires     an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about     matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is     made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been     used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably     likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the     consolidated financial statements. We believe the following     critical        57    Table of Contents       accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and     assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated     financial statements. The following descriptions of critical     accounting policies, judgments and estimates should be read in     conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and other     disclosures included in this report.     Provisions     for Doubtful Accounts and Authorized Credits         We are exposed to losses due to uncollectible accounts and     credits to sellers. Provisions for these items represent our     estimate of actual losses and credits based on our historical     experience, are monitored monthly, and are made at the time the     related revenue is recognized. The provision for doubtful     accounts is recorded as a charge to operating expense, while the     authorized credits are recorded as a reduction of revenues. The     following table illustrates the provision related to doubtful     accounts and authorized credits as a percentage of net revenues     for 2004, 2005, and 2006 (in thousands, except percentages):                                                         Year Ended December 31,                 2004           2005           2006               Net revenues                 $       3,271,309               $       4,552,401               $       5,969,741          Provision for doubtful accounts     and authorized credits                 $       90,942               $       89,499               $       100,729          Provision for doubtful accounts     and authorized credits as a % of net revenues                     2.78       %               1.97       %               1.69       %             Historically, our actual losses and credits have been consistent     with these provisions. However, future changes in trends could     result in a material impact to future consolidated statements of     income and cash flows. Based on our results for the year ended     December 31, 2006, a 25 basis point deviation from our     estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in     operating income of approximately $14.9 million. The     following analysis demonstrates, for illustrative purposes only,     the potential effect a 25 basis point deviation from our     estimates would have upon our consolidated financial statements     and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected     deviation (in thousands, except per share data):                                                         −25 Basis                        +25 Basis                  Points           2006           Points               Provision for doubtful accounts     and related authorized credits                 $       85,805               $       100,729               $       115,653          Income from operations                     1,437,880                   1,422,956                   1,408,032          Net income                     1,140,563                   1,125,639                   1,110,715          Diluted earnings per share                 $       0.80               $       0.79               $       0.78             Provision     for Transaction Losses         Our Payments segment is exposed to transaction losses due to     credit card and other payment misuse, as well as non-performance     of sellers who accept payment through PayPal. We establish     allowances for estimated losses arising from processing customer     transactions, such as charge-backs for unauthorized credit card     use and merchant-related charge-backs due to non-delivery of     goods or services, Automated Clearing House, or ACH, returns,     buyer protection program claims and debit card overdrafts. These     allowances represent an accumulation of the estimated amounts     necessary to provide for transaction losses incurred as of the     reporting date, including those of which we have not yet been     notified. The allowances, which involve the use of actuarial     techniques, are monitored monthly and are updated based on     actual claims data reported by our claims processors. The     allowances are based on known facts and circumstances, internal     factors including our experience with similar cases, historical     trends involving loss payment patterns and the mix of     transaction and loss types. The provision for transaction losses     is reflected as a general and administrative expense in our     consolidated statement of income. At December 31, 2006, the     allowance for transaction losses totaled $79.5 million and     was included in other current assets and accrued expenses and     other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.        58    Table of Contents         The following table illustrates the provision for transaction     losses as a percentage of total payment volume from PayPal     operations for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and     2006 (in thousands, except percentages):                                                         Year Ended December 31,                 2004           2005           2006               Total payment volume                 $       18,915,000               $       27,485,000               $       37,752,000          Transaction loss expense                 $       50,459               $       73,773               $       126,439          As a % of total payment volume                     0.27       %               0.27       %               0.33       %             Determining appropriate allowances for transaction losses is an     inherently uncertain process, and ultimate losses may vary from     the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance     estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may     impact the settlement or recovery of losses. The allowances are     maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide     for losses incurred at the balance sheet date. Based on our     results for the year ended December 31, 2006, a five basis     point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an     increase or decrease in our operating expenses of approximately     $18.9 million. The following analysis demonstrates, for     illustrative purposes only, the potential effect a five basis     point deviation from our estimates would have upon our     consolidated financial statements for the year ended     December 31, 2006, and is not intended to provide a range     of exposure or expected deviation (in thousands, except per     share data):                                                         −5 Basis                        +5 Basis                  Points           2006           Points               Transaction loss expense                 $       107,562               $       126,439               $       145,315          Income from operations                     1,441,832                   1,422,956                   1,404,079          Net income                     1,144,515                   1,125,639                   1,106,762          Diluted earnings per share                 $       0.80               $       0.79               $       0.78             Legal     Contingencies         In connection with certain pending litigation and other claims,     we have estimated the range of probable loss and provided for     such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of     income. These estimates have been based on our assessment of the     facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are     subject to change based upon new information and future events.         From time to time, we are involved in disputes that arise in the     ordinary course of business, and we do not expect this trend to     change in the future. We are currently involved in certain legal     proceedings as discussed in Item 3: Legal     Proceedings and Note 8  Commitments     and Contingencies  Litigation and Other Legal     Matters to our consolidated financial statements included     elsewhere in this Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims     against us, and we will defend ourselves vigorously. However,     even if successful, our defense against certain actions will be     costly and could divert our managements time. If the     plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims, we might be forced     to pay significant damages and licensing fees, modify our     business practices or even be prohibited from conducting a     significant part of our business. Any such results could     materially harm our business and could result in a material     adverse impact on the financial position, results of operations     or cash flows of all or any of our three businesses.     Accounting     for Income Taxes         We are required to recognize a provision for income taxes based     upon the taxable income and temporary differences for each of     the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires     a calculation of taxes payable under currently enacted tax laws     around the world and an analysis of temporary differences     between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities,     including various accruals, allowances, depreciation and     amortization. The tax effect of these temporary differences and     the estimated tax benefit from our tax net operating losses are     reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our     consolidated balance sheet. We also assess the likelihood that     our net deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable     income. To the extent we believe that it is more likely than not     that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be     realized, we establish a valuation allowance. At     December 31, 2006, we had a valuation allowance on certain     foreign net operating losses based on our assessment        59    Table of Contents       that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will     not be realized. To the extent we establish a valuation     allowance or change the allowance in a period, we reflect the     change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our tax     provision in our consolidated statement of income.         Our U.S. businesses generate sufficient cash flow to fully     fund their operating requirements, and we expect that profits     earned outside the U.S. will be fully utilized to fund our     continued international expansion. Accordingly, we have not     provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding     taxes on     non-U.S. subsidiaries     undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2006, because     such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. In the     event that our future international expansion plans change and     such amounts are not reinvested indefinitely, we would be     subject to U.S. income taxes partially offset by foreign     tax credits.         The following table illustrates the effective tax rates for     2004, 2005, and 2006 (in thousands, except percentages):                                                         Year Ended December 31,                 2004           2005           2006               Provision for income taxes                 $       343,885               $       467,285               $       421,418          As a % of income before income     taxes                     30       %               30       %               27       %             Historically, these provisions have adequately provided for our     actual income tax liabilities. Our future effective tax rates     could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than     anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and     higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher     statutory rates, by changes in the valuations of our deferred     tax assets or liabilities, or by changes or interpretations in     tax laws, regulations or accounting principles. In addition, we     are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax     returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax     authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse     outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the     adequacy of our provision for income taxes.         Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2006,     a one-percentage point change in our provision for income taxes     as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an     increase or decrease in the provision of approximately     $15.5 million. The following analysis demonstrates, for     illustrative purposes only, the potential effect such a     one-percentage point deviation change would have upon our     consolidated financial statements and is not intended to provide     a range of exposure or expected deviation (in thousands, except     per share data):                                                         −100 Basis                        +100 Basis                  Points           2006           Points               Provision for income taxes                 $       405,947               $       421,418               $       436,889          Income from operations                     1,438,427                   1,422,956                   1,407,485          Net income                     1,141,110                   1,125,639                   1,110,168          Diluted earnings per share                 $       0.80               $       0.79               $       0.78             Advertising     and Other Revenues         A portion of our net revenues result from fees associated with     advertising and other services. Net revenues from advertising     are derived principally from the sale of online advertisements     for cash and through barter arrangements. Other net revenues are     derived principally from contractual arrangements with third     parties that provide transaction services to eBay and PayPal     users and interest earned from banks on certain PayPal customer     account balances. Advertising and other net revenues, including     barter transactions, totaled 3% of our consolidated net revenues     for each of the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and     2006, and were primarily generated by our Marketplaces segment.     Revenue from barter arrangements totaled $1.4 million in     2006, $6.7 million in 2005 and $13.3 million in 2004.     Certain judgments are involved in the determination of the     appropriate revenue recognition, including, but not limited to,     the assessment and allocation of fair values in multiple element     arrangements, the appropriateness of gross or net revenue     recognition and, for barter transactions, the existence of     comparable cash transactions to establish fair values. Our     advertising and other net revenues may be affected by the     financial condition of the parties with whom we have these     relationships and by the success of online services and     promotions in general. Unlike our transaction revenues,     advertising and other net revenues are derived from a relatively     concentrated customer base.        60    Table of Contents     Goodwill     and Intangible Assets         The purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between     intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired     business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as     goodwill. The determination of the value of the intangible     assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates. These     judgments can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows     that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the     appropriate weighted average cost of capital.         At December 31, 2006 our goodwill totaled $6.5 billion     and our identifiable intangible assets totaled     $683.0 million. We assess the impairment of goodwill of our     reportable units annually, or more often if events or changes in     circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be     recoverable. This assessment is based upon a discounted cash     flow analysis and analysis of our market capitalization. The     estimate of cash flow is based upon, among other things, certain     assumptions about expected future operating performance and an     appropriate discount rate determined by our management. Our     estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash     flows due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes     to its business model or changes in operating performance.     Additionally, certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve     businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue     models which increase the risk of differences between the     projected and actual performance. Significant differences     between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially     affect our future financial results. We completed our annual     goodwill impairment test as of August 31, 2006 and     determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill     for any of our reportable units was required. We have determined     that no events or circumstances from that date through     December 31, 2006 indicate that a further assessment was     necessary. There was no impairment of goodwill or identifiable     intangible assets in 2006, 2005 and 2004.     Stock-Based     Compensation         On January 1, 2006, we adopted FAS 123(R), which     requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense     for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and     directors including employee stock options and employee stock     purchases based on estimated fair values. Stock-based     compensation expense recognized for 2006 was     $317.4 million, which consisted of stock-based compensation     expense related to stock options and employee stock purchases.     For 2005 and 2004, stock-based compensation expense of     $31.8 million and $5.8 million, respectively, was     recognized under previous accounting standards. See     Note 12  Stock-Based Plans to our     consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this     Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for additional information.         We calculated the fair value of each option award on the date of     grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The     determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the     date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our     stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly     complex and subjective variables. The use of a Black-Scholes     model requires extensive actual employee exercise behavior data     and a number of complex assumptions including expected life,     expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield.     The weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options     granted during 2006 was $10.47 per share, using the     Black-Scholes model with the following weighted-average     assumptions:                    Risk-free interest rates             4.7%           Expected life             3 years           Dividend yield             0%           Expected volatility             36%                  Our computation of expected volatility for 2006 was based on a     combination of historical and market-based implied volatility     from traded options on our stock. Prior to 2006, our computation     of expected volatility was based on historical volatility. Our     computation of expected life was determined based on historical     experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the     contractual terms of the stock-based awards, vesting schedules     and expectations of future employee behavior. The interest rate     for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on     the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of     grant.        61    Table of Contents     Recent     Accounting Pronouncements         In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board     (FASB) issued Financial Interpretation No. 48,     Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an     interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109     (FIN 48), which is a change in accounting for     income taxes. Among other provisions, FIN 48: specifies how     tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are to be recognized,     measured, and derecognized in financial statements; requires     certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters; specifies how     reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified on the     balance sheet; and provides transition and interim-period     guidance. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning     after December 15, 2006 and as a result, is effective for     us in the first quarter of 2007. We have not yet completed our     evaluation of the impact of adoption on our consolidated     financial statements.         In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,     Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157). FAS 157     establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands     disclosures about fair value measurements. The changes to     current practice resulting from the application of this     statement relate to the definition of fair value, the methods     used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about     fair value measurements. We will be required to adopt the     provisions on FAS 157 beginning with our first quarter     ending March 31, 2007. We do not believe that the adoption     of the provisions of FAS 157 will materially impact our     consolidated financial statements.         Effective December 31, 2006, we adopted the recognition and     disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158, Employers     Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement     Plans  an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,     88, 106, and 132(R), (FAS 158). These provisions did     not materially impact our consolidated financial statements.     FAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the over-funded     or under-funded status of a defined benefit pension and other     postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an     asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to     recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the     changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity.     This statement also requires plan assets and obligations to be     measured as of the employers balance sheet date. The     measurement provision of this statement will be effective for     years beginning after December 15, 2008 with early adoption     encouraged. We have not yet adopted the measurement date     provisions of this statement.         In 2006, we adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,     Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When     Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial     Statements (SAB 108), which provides interpretive     guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of     prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a     current year misstatement. The adoption of SAB 108 did not     impact our consolidated financial statements.      ITEM 7A:  QUANTITATIVE     AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK      Interest     Rate Risk         The primary objective of our investment activities is to     preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields     without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this     objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and     short-term and long-term investments in a variety of securities,     including government and corporate securities and money market     funds. These securities are generally classified as available     for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at     fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a     separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income     (loss), net of estimated tax.         Investments in both fixed-rate and floating-rate     interest-earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest     rate risk. The fair market value of our fixed-rate securities     may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. In     general, securities with longer maturities are subject to     greater interest-rate risk than those with shorter maturities.     While floating rate securities generally are subject to less     interest-rate risk than fixed-rate securities, floating-rate     securities may produce less income than expected if interest     rates decrease. Due in part to these factors, our investment     income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in     principal if securities are sold that have declined in market     value due to changes in interest rates. As of December 31,     2006, our fixed-income investments earned a pretax yield of     approximately 4.7%, with a weighted average maturity of two     months. If interest rates were to instantaneously increase     (decrease) by 100 basis points, the fair market value of     our total investment portfolio could decrease (increase) by     approximately $1.3 million.        62    Table of Contents     Equity     Price Risk         We are exposed to equity price risk on the marketable portion of     equity instruments and equity method investments we hold,     typically as the result of strategic investments in third     parties that are subject to considerable market risk due to     their volatility. We typically do not attempt to reduce or     eliminate our market exposure in these equity investments. We     did not record an impairment charge during the years ended     December 31, 2006, 2005 or 2004 relating to the     other-than-temporary     impairment in the fair value of equity investments. At     December 31, 2006, the total carrying value of our equity     instruments and equity method investments was $65.5 million.     Foreign     Currency Risk         International net revenues result from transactions by our     foreign operations and are typically denominated in the local     currency of each country. These operations also incur most of     their expenses in the local currency. Accordingly, certain     foreign operations use the local currency, which is primarily     the Euro, and to a lesser extent, the British pound, as their     functional currency. Our international operations are subject to     risks typical of international operations, including, but not     limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political     climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and     restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility. Accordingly,     our future results could be materially adversely impacted by     changes in these or other factors. In addition, at     December 31, 2006, we held balances in cash, cash     equivalents and investments outside the U.S. totaling     approximately $2.3 billion.     Transaction     Exposure         As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding forward foreign     exchange hedge contracts with notional values equivalent to     approximately $188.4 million with maturity dates within     31 days. The hedge contracts are used to offset changes in     the functional currency value of assets and liabilities     denominated in foreign currencies as a result of currency     fluctuations. Transaction gains and losses on the contracts and     the assets and liabilities are recognized each period in our     consolidated statement of income.     Translation     Exposure         Foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our     financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign     operations are translated into U.S. dollars in preparing     our consolidated balance sheet. The effect of foreign exchange     rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position for the     year ended December 31, 2006, was a net translation gain of     approximately $588.2 million. This gain is recognized as an     adjustment to stockholders equity through accumulated     other comprehensive income. Additionally, foreign exchange rate     fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of     operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions     denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies     result in gains and losses that are reflected in our     consolidated statement of income.         We consolidate the earnings of our international subsidiaries by     converting them into U.S. dollars in accordance with     SFAS No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation     (FAS 52). Such earnings will fluctuate when there is a     change in foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into     transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency     denominated earnings translation exposure using either forward     exchange contracts or other instruments. All contracts that     hedge translation exposure mature ratably over the quarter in     which they are executed. During the year ended December 31,     2006, the realized gains and losses related to these hedges were     not significant.         A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening or weakening in the     value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro, British     pound and Korean won in which our revenues and profits are     denominated would result in a decrease/increase to operating     income of approximately $110 million. There are inherent     limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented, primarily due     to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are     linear and instantaneous. As a result, the analysis is unable to     reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes     that could arise, which may positively or negatively affect     income.        63    Table of Contents     Economic     Exposure         We currently charge our international subsidiaries on a monthly     basis for their use of intellectual property and technology and     for certain corporate services provided by eBay and PayPal.     These charges are denominated in Euros and these forecasted     inter-company transactions represent a foreign currency cash     flow exposure. To reduce foreign exchange risk relating to these     forecasted inter-company transactions, we entered into forward     exchange contracts or other instruments during the year ended     December 31, 2006. The objective of the forward contracts     is to ensure that the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are     not adversely affected by changes in the U.S. dollar/Euro     exchange rate. Pursuant to SFAS No. 133     Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging     Activities (FAS 133), we expect the hedge of certain     of these forecasted transactions using the forward contracts to     be highly effective in offsetting potential changes in cash     flows attributed to a change in the U.S. dollar/Euro     exchange rate. Accordingly, we record as a component of other     comprehensive income all unrealized gains and losses related to     the forward contracts that receive hedge accounting treatment.     We record all unrealized gains and losses in interest and     accumulated other income, net, related to the forward contracts     that do not receive hedge accounting treatment pursuant to     FAS 133. During the years ended December 31, 2004,     2005 and 2006, the realized gains and losses related to these     hedges were not significant. The notional amount of our economic     hedges receiving hedge accounting treatment and the losses, net     of gains, recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income as     of December 31, 2004 was $140.2 million and     $3.4 million, respectively. The notional amount of our     economic hedges receiving hedge accounting treatment and the     loss, net of gains, recorded to accumulated other comprehensive     income as of December 31, 2005 was $203.0 million and     $200,000 respectively. We did not have any economic hedges in     place as of December 31, 2006.

ITEM 9A:     CONTROLS     AND PROCEDURES       Evaluation of disclosure controls and     procedures.  Based on the evaluation of our     disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the     Rules 13a-15(e)     and     15d-15(e)     under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act)     required by Exchange Act     Rules 13a-15(b)     or     15d-15(b),     our principal executive officer and our principal financial     officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered     by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were     effective.     Changes in internal controls.  There were no     changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as     defined in Exchange Act     Rule 13a-15(f)     that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter     that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to     materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.     Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial     Reporting.  Our management is responsible for     establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over     financial reporting. Our management, including our principal     executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an     evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over     financial reporting based on the framework in Internal     Control  Integrated Framework issued by the     Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway     Commission. Based on its evaluation under the framework in     Internal Control  Integrated Framework, our     management concluded that our internal control over financial     reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006. Our     managements assessment of the effectiveness of our     internal control over financial reporting as of     December 31, 2006 has been audited by     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public     accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included     elsewhere in this Annual Report on     Form 10-K.        64    Table of Contents      ITEM 9B:  OTHER     INFORMATION          Not applicable.

(c)        The financial statement schedules required by this item are     listed under Item 15 (a) (2) above.        69    Table of Contents      Report of     Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm          To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of eBay Inc.:         We have completed integrated audits of eBay Inc.s     consolidated financial statements and of its internal control     over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, in     accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting     Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our     audits, are presented below.     Consolidated     financial statements and financial statement     schedule         In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in     the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in     all material respects, the financial position of eBay Inc. and     its subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and December 31,     2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows     for each of the three years in the period ended     December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles     generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,     in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the     index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all     material respects, the information set forth therein when read     in conjunction with the related consolidated financial     statements. These financial statements and financial statement     schedule are the responsibility of the Companys     management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these     financial statements and financial statement schedule based on     our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in     accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting     Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we     plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about     whether the financial statements are free of material     misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes     examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and     disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the     accounting principles used and significant estimates made by     management, and evaluating the overall financial statement     presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable     basis for our opinion.         As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial     statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts     for share-based compensation in 2006.     Internal     control over financial reporting         Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in     Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial     Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company     maintained effective internal control over financial reporting     as of December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in     Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued     by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway     Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects,     based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the     Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal     control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006,     based on criteria established in Internal Control      Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys     management is responsible for maintaining effective internal     control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the     effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our     responsibility is to express opinions on managements     assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys     internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We     conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting     in accordance with the standards of the Public Company     Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards     require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable     assurance about whether effective internal control over     financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An     audit of internal control over financial reporting includes     obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial     reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and     evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal     control, and performing such other procedures as we consider     necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit     provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.         A companys internal control over financial reporting is a     process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the     reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of     financial statements for external purposes in accordance with     generally accepted accounting principles. A companys     internal control over financial reporting includes those     policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance     of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly     reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the     company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that     transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of     financial statements in accordance with generally accepted     accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the     company are being made        70    Table of Contents       only in accordance with authorizations of management and     directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable     assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of     unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the     companys assets that could have a material effect on the     financial statements.         Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over     financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.     Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future     periods are subject to the risk that controls may become     inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree     of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.     /s/  PricewaterhouseCoopers     LLP         San Jose, California     February 27, 2007        71    Table of Contents   eBay     Inc.

NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      Note 1      The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting     Policies:     The     Company         eBay Inc. (eBay) was incorporated in California in     May 1996, and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.     eBays purpose is to pioneer new communities around the     world, built on commerce, sustained by trust, and inspired by     opportunity. eBay brings together millions of buyers and sellers     every day on a local, national and international basis through     an array of websites. eBay provides online marketplaces for the     sale of goods and services, online payment services and online     communication offerings to a diverse community of individuals     and businesses.         eBay has three operating segments: Marketplaces, Payments and     Communications. The Marketplaces segment enables online commerce     through a variety of different platforms, including the     traditional eBay auction site, our classifieds websites, and our     comparison shopping site, Shopping.com. The Payments segment,     which consists of our PayPal, Inc. (PayPal)     business, enables individuals or businesses to securely, easily     and quickly send and receive payments online. The Communications     segment, which consists of our Skype Technologies SA     (Skype) business, enables Voice over Internet     Protocol (VoIP) calls between Skype users, as well as provides     low-cost connectivity to traditional fixed-line and mobile     telephones.         When we refer to we, our, us     or eBay in this document, we mean the current     Delaware corporation (eBay Inc.) and its California predecessor,     as well as all of our consolidated subsidiaries.     Use of     estimates         The preparation of consolidated financial statements in     conformity with generally accepted accounting principles     requires management to make estimates and assumptions that     affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and     disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of     the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts     of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an     ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those     related to provisions for doubtful accounts and authorized     credits, the provision for transaction losses, legal     contingencies, income taxes, advertising and other     non-transaction revenues, and goodwill and intangible assets. We     base our estimates on historical experience and on various other     assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the     circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.     Principles     of consolidation and basis of presentation         The accompanying financial statements are consolidated and     include the financial statements of eBay and our majority-owned     subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and     transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.         The consolidated financial statements include 100% of the assets     and liabilities of these majority-owned subsidiaries and the     ownership interests of minority investors are recorded as     minority interests. Investments in entities where we hold more     than a 20% but less than a 50% ownership interest and have the     ability to significantly influence the operations of the     investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting     and the investment balance is included in long-term investments,     while our share of the investees results of operations is     included in interest and other income, net. Investments in     entities where we hold less than a 20% ownership interest and     where we do not have the ability to significantly influence the     operations of the investee are accounted for using the cost     method of accounting and are included in long-term investments.         Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform     to the current period presentation.     Fair     value of financial instruments         Cash and cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid     investments with original or remaining maturities of three     months or less when purchased. Our financial instruments,     including cash, cash equivalents, accounts        77    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)        receivable, funds receivable, accounts payable, and funds     payable are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value     because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.         Short and long-term investments, which include marketable equity     securities and government and corporate bonds, are classified as     available-for-sale     and reported at fair value using the specific identification     method. Unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings     and reported as a component of other comprehensive income     (loss), net of related estimated tax provisions or benefits.     Additionally, we assess whether an     other-than-temporary     impairment loss on our investments has occurred due to declines     in fair value or other market conditions. Declines in fair value     that are considered other than temporary are recorded as an     impairment of investments in the consolidated statement of     income.     Derivative     instruments         We recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at     fair value. Changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of     the derivatives are recorded each period in the consolidated     statement of income or accumulated other comprehensive income     (loss). For a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, the     gain or loss on the derivative is initially reported as a     component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and     subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statement of     income when the hedged transaction affects earnings. For     derivatives recognized as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss     on the derivative in the period of change and the offsetting     loss or gain of the hedged item attributed to the hedged risk,     are recognized in the consolidated statement of income. For     derivatives not recognized as hedges, the gain or loss on the     derivative in the period of change is recognized as interest and     other income, net.     Concentrations     of credit risk         Our cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and funds     receivable are potentially subject to concentration of credit     risk. Cash and cash equivalents are placed with financial     institutions that management believes are of high credit     quality. Our accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned     from customers located in the U.S. and internationally. Accounts     receivable balances are settled through customer credit cards,     debit cards, and PayPal accounts, with the majority of accounts     receivable collected upon processing of credit card     transactions. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts     receivable and authorized credits based upon our historical     experience. Historically, such losses have been within our     expectations. However, unexpected or significant future changes     in trends could result in a material impact to future statements     of income or cash flows. Due to the relatively small dollar     amount of individual accounts receivable, we generally do not     require collateral on these balances. The provision for doubtful     accounts is recorded as a charge to general and administrative     expense, while the provision for authorized credits is     recognized as a reduction of net revenues.         During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005, and 2006,     no customers accounted for more than 10% of net revenues. As of     December 31, 2005 and 2006, no customers accounted for more     than 10% of net accounts receivable.     Allowances     for transaction losses         Our Payments segment is exposed to transaction losses due to     fraud, as well as non-performance of customers. We establish     allowances for estimated losses arising from processing customer     transactions, such as charge-backs for unauthorized credit card     use and merchant related charge-backs due to non-delivery of     goods or services, Automated Clearing House, or ACH, returns,     and debit card overdrafts. These allowances represent an     accumulation of the estimated amounts necessary to provide for     transaction losses incurred as of the reporting date, including     those to which we have not yet been notified. The allowances,     which involve the use of actuarial techniques, are monitored     monthly and are updated based on actual claims data reported by     our claims processors. The allowances are based on known facts     and circumstances, internal factors including our experience     with similar cases, historical trends involving loss payment     patterns and the mix of transaction and loss types. Additions to     the        78    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)        allowance, in the form of provisions, are reflected as a general     and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of     income. At December 31, 2005 and 2006, the allowance for     transaction losses totaled $50.3 million and     $79.5 million, respectively, and was included as an offset     to other current assets and accrued expenses and other current     liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.     Foreign     currency         The majority of our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency     of their respective countries as their functional currency.     Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates     prevailing at the balance sheet dates. Revenues, costs and     expenses are translated into United States dollars at average     exchange rates for the period. Gains and losses resulting from     translation are recorded as a component of accumulated other     comprehensive income (loss).         Realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are     recognized as interest and other income, net.     Funds     receivable and funds payable to customers         Funds receivable and payable relate to our Payments segment and     arise due to the time taken to clear transactions through     external payment networks. When customers fund their account     using their bank account or credit card, or withdraw money from     their bank account or through a debit card transaction, there is     a clearing period before the cash is received or sent by PayPal,     usually one to three business days for U.S. transactions,     and up to five business days for international transactions.     Hence, these funds are treated as a receivable or payable until     the cash is settled.     Customer     accounts         Based on differences in regulatory requirements and commercial     law in the jurisdictions where PayPal operates, PayPal holds     customer balances either as direct claims against PayPal or as     an agent or custodian on behalf of PayPals customers.     Customer balances held as direct claims against PayPal are     included on our consolidated balance sheet as customer accounts     with an offsetting current liability in funds payable and     amounts due to customers. The customer accounts can be invested     only in specified types of liquid assets. Customer accounts on     our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006     included approximately $180 million from direct     non-custodial customer relationships established in conjunction     with PayPals Asia Pacific headquarters during 2006.         All customer funds held by PayPal as an agent or custodian on     behalf of our customers are not reflected in our consolidated     balance sheet. These off-balance sheet funds total approximately     $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion as of December 31,     2005 and 2006, respectively. These off-balance sheet funds     include funds held in the U.S. that are deposited in bank     accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation     and funds that customers choose to invest in PayPals Money     Market Fund.     Property     and equipment         Property and equipment are stated at historical cost less     accumulated depreciation. Depreciation and amortization are     computed using the straight-line method over the estimated     useful lives of the assets, generally, one to three years for     computer equipment and software, up to 30 years for     buildings and building improvements, ten years for aviation     equipment, the shorter of five years or the term of the lease     for leasehold improvements, three years for furniture and     fixtures and three years for vehicles.     Goodwill     and intangible assets         Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the     fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible     assets acquired in a business combination. Intangible assets     resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using     the purchase method of accounting are estimated by management     based on the fair value of assets received. Identifiable     intangible assets are comprised of purchased customer lists and     user base, trademarks        79    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)        and trade names, developed technologies, and other intangible     assets. Identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over     the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method     and estimated useful lives ranging from one to eight years.     Goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is subject to at     least an annual assessment for impairment, applying a fair-value     based test.     Impairment     of long-lived assets         We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or     changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a     long-lived asset may not be recoverable. An asset is considered     impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future net cash flow     the asset is expected to generate. If an asset is considered to     be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the     amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its     fair market value. We assess the recoverability of our     long-lived and intangible assets by determining whether the     unamortized balances can be recovered through undiscounted     future net cash flows of the related assets. The amount of     impairment, if any, is measured based on projected discounted     future net cash flows.         We evaluate goodwill, at a minimum, on an annual basis and     whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the     carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment of goodwill     is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting     units carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair     value of the reporting unit. The fair values of the reporting     units are estimated using a combination of the income or     discounted cash flows approach and the market approach, which     utilizes comparable companies data. If the carrying amount     of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is     considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure     the amount of impairment loss, if any. We conducted our annual     impairment test as of August 31, 2006 and determined there     was no impairment. There were no events or circumstances from     that date through December 31, 2006 that would impact this     assessment.     Revenue     recognition         Our net revenues result from transaction, advertising and other     fees generated in our Marketplaces, Payments and Communications     segments. Revenues are recognized when evidence of an     arrangement exists, the fee is fixed and determinable, no     significant obligation remains and collection of the receivable     is reasonably assured.         Our Marketplaces segment generates transaction revenues for     listing and feature fees and lead referral fees. Listing and     feature fee revenues are recognized ratably over the estimated     period of the listing, while revenues related to final value     fees are recognized at the time that the transaction is     successfully concluded. A transaction is considered successfully     concluded when at least one buyer has bid above the     sellers specified minimum price or reserve price,     whichever is higher, at the end of the transaction term. Lead     referral fee revenue is generated from lead referral fees based     on the number of times a user clicks through to a     merchants website from our websites. Lead referral fees     are recognized in the period in which the user clicks through to     the merchants website.         Our Payments segment earns transaction revenues from processing     transactions for certain customers. Revenues resulting from a     payment processing transaction is recognized once the     transaction is complete.         Our Communications segment revenues are recognized when the     related service offering is provided. The majority of     Communications segment transaction revenues are prepaid. We     record customer advances for prepaid amounts in excess of     revenues recognized.         Our advertising revenues are derived principally from the sale     of online advertisements. To date, the duration of our     advertising contracts has ranged from one week to five years,     but is generally one week to one year. Advertising revenues on     contracts are recognized as impressions (i.e., the     number of times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by     users of our websites) are delivered or ratably over the term of     the agreement where such agreements provide for minimum monthly     or quarterly advertising commitments or where such commitments     are fixed throughout the term. Barter transactions are valued on     amounts realized in similar cash transactions occurring within     six months prior to the date of the barter transaction. To the     extent that significant delivery obligations remain        80    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)        at the end of a period or collection of the resulting account     receivable is not considered probable, revenues are deferred     until the obligation is satisfied or the uncertainty is     resolved. These amounts are included in deferred revenues in our     consolidated balance sheet. Revenue from barter arrangements     totaled $13.3 million, $6.7 million and     $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004,     2005 and 2006, respectively, with the reciprocal arrangements     being recognized as an operating expense. In general, the     services are received in the same period in which the reciprocal     services are provided. In certain circumstances, we are required     to record, as a reduction of revenue, payments to a party who is     also a customer. These payments primarily consist of certain     promotional activities which result in payments to our users.         Our other revenues are derived principally from contractual     arrangements with third parties that provide transaction     services to eBay and PayPal users and interest earned from banks     on certain PayPal customer account balances. Revenues from     contractual arrangements with third parties are recognized as     the contracted services are delivered to end users. Revenues     from interest income are recognized when earned.         We evaluate whether payments made to customers or revenues     earned from vendors have a separate identifiable benefit and     whether they are fairly valued in determining the appropriate     classification of the related revenues and expense. For revenue     agreements with multiple deliverables we ensure all undelivered     elements are accounted for at fair value.         Provisions for doubtful accounts, transaction losses and     authorized credits are made at the time of revenue recognition     based upon our historical experience. The provision for doubtful     accounts and transaction losses are recorded as charges to     operating expense, while the provision for authorized credits is     recognized as a reduction of net revenues.     Product     development costs         Costs related to the planning and post implementation phases of     our website development efforts are recorded as an operating     expense. Direct costs incurred in the development phase are     capitalized and amortized over the products estimated     useful life of one to three years as charges to cost of net     revenues.     Advertising     expense         We expense the costs of producing advertisements at the time     production occurs and expense the cost of communicating     advertising in the period during which the advertising space or     airtime is used. Internet advertising expenses are recognized     based on the terms of the individual agreements, which is     generally over the greater of the ratio of the number of     impressions delivered over the total number of contracted     impressions,     pay-per-click,     or on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.     Advertising expenses totaled $459.5 million,     $665.1 million and $871.0 million during the years     ended December 31, 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively.     Stock-based     compensation         On January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial     Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised     2004), Share-Based Payment (FAS 123(R)), which     requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations     all share-based payments to employees, including grants of     employee stock options, based on their fair value. The statement     eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation     transactions, as we formerly did, using the intrinsic value     method as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board, or APB,     Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to     Employees.         We adopted FAS 123(R) using the modified prospective     method, which requires the application of the accounting     standard as of January 1, 2006. Our consolidated financial     statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006     reflect the impact of adopting FAS 123(R). In accordance     with the modified prospective method, the consolidated financial     statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect,     and do not include, the impact of FAS 123(R). See     Note 12  Stock-Based Plans for     further details.        81    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          Stock-based compensation expense recognized during the period is     based on the value of the portion of stock-based payment awards     that is ultimately expected to vest. Stock-based compensation     expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income     during 2006 included compensation expense for stock-based     payment awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of,     January 1, 2006 based on the grant date fair value     estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of     FAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based     Compensation  Transition and Disclosures     (FAS 148) and compensation expense for the stock-based     payment awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005,     based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with     FAS 123(R). As stock-based compensation expense recognized     in the statement of income for 2006 is based on awards     ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated     forfeitures. FAS 123(R) requires forfeitures to be     estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in     subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those     estimates. In the pro forma information required under     FAS 148 for the periods prior to 2006, we accounted for     forfeitures as they occurred.         FAS No. 123(R) prohibits recognition of a deferred tax     asset for an excess tax benefit that has not been realized. We     will recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in equity     if an incremental tax benefit is realized by following the     ordering provisions of the tax law. In addition, we account for     the indirect effects of stock-based compensation on the research     tax credit and the foreign tax credit through the income     statement.     Income     taxes         We account for income taxes using an asset and liability     approach, which requires the recognition of taxes payable or     refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and     assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been     recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. The     measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities     is based on provisions of enacted tax laws; the effects of     future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. If     necessary, the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by     the amount of any tax benefits that are not expected to be     realized based on available evidence.     Recent     accounting pronouncements         In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board     (FASB) issued Financial Interpretation No. 48,     Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an     interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109     (FIN 48), which is a change in accounting for     income taxes. Among other provisions, FIN 48 specifies how     tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are to be recognized,     measured, and derecognized in financial statements; requires     certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters; specifies how     reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified on the     balance sheet; and provides transition and interim-period     guidance. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning     after December 15, 2006 and as a result, is effective for     us in the first quarter of 2007. We have not yet completed our     evaluation of the impact of adoption on our consolidated     financial statements.         In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,     Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157). FAS 157     establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands     disclosures about fair value measurements. The changes to     current practice resulting from the application of this     Statement relate to the definition of fair value, the methods     used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about     fair value measurements. We will be required to adopt the     provisions on FAS 157 beginning with our first quarter     ending March 31, 2007. We do not believe that the adoption     of the provisions of FAS 157 will materially impact our     consolidated financial statements.         Effective December 31, 2006 we adopted the recognition and     disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158, Employers     Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement     Plans  an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,     88, 106, and 132(R), (FAS 158). These provisions did     not materially impact our consolidated financial statements.     FAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the over-funded     or under-funded status of a defined benefit pension and other     postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an     asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to     recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the     changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity.     This statement also requires plan assets and obligations to be        82    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)        measured as of the employers balance sheet date. The     measurement provision of this statement will be effective for     years beginning after December 15, 2008 with early adoption     encouraged. We have not yet adopted the measurement date     provisions of this statement.         In 2006, we adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,     Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When     Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial     Statements (SAB 108), which provides interpretive     guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of     prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a     current year misstatement. The adoption of SAB 108 did not     impact our consolidated financial statements.     Note 2      Net Income Per Share:         Basic net income per share is computed by dividing the net     income for the period by the weighted average number of common     shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per     share is computed by dividing the net income for the period by     the weighted average number of shares of common stock and     potentially dilutive common stock outstanding during the period.     The dilutive effect of outstanding options, restricted stock     units and nonvested stock is reflected in diluted earnings per     share by application of the treasury stock method, which in 2006     includes consideration of stock-based compensation required by     FAS 123(R). The following table sets forth the computation     of basic and diluted net income per share for the periods     indicated (in thousands, except per share amounts):                                                         Year Ended December 31,                 2004           2005           2006               Numerator:                                                            Net income                 $       778,223               $       1,082,043               $       1,125,639                                                                Denominator:                                                            Weighted average common shares                     1,319,548                   1,361,748                   1,403,455          Weighted average unvested common     stock subject to repurchase                     (90       )               (40       )               (4,204       )                                                            Denominator for basic calculation                     1,319,458                   1,361,708                   1,399,251          Weighted average effect of     dilutive securities:                                                            Weighted average unvested common     stock subject to repurchase                     90                   40                   4,204          Employee stock options                     48,172                   32,127                   22,017                                                                Denominator for diluted calculation                     1,367,720                   1,393,875                   1,425,472                                                                Net income per share:                                                            Basic                 $       0.59               $       0.79               $       0.80                                                                Diluted                 $       0.57               $       0.78               $       0.79                                                                       The calculation of diluted income per share excludes all     anti-dilutive shares. For the years ended December 31,     2004, 2005 and 2006, the number of anti-dilutive shares, as     calculated based on the weighted average closing price of our     common stock for the period, amounted to approximately     3.4 million, 26.7 million and 73.7 million     shares, respectively.        83    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)      Note 3      Business Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets:         Through both domestic and international acquisitions, we have     continued to expand our business. The following table summarizes     our purchase acquisitions in 2005 and 2006 with aggregate     purchase prices in excess of $50 million (in thousands,     except percentages):                                                                                                                 Net                                                              Tangible        Identifiable        Deferred        Unearned                Aggregate              Year        Assets/        Intangible        Tax        Stock-Based                Purchase      Company Name       Acquired       (Liabilities)       Assets       Liabilities       Compensation       Goodwill       Price           Rent.com                     2005               $       18,050               $       61,800               $       (24,924       )           $                      $       380,439               $       435,365          International classified websites                     2005                   (201       )               13,800                   (3,786       )                                  71,771                   81,584          Shopping.com                     2005                   145,898                   133,600                   (29,683       )               16,759                   418,711                   685,285          Skype                     2005                   (1,610       )               280,300                   (71,474       )               55,249                   2,330,961                   2,593,426          Verisigns Payment Gateway     Business                     2005                   (8,804       )               106,600                                                         275,989                   373,785          Tradera.com                     2006                   2,949                   6,200                                                         43,120                   52,269                 Tangible net assets were valued at their respective carrying     amounts as we believe that these amounts approximated their     current fair values at the respective acquisition dates. The     valuation of identifiable intangible assets acquired reflects     managements estimates based on, among other factors, use     of established valuation methods. Such assets consist of     customer lists and user base, trademarks and trade names,     developed technologies and other acquired intangible assets     including contractual agreements. Identifiable intangible assets     are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the     straight-line method and the estimated useful lives of one to     eight years. We believe the straight-line method of amortization     represents our best estimate of the distribution of the economic     value of the identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents     the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net     tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each     business combination. The following table summarizes our     acquired intangible assets by type related to the above purchase     acquisitions (in thousands):                                                                                                                                     Total                      Customer        Trade                Other        Acquired              Year        List/        name/        Developed        Intangible        Intangible      Company Name       Acquired       User Base       Trademarks       Technologies       Assets       Assets           Rent.com                     2005               $       34,500               $       18,000               $       8,200               $       1,100               $       61,800          International classified websites                     2005                   2,600                   11,200                                                         13,800          Shopping.com                     2005                   73,600                   38,700                   21,300                                      133,600          Skype                     2005                   27,700                   243,800                   8,000                   800                   280,300          Verisigns Payment Gateway     Business                     2005                   86,700                   400                   19,500                                      106,600          Tradera.com                     2006                   4,600                   1,000                   600                                      6,200                 The results of operations for periods prior to our acquisition     for each acquisition during 2004, 2005 and 2006, both     individually and in the aggregate, except for Skype, were not     material to our consolidated statement of income and,     accordingly, pro forma results of operations have not been     presented.     Rent.com         On February 23, 2005, we acquired Viva Group, Inc., which     does business under the name Rent.com, for a cash purchase price     of approximately $415 million plus payments for net cash     and investments of approximately $18 million. Rent.com is     an Internet listing website in the apartment and rental housing     industry. The acquisition better enables our expansion into the     online real estate market and is consistent with our strategy of     growing our global online marketplaces. The total purchase price     recorded was approximately $435 million, including     approximately $2 million in estimated acquisition-related     expenses. We accounted for the acquisition as a non-        84    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)        taxable purchase transaction and, accordingly, the purchase     price has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets     acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their     respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date.         The estimated useful economic lives of the identifiable     intangible assets acquired in the Rent.com acquisition are six     years for the customer list, five years for the trade name,     three years for the developed technology and the advertising     relationships, and one year for the user base.     International     Classifieds Websites         During the second quarter of 2005, we announced our acquisitions     of three international classifieds websites, Gumtree.com, LoQUo,     and opusforum, which operate in select international cities.     These acquisitions were made to  help us expand our global     network of classifieds websites and to create a more efficient     place for local consumers to come together online. The aggregate     purchase price recorded for these acquisitions was approximately     $81.6 million, including approximately $1.3 million in     estimated acquisition-related expenses. We accounted for two of     these acquisitions as non-taxable and one as a taxable purchase     transaction and, accordingly, the purchase price for each     acquisition has been allocated to the tangible and intangible     assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their     respective estimated fair values on the applicable acquisition     date.         The estimated useful economic lives of the identifiable     intangible assets acquired in these acquisitions are five years     for both the trade names and for the customer lists.     Shopping.com         On August 30, 2005, we acquired Shopping.com Ltd., or     Shopping.com, for a purchase price of approximately     $685.3 million. We acquired all outstanding shares of     Shopping.coms common stock for $21 per share in cash     totaling approximately $634.5 million and we assumed     Shopping.coms outstanding common stock options, valued at     approximately $43.2 million. The total purchase price also     includes approximately $7.6 million in estimated     acquisition-related expenses. Shopping.com is a provider of     online comparison shopping and consumer reviews. This     acquisition is consistent with our strategy of growing our     global online marketplaces and we believe that it will create a     premier online shopping experience for individuals and     businesses of all sizes. We accounted for the acquisition as a     taxable purchase transaction and, accordingly, the purchase     price has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets     acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their     respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date.         The intrinsic value of Shopping.coms unvested common stock     options assumed in the acquisition totaled approximately     $16.8 million and was recorded as unearned stock-based     compensation. The unearned stock-based compensation relating to     the unvested options is being amortized on an accelerated basis     over the remaining vesting period of less than one year to four     years, consistent with the graded vesting approach under FASB     Interpretation No. 28.         The estimated useful economic lives of the identifiable     intangible assets acquired in the Shopping.com acquisition are     four years for the customer base and five years for the trade     names and the developed technology.     Skype         On October 14, 2005, we acquired all of the outstanding     securities of Skype Technologies S.A. (Skype), for a     total initial consideration of approximately $2.6 billion,     plus potential performance-based payments of up to approximately     $1.3 billion (based on the Euro-dollar exchange rate at the     time of the acquisition). In addition, we agreed to assume     Skypes stock options outstanding as of the closing date     and convert them into options to acquire approximately     1.9 million shares of our common stock. The initial     consideration of approximately $2.6 billion was comprised     of approximately $1.3 billion in cash and 32.8 million     shares of our common stock. For accounting purposes, the stock     portion of the initial consideration was valued at approximately     $1.3 billion based on the average closing price of our     common stock surrounding the acquisition announcement date of     September 12, 2005.        85    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)        The shares of our common stock issued in connection with the     acquisition are subject to certain contractual restrictions on     resale. Additionally, the assumed options have been valued at     $64.6 million and were included as part of the purchase     price. We accounted for the acquisition as a non-taxable     purchase transaction, and accordingly, the purchase price was     allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and     liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the     acquisition date.         In addition to the initial consideration, the maximum amount     potentially payable under the performance-based earn-out is     approximately 1.1 billion, or approximately     $1.5 billion (based on a U.S. dollar to Euro exchange     rate of $1.32), and would be payable in cash or common stock, at     our discretion. The earn-out payments are contingent upon Skype     achieving certain net revenue, gross profit margin-based and     active user targets. Base earn-out payments of up to an     aggregate of approximately 877 million, or     approximately $1.2 billion (based on a U.S. dollar to     Euro exchange rate of $1.32), weighted equally among the three     targets, would be payable if the targets are achieved over any     four-quarter period commencing on January 1, 2006 through     June 30, 2009. Additional bonus earn-out payments of up to     an aggregate of approximately 292 million, or     approximately $386 million (based on a U.S. dollar to     Euro exchange rate of $1.32), weighted equally among the three     targets, would be payable if Skype exceeds the targets during     calendar year 2008. Any contingent earn-out payments made would     be accounted for as additional purchase price and would increase     goodwill. As of December 31, 2006, the targets had not been     met and accordingly, no payments had been made.         The intrinsic value of Skypes unvested common stock     options assumed in the acquisition totaled approximately     $55.2 million and was recorded, prior to the adoption of     FAS 123(R), as unearned stock-based compensation. The     unearned stock-based compensation relating to the unvested     options will be amortized on an accelerated basis over the     remaining vesting period of approximately three years,     consistent with the graded vesting approach under FASB     Interpretation No. 28.         The estimated useful economic lives of the identifiable     intangible assets acquired in the Skype acquisition are five     years for registered user technology and trade names, two years     for existing technology, and one year for network access     agreements.

VeriSigns     Payment Gateway Business         On November 18, 2005, we acquired VeriSigns payment     gateway business for a purchase price of approximately     $373.8 million, consisting of $370.0 million in cash     and $3.8 million in estimated acquisition-related expenses.     The payment gateway is a real-time, scalable Internet payment     platform that allows merchants to authorize, process and manage     online payments. Additionally, we have signed a multi-year     security technology agreement with VeriSign, Inc. that calls for     us to invest in the deployment of its technologies that enable     and better        86    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.

Tradera.com         On April 24, 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding     equity securities of Tradera.com, an online auction-style     marketplace in Sweden, for a total purchase price of     approximately $52.3 million, including approximately     $0.6 million in estimated acquisition-related expenses. We     anticipate that this acquisition will allow us to expand our     online auction-style marketplace in Sweden. We accounted for the     acquisition as a taxable purchase transaction, and, accordingly,     the purchase price has been allocated to the tangible and     intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis     of their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition     date. The estimated useful economic lives of the identifiable     intangible assets acquired in the acquisition are four years for     user base and one year for developed technology and trade name.

No     significant residual value is estimated for the intangible     assets. The increase in intangible assets during the year ended     December 31, 2006 resulted primarily from certain     intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisition of the     outstanding shares of Tradera.com. The net carrying amount of     intangible assets related to our equity investments, included     above, totaled approximately $3.8 million and     $2.5 million, as of December 31, 2005 and 2006,     respectively. Aggregate amortization expense for intangible     assets totaled $70.2 million, $136.4 million and     $220.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2004,     2005 and 2006, respectively. Included in amortization of     intangibles for the year ended December 31, 2006 is a     charge of $10.9 million for in-process research and     development related to an asset purchase completed during the     period.

The Payments segment includes our global payments     platform consisting of our PayPal subsidiary. The Communications     segment includes the VoIP offerings provided by our Skype     subsidiary. Since October 14, 2005, the results from our     Communications segment reflect Skype operations.         Direct contribution consists of net revenues from external     customers less direct costs. Direct costs include specific costs     of net revenues, sales and marketing expenses, and general and     administrative expenses over which segment managers have direct     discretionary control, such as advertising and marketing     programs, customer support expenses, bank charges, site     operations expenses, product development expenses, billing     operations, certain technology and facilities expenses,     transaction expenses, provisions for doubtful accounts,     authorized credits and transaction losses. Segment managers do     not have discretionary control over expenses such as our     corporate center costs (consisting of certain costs such as     corporate management, human resources, finance and legal),     amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation     expenses, as they are not evaluated in the measurement of     segment performance. We have also recast our direct costs to     reflect changes in the current management of site operations     cost, product development, billing operations, and certain     technology and facilities expenses as direct costs.         The following table summarizes the financial performance of our     reporting segments (in thousands):                                                         Year Ended December 31, 2004                 Marketplaces           Payments           Consolidated               Net revenues from external     customers                 $       2,573,607               $       697,702               $       3,271,309          Direct costs                     1,476,965                   512,946                   1,989,911                                                                Direct contribution                     1,096,642                   184,756                   1,281,398                                                                Operating expenses and indirect     costs of net revenues                                                     222,156                                                                Income from operations                                                     1,059,242          Interest and other income, net                                                     77,867          Interest expense                                                     (8,879       )                                                            Income before income taxes and     minority interests                                                 $       1,128,230                                                                                                                                   Year Ended December 31, 2005                 Marketplaces           Payments           Communications           Consolidated               Net revenues from external     customers                 $       3,499,137               $       1,028,455               $       24,809               $       4,552,401          Direct costs                     2,008,215                   725,616                   25,821                   2,759,652                                                                                Direct contribution                     1,490,922                   302,839                   (1,012       )               1,792,749                                                                                Operating expenses and indirect     costs of net revenues                                                                     351,042                                                                                Income from operations                                                                     1,441,707          Interest and other income, net                                                                     111,148          Interest expense                                                                     (3,478       )                                                                            Income before income taxes and     minority interests                                                                 $       1,549,377                                                                                        89    Table of Contents   eBay     Inc.

The United Kingdom and Germany     accounted for greater than 10% of our total net revenues for the     years ended December 31, 2004, 2005, and 2006,     respectively. Long-lived assets attributed to the U.S. and     International geographies are based upon the country in which     the asset is located or owned.       90    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.

The longer the duration of these securities, the more     susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and     bond yields. As yields increase, those securities purchased with     a lower     yield-at-cost     show a     mark-to-market     unrealized loss. All unrealized losses are due to changes in     interest rates and bond yields. We expect to realize the full     value of all these investments upon maturity or sale. As of     December 31, 2006, the losses on these securities have an     average remaining duration of approximately two months.     Restricted cash is held primarily in money market funds and     interest bearing accounts for letters of credit related     primarily to various lease arrangements.         The estimated fair value of short and long-term investments     classified by date of contractual maturity at December 31,     2006 are as follows (in thousands):                                 December 31,                  2006               One year or less (including     restricted cash of $12,738)                 $       554,841          One year through two years                     176,794          Two years through three years                     33,523          Restricted cash and investments of     $2,045 in 10 years and thereafter                     2,045                                           $       767,203                                   Equity     and cost method investments         We have certain investments accounted for using the equity and     cost method of accounting totaling $51.9 million in 2005     and $65.5 million in 2006. The total of these investments,     including identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax     liabilities and goodwill, are classified on our balance sheet as     long-term investments. Our consolidated results of operations     include, as a component of other income, our share of the net     income or loss of the equity method investments together with     amortization expense relating to acquired intangible assets. Our     share of the results of investees results of operations is     not significant for any period presented.     Note 6      Derivative Instruments:     Transaction     Exposure         As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding forward foreign     exchange hedge contracts with notional values equivalent to     approximately $188.4 million with maturity dates within     31 days. The hedge contracts are used to offset changes in     non-US dollar denominated functional currency value of assets     and liabilities as a result of foreign exchange rate     fluctuations. Transaction gains and losses on the contracts and     the assets and liabilities are recognized each period in     interest and other income, net.        92    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)      Translation     Exposure         We consolidate the earnings of our international subsidiaries by     converting them into U.S. dollars in accordance with     Financial Accounting Standards No. 52 Foreign     Currency Translation (FAS 52). Such earnings will     fluctuate when there is a change in foreign currency exchange     rates. We enter into transactions to hedge portions of our     foreign currency denominated earnings translation exposure using     either forward exchange contracts or other instruments. All     contracts that hedge translation exposure mature ratably over     the quarter in which they are executed. During the years ended     December 31, 2005 and 2006, the realized gains and losses     related to these hedges were not significant.     Economic     Exposure         We currently charge our international subsidiaries on a monthly     basis for their use of intellectual property and technology and     for certain corporate services provided by eBay and by PayPal.     These charges are denominated in Euros and these forecasted     inter-company transactions represent a foreign currency cash     flow exposure. To reduce foreign exchange risk relating to these     forecasted inter-company transactions, we entered into forward     foreign exchange contracts during the year ended     December 31, 2006. The objective of the forward contracts     is to better ensure that the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash     flows are not adversely affected by changes in the     U.S. dollar/Euro exchange rate. Pursuant to Financial     Accounting Standards No. 133 Accounting for     Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities     (FAS 133), we expect the hedge of certain of these     forecasted transactions to be highly effective in offsetting     potential changes in cash flows attributed to a change in the     U.S. dollar/Euro exchange rate. Accordingly, we record as a     component of accumulated other comprehensive income all     unrealized gains and losses related to the forward contracts     that receive hedge accounting treatment. We record all     unrealized gains and losses in interest and other income, net,     related to the forward contracts that do not receive hedge     accounting treatment pursuant to FAS 133. During the years     ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, the realized gains and     losses related to these hedges were not significant. The     notional amount of our economic hedges receiving hedge     accounting treatment and the losses, net of gains, recorded to     accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31,     2005 was $203 million and $200,000, respectively.

As a result of various     subleasing arrangements that we have entered into, we are     expecting approximately $9.4 million in sublease income     through 2012. There were no material capital leases at     December 31, 2005 and 2006.     Line     of Credit         In November 2006, we entered into a credit agreement which     provides for an unsecured $1 billion five-year revolving     credit facility. Loans under the credit agreement will bear     interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from     0.25 percent to 0.45 percent or (ii) a formula     based on the Bank of America, or Agents, prime rate or on     the federal funds effective rate. Subject to certain conditions     stated in the credit agreement, we may borrow, prepay and     reborrow amounts under the credit facility at any time during     the term of the credit agreement. Funds borrowed under the     credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital     expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes     of eBay and its subsidiaries. We entered into the credit     agreement in order to enhance our financial flexibility. As of     December 31, 2006, we had not borrowed any funds under the     credit agreement.     Litigation     and Other Legal Matters         In April 2001, two of our European subsidiaries, eBay GmbH and     eBay International AG, were sued by Montres Rolex S.A. and     certain of its affiliates in the regional court of Cologne,     Germany. The suit subsequently        95    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)        was transferred to the regional court in Düsseldorf,     Germany. Rolex alleged that our subsidiaries were infringing     Rolexs trademarks as a result of users selling counterfeit     Rolex watches through our German website. The suit also alleged     unfair competition. Rolex sought an order enjoining the sale of     Rolex-branded watches on the website as well as damages. In     December 2002, a trial was held in the matter and the court     ruled in favor of eBay on all causes of action. Rolex appealed     the ruling to the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf, and     the appeal was heard in October 2003. In February 2004, the     court rejected Rolexs appeal and ruled in our favor. Rolex     appealed the ruling to the German Federal Supreme Court, a     hearing took place before that court in December 2006, and a     decision is expected in the first half of 2007. In September     2004, the German Federal Supreme Court issued its written     opinion in favor of Rolex in a case involving an unrelated     company, ricardo.de AG, but somewhat comparable legal theories.     Although it is not yet clear what the ultimate effect of the     reasoning of the German Federal Supreme Courts ricardo.de     decision will have when applied to eBay, we believe the     Courts decision has resulted in an increase in similar     litigation against us in Germany, although we do not currently     believe that it will require a significant change in our     business practices.         In August 2006, Louis Vuitton Malletier and Christian Dior     Couture filed two lawsuits in the Paris Court of Commerce     against eBay Inc. and eBay International AG. The complaint     alleges we have violated French tort law by negligently     broadcasting listings posted by third parties offering     counterfeit items bearing plaintiffs trademarks, and by     purchasing certain advertising keywords. The plaintiffs seek     approximately EUR 35 million in damages. In or about     September 2006 Parfums Christian Dior, Kenzo Parfums, Parfums     Givenchy, and Guerlain Société also filed a lawsuit in     the Paris Court of Commerce against eBay Inc. and eBay     International AG. The complaint alleges that we have interfered     with the selective distribution network plaintiffs have     set up in France and the European Union by allowing third     parties to post listings offering genuine perfumes and cosmetics     for sale on our sites. The plaintiffs in this suit seek     approximately EUR 9 million in damages and injunctive     relief. We filed our initial briefs responding to the first     complaint in February 2007, and initial briefs in response to     the second complaint are due in April 2007. We believe that we     have meritorious defenses to these suits and intend to defend     ourselves vigorously. Other luxury brand owners have also filed     suit against us or have threatened to do so.         In September 2001, MercExchange LLC filed a complaint against     us, our Half.com subsidiary and ReturnBuy, Inc. in the     U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia     (No. 2:01-CV-736)     alleging infringement of three patents (relating to online     consignment auction technology, multiple database searching and     electronic consignment systems) and seeking a permanent     injunction and damages (including treble damages for willful     infringement). Following a trial in 2003, the jury returned a     verdict finding that we had willfully infringed the patents     relating to multiple database searching and electronic     consignment systems, and the court entered judgment for     MercExchange in the amount of approximately $30 million,     plus pre-judgment interest and post-judgment interest. In May     2006, following appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals for     the Federal Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court, the Supreme     Court remanded the case back to the district court for further     action. In parallel with the federal court proceedings, at our     request, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office agreed to     reexamine each of the patents in suit, finding that substantial     questions existed regarding the validity of the claims contained     in them. In separate actions in 2005, the Patent and Trademark     Office initially rejected all of the claims contained in the     three patents in suit. In March 2006, the Patent and Trademark     Office reiterated its earlier ruling rejecting the claims     contained in the patent that underlies the jury verdict, which     relates to electronic consignment systems. We have requested     that the district court stay all proceedings in the case pending     the final outcome of the reexamination proceedings, and     MercExchange has renewed its request that the district court     grant an injunction. The district court recently allowed     additional discovery regarding these matters, and final briefs     regarding both claims are due in March 2007. Even if successful,     our litigation of these matters will continue to be costly. As a     precautionary measure, we have modified certain functionality of     our websites and business practices in a manner which we believe     avoids any infringement of the consignment patent. For this     reason, we believe that any injunction that might be issued by     the district court will not have any impact on our business. We     also believe we have appropriate reserves for this litigation.     Nonetheless, if the modifications to the functionality of our     websites and business practices are not        96    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)        sufficient to make them non-infringing, we would likely be     forced to pay significant additional damages and licensing fees     and/or     modify our business practices in an adverse manner.         In June 2006, Net2Phone, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the     U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey     (No. 06-2469)     alleging that eBay Inc., Skype Technologies S.A., and Skype Inc.     infringed five patents owned by Net2Phone relating to     point-to-point     Internet protocol. The suit seeks an injunction against     continuing infringement, unspecified damages, including treble     damages for willful infringement, and interest, costs, and fees.     We have filed an answer and counterclaims asserting that the     patents are invalid, unenforceable, and not infringed. The     parties are in the process of conducting discovery, and we     expect a trial date to be scheduled for 2008. We believe that we     have meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves     vigorously.         In August 2006, Peer Communications Corporation filed a lawsuit     in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of     Texas     (No. 6-06CV-370)     alleging that eBay Inc., Skype Technologies S.A., and Skype Inc.     infringed two patents owned by Peer Communications relating to     uniform network access. The suit seeks an injunction against     continuing infringement, unspecified damages, and interest,     costs, and fees. The parties are in the process of conducting     discovery, and a trial date has been scheduled for October 2008.     We believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to     defend ourselves vigorously.         In September 2006, Mangosoft Intellectual Property, Inc. filed a     lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District     of Texas     (No. 2-06CV-390)     alleging that eBay Inc., Skype Technologies S.A., and Skype     Software S.a.r.l. infringed a patent owned by Mangosoft relating     to dynamic directory services. The suit seeks an injunction     against continuing infringement, unspecified damages, and     interest, costs, and fees. We have filed an answer and     counterclaims asserting that the patents are invalid,     unenforceable, and not infringed. We expect to receive the     courts scheduling order shortly. We believe that we have     meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.         Other third parties have from time to time claimed, and others     may claim in the future, that we have infringed their     intellectual property rights. We are subject to additional     patent disputes, and expect that we will increasingly be subject     to patent infringement claims as our services expand in scope     and complexity. In particular, we expect that we may face     additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects     of our Payments and Communications businesses. We have in the     past been forced to litigate such claims. We may also become     more vulnerable to third-party claims as laws such as the     Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Lanham Act and the     Communications Decency Act are interpreted by the courts, and as     we expand geographically into jurisdictions where the underlying     laws with respect to the potential liability of online     intermediaries like ourselves are either unclear or less     favorable. We believe that additional lawsuits alleging that we     have violated copyright or trademark laws will be filed against     us, especially in Europe. Intellectual property claims, whether     meritorious or not, are time consuming and costly to resolve,     could require expensive changes in our methods of doing     business, or could require us to enter into costly royalty or     licensing agreements.         From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or     regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of     business. The number and significance of these disputes and     inquiries are increasing as our business expands and our company     grows larger. Any claims or regulatory actions against us,     whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in     costly litigation, require significant amounts of management     time, and result in the diversion of significant operational     resources.     Indemnification     Provisions         In the ordinary course of business we have included limited     indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with     parties with whom we have commercial relations, including our     standard marketing, promotions and     application-programming-interface license agreements. Under     these contracts, we generally indemnify, hold harmless, and     agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or     incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by     any third party with respect to domain names, trademarks, logos     and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are     applicable to our performance under the subject agreement. In a     limited        97    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)        number of agreements, we have provided an indemnity for other     types of third-party claims, substantially all of which are     indemnities related to copyrights, trademarks, and patents. In     our PayPal business, we have provided an indemnity to our     payment processors in the event of certain third-party claims or     card association fines against the processor arising out of     conduct by PayPal. It is not possible to determine the maximum     potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to our     limited history of prior indemnification claims and unique facts     and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To     date, no significant costs have been incurred, either     individually or collectively, in connection with our     indemnification provisions.     Note 9      Related Party Transactions:         We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our     directors, executive officers and certain other officers. These     agreements require us to indemnify such individuals, to the     fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain     liabilities to which they may become subject as a result of     their affiliation with us.         All contracts with related parties are at rates and terms that     we believe are comparable with those entered into with     independent third parties. There were no material related party     transactions in 2004, 2005 and 2006. As of December 31,     2006, there were no significant amounts payable or amounts     receivable from related parties.     Note 10      Preferred Stock:         We are authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware     law: to issue Preferred Stock in one or more series; to     establish the number of shares included within each series; to     fix the rights, preferences and privileges of the shares of each     wholly unissued series and any related qualifications,     limitations or restrictions; and to increase or decrease the     number of shares of any series (but not below the number of     shares of a series then outstanding) without any further vote or     action by the stockholders. At December 31, 2005 and 2006,     there were 10 million shares of $0.001 par value     Preferred Stock authorized for issuance, and no shares issued or     outstanding.     Note 11      Common Stock:         Our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, authorizes us to     issue 3,580 million shares of common stock. A portion of     the shares outstanding are subject to repurchase or forfeiture     over a four-year period from the earlier of the issuance date or     employee hire date, as applicable. At December 31, 2005 and     2006 there were 40,000 and 551,676 shares subject to     repurchase rights or forfeiture, respectively.         At December 31, 2006, we had reserved 235.7 million     shares of common stock available for future issuance under our     stock option plans, including 137.1 million shares related     to outstanding stock options. In addition, as of     December 31, 2006, we had reserved approximately     4.0 million shares of common stock available for future     issuance under our deferred stock unit plan, and approximately     5.6 million shares of common stock available for future     issuance under our employee stock purchase plan.     Treasury     Stock         In July 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase     of up to $2.0 billion of the companys common stock     within two years from the date of authorization. The stock     repurchase program was announced in July 2006. During 2006, we     repurchased 54.5 million shares of our common stock at an     average price of $30.56 per share for an aggregate purchase     price of $1.7 billion. As of December 31, 2006,     $0.3 billion remained available for further purchases under     the July 2006 program. During 2006, we also repurchased     approximately 88,000 shares from employees.         These repurchased shares are recorded as treasury stock and are     accounted for under the cost method. No repurchased shares have     been retired.        98    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          The stock repurchase program may be limited or terminated at any     time without prior notice. Stock repurchases under this program     may be made through a variety of open market and privately     negotiated transactions, including structured stock repurchase     transactions or other derivative transactions, at times and in     such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded     from the companys working capital or other financing     alternatives. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased     will depend on a variety of factors including corporate and     regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions. The     program is intended to comply with the volume, timing and other     limitations set forth in     Rule 10b-18     under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.     Note 12      Stock-Based Plans:     Employee     Stock Purchase Plan         We have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible     employees. Under the plan, shares of our common stock may be     purchased over an offering period with a maximum duration of two     years at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first     day of the applicable offering period or on the last day of the     six-month purchase period. Employees may purchase shares having     a value not exceeding 10% of their gross compensation during an     offering period. During the years ended December 31, 2004,     2005, and 2006, employees purchased approximately     1.2 million, 1.4 million, and 1.6 million shares     at average prices of $20.66, $25.55 and $27.32 per share,     respectively. At December 31, 2006, approximately     5.6 million shares of common stock were reserved for future     issuance. Our employee stock purchase plan contains an     evergreen provision that automatically increases, on     each January 1, the number of shares reserved for issuance     under the employee stock purchase plan by the number of shares     purchased under this plan in the preceding calendar year.     Deferred     Stock Unit Plan         We have a deferred stock unit plan under which deferred stock     units have been granted to new non-employee directors elected to     our Board of Directors after December 31, 2002. Under this     plan, each new director receives a one-time grant of deferred     stock units equal to the result of dividing $150,000 by the fair     market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Each     deferred stock unit constitutes an unfunded and unsecured     promise by us to deliver one share of our common stock (or the     equivalent value thereof in cash or property at our election).     Each deferred stock unit award granted to a new non-employee     director upon election to the Board vests 25% one year from the     date of grant, and at a rate of 2.08% per month thereafter.     If the services of the director are terminated at any time, all     rights to the unvested deferred stock units shall also     terminate. In addition, directors may elect to receive, in lieu     of annual retainer and committee chair fees and at the time     these fees would otherwise be payable (i.e., on a quarterly     basis in arrears for services provided), fully vested deferred     stock units with an initial value equal to the amount of these     fees. Deferred stock units are payable following the termination     of a directors tenure as a director. All eBay officers,     directors and employees are eligible to receive awards under the     plan, although, to date, awards have been made only to new     non-employee directors. As of December 31, 2006,     36,056 units have been awarded under this plan.     Other     Equity Incentive Plans         We have equity incentive plans for directors, officers and     employees. Stock options granted under these plans generally     vest 25% one year from the date of grant (or 12.5% six months     from the date of grant for grants to existing employees) and the     remainder vest at a rate of 2.08% per month thereafter, and     generally expire 7 to 10 years from the date of grant.     Stock options issued prior to June 1998, were exercisable     immediately, subject to repurchase rights held by us, which     lapsed over the vesting period. At December 31, 2006,     614.8 million shares were authorized under our equity     incentive plans. Shares of restricted stock and restricted stock     units issued under these plans that have not vested are subject     to repurchase by us or forfeiture at such times as determined by     the Board of Directors, typically three to five years. At     December 31, 2006, 98.5 million shares were available     for future grant.        99    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)      Employee     Savings Plans         We have a savings plan, which qualifies under     Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participating     employees may contribute up to 25% of their annual salary, but     not more than statutory limits. In 2004, 2005 and 2006, we     contributed one dollar for each dollar a participant     contributed, with a maximum contribution of $1,500 per     employee. Our     non-U.S. employees     are covered by various other savings plans. Our expenses for     these plans were $5.6 million in 2004, $8.6 million in     2005 and $14.9 million in 2006.     Stock-Based     Compensation         We adopted FAS 123(R) using the modified prospective     transition method beginning January 1, 2006. Accordingly,     during 2006, we recorded stock-based compensation expense for     awards granted prior to, but not yet vested, as of     January 1, 2006, as if the fair value method required for     pro forma disclosure under FAS 123 were in effect for     expense recognition purposes, adjusted for estimated     forfeitures. For these awards, we have continued to recognize     compensation expense using the accelerated amortization method     under FIN 28. For stock-based awards granted after     January 1, 2006, we have recognized compensation expense     based on the estimated grant date fair value method using the     Black-Scholes valuation model. For these awards, we have     recognized compensation expense using a straight-line     amortization method. As FAS 123(R) requires that     stock-based compensation expense be based on awards that are     ultimately expected to vest, stock-based compensation for 2006     has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. When estimating     forfeitures, we consider voluntary termination behaviors as well     as trends of actual option forfeitures.     Valuation     Assumptions         We calculated the fair value of each option award on the date of     grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The     following weighted-average assumptions were used for each     respective period:                                       Year Ended December 31,             2004       2005       2006           Risk-free interest rates             2.5%            3.8%            4.7%           Expected life             3 years            3 years            3 years           Dividend yield             0%            0%            0%           Expected volatility             49%            36%            36%                  Our computation of expected volatility for 2006 was based on a     combination of historical and market-based implied volatility     from traded options on our stock. Prior to 2006, our computation     of expected volatility was based on historical volatility. Our     computation of expected life was determined based on historical     experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the     contractual terms of the stock-based awards, vesting schedules     and expectations of future employee behavior. The interest rate     for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on     the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of     grant.        100    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.

FAS 123(R) requires     cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits to be classified     as a part of cash flows from financing activities. Excess tax     benefits are realized tax benefits from tax deductions for     exercised options in excess of the deferred tax asset     attributable to stock compensation costs for such options. As a     result of adopting FAS 123(R), $92.4 million of excess     tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2006 have been     classified as a financing cash inflow. Cash received from option     exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for the     years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, was     $650.6 million, $599.8 million and     $313.5 million, respectively. Total stock-based     compensation costs included in capitalized development costs was     $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.     There was no stock-based compensation costs included in     capitalized development costs during 2005 and 2004.         Prior to the adoption of FAS 123(R), the intrinsic value of     Skypes and Shopping.coms unvested common stock     options assumed in the acquisition were recorded as unearned     stock-based compensation. Upon the adoption of FAS 123(R)     in January 2006, the unearned stock-based compensation balance     of $45.5 million was reclassified to additional paid-in     capital.

The weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted     during the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 was $12.12, $11.70 and     $10.47, respectively. During the years 2004, 2005 and 2006, the     aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under our equity     incentive plans was $1,017.3 million, $719.2 million     and $283.6 million, respectively, determined as of the date     of option exercise. As of December 31, 2006, there was     approximately $395.1 million of total unrecognized     compensation cost related to stock options granted under our     equity incentive plans. That cost is expected to be recognized     over a weighted-average period of three years.     Restricted     Stock Units and Nonvested Shares         Restricted stock units and nonvested shares were awarded to     employees under our equity incentive plans. In general,     restricted stock units and nonvested shares vest over three to     five years and are subject to the employees continuing     service to the company. The cost of restricted stock units and     nonvested shares is determined using the fair value of our     common stock on the date of the grant. The compensation expense     is recognized over the vesting period.        102    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.

There were no awards     vesting in 2005 and 2004. As of December 31, 2006, there     was approximately $12.8 million of unrecognized     compensation cost related to nonvested shares granted under our     equity incentive plans. That cost is expected to be recognized     over a weighted-average period of three years.     Non-stockholder     approved stock option grants         Prior to our initial public offering in 1998, our Board of     Directors approved three stock option grants outside of formally     approved stockholder plans to two independent directors upon     their joining our Board of Directors and to an executive officer     upon his hiring. All of such option grants vested over 25% one     year from the date of grant, with the remainder vesting at a     rate of 2.08% per month thereafter and expire 10 years     from the date of grant. The options granted to the independent     directors were immediately exercisable, subject to repurchase     rights held by us, which lapse over the vesting period. The     terms and conditions of such grants are otherwise identical to     nonqualified option grants made under the stock option plan in     effect at that time. At the time of such grants, members of our     Board of Directors (and their affiliates) beneficially owned in     excess of 90% of our then outstanding voting interests.

The utilization of a portion     of the NOLs is subject to an annual limitation under Section 382     of the Internal Revenue Code due to a change of ownership.     However, we do not believe such annual limitation will impact     our realization of the NOLs. If not utilized, the federal net     operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2019, the     state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in     2009, and the foreign net operating loss carryforwards will     begin to expire in 2009. As of December 31, 2006, our state     tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were     approximately $7.9 million. If not utilized, the state tax     credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2015.        105    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          We receive tax deductions from the gains realized by employees     on the exercise of certain non-qualified stock options for which     the benefit is recognized as a component of stockholders     equity. Historically, we have evaluated the deferred tax assets     relating to these stock option deductions along with our other     deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is     not required for that portion of the total deferred tax assets     that are not considered more likely than not to be realized in     future periods. To the extent that the deferred tax assets with     a valuation allowance become realizable in future periods, we     will have the ability, subject to carryforward limitations, to     benefit from these amounts. When realized, the tax benefits of     tax deductions related to stock options are accounted for as an     increase to additional paid-in capital rather than a reduction     of the income tax provision. Our profitability coupled with the     level of stock option deductions generated during 2006 resulted     in the utilization of net operating losses related to deferred     tax assets for stock option deductions. Accordingly the     valuation allowance related to these deferred tax assets was     eliminated in 2006, resulting in an increase of     $42.9 million in additional paid-in capital. Beginning in     2006, deferred tax assets related to stock option deductions     were recognized in the periods when the benefit was received.         We have not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign     withholding taxes on $1.9 billion of     non-U.S. subsidiaries     undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2006, because     such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the     operations and potential acquisitions of our International     operations. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of     dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to U.S. income     taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits). It is     not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might     be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed.     Note 14      Subsequent Events:         During January 2007, eBays Board of Directors     authorized the expansion of the share repurchase program to     provide for the repurchase of up to an additional     $2.0 billion of eBays common stock within the next     two years. See discussion of our stock repurchase program at     Note 11  Common Stock.         On February 13, 2007, we completed the acquisition of     StubHub, an online marketplace for the resale of event tickets,     for a total purchase price of approximately $307 million,     which included StubHubs net cash at the time of closing of     $21 million.
