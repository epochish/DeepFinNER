You can identify these forward-looking statements     by words such as may, will,     would, should, could,     expect, anticipate, believe,     estimate, intend, plan and     other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements     involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual     results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in     our forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties     include, among others, those discussed in Item 1A:     Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on     Form 10-K     as well as our consolidated financial statements, related notes,     and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this     report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange     Commission, or the SEC. We do not intend, and undertake no     obligation, to update any of our forward-looking statements     after the date of this report to reflect actual results or     future events or circumstances. Given these risks and     uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance     on such forward-looking statements.           ITEM 1:     BUSINESS       Overview         eBay Inc. was formed as a sole proprietorship in September 1995     and was incorporated in California in May 1996. In April 1998,     we reincorporated in Delaware, and in September 1998, we     completed the initial public offering of our common stock. Our     principal executive offices are located at 2145 Hamilton Avenue,     San Jose, California 95125, and our telephone number is     (408) 376-7400.     When we refer to we, our or     eBay in this Annual Report on     Form 10-K,     we mean the current Delaware corporation (eBay Inc.) and its     California predecessor, as well as all of its consolidated     subsidiaries. When we refer to eBay.com, we mean the     online marketplace located at www.ebay.com and its     localized counterparts. When we refer to PayPal, we     mean the online payments platform located at www.paypal.com     and its localized counterparts. When we refer to     Skype, we mean the Voice over Internet Protocol, or     VoIP, offerings provided by our subsidiary Skype Technologies     S.A.         Our purpose is to pioneer new communities around the world built     on commerce, sustained by trust and inspired by opportunity. We     provide online marketplaces for the sale of goods and services     as well as other online commerce, or ecommerce, platforms,     online payment solutions and online communications offerings to     a diverse community of individuals and businesses.         We operate three primary business segments: Marketplaces,     Payments and Communications. Our Marketplaces segment provides     the infrastructure to enable global online commerce on a variety     of platforms, including the traditional eBay.com platform, our     other online platforms, such as our online classifieds     businesses, our secondary tickets marketplace (StubHub), our     online shopping comparison website (Shopping.com), our apartment     listing service platform (Rent.com), as well as our fixed price     media marketplace (Half.com). Our Payments segment is comprised     of our online payment solutions PayPal and Bill Me Later (which     we acquired in November 2008). Our Communications segment, which     consists of Skype, enables VoIP calls between Skype users and     provides low-cost connectivity to traditional fixed-line and     mobile telephones.         We generate net transaction revenues from all three of our     business segments. Our net transaction revenues from our     Marketplaces segment are derived primarily from listing and     final value fees paid by sellers. For our Payments segment, net     transaction revenues are generated primarily by fees paid by     merchants for payment processing services. Our Communications     segment net transaction revenues are generated primarily from     fees charged to users to connect Skypes VoIP product to     traditional fixed-line and mobile telephones. These fees are     charged on a per-minute basis or on a subscription basis and we     refer to these minutes as SkypeOut minutes.         We generate marketing services and other revenues from all three     of our business segments. Our marketing services are derived     principally from the sale of advertisements, revenue sharing     arrangements, classifieds fees, lead referral fees. Other     revenues are derived principally from interest earned from banks     on certain PayPal        1    Table of Contents       customer account balances, interest and fees earned on the Bill     Me Later loan portfolio and from contractual arrangements with     third parties that provide services to all of our users.     Marketplaces         Our Marketplaces segment is comprised of online commerce     platforms that enable a global community of buyers and sellers     to interact and trade with one another. Our goal is to create,     maintain and expand the functionality, safety, ease-of-use and     reliability of our online commerce platforms while supporting     the growth and success of our community of users.     Marketplaces     Value Proposition         We seek to attract buyers and sellers to our community by     offering:                      Buyers         Sellers                   Selection                Access to broad global markets              Value                Efficient marketing and distribution     costs              Trust                Opportunity to increase sales              Convenience                       We believe our Marketplaces platforms make inefficient markets     more efficient because:                         Our global community of users can more easily and inexpensively     communicate, exchange information and complete transactions;                    Our Marketplaces platforms include more than 140.0 million     listings on any given day and make available to our users a wide     variety and selection of goods; and                    We bring buyers and sellers together in a more cost-effective     manner than traditional intermediaries and available     alternatives.           We seek to create a global platform that provides individuals     and businesses of all types and sizes with access to broad     markets. We have aggregated a significant number of buyers,     sellers and items listed for sale, which, in turn, has resulted     in a vibrant online commerce environment. Our sellers generally     enjoy good conversion rates selling goods on our Marketplaces     platforms and our buyers enjoy an extensive selection of goods     and services. Key components of our community philosophy are     maintaining honest and open marketplaces and treating individual     users with respect. We seek to maintain the satisfaction and     loyalty of our buyers and sellers by offering a variety of     community and support features, such as announcement and     bulletin boards, customer support boards and personal pages, as     well as other topical and category-specific information     exchanges.         Generally speaking, our Marketplaces platforms are more     effective, relative to available alternatives, at addressing     markets of scarce new goods, new items that are no longer     in-season, end-of-life products and used and vintage items. Our     highest growth in recent periods, however, has been in our     fixed-price listing format, primarily for new no longer     in-season items.         Our historical success has resulted largely from the size of our     community of active users. We had approximately     86.3 million active users at the end of 2008, compared to     approximately 83.2 million at the end of 2007. We define an     active user as any user who bid on, bought or listed an item     during the preceding     12-month     period.     Marketplaces     Platforms Overview         Our Marketplaces platforms seek to bring buyers and sellers     together through fully automated and easy-to-use online websites     that are generally available throughout the world at any time.     The platforms include software tools and services, some     available at no charge and others for a fee, that allow buyers     and sellers to trade with one another more easily and     efficiently. The Marketplaces platforms consist of our core     online commerce platform, eBay.com and its localized     counterparts, and adjacent platforms consisting of our     classifieds websites, as well as StubHub, Shopping.com,     Half.com, and Rent.com. Our Marketplaces platforms earn revenue     from, as the case may be,        2    Table of Contents       listing, feature, subscription and final value fees paid by     sellers, lead referral fees, transaction fees and advertising     fees.     eBay.com     Platform         Our Marketplaces core platform, eBay.com, includes our     traditional auction-style format and fixed-price format and has     a global presence in 39 markets. In 2008, our auction-style     listing format accounted for approximately 55% of our gross     merchandise volume, or GMV, which is the total value of all     successfully closed items between users on our Marketplaces     trading platform websites during the period, regardless of     whether the buyer and seller actually consummated the     transaction (excluding Rent.com, Shopping.com and our classified     websites). Our fixed-price listing format accounted for the     remaining 45% of our GMV in 2008.     Auction-Style     Listing Format         Our traditional auction-style format allows a seller to select a     minimum price for opening bids, with the option to set a reserve     price for the item, which is the minimum price at which the     seller is willing to sell the item. A seller with appropriate     feedback ratings can also sell in a Multiple     Item Auction format, which allows a seller to sell     multiple identical items to the highest bidders.     Fixed-Price     Listing Format         Our fixed-price format allows buyers and sellers to accelerate     the transaction process rather than waiting for the auction     period to expire. Sellers with appropriate feedback ratings are     allowed to name a price at the time the item is listed at which     they would be willing to sell the item to a buyer. Our Half.com     subsidiary also provides a fixed-price, person-to-person online     commerce platform that allows people to buy and sell new and     previously owned books, movies, music and games at discounted     prices.         In addition, eBay Stores enables sellers to exhibit all of their     listings in one place on our eBay platform and to describe their     respective businesses through customized pages. eBay Stores     provides sellers with useful tools to build, manage, promote and     track their businesses. Store Inventory Format     listings allow sellers to list items for a minimum     30-day     listing period at a lower insertion fee and higher final value     fee than regular auction-style and fixed-price listings. As of     December 31, 2008, there were approximately 516,000 online     storefronts established by users in locations around the world.     Key     Services for Buyers and Sellers         We have developed a number of features on our platforms in the     areas of Trust and Safety (including our Feedback Forum, Safe     Harbor Program and Verified Rights Owner Program), Customer     Support and Value-Added Tools and Services, as well as Loyalty     Programs (such as PowerSeller, top buyer and coupons and buyer     rewards). These features are designed to make users more     comfortable dealing with unknown trading partners and completing     commercial transactions on the Internet.     Feedback Forum:  Our Feedback Forum encourages     users to provide feedback ratings and comments on other users     with whom they trade. Users profiles, which include these     feedback ratings and comments, can be viewed by any of our other     users. Every registered user has a feedback profile that may     contain compliments, criticisms     and/or other     comments by users who have conducted business with that user.     The Feedback Forum requires feedback to be related to specific     transactions and provides an easy tool for users to match     specific transactions with the user names of their trading     partners. This information is recorded in a profile that     includes a feedback rating for the user, with feedback sorted     according to whether the feedback has been provided over the     past month, six months or twelve months. Users who develop     positive reputations have color-coded star symbols displayed     next to their user names to indicate the number of positive     feedback ratings they have received. In addition to leaving an     overall feedback rating (positive, neutral or negative) for a     seller, buyers also can leave anonymous Detailed Seller Ratings     (DSR) that cannot be viewed by the seller in four     areas: item as described, communication, shipping time and     shipping and handling charges. The Feedback Forum has several     automated features designed to detect and prevent certain forms     of abuse, such as a user leaving positive feedback about himself     or herself through multiple accounts. As a        3    Table of Contents       customer-focused company, we no longer allow sellers to leave     negative feedback for buyers and provide sellers with additional     tools designed to avoid negative feedback.     SafeHarbor Program:  We also offer the     SafeHarbor program, which provides guidelines for trading and     user dispute resolution. Our SafeHarbor staff investigates     users complaints of possible misuse of eBay platforms and     takes appropriate action, including issuing warnings to users,     ending and removing listings, or suspending users from bidding     on or listing items for sale.     Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) Program:  The VeRO     Program lets intellectual property rights owners request the     removal of listings that offer items or contain materials that     infringe on their rights. This helps to protect community     members from purchasing items that may be counterfeit or     otherwise unauthorized.     Customer Support:  We devote significant     resources to providing personalized, accurate and timely support     services to our community of users. Buyers and sellers can     contact us through a variety of means, including email, online     text chat and, in certain circumstances, telephone. We continue     to focus our resources on improving our accessibility,     increasing our capacity, expanding our category-specific     support, extending our online self-help features and improving     our systems and processes to allow us to provide efficient and     effective support. In addition, top eBay sellers who qualify for     our PowerSeller program receive prioritized customer support.     Value-Added Tools and Services:  eBay users     have access to a variety of pre-trade and     post-trade tools and services to enhance their user     experience and to make trading faster, easier and safer for     them. Pre-trade tools and services are intended to     simplify the listing process. Post-trade tools and     services are designed to make transactions easier and more     convenient to complete. These tools and services may not be     available in all international markets.         These tools and services include:                         Turbo Lister, eBay Blackthorne, ProStores, Selling Manager and     Selling Manager Pro, each of which helps to automate the selling     process;                    Shipping Calculator, which makes it easier for buyers and     sellers to calculate shipping costs;                    Shipping Labels, which allows sellers to print certain postage     and UPS labels;                    eBay To Go, which allows users to embed item listings in their     own Internet websites; and                    PayPal, which facilitates the online exchange of funds.           We currently provide these services directly or through     contractual arrangements with third parties.     PowerSeller program:  PowerSellers are     eBays top sellers who have consistently sustained a high     volume of monthly sales and who have a high level of positive     feedback. Members of the PowerSeller program get a range of     special benefits, including pricing discounts, prioritized     customer support, promotional offers, eBay promotional     merchandise, advanced selling education, opportunities to     participate in research and other special rewards. The     PowerSeller program is free of charge and a special PowerSeller     icon is located next to the sellers user name if the     seller qualifies for the program.     Top buyer program:  Our top buyers benefit from     having a special phone number to call if they have an     unsatisfactory user experience in connection with a transaction     on our websites. From time to time, we also offer special coupon     initiatives to top buyers.      Coupons and Buyer Rewards:  Coupons were given     to targeted buyers throughout 2008 to drive our GMV growth. We     introduced, on a limited basis, a buyer rewards program to     incentivize our larger buyers to remain loyal by offering cash     back through eBay bucks.     Best Match:  Buyers on eBay.com now see     best match as the default search result. The best     match algorithm determines which listings appear at the top of     searches based on, among other factors, relevance, detailed     seller ratings and shipping and handling charges. Best     Match is designed to enable buyers to find the items they     are looking for more quickly and easily, incentivize sellers to     provide better deals, reasonable or free shipping and        4    Table of Contents       excellent customer service, and reduce negative buying     experiences from sellers with high rates of buyer     dissatisfaction.

Classifieds     Websites         Our classifieds websites are available in hundreds of cities and     regions around the world and are designed to help people meet,     share ideas and trade on a local level. Our classifieds websites     include Kijiji, Den Blå Avis, Gumtree.com, LoQUo.com,     OpusForum, Marktplaats.nl and mobile.de. In addition, we have a     minority equity investment in craigslist, Inc., which operates     the craigslist classifieds websites around the world. Our     classified websites generate revenue primarily through     advertising.     Online     Advertising and Other Services         We work with strategic partners in a variety of areas, such as     online advertising, mailing and other services, that allow us to     extend the monetization of our platforms and user base. We work     with strategic partners and members of our affiliate advertising     network in a variety of areas, such as online advertising,     mailing and other services, that allow us to extend the     monetization of our platforms and user base. In 2008, we also     launched our own advertising service that enables third parties     to directly purchase text advertising promoting their eBay     listings and eBay stores to appear on our websites.     Shopping.com         Shopping.com is a leading comparison shopping destination     featuring products from thousands of merchants across the     Internet. Shopping.com offers one of the largest product     catalogs on the Internet  searchable by thousands of     attributes  along with consumer product reviews     through Epinions.com, which help users make informed buying     decisions. Shopping.coms revenue is earned primarily from     retailers who pay a fee for shoppers directed to their sites by     Shopping.com. In addition, Shopping.com is monetized through     advertising revenues.     Rent.com         Rent.com is a leading U.S. listing website in the rental     housing industry. The website is designed to bring apartment     seekers and apartment managers together in an efficient manner.     Landlords pay a fee to Rent.com for renters who indicate that     they have found their apartments through Rent.com.     Marketplaces     Growth Strategy         We will continue to work toward our goal of creating the     worlds leading ecommerce franchise by investing in our     core Marketplaces segment and continuing to build our adjacent     Marketplaces businesses.         Our growth strategy is focused on reinvesting in our customers,     improving the buyer experience and seller economics by enhancing     our products and services, improving Trust and Safety and     customer support, extending our product offerings into new     formats, categories and geographies, and experimenting with     various pricing and buyer retention strategies. We have made     significant changes in our three largest markets, the United     States, Germany and the United Kingdom to improve our buyer     experience over the course of 2008, with a series of pricing,     shipping and other changes. The pricing changes reduced the     upfront cost of listing fixed-price items on eBay so that fees     are now based more on the successful sale of items. In addition,     final value fees also have been rebalanced on a     category-by-category     basis. We encourage sellers to offer reasonable or free shipping     to our buyers by        5    Table of Contents       promoting their listings through our Best Match     search algorithm. We are also in the process of modifying the     payment process to enhance speed and reliability.         eBay strives to offer a wide variety of inventory ranging from     new in-season through end-of-life products, from different types     of sellers, in a broad variety of categories, with a favorable     buyer experience and a choice between auctions and fixed price     formats, all in one place. We believe that, if successful, these     measures will increase the number of items sold on our sites.         Another element of our growth strategy is to build adjacent     Marketplaces businesses, such as our classified platforms and     StubHub, which offer new formats and new monetization models, as     well as opportunities for growth beyond our core businesses.     Payments         Our payments segment is comprised of online payment     solutions  PayPal (which enables individuals and     businesses to securely, easily and quickly send and receive     payments online in approximately 190 markets worldwide) and Bill     Me Later (which we acquired in November 2008 and which enables     online U.S. merchants to offer, and U.S. consumers to     obtain, transactional credit at the point of sale). Our Payments     network builds upon the existing financial infrastructure to     create a global, real-time payment solution.     Payments     Value Proposition         We believe our payment solutions make online commerce more     efficient compared to traditional payment alternatives such as     checks, money orders and credit cards via merchant accounts.     These traditional payment alternatives present various obstacles     to the online commerce experience, including lengthy processing     time, inconvenience and high costs. Providing a more efficient     and effective payment alternative for users is essential to     creating a faster, easier and safer online commerce experience.     Our online payment solutions allow customers to send and receive     funds securely, easily and quickly, and facilitate transactional     credit for merchants and consumers.     Payments     Solution     Buyer     Value Proposition         PayPal enables buyers to pay merchants without sharing sensitive     financial information. To make payments, buyers need to disclose     only their email addresses to recipients. Buyers also benefit     from PayPals Buyer Protection Program, which reimburses     buyers using PayPal with respect to most purchases made on     eBay.com. When using Bill Me Later to obtain transactional     credit, buyers need to provide only their name, address, birth     date and the last four digits of their social security number.     Many buyers wary of disclosing financial information online find     the limited amount of information they are required to provide     attractive. Bill Me Later also offers U.S. buyers an     opportunity to defer payments; under some promotional     arrangements with select merchants, interest on such payments     can be deferred for as long as three to six months.     Seller     Value Proposition         PayPal offers online merchants an     all-in-one     payment processing solution that is less expensive than most     credit card merchant accounts, offers industry-leading fraud     prevention, and enables merchants to conduct business with     approximately 68.6 million PayPal registered active     accounts in approximately 190 markets. Many of these active     accounts prefer to use PayPal over other payment methods, which     may help merchants to increase sales volume. PayPal also offers     merchants the ability to maintain a direct relationship with     their customers. In addition, PayPal also offers a payment     gateway service that provides merchants who already have a     credit card merchant account with a secure connection from their     online store to their internet merchant account and their     payment processing network.         A merchant can generally open a PayPal account and begin     accepting credit card payments within a few minutes. Most     merchants are approved instantly for a PayPal account, and do     not need to provide a personal guaranty, acquire any specialized     hardware, prepare an application, contact a payment gateway or     securely store customer financial information that is maintained     by PayPal instead of the merchant. Furthermore, PayPal charges     lower transaction fees than most U.S. merchant accounts, and     charges no setup fees and few or no recurring monthly fees.        6    Table of Contents       The account-based nature of PayPals network helps us to     detect and prevent fraud when funds enter, flow through, and     exit the PayPal network. Sellers can also reduce the risk of     transaction losses resulting from unauthorized credit card use     and fraudulent chargebacks if they comply with PayPals     Seller Protection Policy.         U.S. merchants offering Bill Me Later provide buyers with     various transactional credit arrangements at the point of sale,     which may help to increase sales volume and average sales orders.     PayPal     Overview     Joining     the Network     PayPal offers three types of     accounts:  Personal, Business and Premier. A new     account holder typically opens an account to send money for an     eBay purchase or a purchase on another website, a payment for     services rendered, or a payment to an individual in lieu of cash     or check. Allowing new account holders to join the network when     they make or receive payments encourages PayPals natural,     user-driven growth. PayPals account     sign-up     process asks each new account holder to provide PayPal with his     or her name, street address, phone number and email address. The     account holders email address serves as the unique account     identifier. PayPal also offers certain customers who sell on     their own websites the ability to accept credit card payments     from buyers without requiring the buyer to open a PayPal account.     Payment     Transaction Overview         Buyers make payments at the PayPal website, at the eBay.com     website, or at the websites of merchants that have integrated     PayPals Website Payments or Express Checkout features. To     make a payment at PayPals website, a buyer logs in to his     or her account and enters the recipients email address and     the amount of the payment. To make a payment through eBay.com or     merchant websites, a buyer selects an item for purchase,     confirms the payment information and enters his or her email     address and password to authorize the payment. The buyer chooses     whether PayPal debits the money from the buyers PayPal     balance, credit card, or bank account and the payment is then     credited to the recipients PayPal balance. In some bank     account payments (which we call eCheck payments), the     transaction is held until the funds have cleared the     senders bank, which typically takes three to five business     days. Once the payment is completed, the recipient can make     payments to others or withdraw his or her funds at any time via     check (in the U.S.), electronic funds transfer, a PayPal-branded     debit card (which is only available to U.S. users), a     prepaid card (in the U.K.), or through a credit to a     recipients credit card account (in limited markets).         PayPal earns revenues in several ways:                         PayPal earns transaction fees when a Business or Premier account     receives a payment;                    PayPal earns a foreign exchange fee when an account holder     converts a balance from one currency to another;                    PayPal earns fees from merchants who utilize PayPals Pro     direct payment card processing services or Payflow gateway     processing services;                    PayPal earns fees when a user receives payments from outside the     users country of residence;                    PayPal may earn fees when a user withdraws money to certain bank     accounts, depending on the amount of the withdrawal;                    PayPal earns a return on certain customer balances; and                    Ancillary revenues are earned from a suite of financial     products, as described below.           PayPal incurs funding costs on payments at varying levels     depending on the source of the payment. Funding costs associated     with credit card and debit card funded payments are     significantly higher than bank account or balance-funded     payments. U.S. account holders who choose to maintain     PayPal balances in U.S. dollars have the ability to sweep     balances into the PayPal Money Market Fund. This Money Market     Fund, which is invested in a portfolio managed by Barclays     Global Fund Advisors, bore a current compound annual yield     of 0.52% as of February 12, 2009.        7    Table of Contents   Verification     of Account Holders         To fund payments from their bank accounts in the U.S., account     holders must first become verified by PayPal. The primary method     for verification is our patented Random Deposit technique. Under     this technique, PayPal makes two deposits ranging from 1 cent to     99 cents to the account holders bank account. To verify     ownership of the account, the account holder then enters the two     amounts as a four-digit code at the PayPal website. In addition     to allowing funding through bank accounts, verification also     removes some spending limits on account holders accounts     and gives them reputational advantages when transacting with     other members of the PayPal community. Outside of the U.S.,     similar verification processes are used for credit card accounts     and in the limited number of countries where PayPal offers bank     funding. In certain cases specific to local markets, bank funded     transactions are permitted up to set limits before additional     verification is required.     Withdrawing     Money         Each account holder in the U.S. and in 64 other countries     may withdraw money from his or her PayPal account through an     electronic fund transfer to his or her U.S. bank account or, in     40 of those countries, to their local bank account. In the U.S.     and seven other countries, users can withdraw their funds by a     mailed check. Withdrawals by electronic transfer in the U.S. may     take three to five business days to arrive in the account     holders bank account, depending on the bank, and make take     longer in other countries. Mailed checks may take one to two     weeks to arrive. Qualifying PayPal business users in the     U.S. can receive a PayPal ATM/debit card, which provides     these users with instant access to their PayPal account     balances. ATM/debit cardholders can withdraw cash from any ATM     connected to the Cirrus or Maestro networks and can make     purchases at any merchant accepting MasterCard. PayPal offers     customers the opportunity to apply for a Prepaid card in the     U.K., which can be linked to a customers PayPal account to     add or withdraw funds. In limited markets, customers can also     access their money by generating a credit to their credit card     account.     PayPals     Trust and Safety Programs         We have developed a number of PayPal trust and safety programs,     including PayPals Seller Protection and Buyer Protection     Programs. These programs provide additional protection to     certain account holders who pay or receive payment for their     transactions through PayPal on eBay. PayPals Seller     Protection Program covers sellers who follow specific shipping     and handling practices against claims that a transaction was not     authorized by the buyer or that the item was not received.     PayPals Buyer Protection Program reimburses the buyer in     full for qualified purchases on eBay.com at no cost if the buyer     does not receive the item or if the item is significantly not as     described. In some eBay localized markets, protection for buyers     is limited to a maximum amount per transaction. In addition, our     Risk Management and Fraud Investigation Teams focus on     identifying and preventing fraud before it occurs, detecting     fraud in process, mitigating loss if fraud does occur and     delivering information to law enforcement around the world to     better combat online fraud.     Bill     Me Later Transactional Credit         Bill Me Later offers U.S. online consumers a way to obtain     instant credit at the point of transaction. Bill Me Later is not     a chartered financial institution, and relies on CIT Bank to     extend credit to Bill Me Later customers with the Bill Me Later     service. When a consumer makes a purchase using the Bill Me     Later service, CIT Bank funds the consumer loan at the point of     sale and advances funds to the merchant. Bill Me Later     subsequently purchases the receivable related to the consumer     loan extended by CIT Bank. Bill Me Later accounts are most     commonly opened on a U.S. merchant site offering Bill Me     Later as a payment method, but can also be opened at the Bill Me     Later website. A buyer enters his or her birth date and the last     four digits of his or her social security number and, if     approved, Bill Me Later opens an account for the buyer. This     account can be used on any other U.S. merchant site     offering the Bill Me Later payment option. Once established,     customers can then manage their accounts online with access to     their transaction history and monthly statements and can elect     to establish recurring electronic monthly payments. Bill Me     Later earns the majority of its revenues by collecting interest     on the outstanding customer balances and collecting late fees,     as well as transaction fees from merchants.        8    Table of Contents       Bill Me Laters alternative payment solutions help     multichannel retailers to attract, satisfy and retain customers     at the point of sale. Through this offering, we believe that     merchants can make successful real-time retailing decisions, and     that multichannel online retailers of all sizes can develop an     effective payments strategy and  increase sales and satisfaction     by providing consumers with the secure, convenient and flexible     payment choices they demand. The Bill Me Later payment solution     is available on the websites of more than 1,000 online stores,     catalogs and travel partners, including Borders, Blue Nile,     Bluefly, Continental Airlines, eLUXURY, Fujitsu, JetBlue,     Overstock, QVC, Toshiba, Toys R Us,     U.S. Airways, Walmart.com and Zappos.     Payments     Growth Strategy         We seek to become the online payment solution of choice around     the world through our focus on simplifying and improving the     customer experience, striving to be the most secure method of     payment on the Internet, enhancing our product offering for our     merchants and utilizing multiple sales channels. To establish     PayPal and Bill Me Later as the online payment solution of     choice, we intend to continue focusing on increased user     adoption of PayPal on our Marketplaces platforms, continued     expansion of PayPals Merchant Services business and our     financial products business, and expanding the offerings of Bill     Me Later, including as a funding source for PayPal accounts, as     well as on an increasing number of merchant sites, including the     eBay Marketplace.     Marketplaces         PayPals services are integrated into the checkout flow of     the eBay.com platform in our key markets, including the U.S.,     Germany, the U.K. and Canada. In 2008, eBay.com generated     approximately $59.7 billion in GMV. PayPal, in turn,     generated approximately $30.4 billion of net Total     Payment Volume from eBay.com transactions, which represented     approximately 51% of PayPals net Total Payment Volume     during 2008. Net Total Payment Volume is the total dollar volume     of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed     through our Payments system, excluding PayPals payment     gateway business.         We intend to increase PayPals penetration of GMV on the     eBay.com platform globally by continuing to integrate PayPal     with eBay listings and new formats, including our adjacent     Marketplaces businesses, focusing on buyer and seller protection     programs and adding product features and innovations important     to the Marketplaces community. We believe that our expansion     into an increased number of international markets and currencies     will continue to make cross-border transactions easier and more     efficient, benefiting both our Marketplaces and Payments     segments.     PayPal     Merchant Services         Our Merchant Services business offers a differentiated product     solution for each merchant category, while providing a     cost-effective and secure payment solution across all     categories. In 2008, PayPal expanded its presence to ecommerce     websites such as those of American Airlines, Omaha Steaks,     Walmart.com, Zappos, BBC, Vodafone, Deutsche Post and Ferrari.     We intend to continue to market our global payments solution to     spur our growth as a payment solution off of eBay.com for sole     proprietors and small, medium and large businesses.         We also intend to grow our Merchant Services business by     enhancing our product offerings and leveraging our multiple     sales channels to expand our network of merchants globally.     Payments     Financial Products         We will continue to identify transactions and markets not served     adequately by existing payment systems and seek to develop     product features that improve upon those legacy systems. In     addition, we intend to expand the breadth of products and     services available to our account holders and to continue     offering financial products such as the following:                         PayPal ATM/Debit Card/Prepaid card, which enables business users     to withdraw funds from their PayPal accounts at ATMs, pay for     offline purchases with funds from their PayPal account, and in     the U.S. qualify to receive cash back on eligible purchases;                    PayPal Plus Credit Card and eBay MasterCard issued by GE Money     Bank, which allow users to earn rewards on purchases made     offline or using PayPal, as well as a PayPal Credit Card offered     to U.K. users through GE Money;          9    Table of Contents                         PayPal Plug In, which allows users to use their PayPal account     to make payments on the Internet everywhere that MasterCard is     accepted (including websites that do not accept PayPal);                    PayPal Money Market Fund, which allows participants to earn a     yield on the funds in their PayPal account; and                    Bill Me Later transactional point of sale credit, which allows     consumers to obtain instant credit at the point of transaction.       Communications         Our Communications segment is comprised of Skype. Skype is a     leading global Internet communications company and is     headquartered in Luxembourg, with offices in Europe, the     U.S. and Asia.     Skype     Value Proposition         Skype offers a simple and convenient way for people in almost     every country around the world to stay in touch over the     Internet through free voice and video calls, sending instant     messages, SMS (text messaging) or files, and by making low-cost     calls to landline and mobile numbers.     Skype     Overview         Skype is focused on becoming the worlds leading     communications software platform. Skype is software that     millions of people use everyday to make free voice and video     calls from one Skype user to another. Skype generates revenue     through its premium offerings, such as calls made to and from     landline and mobile phones, voicemail, call forwarding, and SMS.     Skype users can also purchase a variety of flat rate     subscriptions for regional and international calling to     landlines in many different countries.         Skypes online communications platform is built on the     following:                         Growing user base: Skype software has been downloaded more than     one billion times and is available in over 28 languages. As     of December 31, 2008, Skype had approximately     405.3 million registered users and was used in almost every     country around the world.                    Product features: Skypes product offerings are simple and     easy to use and enable high-quality voice and video calls.                    Strong technology: Skypes peer-to-peer network management,     voice/video processing, and scalability provide it with a     competitive advantage.                    A thriving ecosystem: As of December 31, 2008, there were     more than 190 Skype Certified hardware devices, and 15,000     third-party developers part of an ecosystem focused on enhancing     the Skype experience.       Skype     Growth Strategy         To expand upon Skypes position as a leading global     Internet communications company, we will continue to focus on     acquiring new active users, reducing the churn among our     existing users, and converting our users to Skypes premium     offerings. In addition, we expect that online communications     will go beyond the desktop PC and will be available across many     different devices and platforms. In this regard, we are focused     on leveraging our core desktop product, increasing relevance     among mobile users, diversifying among business users and     increasing our scalability through improvements to Skypes     platform.         Our strategy for driving growth in the core desktop product is     built around continuously improving the quality and ease-of-use     of our products, particularly with regard to voice and video     communications. For the mobile market, Skype is focused on     increasing consumers ability to bring their Skype     functionality with them through the development of downloadable     or pre-installed applications. We are also focused on expanding     Skype usage among businesses through the introduction of new     products, solutions, and partnerships designed to help     businesses save time and money and gain a competitive edge.     Skype also intends to work to become more scalable and     ubiquitous by making its communications platform capable of     working with other services, devices, and Web environments.        10    Table of Contents   Other     Items     Employees         As of December 31, 2008, eBay Inc. and its subsidiaries     employed approximately 16,200 people (including temporary     employees), approximately 9,950 of whom were located in the U.S.     Competition         We encounter vigorous competition in our businesses from     numerous sources. Our users can find, buy, sell and pay for     similar items through a variety of competing channels. These     include, but are not limited to, online and offline retailers,     distributors, liquidators, import and export companies, online     and offline auctioneers, catalog and mail-order companies,     classifieds, directories, search engines, products of search     engines, virtually all online and offline commerce participants     (consumer-to-consumer, business-to-consumer and     business-to-business), online and offline shopping channels and     networks. As our product offerings continue to broaden into new     categories of items and new commerce formats, we expect to face     additional competition from other online and offline channels     for those new offerings. We compete on the basis of price,     product selection, and services. Our growth rates in our most     mature markets have significantly slowed and we are losing     market share in some segments. For our Payments segment, our     users may choose to pay through a variety of alternative means,     including other online payment services, offline payment methods     such as cash, check or money order, and traditional online or     offline credit card merchant accounts. For our Communications     segment, our users may choose to use their local telephone     companies, cable providers and other VoIP providers. To compete     effectively, we may need to expend significant resources in     technology and marketing. These efforts may be expensive and     could reduce our margins and have a materially adverse effect on     our business, financial position, operating results and cash     flows and reduce the trading price of our stock. We believe that     we will be able to maintain profitability by preserving and     expanding the size and diversity of our users online     community and enhancing our user experience, but despite our     efforts, we may not be able to continue to manage our operating     expenses to avoid or reduce a decline in our consolidated net     income. For more information regarding these risks, see the     information in Item 1A: Risk Factors under the     caption Our industry is intensely competitive, and other     companies or governmental agencies may allege that our behavior     is anti-competitive.     Seasonality         Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter     of sequential revenue growth. However, this was not the case in     2008 due primarily to the impact of the global economic     environment and the strengthening U.S. dollar, which     impacted the fourth quarter in particular. We expect transaction     activity patterns on our websites to increasingly mirror general     consumer buying patterns. Please see the information in     Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of     Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the     heading Seasonality.     Technology     Marketplaces     and Payments         Our Marketplaces and Payments platforms utilize a combination of     proprietary technologies and services as well as technologies     and services provided by others. We have developed intuitive     user interfaces, customer tools and transaction processing,     database and network applications that help enable our users to     reliably and securely complete transactions on our sites. Our     technology infrastructure simplifies the storage and processing     of large amounts of data, eases the deployment and operation of     large-scale global products and services and automates much of     the administration of large-scale clusters of computers. Our     infrastructure has been designed around industry-standard     architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or     catastrophic occurrences. We are continually improving our     technology to enhance the customer experience and to increase     efficiency, scalability and security. For information regarding     technology related risks, see the information in     Item 1A: Risk Factors under the captions     Our failure to cost-effectively manage certain aspects of     our business could harm us, and System failures     could harm our business.        11    Table of Contents   Communications         Skypes VoIP communication and other services are delivered     through a peer-to-peer network architecture, in which users     joining the network provide a significant portion of the     technology resources (for example, computer bandwidth and     hardware) that enable Skypes products. To access     Skypes products, users download Skype software over the     Internet. Skype utilizes a combination of proprietary     technologies and products as well as technologies and products     provided by third parties to design, develop and support its     products. For more information regarding Skypes technology     risks, see the information in Item 1A: Risk     Factors under the caption Skype depends on key     technology that is licensed from third parties.     Intellectual     Property         We regard the protection of our intellectual property as     critical to our success. We have entered into confidentiality     and invention assignment agreements with our employees and     contractors, and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom     we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure     of our proprietary information.         We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by     relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as a     variety of administrative procedures. We actively pursue the     registration of our trademarks, copyrights, patents and domain     names in the U.S. and international jurisdictions. The     expansion of our business has required us to protect our     trademarks, patents and domain names in an increasing number of     jurisdictions, a process that is expensive, may require     litigation, and may not be successful in every location. We have     registered our core brands as trademarks and domain names in the     U.S. and a large number of other jurisdictions and have in     place an active program to continue to secure trademarks and     domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of     interest. If we are unable to secure our trademarks or domain     names, we could be adversely affected in any jurisdiction in     which our trademarks or domain names are not registered.         Third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may     claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual     property rights. We currently are involved in several such legal     proceedings. Please see the information in Item 3:     Legal Proceedings and in Item 1A: Risk     Factors under the captions We are subject to patent     litigation and We may be unable to protect or     enforce our own intellectual property rights adequately.     Segments     and Geographic Information         For an analysis of financial information about our segments as     well as our geographic areas, see Note 4      Segments to our consolidated financial statements included     elsewhere in this Annual Report on     Form 10-K.

Other events that we do not currently anticipate     or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results     of operations and financial condition.     Our     operating results may decline.         Our operating results have varied on a quarterly basis during     our operating history. Our operating results may fluctuate     significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which     are outside our control. Factors that may affect our operating     results include the following:                         general economic conditions, including the possibility of a     severe and protracted recession in the U.S. and worldwide     economic slowdown; recent disruptions to the credit and     financial markets in the U.S. and worldwide; and those     economic conditions specific to the Internet, ecommerce and     payments industries;                    our ability to retain an active user base, attract new users,     and encourage existing users to list items for sale, purchase     items through our websites, or use our payment service or     communication software and products, especially when consumer     spending is contracting;                    our ability to reduce the loss of active buyers and sellers and     increase activity of the users of our Marketplaces business,     especially with respect to our top buyers and sellers, and     especially in the U.S., Germany and the U.K.;                    our ability to successfully integrate and manage businesses that     we acquire, including new needs to manage credit risks and bad     debts following our acquisition of Bill Me Later in November     2008;                    our ability to manage funding costs associated with our new Bill     Me Later business;                    the volume, velocity, size, timing, monetization, and completion     rates of transactions using our websites or technology;                    the amount and timing of operating costs and capital     expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our     businesses, operations, and infrastructure;                    the primary and second-order effects of previously announced and     possible future changes to our pricing, products and policies,     including, among other changes: a reduced emphasis on upfront     fees (e.g., insertion fees for listings) and corresponding     increases in success-based fees (e.g., final value fees for sold     items); new algorithms for determining which listings appear at     the top of searches (Best Match); changes to buyer and seller     feedback criteria; tighter seller standards, which may restrict     some sellers from selling on our websites even if they have been     able to do so historically; new restrictions or holds on     payments made to certain sellers or in connection with certain     categories of higher-risk transactions; new incentives and     rewards for top PowerSellers; increased protection for buyers     who pay for eligible transactions on eBay.com using PayPal, as     well as improved seller protection for U.S. eBay sellers     against certain claims, chargebacks and reversals; lower     insertion fees for, and extended duration of, listings of     fixed-price items; shipping and handling limits on certain     categories of items (e.g., media); and requiring sellers to     accept at least one accepted payment method (and restricting     sellers from referencing non-permitted payment methods,     including paper forms of payment such as checks and money     orders), on eBay.com in the U.S. for most categories of     items;                    regulatory and legal actions imposing obligations on our     businesses or our users, including the injunction related to     certain cosmetic and perfume brands (see     Item 3  Legal Proceedings below);                    new laws or regulations, or interpretations of existing laws or     regulations, that impose liability on us for actions of our     users or otherwise harm our business models or restrict the     Internet, electronic commerce, online payments, or online     communications;          13    Table of Contents                         our ability to meet regulatory requirements as we expand the     range and geographical scope of PayPals services and the     range of services (and marketing programs) offered by Skype;                    the actions of our competitors, including the introduction of     new sites, services, and products;                    consumer confidence in the safety and security of transactions     using our websites or technology and our ability to manage the     costs of our user protection programs;                    our ability to manage PayPals payment funding mix and the     transaction loss rate in our Payments business;                    the costs and results of litigation that involves us;                    our ability to develop product enhancements, programs, and     features at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner;                    our ability to upgrade and develop our systems, infrastructure,     and customer service capabilities to accommodate growth and to     improve our websites at a reasonable cost while maintaining 24/7     operations;                    technical difficulties or service interruptions involving our     websites or services provided to us or our users by third     parties;                    our ability to comply with the requirements of entities whose     services are required for our operations, such as credit card     networks and banks;                    our ability to manage, profitably expand and effectively     monetize the Skype business;                    our ability to manage our businesses following recent reductions     in our workforce;                    the cost and availability of online and traditional advertising,     and the success of our brand building and marketing campaigns;                    our ability to attract new personnel in a timely and effective     manner and to retain key employees;                    the continued healthy operation of our technology suppliers and     other parties with which we have commercial relations;                    continued consumer acceptance of the Internet as a medium for     commerce and communication in the face of increasing publicity     about fraud, spoofing, phishing, viruses, spyware, malware and     other dangers of the Internet; and                    macroeconomic and geopolitical events affecting commerce     generally.           The increased variety of services offered on our websites makes     it difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our     revenues or earnings accurately. In view of the rapidly evolving     nature of our business, we believe that period-to-period     comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and     you should not rely upon them as an indication of future     performance. We do not have backlog, and substantially all of     our net revenues each quarter come from transactions involving     sales or payments during that quarter. Due to the inherent     difficulty in forecasting revenues, it is also difficult to     forecast income statement expenses as a percentage of net     revenues. Quarterly and annual income statement expenses as a     percentage of net revenues may be significantly different from     historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or     more future quarters may fall below the expectations of     securities analysts and investors. In that event, the trading     price of our common stock would almost certainly decline.         We invest heavily in marketing and promotion, customer support,     protection programs, technology and further development of the     operating infrastructure for our core and non-core operations.     Some of this investment entails long-term contractual     commitments. As a result, we may be unable to adjust our     spending rapidly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenue     shortfall, which may harm our profitability. Growth rates of our     Marketplaces businesses in our most established markets, such as     the U.S., Germany and the U.K., have continued to decline.     Despite our efforts to stem these declines, growth rates in     these and other markets may continue to decline. As our     penetration in established markets grows, we will increasingly     need to focus on keeping existing users, especially our top     buyers and sellers, active and increasing their activity level     on our websites in order to continue to grow our business. In     addition, our Marketplaces business is facing increased     competitive pressure. If        14    Table of Contents       we are unable to change our services in ways that reflect the     changing demands of the ecommerce marketplace, particularly the     higher growth of sales of fixed-price items and higher service     levels, our business will suffer.         In January and June 2008, we announced significant changes to     our Marketplaces business in four major areas: fee structure,     seller incentives, standards and buyer and seller feedback and     increased buyer and seller protections in the U.S. In     August 2008, we announced a series of pricing, shipping and     other changes for our Marketplaces business in our three largest     markets: the U.S., Germany and the U.K. We may make further     changes in these or other areas in the future. Some of the     changes that we have announced to date have been controversial     with, and led to dissatisfaction among, our sellers, and     additional changes that we announce in the future may also be     negatively received by a number of our sellers. Given the number     of recent changes that we have made to our policies and pricing,     it may take a number of our sellers some time to fully assess     and adjust to these changes, and sellers may elect to reduce     volume while making such assessments and adjustments. If any of     these changes cause sellers to move their business (in whole or     in part) away from our websites or otherwise fail to improve     gross merchandise volume or the number of successful listings,     our operating results and profitability will be harmed.         In addition, because a large percentage of PayPal transactions     originate on the eBay platform, declines in growth rates in     major Marketplaces markets also adversely affect PayPals     growth rate. The expected future growth of our PayPal, Skype,     StubHub, and other lower margin businesses may also cause     downward pressure on our profit margins because those businesses     have lower gross margins than our Marketplaces platforms.     An     economic recession could harm our business.         Our Marketplaces and Payments businesses are dependent on     consumer purchases. The current economic downturn has resulted     in reduced selling prices and may reduce the volume of purchases     on our Marketplaces platforms and the volume of transactions     paid for using our PayPal payment service, and adversely affect     our business. In addition, an economic downturn will likely     continue to require us to increase our reserves for bad debt and     transaction losses. Continuing poor economic conditions will     likely continue these trends.     We are     exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest     rates.         Because we conduct a significant and growing portion of our     business outside the United States but report our results in     U.S. dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in     currency exchange rates. In connection with its multi-currency     service, PayPal fixes exchange rates twice per day, and may face     financial exposure if it incorrectly fixes the exchange rate or     if exposure reports are delayed. PayPal also holds some     corporate and customer funds in     non-U.S. currencies,     and thus its financial results are affected by the translation     of these     non-U.S. currencies     into U.S. dollars. In addition, the results of operations     of many of our internationally focused websites are exposed to     foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of     the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local     currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. If the     U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the     translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions     will result in increased net revenues, operating expenses, and     net income. Similarly, our net revenues, operating expenses, and     net income will be negatively impacted if the U.S. dollar     strengthens against foreign currencies, as happened in the     second half of 2008. Based on changes in foreign currency rates     year over year, net revenues in the fiscal year ended     December 31, 2008 were positively impacted by foreign     currency translation of $190.9 million, compared to the     prior fiscal year. However, net revenues in the three months     ended December 31, 2008 were negatively impacted by foreign     currency translation of $104.9 million, compared to the     same period of the prior fiscal year. Similarly, based on     changes in foreign currency rates year over year, operating     income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 was     positively impacted by foreign currency translation of     $130.6 million, compared to the prior fiscal year, but     operating income for the three months ended December 31,     2008 was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of     $39.0 million, compared to the same period of the prior     fiscal year. As exchange rates vary, net sales and other     operating results, when translated, may differ materially from     expectations. In particular, to the extent the U.S. dollar     strengthens against the Euro, British pound, Australian dollar,     or Canadian dollar, our foreign revenues and profits will be     reduced as a result of these translation adjustments. While from     time to time we enter into transactions to hedge portions of our     foreign currency translation exposure, it is impossible to     perfectly predict or completely eliminate the effects of this     exposure. In addition, to the extent the U.S. dollar     strengthens against the Euro, the British pound, the Australian     dollar, and the Canadian dollar, cross-border trade related to     purchases of dollar-denominated goods        15    Table of Contents       by     non-U.S. purchasers     will likely decrease, and that decrease will likely not be     offset by a corresponding increase in cross-border trade     involving purchases by U.S. buyers of goods denominated in     other currencies, adversely affecting our business.         In addition, we face exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.     For example, recent reductions in interest rates have reduced     our investment income, including income we earn on PayPal     balances, which in turn has materially lowered our net interest     income.     The     listing or sale by our users of pirated or counterfeit items may     harm our business.         We have received in the past, and we anticipate receiving in the     future, communications alleging that certain items listed or     sold through our service by our users infringe third-party     copyrights, trademarks and trade names, or other intellectual     property rights. Although we have sought to work actively with     the owners of intellectual property rights to eliminate listings     offering infringing items on our websites, some rights owners     have expressed the view that our efforts are insufficient.     Content owners and other intellectual property rights owners     have been active in asserting their purported rights against     online companies, including eBay. Allegations of infringement of     intellectual property rights have resulted in threats of     litigation and actual litigation against us from time to time by     rights owners, including litigation brought by luxury brand     owners such as Tiffany & Co. in the U.S., Rolex S.A.     in Germany, Louis Vuitton Malletier and Christian Dior Couture     in France, LOréal SA, Lancôme Parfums et     Beauté & Cie, and Laboratoire Garnier & Cie     in several European countries. The plaintiffs in these cases     seek to hold eBay liable for alleged counterfeit items listed on     our sites by third parties, for tester and other not     for resale consumer products listed on our sites by third     parties, for the alleged misuse of trademarks or copyrights in     listings or otherwise on our sites, or in connection with paid     search advertisements, or for alleged violations of selective     distribution channel laws or parallel import laws for listings     of authentic items. Such plaintiffs seek, among other things,     injunctive relief and damages. In the aggregate, these suits     could result in significant damage awards and could adversely     affect our business. In June 2008, the Paris Court of Commerce     ruled in the Louis Vuitton Malletier and Christian     Dior Couture cases that eBay and eBay International AG were     liable for failing to prevent the sale of counterfeit items on     its websites that traded on plaintiffs brand names and for     interfering with the plaintiffs selective distribution     network. The court awarded the plaintiffs approximately     EUR 38.6 million in damages and issued an injunction     prohibiting all sales of perfumes and cosmetics bearing the     Dior, Guerlain, Givenchy and Kenzo brands over all worldwide     eBay sites to the extent they are accessible from France. We     have taken measures to comply with the injunction and have     appealed these rulings. However, these and similar suits may     force us to modify our business practices, which could lower our     revenue, increase our costs or make our websites less convenient     to our customers. Any such results could materially harm our     business.         In addition to litigation from rights owners, we may be subject     to regulatory, civil or criminal proceedings and penalties if     the authorities feel we have aided in the sale of counterfeit     goods. While we have had some early success in defending against     such litigation, more recent cases have been based, at least in     part, on different legal theories than those of earlier cases,     and there is no guarantee that we will continue to be successful     in defending against such litigation. For example, the German     Federal Supreme Court has ruled that we may owe duties, under     certain circumstances, to content owners and competitors     relating to taking reasonable steps to prevent the listing of     illegal, counterfeit, and pirated items. Plaintiffs in recent     cases have argued that we are not entitled to safe harbors under     the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the U.S. or as a     hosting provider in the European Union because of the alleged     active nature of our involvement with our sellers, and that,     whether or not such safe harbors are available, we should be     found liable because we supposedly have not adequately removed     counterfeit listings or effectively suspended users who have     created such listings. We are constantly improving and modifying     our efforts to eliminate counterfeit and pirated items. These     improvements are in response to ongoing business initiatives     designed to reduce bad buyer experiences and improve customer     satisfaction as well as in response to new patterns we are     seeing among counterfeiters and others committing fraud on our     users. Notwithstanding these efforts, we believe that the legal     climate, especially in Europe, is becoming more adverse to our     arguments, which may require us to take actions which could     lower our revenues, increase our costs, or make our websites     less convenient to our customers, which may materially harm our     business. In addition, a public perception that counterfeit or     pirated items are commonplace on our site, even if factually     incorrect, could damage our reputation and our business.        16    Table of Contents       Content owners and other intellectual property rights owners may     also seek to bring legal action against entities that are     peripherally involved in the sale of infringing items, such as     payment companies. To the extent that intellectual property     rights owners bring legal action against PayPal based upon the     use of PayPals payment services in a transaction involving     the sale of infringing items, including on our websites, our     business could be harmed.     We are     subject to patent litigation.         We have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other     parties patents. Some of these ongoing suits are described     under the heading Item 3  Legal     Proceedings, below. We are a defendant in other patent     suits and we have been notified of several other potential     patent disputes, and expect that we will increasingly be subject     to patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our     Marketplaces, Payments and Communications businesses as our     services expand in scope and complexity. These claims, whether     meritorious or not, are time consuming and costly to resolve,     and could require expensive changes in our methods of doing     business, could require us to enter into costly royalty or     licensing agreements, or could require us to cease conducting     certain operations.     Use of     our services for illegal purposes could harm our     business.         The law relating to the liability of providers of online     services for the activities of their users on their service is     often challenged in the U.S. and internationally. In     violation of our policies, unlawful goods and stolen goods have     been listed and traded on our services. We may be unable to     prevent our users from selling unlawful or stolen goods or     unlawful services or selling goods or services in an unlawful     manner, and we may be subject to allegations of civil or     criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by users     through our services. We have been subject to several lawsuits     based upon such allegations. In December 2004, an executive of     Baazee.com, our Indian subsidiary, was arrested in connection     with a users listing of a pornographic video clip on that     website. We continue to contest the charges related to this     arrest. Similarly, our Korean subsidiary and one of its     employees were found criminally liable for listings on the     Korean subsidiarys website. The German Federal Supreme     Court has ruled that we may have a duty to take reasonable     measures to prevent prohibited DVDs from being sold on our site     to minors and that competitors may be able to enforce this duty.     In a number of circumstances, third parties have alleged that     our services aid and abet certain violations of certain laws,     including antiscalping laws with respect to the resale of     tickets, laws regarding the sale of counterfeit items, the     fencing of stolen goods, and restrictive distribution laws and     distance selling laws.         Although we have prohibited the listing of stolen goods and     certain high-risk items and implemented other protective     measures, we may be required to spend substantial resources to     take additional protective measures or discontinue certain     service offerings, any of which could harm our business. Any     costs incurred as a result of potential liability relating to     the alleged or actual sale of unlawful goods or the unlawful     sale of goods could harm our business. In addition, we have     received significant and continuing media attention relating to     the listing or sale of unlawful goods and stolen goods using our     services. This negative publicity, even if factually incorrect,     could damage our reputation, diminish the value of our brand     names and make users reluctant to use our services.         PayPals payment system is also susceptible to potentially     illegal or improper uses. These may include illegal online     gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illicit sales     of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of     software and other intellectual property, money laundering, bank     fraud, child pornography trafficking, prohibited sales of     alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, and online securities     fraud. Recent changes in law have increased the penalties for     intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal     activities. Despite measures PayPal has taken to detect and     lessen the risk of this kind of conduct, including PayPals     ability to take legal action to recover its losses for certain     violations of its acceptable use policy, illegal activities     could still be funded using PayPal. Any resulting claims or     liabilities could adversely affect our business.     We are     subject to risks associated with information disseminated     through our service.         The law relating to the liability of online services companies     for information carried on or disseminated through their     services is often unsettled. Claims could be made against online     services companies under both U.S. and foreign law for     defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or     trademark infringement, or        17    Table of Contents       other theories based on the nature and content of the materials     disseminated through their services. Several private lawsuits     seeking to impose liability under a number of these theories     have been brought against us, as well as other online service     companies. In addition, domestic and foreign legislation has     been proposed that would prohibit or impose liability for the     transmission over the Internet of certain types of information.     Our service features a Feedback Forum, which includes     information from users regarding other users. Although all such     feedback is generated by users and not by us, claims of     defamation or other injury have been made in the past and could     be made in the future against us for not removing content posted     in the Feedback Forum.         Furthermore, several court decisions arguably have narrowed the     scope of the immunity provided to Internet service providers     like us under the Communications Decency Act. For example, the     Ninth Circuit recently held that certain immunity provisions     under the Communications Decency Act might not apply to the     extent that a website owner materially contributes to the     development of unlawful content on its website. In addition, the     Paris Court of Commerce has ruled in the Louis Vuitton     Malletier and Christian Dior Couture cases that     applicable laws protecting passive internet hosts     from liability are inapplicable to eBay given that the content     in question was provided by users under eBays control and     authority. This trend, if continued, may increase our potential     liability to third parties for the user-provided content on our     sites, particularly in jurisdictions outside the U.S. where     laws governing Internet transactions are unsettled. If we become     liable for information provided by our users and carried on our     service in any jurisdiction in which we operate, we could be     directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures     to reduce our exposure to this liability, including expending     substantial resources or discontinuing certain service     offerings, which would negatively affect our financial results.     In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability     issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals     could require us to incur additional costs and harm our     reputation and our business.     Government     inquiries may lead to charges or penalties.         A large number of transactions occur on our websites on a daily     basis. Government regulators have received a significant number     of consumer complaints about both eBay and PayPal, which, while     small as a percentage of our total transactions, are large in     aggregate numbers. As a result, from time to time we have been     contacted by various foreign and domestic governmental     regulatory agencies that have questions about our operations and     the steps we take to protect our users from fraud. PayPal has     received inquiries regarding its restriction and disclosure     practices from the Federal Trade Commission and regarding these     and other business practices from the attorneys general of a     number of states. In September 2006, PayPal entered into a     settlement agreement with the attorneys general of a number of     states under which it agreed to pay $1.7 million to the     attorneys general, shorten and streamline its user agreement,     increase educational messaging to users about funding choices,     and communicate more information regarding protection programs     to users. We currently face inquiries from government regulators     in various jurisdictions related to actions that we have taken     that are designed to improve the safety of transactions on our     websites, most notably by requiring PayPal to be offered     and/or used     for certain high-risk transactions or by certain sellers in     certain jurisdictions, and we may face similar inquires from     other government regulators in the future. For example, the     Reserve Bank of Australia is currently reviewing our policy     requiring sellers to offer PayPal as a payment alternative on     most transactions on our localized Australian website and     precluding sellers from imposing a surcharge or any other fee     for accepting PayPal as a payment method. Similarly, Bill Me     Later has from time to time received customer complaints that     could result in investigations into Bill Me Laters     business practices by state or federal regulators. As a result     of the current credit crisis, we expect new laws and regulations     to be imposed on providers of credit. We are likely to receive     additional inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future,     including under existing or new credit laws or regulations,     which may lead to action against us. We have responded to all     inquiries from regulatory agencies by describing our current and     planned antifraud efforts, customer support procedures,     operating procedures and disclosures. If one or more of these     agencies is not satisfied with our response to current or future     inquiries, we could be subject to enforcement actions, fines or     other penalties, or forced to change our operating practices in     ways that could harm our business.     We are     subject to general litigation and regulatory     disputes.         From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or     regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of     business. The number and significance of these disputes and     inquiries have increased as our business expands and        18    Table of Contents       our company grows larger. We have in the past been forced to     litigate such claims. We may also become more vulnerable to     third-party claims as laws such as the Digital Millennium     Copyright Act, the Lanham Act and the Communications Decency Act     are interpreted by the courts and as we expand geographically     into jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the     potential liability of online intermediaries such as ourselves     are either unclear or less favorable. Any claims or regulatory     actions against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time     consuming result in costly litigation, damage awards, injunctive     relief, or increased costs of business through adverse judgment     or settlement, require us to change our business practices in     expensive ways, require significant amounts of management time,     result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or     otherwise harm our business.     Failure     to deal effectively with fraudulent transactions and customer     disputes would increase our loss rate and harm our     business.         Beginning in October 2008, buyers who pay for transactions on     eBay.com with PayPal are protected on eligible transactions for     the full amount of an items purchase price if the buyer     does not receive the goods they purchased or if the goods differ     significantly from what was described by the seller.     Furthermore, U.S. sellers on eBay.com have received     improved seller protection for eligible transactions in which     the seller is paid with PayPal, in that they are covered against     payment reversals due to buyer claims of an unauthorized payment     or an item that was not received, so long as the seller follows     specified shipping and handling practices. We also enhanced our     buyer and seller protections in certain eBay international     marketplaces. These changes to PayPals buyer protection     program could result in future increases and fluctuations in our     Payments transaction loss rate. For the fiscal years ended     December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2008, our Payments     transaction losses (including both direct losses and buyer     protection payouts) totaled $139.3 million and     $171.5 million, representing 0.29% and 0.29% of our     net Total Payment Volume in each period, respectively.         PayPals highly automated and liquid payment service makes     PayPal an attractive target for fraud. In configuring its     service, PayPal continually strives to maintain the right     balance of appropriate measures to promote both convenience and     security for customers. Identity thieves and those committing     fraud using stolen credit card or bank account numbers can     potentially steal large amounts of money from businesses such as     PayPal. We believe that several of PayPals current and     former competitors in the electronic payments business have gone     out of business or significantly restricted their businesses     largely due to losses from this type of fraud. While PayPal uses     advanced anti-fraud technologies, we expect that technically     knowledgeable criminals will continue to attempt to circumvent     PayPals anti-fraud systems using increasingly     sophisticated methods. In addition, PayPals service could     be subject to employee fraud or other internal security     breaches, and PayPal may be required to reimburse customers for     any funds stolen as a result of such breaches. Merchants could     also request reimbursement, or stop using PayPal, if they are     affected by buyer fraud.         PayPal incurs substantial losses from merchant fraud, including     claims from customers that merchants have not performed or that     their goods or services do not match the merchants     description. PayPal also incurs losses from claims that the     customer did not authorize the purchase, from buyer fraud, from     erroneous transmissions, and from customers who have closed bank     accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments.     In addition to the direct costs of such losses, if they are     related to credit card transactions and become excessive, they     could result in PayPal losing the right to accept credit cards     for payment. If PayPal were unable to accept credit cards, the     velocity of trade on eBay could decrease and result in     corresponding decreases in our net Total Payment Volume, in     which case our business would further suffer. Bill Me Later is     similarly subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated     with merchants, users of the Bill Me Later service and third     parties handling its user information, which could increase our     exposure to transaction losses and reduce the profitability of     Bill Me Laters business. Our Payments business has taken     measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, but these     measures need to be continually improved and may not be     effective against new and continually evolving forms of fraud or     in connection with new product offerings. If these measures do     not succeed, our business will suffer.         eBay faces similar risks with respect to fraudulent activities     on its websites. eBay periodically receives complaints from     users who may not have received the goods that they had     purchased. In some cases individuals have been arrested and     convicted for fraudulent activities using our websites. eBay     also receives complaints from sellers who have not received     payment for the goods that a buyer had contracted to purchase.     Non-payment may occur        19    Table of Contents       because of miscommunication, because a buyer has changed his or     her mind and decided not to honor the contract to purchase the     item, or because the buyer bid on the item maliciously in order     to harm either the seller or eBay. In some European and Asian     jurisdictions, buyers may also have the right to withdraw from a     sale made by a professional seller within a specified time     period. While sometimes eBay can suspend the accounts of users     who fail to fulfill their payment or delivery obligations to     other users, eBay does not have the ability to require users to     make payment or deliver goods, or otherwise make users whole     other than through our limited buyer protection programs. Other     than through these programs, eBay does not compensate users who     believe they have been defrauded by other users, although users     who pay through PayPal may have reimbursement rights from their     credit card company or bank, which in turn will seek     reimbursement from PayPal. eBay also periodically receives     complaints from buyers as to the quality of the goods purchased.     We expect to continue to receive communications from users     requesting reimbursement or threatening or commencing legal     action against us if no reimbursement is made. Our liability for     these sort of claims is only beginning to be clarified in some     jurisdictions and may be higher in some     non-U.S. jurisdictions     than it is in the U.S. Litigation involving liability for     third-party actions could be costly for us, divert management     attention, result in increased costs of doing business, lead to     adverse judgments, or otherwise harm our business. In addition,     affected users will likely complain to regulatory agencies that     could take action against us, including imposing fines or     seeking injunctions.         Negative publicity and user sentiment generated as a result of     fraudulent or deceptive conduct by users of our Marketplaces and     Payments services could damage our reputation, reduce our     ability to attract new users or retain our current users,     diminish the value of our brand names. We believe that negative     user experiences are one of the primary reasons users stop using     our services.     Any     factors which reduce cross-border trade could harm our     business.         Cross-border transactions using our websites generally provide     higher revenues and gross margins than similar transactions that     take place within a single country due to higher transaction     fees we earn for those transactions. Cross-border trade has     become an increasingly important source of both revenue and     profits for us. To the extent that any factors result in a net     reduction in cross-border trade, including, among other factors,     fluctuations in exchange rates, the application of specific     national or regional laws (e.g., selective distribution channel     laws) to users in other countries, or any other factors impose     restrictions on, or increase the costs of, shipping goods across     national borders, our business would suffer. We believe that     recent increases in the relative value of the U.S. dollar     versus other currencies have reduced cross-border trade between     U.S. sellers and foreign buyers, without a corresponding     increase in cross-border traffic in the other direction,     adversely affecting our business.     Our     business is subject to online security risks, including security     breaches and identity theft.         To succeed, online commerce and communications must provide a     secure transmission of confidential information over public     networks. Our security measures may not detect or prevent     security breaches that could harm our business. Currently, a     significant number of our users authorize us to bill their     credit card accounts directly for all transaction fees charged     by us. PayPals users routinely provide credit card and     other financial information. We rely on encryption and     authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide     the security and authentication to effectively secure     transmission of confidential information, including customer     credit card numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new     discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments     may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by     us to protect transaction data. In addition, any party who is     able to illicitly obtain a users password could access the     users transaction data. An increasing number of websites     have reported breaches of their security. Any compromise of our     security could harm our reputation and, therefore, our business,     and could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other     laws. In addition, a party that is able to circumvent our     security measures could misappropriate proprietary information,     cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or     those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation and     business. Under credit card rules and our contracts with our     card processors, if there is a breach of credit card information     that we store, or that is stored by PayPals direct credit     card processing customers, we could be liable to the credit card     issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related     expenses. In addition, if we fail to follow credit card industry     security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer     information, we could incur significant        20    Table of Contents       fines or lose our ability to give customers the option of using     credit cards to fund their payments or pay their fees. If we     were unable to accept credit cards, our business would be     seriously damaged.         eBays Korean subsidiary, IAC, has notified a majority of     its approximately 20 million users of a data breach     involving personally identifiable information including name,     address, resident registration number and some transaction and     refund data (but not including credit card information or real     time banking information). Approximately 141,000 users have sued     IAC over this breach in several lawsuits and we expect more to     do so in the future. There is some precedent in Korea for a     court to grant consolation money for data breaches     without a specific finding of harm from the breach. Such     precedents have involved payments of up to approximately $200     per user. A consumer agency recently made a non-binding     recommendation that IAC make payments of     50,000-100,000     Korean won (approximately $35-70) to consumers who had     complained to it as a result of such breach. IAC intends to     vigorously defend itself in this lawsuit.         Our servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or     electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions, and we have     experienced denial-of-service type attacks on our     system that have made all or portions of our websites     unavailable for periods of time. We may need to expend     significant resources to protect against security breaches or to     address problems caused by breaches. These issues are likely to     become more difficult as we expand the number of places where we     operate. Security breaches, including any breach by us or by     parties with which we have commercial relationships that result     in the unauthorized release of our users personal     information, could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk     of loss or litigation and possible liability. Our insurance     policies carry low coverage limits, which may not be adequate to     reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.         Our users, as well as those of other prominent Internet     companies, have been and will continue to be targeted by parties     using fraudulent spoof and phishing     emails to misappropriate passwords, credit card numbers, or     other personal information or to introduce viruses through     trojan horse programs to our users computers.     These emails appear to be legitimate emails sent by eBay,     PayPal, Skype, or a user of one of those businesses, but direct     recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email     or request that the recipient send a password or other     confidential information via email or download a program.     Despite our efforts to mitigate spoof and     phishing emails through product improvements and     user education, spoof and phishing     remain a serious problem that may damage our brands, discourage     use of our websites, and increase our costs.     Changes     in regulations or user concerns regarding privacy and protection     of user data could adversely affect our business.         We are subject to laws relating to the collection, use,     retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable     information about our users, especially for financial     information and for users located outside of the U.S. In     many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party     transactions but also to transfers of information between     ourselves and our subsidiaries, and between ourselves, our     subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial     relations. New laws in this area have been passed by several     jurisdictions, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing     additional restrictions. The interpretation and application of     user data protection laws are in a state of flux. These laws may     be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to     country and our current data protection policies and practices     may not be consistent with those interpretations and     applications. Complying with these varying international     requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or     require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse     to our business. In addition, we have and post on our websites     our own privacy policies and practices concerning the     collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or     perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy     policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other     federal, state or international privacy or consumer     protection-related laws and regulations could result in     proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or     others, subject us to significant penalties and negative     publicity and adversely affect us. In addition, as noted above,     we are subject to the possibility of security breaches, which     themselves may result in a violation of these laws.     Our     revenue from advertising is subject to factors beyond our     control.         We derive an increasing portion of our revenues from advertising     on our websites. Revenues from online advertising are sensitive     to events and trends that affect advertising expenditures, such     as general changes in the        21    Table of Contents       economy and changes in consumer spending, as well as the     effectiveness of online advertising versus offline advertising     media and the value our websites provide to advertisers relative     to other websites. In addition, major search engine operators     have the ability to change from time to time, at their sole     discretion, the rules and search algorithms governing the     pricing, availability, and placement of online advertising. Any     changes in these rules or search algorithms could materially     reduce the value that we derive from online advertising on our     websites, either directly or indirectly. For example, retailers     pay a fee to Shopping.com for online shoppers directed to their     websites by Shopping.com. Rule changes made by search engines in     2008 disrupted traffic to our Shopping.com website, which in     turn has adversely affected click-through traffic to retailers     from our Shopping.com website and associated fee revenue. If we     experience a reduction in our advertising revenues due to     economic, competitive, technological or other factors, including     a reduction in consumer spending due to the current recession in     the U.S. and worldwide economic slowdown or if we are     unable to provide value to our advertisers, our business and     financial results would suffer.     Our     growth will depend on our ability to develop our brands, and     these efforts may be costly.         We believe that continuing to strengthen our brands will be     critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our services, and     will require a continued focus on active marketing efforts     across all of our brands. The demand for and cost of online and     traditional advertising have been increasing, and may continue     to increase. Accordingly, we will need to continue to spend     substantial amounts of money on, and devote substantial     resources to, advertising, marketing, and other efforts to     create and maintain brand loyalty among users. Since 2004, we     have significantly increased the number of brands we are     supporting, adding Rent.com, Shopping.com, our classified     websites (e.g., Kijiji and Marktplaats), StubHub, Skype and Bill     Me Later, among others. Each of these brands requires its own     resources, increasing the costs of our branding efforts. Brand     promotion activities may not yield increased revenues, and even     if they do, any increased revenues may not offset the expenses     incurred in building our brands. Also, major search engine     operators that we use to advertise our brands have     frequently-changing rules that govern their pricing,     availability and placement of online advertisement (e.g., paid     search, keywords), and changes to these rules could negatively     affect our use of online advertising to promote our brands. If     we fail to promote and maintain our brands, or if we incur     substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and     maintain our brands, our business would be harmed.     New     and existing regulations could harm our business.         We are subject to the same foreign and domestic laws as other     companies conducting business on and off the Internet. It is not     always clear how existing laws governing issues such as property     ownership, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual     property issues, parallel imports and distribution controls,     taxation, libel and defamation, obscenity, and personal privacy     apply to online businesses such as ours. The majority of these     laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and     related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or     address the unique issues of the Internet and related     technologies. Those laws that do reference the Internet, such as     the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the European     Unions Directive on Distance Selling and Electronic     Commerce, are being interpreted by the courts, but their     applicability and scope remain uncertain. Furthermore, as our     activities and the types of goods and services listed on our     websites expand, including through acquisitions such as our     acquisition of Bill Me Later, a transactional credit provider,     in November 2008 and StubHub, an online ticket marketplace, in     February 2007, regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold     that we or our users are subject to licensure or prohibited from     conducting our business in their jurisdiction, either generally     or with respect to certain actions (e.g., the sale of real     estate, event tickets, cultural goods, boats and automobiles).         Our success and increased visibility has driven some existing     businesses that perceive our business model to be a threat to     their business to raise concerns about our business models to     policymakers and regulators, particularly in the U.S. and     Europe. These established businesses and their trade association     groups employ significant resources in their efforts to shape     the legal and regulatory regimes in countries where we have     significant operations. They may employ these resources in an     effort to change the legal and regulatory regimes in ways     intended to reduce the effectiveness of our businesses and the     ability of users to use our products and services. In     particular, these established businesses have raised concerns     relating to pricing, parallel imports, professional seller     obligations, stolen goods, copyrights, trademarks and other     intellectual property rights, and the liability of the provider     of an        22    Table of Contents       Internet marketplace for the conduct of its users related to     those and other issues. Success in changing the legal or     regulatory regimes in a manner that would increase our liability     for third-party listings could negatively impact our business.         Over the last few years some large retailers and their trade     associations have sought legislation in a number of states and     the U.S. Congress that would make eBay liable for the sale     of stolen property or would ban certain categories of goods from     sale on our platform, including gift cards and health and beauty     products. No such legislation has passed. Nonetheless, the     proponents continue to seek passage of such legislation, and if     any of these laws are adopted it could harm our business.         Numerous states and foreign jurisdictions, including the State     of California, where our headquarters are located, have     regulations regarding auctions and the handling of     property by secondhand dealers or     pawnbrokers. Several states and some foreign     jurisdictions, including France, have attempted, and may attempt     in the future, to impose such regulations upon us or our users.     Attempted enforcement of these laws against some of our users     appears to be increasing and such attempted enforcements could     harm our business. In France, we have been sued by Conseil des     Ventes, the French auction regulatory authority. The agency     alleges that sales on our French website constitute illegal     auctions that cannot be performed without its consent. A lawsuit     alleging similar claims has been brought against us by two     associations of French antique dealers. We intend to vigorously     defend against these lawsuits. However, this and other     regulatory and licensure claims could result in costly     litigation and, if successful, could require us to change the     way we or our users do business in ways that increase costs or     reduce revenues (for example, by forcing us to prohibit listings     of certain items for some locations). We could also be subject     to fines or other penalties, and any of these outcomes could     harm our business.         A number of the lawsuits against us relating to trademark issues     seek to have our websites subject to unfavorable local laws. For     example, trademark exhaustion principles provide     trademark owners with certain rights to control the sale of a     branded authentic product until it has been placed on the market     by the trademark holder or with the holders consent. The     application of trademark exhaustion principles is     largely unsettled in the context of the Internet, and if     trademark owners are able to force us to prohibit listings of     certain items in one or more locations, our business could be     harmed.         As we expand and localize our international activities, we     become obligated to comply with the laws of the countries in     which we operate. In addition, because our services are     accessible worldwide, and we facilitate sales of goods to users     worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our     users are required to comply with their laws based on the     location of our servers or one or more of our users, or the     location of the product or service being sold or provided in an     ecommerce transaction. For example, we were found liable in     France, under French law in the recent Louis Vuitton     Malletier litigation for transactions on our websites     worldwide that did not involve French buyers and sellers. Laws     regulating Internet and ecommerce companies outside of the     U.S. may be less favorable than those in the U.S., giving     greater rights to consumers, content owners, competitors, users     and other third parties. Compliance may be more costly or may     require us to change our business practices or restrict our     service offerings, and the imposition of any regulations on our     users may harm our business. In addition, we may be subject to     overlapping legal or regulatory regimes that impose conflicting     requirements on us. Our alleged failure to comply with foreign     laws could subject us to penalties ranging from criminal     prosecution to significant fines to bans on our services.     If our     Payments business is found to be subject to or in violation of     any laws or regulations, including those governing money     transmission, electronic funds transfers, money laundering,     banking and lending, it could be subject to liability, licensure     and regulatory approval and may be forced to change its business     practices.         To date, PayPal has obtained licenses to operate as a money     transmitter in 42 U.S. states and territories and     interpretations in seven states that licensing is not required     under their existing statutes. The remaining U.S. states     and territories do not currently regulate money transmitters. As     a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to restrictions     on its investment of customer funds, reporting requirements,     bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory     agencies. If PayPal were found to be in violation of money     services laws or regulations, PayPal could be subject to     liability, forced to cease doing business with residents of     certain states, forced to change its business practices, or     required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals     that could impose a substantial        23    Table of Contents       cost on PayPal. Any change to PayPals business practices     that makes the service less attractive to customers or prohibits     its use by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease     the velocity of trade on eBay, which would further harm our     business.         Although there have been no definitive interpretations to date,     PayPal has assumed that its service is subject to the Electronic     Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E of the Federal     Reserve Board. As a result, among other things, PayPal must     provide advance disclosure of changes to its service, follow     specified error resolution procedures and reimburse consumers     for losses above $50 from transactions not authorized by the     consumer. PayPal currently voluntarily reimburses consumers for     all financial losses from transactions not authorized by the     consumer, not just losses above $50. PayPal seeks to pass most     of these losses on to the relevant merchants, but PayPal incurs     losses if the merchant does not have sufficient funds in its     PayPal account.         PayPal is also subject to anti-money laundering and     counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations that prohibit,     among other things, its involvement in transferring the proceeds     of criminal activities. Although PayPal has adopted a program to     comply with these laws and regulations, any errors or failure to     implement the program properly could lead to lawsuits,     administrative action, and prosecution by the government. PayPal     is also subject to regulations that require it to report     suspicious activities involving transactions of $2,000 or more     and may be required to obtain and keep more detailed records on     the senders and recipients in certain transfers of $3,000 or     more. The interpretation of suspicious activities in this     context is uncertain. Future regulations under the USA PATRIOT     Act may require PayPal to revise the procedures it uses to     verify the identity of its customers and to monitor     international transactions more closely. As PayPal localizes its     service in other countries, additional verification and     reporting requirements may apply, which in some cases are more     stringent. Several countries, including Australia, Canada,     Luxembourg and Singapore, have implemented or are in the process     of implementing new anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist     financing laws and regulations, and the impact of these laws and     regulations on PayPals business is uncertain. PayPal could     be required, among other things, to learn more about its     customers before opening an account, to obtain additional     verification of customers and to monitor its customers     activities more closely. These requirements could impose     significant costs on PayPal, make it more difficult for new     customers to join its network and reduce the attractiveness of     its product. Failure to comply with federal, state or foreign     money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws could     result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties,     and forfeiture of significant assets.         While PayPal currently allows its customers with credit cards to     send payments from 190 markets, only 65 of those markets     (including the U.S.) allow its customers to receive payments, in     some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which     customers can withdraw funds. These limitations may affect     PayPals ability to grow in these markets.         Of the 190 markets whose residents can use the PayPal service,     31 (27 countries plus four French overseas departments) are     members of the European Union (EU). Since 2007, PayPal has     provided localized versions of its service to customers in the     EU through PayPal (Europe) S.A.R.L. et Cie, SCA., a wholly-owned     subsidiary of PayPal that is licensed as a bank in Luxembourg.     Accordingly, PayPal (Europe) is subject to significant fines or     other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure,     reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, funds     management, corporate governance or other requirements imposed     on Luxembourg banks. PayPal has limited experience in operating     as a bank, and any fines or other enforcement actions imposed by     the Luxembourg regulator could adversely affect PayPals     business. PayPal (Europe) implements its localized services in     EU countries through an expedited passport     notification process through the Luxembourg regulator to     regulators in other EU member states pursuant to EU Directives,     and has completed the passport notice process in all     EU member countries. The regulators in these countries could     notify PayPal (Europe) of local consumer protection laws that     will apply to its business, in addition to Luxembourg consumer     protection law, and could also seek to persuade the Luxembourg     regulator to order PayPal (Europe) to conduct its activities in     the local country through a branch office. Any such responses     from these regulators could increase the cost of, or delay,     PayPals plans for expanding its business.         In markets other than the U.S., EU, Australia and China, PayPal     serves its customers through PayPal Private Ltd., a wholly-owned     subsidiary of PayPal that is based in Singapore. In many of     these markets, it is not clear whether PayPals     Singapore-based service is subject to Singaporean law or, if it     is subject to local laws, whether        24    Table of Contents       such local law requires a payment processor like PayPal to be     licensed as a bank or financial institution or otherwise. Even     if PayPal is not currently required to obtain a license in some     jurisdictions, future localization or targeted marketing of     PayPals service in those countries, or expansion of the     financial products offered by PayPal to new jurisdictions     (either alone, through a commercial alliance or through an     acquisition), could subject PayPal to additional licensure     requirements, laws and regulations and increased regulatory     scrutiny. These factors could impose substantial costs and     involve considerable delay to the provision or development of     its products. Delay or failure to receive such a license or     regulatory approval could require PayPal to change its business     practices or features in ways that would adversely affect     PayPals international expansion plans and could require     PayPal to suspend providing products and services to customers     in one or more countries.         Our Bill Me Later service is similarly subject to a variety of     laws and regulations. Although Bill Me Later does not originate     loans, one or more jurisdictions may conclude that Bill Me Later     is a lender or money transmitter or loan broker, which could     subject us to liability or regulation in one or more     jurisdictions. Additionally, federal regulators could mandate     changes to the relationship between Bill Me Later and CIT Bank,     the financial institution that Bill Me Later relies on to extend     credit to customers with the Bill Me Later service. Any adverse     changes in this relationship could negatively impact Bill Me     Laters ability to continue operating its business as     currently conducted.     Changes     to credit card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could     harm PayPals business.         PayPal does not belong to or directly access credit card     networks, such as Visa and MasterCard. As a result, PayPal must     rely on banks or other payment processors to process     transactions, and must pay a fee for this service. From time to     time, credit card networks have increased, and may increase in     the future, the interchange fees and assessments that they     charge for each transaction using one of their cards.     PayPals credit card processors have the right to pass any     increases in interchange fees and assessments on to PayPal as     well as increase their own fees for processing. These increased     fees increase PayPals operating costs and reduce its     profit margins. PayPal is also required by its processors to     comply with credit card network operating rules, and PayPal has     agreed to reimburse its processors for any fines they are     assessed by credit card networks as a result of any rule     violations by PayPal or PayPals customers. The credit card     networks set and interpret the credit card rules. Credit card     networks could adopt new operating rules or re-interpret     existing rules that PayPal or its processors might find     difficult or even impossible to follow. As a result, PayPal     could lose its ability to give customers the option of using     credit cards to fund their payments. If PayPal were unable to     accept credit cards, its business would be seriously damaged. In     addition, the velocity of trade on eBay could decrease and our     business would further suffer.         PayPal is required to comply with credit card networks     special operating rules for Internet payment services. PayPal     and its credit card processors have implemented specific     business processes for merchant customers in order to comply     with these rules, but any failure to comply could result in     fines, the amount of which would be within the credit card     networks discretion. PayPal also could be subject to fines     from credit card networks if it fails to detect that merchants     are engaging in activities that are illegal or that are     considered high risk, primarily the sale of certain     types of digital content. For high risk merchants,     PayPal must either prevent such merchants from using PayPal or     register such merchants with credit card networks and conduct     additional monitoring with respect to such merchants. PayPal has     incurred fines from its credit card processor relating to     PayPals failure to detect the use of its service by     high risk merchants. The amount of these fines has     not been material, but any additional fines in the future would     likely be for larger amounts, could become material, and could     result in a termination of PayPals ability to accept     credit cards or changes in PayPals process for registering     new customers, which would seriously damage PayPals     business.     Changes     in PayPals funding mix could adversely affect     PayPals results.         PayPal pays significant transaction fees when senders fund     payment transactions using credit cards, nominal fees when     customers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of     funds from bank accounts, and no fees when customers fund     payment transactions from an existing PayPal account balance or     use buyer credit issued by GE Money Bank. Senders fund a     significant portion of PayPals payment volume using credit     cards, and PayPals financial success will remain highly     sensitive to changes in the rate at which its senders fund     payments using credit cards. Senders may prefer funding using     credit cards rather than bank account transfers for a number of     reasons,        25    Table of Contents       including the ability to dispute and reverse charges directly     with their credit card provider if merchandise is not delivered     or is not as described, the ability to earn frequent flier miles     or other incentives offered by credit card issuers, the ability     to defer payment, or a reluctance to provide bank account     information to PayPal. The proportion of PayPals payment     volume funded using credit cards has increased over time. In     addition, some of PayPals newer offerings, including the     ability to make a limited number of payments without opening an     account, have a higher rate of credit card funding than     PayPals basic product offering. In September 2006, PayPal     entered into a settlement agreement with the attorneys general     of a number of states under which it agreed to pay     $1.7 million to the attorneys general, shorten and     streamline its user agreement, and communicate more information     regarding protection programs to users. Also in September 2006,     PayPal announced that it had reached a preliminary settlement     agreement under which it agreed to pay approximately     $3.5 million into a settlement fund for the benefit of a     class represented by plaintiffs in a suit that alleged, among     other things, that PayPals disclosure regarding the     effects of users choice of funding mechanism was     deceptive. This settlement has now been approved by the court.     Although PayPal did not admit any liability for any of the     allegations in the two cases, changes to our disclosure     practices could result in increased use of credit card funding,     which could harm PayPals business.     PayPals     failure to manage customer funds properly would harm its     business.         PayPals ability to manage and account accurately for     customer funds requires a high level of internal controls. In     some of the markets that PayPal serves and currencies that     PayPal offers, PayPal has a limited operating history and     limited management experience in managing these internal     controls. As PayPals business continues to grow, it must     strengthen its internal controls accordingly. PayPals     success requires significant public confidence in its ability to     handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of     customer funds. Any failure to maintain necessary controls or to     manage accurately customer funds could diminish customer use of     PayPals product severely.     System     failures could harm our business.         We have experienced system failures from time to time, and any     interruption in the availability of our websites will reduce our     current revenues and profits, could harm our future revenues and     profits, and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny. Our     eBay.com website has been interrupted for periods of up to     22 hours, and our PayPal website has suffered intermittent     unavailability for periods as long as five days. In August 2007,     Skype experienced an interruption during which the majority of     Skypes users were unable to use its products for     approximately two days. Any unscheduled interruption in our     services results in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss     of revenues. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our     services could cause current or potential users to believe that     our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our     competitors or to avoid our sites, and could permanently harm     our reputation and brands. Reliability is particularly critical     for PayPal, especially as it seeks to expand its Merchant     Services business. Because PayPal is a regulated financial     entity, frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to     fines, penalties, or mandatory changes to PayPals business     practices, and ultimately could cause PayPal to lose existing     licenses it needs to operate or prevent it from obtaining     additional licenses that it needs to expand. Finally, because     our customers may use our products for critical transactions,     any system failures could result in damage to our     customers businesses. These customers could seek     significant compensation from us for their losses. Even if     unsuccessful, this type of claim likely would be time consuming     and costly for us to address.         Although our systems have been designed around industry-standard     architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or     catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to damage or     interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss,     telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses,     computer denial-of-service attacks, and similar events. Some of     our systems, including our Shopping.com and Skype websites and     the systems related to the Bill Me Later business, are not fully     redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient     for all eventualities. Our systems are also subject to     break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism. Despite     any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural     disaster, a decision by any of our third-party hosting providers     to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial     or other reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our hosting     facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our     services. We do not carry business interruption insurance     sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from     interruptions in our service as a result of system failures.        26    Table of Contents   There     are many risks associated with our international     operations.         Our international expansion has been rapid and our international     business, especially in Germany and the U.K., has also become     critical to our revenues and profits. Net revenues outside the     U.S. accounted for approximately 51% and 54%, respectively,     of our net revenues in fiscal years 2007 and 2008. Expansion     into international markets requires management attention and     resources and requires us to localize our services to conform to     local cultures, standards, and policies. The commercial,     Internet, and transportation infrastructure in lesser-developed     countries may make it more difficult for us to replicate our     traditional Marketplace business model. In many countries, we     compete with local companies that understand the local market     better than we do, and we may not benefit from first-to-market     advantages. We may not be successful in expanding into     particular international markets or in generating revenues from     foreign operations. For example, in 2002 we withdrew our eBay     marketplace offering from the Japanese market, and in 2007 we     contributed our business in China to a joint venture with a     local Chinese company. Even if we are successful in developing     new markets, we often expect the costs of operating new sites to     exceed our net revenues for at least 12 months in most     countries.         As we continue to expand internationally, including through the     expansion of PayPal, Skype, Shopping.com, and our classified     businesses, we are increasingly subject to risks of doing     business internationally, including the following:                         strong local competitors;                    regulatory requirements, including regulation of Internet     services, communications, auctioneering, professional selling,     distance selling, privacy and data protection, banking, and     money transmitting, that may limit or prevent the offering of     our services in some jurisdictions, prevent enforceable     agreements between sellers and buyers, prohibit the listing of     certain categories of goods, require product changes, require     special licensure, subject us to various taxes, penalties or     audits, or limit the transfer of information between us and our     affiliates;                    greater liability or legal uncertainty regarding our liability     for the listings and other content provided by our users,     including uncertainty as a result of legal systems that are less     developed with respect to the Internet, unique local laws,     conflicting court decisions and lack of clear precedent or     applicable law;                    cultural ambivalence towards, or non-acceptance of, online     trading;                    laws and business practices that favor local competitors or     prohibit foreign ownership of certain businesses;                    difficulties in integrating with local payment providers,     including banks, credit and debit card networks, and electronic     fund transfer systems or with the local telecommunications     infrastructure;                    differing levels of retail distribution, shipping,     communications, and Internet infrastructures;                    different employee/employer relationships and the existence of     workers councils and labor unions;                    difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;                    challenges associated with joint venture relationships,     including dependence on our joint venture partners;                    difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal     controls;                    longer payment cycles, different accounting practices, and     greater problems in collecting accounts receivable;                    potentially adverse tax consequences, including local taxation     of our fees or of transactions on our websites;                    higher telecommunications and Internet service provider costs;                    different and more stringent user protection, data protection,     privacy and other laws;                    seasonal reductions in business activity;                    expenses associated with localizing our products, including     offering customers the ability to transact business in the local     currency;          27    Table of Contents                         profit repatriation restrictions, foreign currency exchange     restrictions, and exchange rate fluctuations;                    volatility in a specific countrys or regions     political, economic or military conditions; and                    differing intellectual property laws.           Some of these factors may cause our international costs of doing     business to exceed our comparable domestic costs. As we expand     our international operations and have additional portions of our     international revenues denominated in foreign currencies, we     also could become subject to increased difficulties in     collecting accounts receivable, repatriating money without     adverse tax consequences, and risks relating to foreign currency     exchange rate fluctuations. The impact of currency exchange rate     fluctuations is discussed in more detail under We are     exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest     rates, above.         In addition, we conduct certain functions, including product     development, customer support and other operations, in regions     outside the U.S., particularly in India and China. We are     subject to both U.S. and local laws and regulations     applicable to our offshore activities, and any factors which     reduce the anticipated benefits, including cost efficiencies and     productivity improvements, associated with providing these     functions outside of the U.S. could adversely affect our     business.         We are continuing to expand PayPals services     internationally. In some countries, expansion of PayPals     business may require a close commercial relationship with one or     more local banks, a shared ownership interest with a local     entity or registration as a bank under local law. Such     requirements may reduce our profitability or limit the scope of     our activities in particular countries. Any limitation on our     ability to expand PayPal internationally could harm our business.         We maintain a portion of Shopping.coms research and     development facilities and personnel in Israel, and in January     2008 we acquired Fraud Sciences Ltd., an Israeli company. As a     result, political, economic and military conditions in Israel     affect those operations. The future of peace efforts between     Israel and its neighboring countries remains uncertain.     Increased hostilities or terrorism within Israel or armed     hostilities between Israel and neighboring states could make it     more difficult for us to continue our operations in Israel,     which could increase our costs. In addition, many of our     employees in Israel could be required to serve in the military     for extended periods of time under emergency circumstances. Our     Israeli operations could be disrupted by the absence of     employees due to military service, which could adversely affect     our business.     Acquisitions     and joint ventures could result in operating difficulties,     dilution, and other harmful consequences.         We have acquired a number of businesses in the past, including,     most recently, Bill Me Later, Inc. in the United States and     Den Blå Avis and BilBasen, classified businesses in     Denmark. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide     array of potential strategic transactions, including business     combinations, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses,     technologies, services, products and other assets. At any given     time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with     respect to one or more of these types of transactions. Any of     these transactions could be material to our financial condition     and results of operations. The process of integrating any     acquired business may create unforeseen operating difficulties     and expenditures and is itself risky. The areas where we may     face difficulties include:                         diversion of management time, as well as a shift of focus from     operating the businesses to issues related to integration and     administration, particularly given the large number and size and     varying scope of our recent acquisitions;                    declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from     changes in, or acceleration of, compensation, or changes in     management, reporting relationships, future prospects, or the     direction of the business;                    the need to integrate each companys accounting,     management, information, human resource and other administrative     systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control     if such integration is delayed or not implemented;          28    Table of Contents                         the need to implement controls, procedures and policies     appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior     to acquisition had lacked such controls, procedures and policies;                    in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate     operations across different cultures and languages and to     address the particular economic, currency, political, and     regulatory risks associated with specific countries;                    in some cases, the need to transition operations, users, and     customers onto our existing platforms; and                    liability for activities of the acquired company before the     acquisition, including violations of laws, rules and     regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other     known and unknown liabilities.           Moreover, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any or     all of our acquisitions, or may not realize them in the time     frame expected. For example, in connection with the Skype     transaction, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of     approximately $1.4 billion in our financial statements     during 2007. Future acquisitions or mergers may require us to     issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur     debt, liabilities, amortization expenses related to intangible     assets or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could reduce our     profitability and harm our business.         In addition, we have made certain investments, including through     joint ventures, in which we have a minority equity interest and     lack management and operational control. These investments may     involve risks. For example, the controlling joint venture     partner in a joint venture investment may have business     interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours,     and business decisions or other actions or omissions of the     controlling joint venture partner or the joint venture company     may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the     value of our investment in the joint venture.     Bill     Me Later will expose us to new risks.         We acquired Bill Me Later, a company that provides     transaction-based credit, in late 2008. Upon acquiring Bill Me     Later, we became exposed to new risks.         Bill Me Later is not a chartered financial institution, and     relies on CIT Bank to extend credit to Bill Me Later customers     in order to offer the Bill Me Later service. When a consumer     makes a purchase using the Bill Me Later service, CIT Bank funds     the consumer loan at the point of sale and advances funds to the     merchant, and Bill Me Later subsequently purchases the     receivable related to the consumer loan extended by CIT Bank.     Although CIT Bank continues to own each customer account, Bill     Me Later owns the related receivable and is responsible for all     servicing functions related to the account. Any termination or     interruption of CIT Banks services to us, including due to     the suspension or termination of CIT Banks banking     charter, a regulatory challenge to the relationship between CIT     Bank and Bill Me Later or the termination of our commercial     relationship with CIT Bank for any reason, could materially and     adversely affect our ability to offer the Bill Me Later service.     Under those circumstances, we would likely be required to either     reach a similar arrangement with another chartered financial     institution, which may not be available on favorable terms, if     at all, or to obtain our own bank charter, which would be a     time-consuming and costly process and would subject us to a     number of additional laws and regulations. Bill Me Later also     relies on third-party merchant processors and payment gateways     to process transactions using the Bill Me Later service. Most of     the transaction volume by dollar amount through the Bill Me     Later service is currently settled through the facilities of a     single vendor. Any disruption to our payment processing and     gateway services would adversely affect the Bill Me Later     service.         We currently fund the origination of receivables related to Bill     Me Later accounts through free cash flow generated from our     portfolio of businesses and from our existing line of credit. As     a result of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., our     available line of credit was effectively reduced by Lehman     Brothers Commercial Banks $160 million commitment. If     other financial institutions that have extended credit     commitments to us are adversely affected by U.S. and global     economic conditions, they may become unable to fund borrowings     under their credit commitments to us. Our ability to securitize     receivables related to Bill Me Later accounts is dependent upon,     among other things, conditions in the structured finance     markets, which have been subject to recent disruptions in the     credit industry, resulting in very limited liquidity for     securitization purposes. If        29    Table of Contents       we are unable to fund receivables related to the Bill Me Later     business in a cost-effective manner, the growth and     profitability of the Bill Me Later business could be     significantly and adversely affected.         The Bill Me Later service is offered to a wide range of     consumers, and the profitability of this business depends on our     ability to manage credit risk while attracting new consumers     with profitable usage patterns. Bill Me Later approves loans     using proprietary segmentation and credit scoring algorithms and     other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk     of the specific transaction. These algorithms and techniques may     not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer due     to, among other factors, inaccurate assumptions about a     particular consumer or the economic environment. Bill Me Later     may also incorrectly interpret the data produced by these     algorithms in setting its credit policies. Bill Me Laters     ability to manage credit risk may also be adversely affected by     economic conditions, legal or regulatory changes (such as     bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations),     competitors actions and consumer behavior and other     factors. In addition, the credit crisis and current recession in     the U.S. may affect consumer confidence levels and reduce     consumers ability or willingness to use credit, including     our transaction-based credit product, which could impair the     growth of the Bill Me Later business.         As of December 31, 2008, Bill Me Later had an aggregate     consumer loan portfolio of approximately $597.6 million.     Like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from     consumer loans, the Bill Me Later service faces the risk that     account holders will default on their payment obligations,     resulting in accounts becoming uncollectible, and the risk of     potential charge-offs related to the loan portfolio. The     nonpayment rate among Bill Me Later users may increase due to,     among other things, worsening economic conditions, such as the     current recession in the U.S., and higher unemployment rates.     Consumers who miss payments on their loans often fail to repay     them, and consumers who file for protection under the bankruptcy     laws generally do not repay their loans. The age and rate of     growth of a consumer loan portfolio also affects the rate of     missed payments and loans charged off as uncollectible.     Consumers are less likely to miss their payments within the     first 12 to 18 months of a loans term. When a lender     makes fewer loans than it has in the past, the proportion of new     loans in its portfolio will decrease and the rate of missed     payments and charge-offs in the portfolio will increase.         In addition, Bill Me Later faces other risks similar to those     faced by PayPal, including the risk of systems failures,     security breaches or other loss of customer data, fraud,     intellectual property claims, compliance failures, and changes     to regulations relating to credit offerings described in these     Risk Factors, including under the captions Government     inquiries may lead to charges or penalties and If     our Payments business is found to be subject to or in violation     of any laws or regulations, including those governing money     transmission, electronic funds transfer, money laundering,     banking and lending, it could be subject to liability, licensure     and regulatory approval and may be forced to change its business     practices.     Our     business and users may be subject to sales tax and other     taxes.         The application of indirect taxes (such as sales and use tax,     value-added tax, or VAT, goods and services tax, business tax,     and gross receipt tax) to ecommerce businesses such as eBay and     to our users is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the     fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes     were established before the growth of the Internet and     ecommerce. In many cases, it is not clear how existing statutes     apply to the Internet or electronic commerce or communications     conducted over the Internet. In addition, some jurisdictions     have implemented or may implement laws specifically addressing     the Internet or some aspect of electronic commerce or     communications on the Internet. For example, the State of New     York recently passed new legislation that requires any     out-of-state seller of tangible personal property to collect and     remit New York use tax if the seller engages affiliates in New     York to perform certain business promotion activities. Several     ecommerce companies are challenging this new law, which was     recently upheld by a lower level New York court. While this     new law does not specifically apply to our businesses it may     adversely affect our sellers and indirectly harm our business.         From time to time, some taxing authorities have notified us that     they believe we owe them certain taxes. In May 2008, the City of     Chicago notified both eBay and StubHub that they are liable for     a city amusement tax on tickets to events in Chicago,     irrespective of the location of the buyer or seller, and has     filed suit to enforce collection of taxes they claim are due.     The application of similar existing or future laws could have     adverse effects on our business.         Several proposals have been made at the U.S. state and     local level that would impose additional taxes on the sale of     goods and services or communications through the Internet. These     proposals, if adopted, could substantially        30    Table of Contents       impair the growth of ecommerce and our brands, and could     diminish our opportunity to derive financial benefit from our     activities. The U.S. federal governments moratorium     on state and local taxation of Internet access or multiple or     discriminatory taxes on ecommerce was extended through November     2014. This moratorium does not prohibit federal, state, or local     authorities from collecting taxes on our income or from     collecting certain taxes that were in effect prior to the     enactment of the moratorium     and/or one     of its extensions.         In conjunction with the Streamlined Sales Tax     Project  an ongoing, multi-year effort by U.S.,     state, and local governments to require collection and     remittance of distant sales tax by out-of-state     sellers  bills have been introduced in recent years     in the U.S. Congress to overturn the Supreme Courts     Quill decision, which limits the ability of state     governments to require sellers outside of their own state to     collect and remit sales taxes on goods purchased by in-state     residents. Such legislation may be considered by the     U.S. Congress as a way to enable states to increase sales     tax revenues and help address significant state budget     difficulties caused by the economic downturn. The adoption of     any legislation overturning the Quill decision that lacks     a robust small business exemption would harm our users and our     business.         We do not collect taxes on the goods or services sold by users     of our services. One or more states or the federal government or     foreign countries may seek to impose a tax collection, reporting     or record-keeping obligation on companies that engage in or     facilitate ecommerce. Such an obligation could be imposed by     legislation intended to improve tax compliance (and legislation     to such effect has been discussed in the U.S. Congress,     several states, and a number of foreign jurisdictions) or if an     eBay company was ever deemed to be the legal agent of the users     of our services by a jurisdiction in which eBay operates. In     July 2008, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (H.R.     3221) was signed into law. This law contains provisions     that require companies like PayPal to report to the IRS     information on payments received by some of our customers. The     legislation, effective for payments received after     December 31, 2010, will require PayPal and similar     companies to report to the IRS     U.S.-based     customers who receive more than $20,000 in payments and more     than 200 payments in a year. This law will require PayPal to     request tax ID numbers from U.S. users and track payments     by tax ID number. This requirement may decrease seller activity     and harm our business. One or more other jurisdictions may also     seek to impose tax-collection or reporting obligations based on     the location of the product or service being sold or provided in     an ecommerce transaction, regardless of where the respective     users are located. Imposition of a discriminatory record keeping     or tax collecting requirement could decrease seller activity on     our sites and would harm our business. Foreign authorities may     also require eBay to help ensure compliance by our users with     local laws regulating professional sellers, including tax     requirements. In addition, we have periodically received     requests from tax authorities in many jurisdictions for     information regarding the transactions of large classes of     sellers on our sites, and in some cases we have been legally     obligated to provide this data. The imposition of any     requirements on us to disclose transaction records for all or a     class of sellers to tax or other regulatory authorities or to     file tax forms on behalf of any sellers, especially requirements     that are imposed on us but not on alternative means of     ecommerce, and any use of those records to investigate, collect     taxes from, or prosecute sellers, could decrease seller activity     on our sites and harm our business.         We pay input VAT on applicable taxable purchases within the     various countries in which we operate. In most cases, we are     entitled to reclaim this input VAT from the various countries.     However, because of our unique business model, the application     of the laws and rules that allow such reclamation is sometimes     uncertain. A successful assertion by one or more countries that     we are not entitled to reclaim VAT could harm our business.         We continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and     legislators to clarify eBays obligations under new and     emerging laws and regulations. Passage of new legislation and     the imposition of additional tax or tax-related reporting     requirements could harm our users and our business. There have     been, and will continue to be, substantial ongoing costs     associated with complying with the various indirect tax     requirements in the numerous markets in which eBay conducts or     will conduct business.     The     current regulatory environment for Voice over Internet Protocol     (VoIP) is uncertain, and Skypes business could be harmed     by new regulations or the application of existing regulations to     its products.         The current regulatory environment for VoIP is uncertain and     rapidly changing. Skype believes that its Internet     communications products are currently subject to few, if any, of     the same regulations that apply to traditional telephony and     VoIP-based telephone replacement services. VoIP companies are     generally subject to different        31    Table of Contents       regulatory regimes in different countries, and in most cases are     subject to lower, or no, regulatory fees and lesser, or no,     specific regulatory requirements. However, the status of VoIP     providers is uncertain in many jurisdictions and Skype     frequently must respond to inquiries about its regulatory     status. Regulatory agencies may require Skype to conform to     rules that are difficult or impossible for it to comply with due     to the nature of its communications technologies, which could     adversely affect its business. For example, while suitable     alternatives may be developed in the future, Skype is currently     unable to identify the exact geographic origin of the traffic     traversing the Internet or to provide detailed calling     information about computer-to-computer communications, either of     which may make complying with future regulatory requirements,     such as emergency service requirements, difficult or impossible.         Governments may impose new or increased fees, taxes, and     administrative burdens on VoIP companies, or Skype may change     its product offerings in a manner that subjects it to     telecommunications regulations. Increased fees could include     access and other charges payable to local exchange carriers to     carry and terminate traffic, contributions to federal or state     Universal Service Funds in the United States and elsewhere, and     other charges. In addition, such fees may be assessed by     governments retroactively or prospectively. Skype may be     required to meet various emergency service requirements,     disability access requirements, user protection requirements,     number assignment and portability requirements, and interception     or wiretapping requirements, such as the Communications     Assistance for Law Enforcement Act in the U.S. and similar     laws in other jurisdictions. Such regulations could result in     substantial costs depending on the technical changes required to     accommodate the requirements, and any increased costs could     erode Skypes pricing advantage over competing forms of     communication. Regulations that decrease the degree of privacy     for users of Skypes products could also slow its adoption.     The increasing growth and popularity of Internet communications     heightens the risk that governments will seek to regulate VoIP     and Internet communications, and Skype has received an     increasing number of inquiries from regulators about its     products and services. Competitors, including the incumbent     telephone companies, may devote substantial lobbying efforts to     seek greater protection for their existing businesses and     increased regulation of VoIP. In the United States, various     state legislatures and regulatory agencies are beginning to     impose their own requirements and taxes on VoIP. Some countries     have prohibited Skype. In many countries in which Skype products     are available, the laws that may relate to its offerings are     unclear. We cannot be certain that Skype or its customers are     currently in full compliance with regulatory or other legal     requirements in all countries in which Skype is used.     Skypes failure or the failure of those with whom Skype     transacts business to comply with these requirements could     materially adversely affect our business, financial condition     and results of operations. In addition, increased regulatory     requirements on VoIP would increase Skypes costs, and, as     a result, our business would suffer.         New rules and regulations with respect to VoIP are being     considered in various countries around the world, and at least     some of these rules and regulations are likely to be adopted and     to be applicable to Skype. Such new rules and regulations are     likely to increase our costs of doing business and could prevent     us from delivering our products and offerings over the Internet,     which could adversely affect Skypes customer base, and     thus its revenue.     Skype     depends on key technology that is licensed from third     parties.         Skype licenses technology underlying certain key components of     its software from third parties it does not control, including     the technology underlying its peer-to-peer architecture and     firewall traversal technology and the video     compression/decompression used to provide high video quality.     Although Skype has contracts in place with its third-party     technology providers, there can be no assurance that the     licensed technology or other technology that we may seek to     license in the future will continue to be available on     commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The loss of, or     inability to maintain, existing licenses could result in a     decrease in service quality or loss of service until equivalent     technology or suitable alternatives can be developed,     identified, licensed and integrated. While we believe Skype     generally has the ability to either extend these licenses on     commercially reasonable terms or identify and obtain or develop     suitable alternatives, the costs associated with licensing or     developing such alternatives could be high and the technical     challenge of assuring backward compatibility with     older versions of Skypes technology may be difficult to     overcome. Any failure to maintain these licenses on commercially     reasonable terms or to license or develop alternative     technologies would harm Skypes business. Skype and one of     its licensors are currently attempting to resolve a dispute     concerning certain key licensed technology. The parties     previously entered into a standstill agreement to     allow further time to resolve the dispute without the     possibility of immediate litigation. While Skype is continuing     to attempt to resolve the matter, in February 2009, Skype     terminated this standstill        32    Table of Contents       agreement, and either party may commence a lawsuit against the     other party beginning in March 2009. Although Skype is confident     of its legal position, as with any litigation, there is the     possibility of an adverse result if the matter is not resolved     through negotiation. In such event, continued operation of     Skypes business as currently conducted would likely not be     possible.     Our     businesses depend on continued and unimpeded access to the     Internet. Internet service providers may be able to block,     degrade, or charge us or our users additional fees for our     offerings.         Our customers rely on access to the Internet to use our products     and services. In many cases that access is provided by companies     that compete with at least some of our offerings, including     incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile     communications companies, and large Internet service providers.     Some of these providers have stated that they may take measures     that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of     customers use of our offerings by restricting or     prohibiting the use of their lines for our offerings, by     filtering, blocking, delaying, or degrading the packets     containing the data associated with our products, or by charging     increased fees to us or our users for use of their lines to     provide our offerings. Some of these providers have     contractually restricted their customers access to VoIP     offerings (which would include Skype) through their terms of     service with their customers. These activities are technically     feasible and may be permitted by applicable law. In addition,     Internet service providers could attempt to charge us each time     our customers use our offerings. Worldwide, a number of     companies have announced plans to take such actions or are     selling products designed to facilitate such actions.     Interference with our offerings or higher charges for access to     our offerings, whether paid by us or by our customers, could     cause us to lose existing customers, impair our ability to     attract new customers, and harm our revenue and growth.     Our     tickets business is subject to regulatory, competitive, and     other risks that could harm this business.         Our tickets business, which includes our StubHub business, is     subject to numerous risks. Many jurisdictions have laws and     regulations covering the resale of event tickets, and some     jurisdictions prohibit the resale of event tickets at prices     above the face value of the tickets. In addition, new laws and     regulations may be passed that would limit our or our     users ability to continue this business. Regulatory     agencies or courts may claim or hold that we are responsible for     ensuring that our users comply with these laws and regulations     or that we or our users are either subject to licensure or     prohibited from reselling event tickets in their jurisdictions.         Some event organizers and professional sports teams have     expressed concern about the resale of their event tickets on our     sites. In November 2006, the New England Patriots filed suit     against StubHub alleging that StubHubs resale activities     violate Massachusetts ticket resale laws and constitute     intentional interference with the teams relationship with     its season ticket holders. Suits alleging a variety of causes of     actions have in the past, and may in the future, be filed     against StubHub by venue owners, competitors, ticket buyers and     unsuccessful ticket buyers. Such litigation could result in     damage awards, could require us to change our business practices     in ways that may be harmful to our business, or could otherwise     negatively affect our tickets business. Our tickets business is     also subject to seasonal fluctuations and the general economic     and business conditions that impact the sporting events and live     entertainment industries. The recent economic downturn has     resulted in a decrease in ticket prices sold on our site and has     adversely affected revenue and profits. Our tickets business     also faces significant competition from a number of sources,     including ticketing service companies (such as TicketMaster and     Tickets.com), event organizers (such as professional sports     teams and leagues), ticket brokers, and other online and offline     ticket resellers, such as TicketsNow (which is owned by     TicketMaster) and RazorGator. In addition, ticketing service     companies and event organizers have recently begun to issue     event tickets through paperless (electronic) ticketing systems     that include restrictions on the transferability of such event     tickets. To the extent that event tickets issued in this manner     cannot be resold on our websites, or to the extent that we are     otherwise unable to compete with these competitors, our tickets     business could be harmed.     We     depend on key personnel.         Our future performance depends substantially on the continued     services of our senior management and other key personnel and     our ability to retain and motivate them. We recently changed our     Chief Executive Officer and the heads of all three of our     business units. These changes may result in increased attrition     of our personnel as new        33    Table of Contents       reporting relationships are established and as other companies     may increasingly target our executives. We do not have long-term     employment agreements with any of our key personnel, we do not     maintain any key person life insurance policies, and     many members of our senior management team have fully vested the     vast majority of their in-the-money equity incentives. The loss     of the services of any of our executive officers or other key     employees could harm our business. Our new businesses all depend     on attracting and retaining key personnel. Our future success     also will depend on our ability to attract, train, retain and     motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing, and     customer support personnel. Competition for these personnel is     intense, and we may be unable to successfully attract,     integrate, or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. In making     employment decisions, particularly in the Internet and     high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the     value of the equity awards they are to receive in connection     with their employment. Fluctuations in our stock price may make     it more difficult to retain and motivate employees whose stock     option strike prices are substantially above current market     prices. Similarly, decreases in the number of unvested     in-the-money stock options held by existing employees, whether     because our stock price has declined, options have vested, or     because the size of follow-on option grants has declined, may     make it more difficult to retain and motivate employees.         In the fourth quarter of 2008, we undertook a plan to reduce our     global workforce to simplify and streamline our organization,     improve our cost structure and strengthen our overall     businesses. These changes have resulted in the recording of     related accounting charges and could harm employee morale and     productivity and be disruptive to our business.     Problems     with or price increases by third parties who provide services to     us or to our users could harm our business.         A number of parties provide services to us or to our users that     benefit us. Such services include seller tools that automate and     manage listings, merchant tools that manage listings and     interface with inventory management software, storefronts that     help our users list items, caching services that make our sites     load faster, and shipping providers that deliver goods sold on     our platform, among others. In some cases we have contractual     agreements with these companies that give us a direct financial     interest in their success, while in other cases we have none.     PayPal is dependent on the processing companies and banks that     link PayPal to the credit card and bank clearing networks.     Similarly, Bill Me Later relies heavily on third parties to     operate its services, including merchant processors and payment     gateways to process transactions. Financial, regulatory, or     other problems that prevent these companies from providing     services to us or our users could reduce the number of listings     on our websites or make completing transactions or payments on     our websites more difficult, and thereby harm our business.     Price increases by companies that provide services to our users     could also reduce the number of listings on our websites or make     it more difficult for our users to complete transactions,     thereby harming our business. For example, we believe recent     changes in postal rates may have reduced listing volume on our     sites in certain categories. Any security breach at one of these     companies could also adversely affect our customers and harm our     business.         In addition, we have outsourced certain functions to third-party     outside providers, including customer support and product     development functions, which are critical to our operations. If     our service providers do not perform satisfactorily, our     operations could be disrupted, which could result in user     dissatisfaction and adversely affect our business, reputation     and operating results. Although we generally have been able to     renew or extend the terms of contractual arrangements with third     parties who provide services to us on acceptable terms, there     can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in     the future, and there can be no assurance that third parties who     provide services directly to our users will continue to do so at     reasonable rates or at all. In addition, the current recession     in the U.S. and a worldwide economic slowdown may impact     the ability of our outside service providers to fulfill their     obligations to us or our users.     Customer     complaints or negative publicity about our customer support or     anti-fraud measures could diminish use of our     services.         Customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer     support could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use     of our services. Measures we sometimes take to combat risks of     fraud and breaches of privacy and security have the potential to     damage relations with our customers or decrease activity on our     sites by making our sites more difficult to use or restricting     the activities of certain users. These measures heighten the     need for        34    Table of Contents       prompt and accurate customer support to resolve irregularities     and disputes. Effective customer support requires significant     personnel expense, and this expense, if not managed properly,     could significantly impact our profitability. Failure to manage     or train our customer support representatives properly could     compromise our ability to handle customer complaints     effectively. If we do not handle customer complaints     effectively, our reputation may suffer and we may lose our     customers confidence.         Because it is providing a financial service and operating in a     more regulated environment, PayPal, unlike eBay, must provide     telephone as well as email customer support and must resolve     certain customer contacts within shorter time frames. As part of     PayPals program to reduce fraud losses and prevent money     laundering, it may temporarily restrict the ability of customers     to withdraw their funds if those funds or the customers     account activity are identified by PayPals risk models as     suspicious. PayPal has in the past received negative publicity     with respect to its customer support and account restrictions,     and has been the subject of purported class action lawsuits and     state attorney general inquiries alleging, among other things,     failure to resolve account restrictions promptly. If PayPal is     unable to provide quality customer support operations in a     cost-effective manner, PayPals users may have negative     experiences, PayPal may receive additional negative publicity,     its ability to attract new customers may be damaged, and it     could become subject to additional litigation. As a result,     current and future revenues could suffer, and its operating     margins may decrease. In addition, negative publicity about, or     negative experiences with, customer support for any of our     businesses could cause our reputation to suffer or affect     consumer confidence in our brands as a whole.     Our     industry is intensely competitive, and other companies or     governmental agencies may allege that our behavior is     anti-competitive.     Marketplaces         Marketplaces businesses currently or potentially compete with a     number of companies providing both particular categories of     goods and broader ranges of goods. The Internet provides new,     rapidly evolving and intensely competitive channels for the sale     of all types of goods. We expect competition to intensify in the     future. The barriers to entry into these channels are relatively     low and current offline and new competitors, including small     businesses who want to create and promote their own stores, can     easily launch online sites at a nominal cost using commercially     available software or partnering with any one of a number of     successful ecommerce companies.         Our broad-based competitors include the vast majority of     traditional department, warehouse, discount, and general     merchandise stores (as well as the online operations of these     traditional retailers), emerging online retailers, online     classified services, and other shopping channels such as offline     and online home shopping networks. Among others, these include:     Wal-Mart, Target, Sears, Macys, JC Penney, Costco, Office     Depot, Staples, OfficeMax, Sams Club, Amazon.com, Buy.com,     AOL.com, Yahoo! Shopping, MSN, QVC, and Home Shopping Network.         A number of companies offer a variety of services that provide     channels for buyers to find and buy items from sellers of all     sizes, including online aggregation and classifieds websites     such as craigslist (in which we own a minority equity stake),     Google Base, Microsoft Live Expo, and Oodle.com. Our classifieds     websites, including Kijiji, Marktplaats, mobile.de, and Gumtree,     offer classifieds listings in the U.S. and a variety of     local international markets. In many markets in which it     operates, including in the U.S., our classified platforms     compete against more established online and offline classifieds     platforms.         In 2005, we acquired Shopping.com Ltd., an online shopping     comparison site. Shopping.com competes with sites such as     Buy.com, Googles Product Search, Nextag.com,     Pricegrabber.com, Shopzilla, and Yahoo! Product Search, which     offer shopping search engines that allow consumers to search the     Internet for specified products. Recent legal developments may     affect the utility of shopping comparison sites if manufacturers     begin requiring more uniformity in product pricing. In addition,     sellers are increasingly utilizing multiple sales channels,     including the acquisition of new customers by paying for     search-related advertisements on search engine sites such as     Google and Yahoo!. We use product search engines and paid search     advertising to channel users to our sites, but these services     also have the potential to divert users to other online shopping     destinations.         We also compete with many local, regional, and national     specialty retailers and exchanges in each of the major     categories of products offered on our websites. For example,     category-specific competitors to offerings in our        35    Table of Contents       Collectibles category include, among others,     Artfact, Beckett, Bonhams & Butterfields, Bowers and     Morena, Christies, Collectiblestoday.com, Collectors     Universe, etsy, Franklin Mint, Go Collect, Heritage,     Littletoncoin, Mastronet, Replacements.com, Ruby Lane, Shop At     Home, Sothebys, Tias, U.S. Mint, U.S. Postal     Service, antique and collectible dealers, antique and     collectible fairs, auction houses, estate sales, flea markets     and swap meets, independent coin and stamp dealers, and     specialty retailers.         Our international Marketplaces websites compete with similar     online and offline channels in each of their vertical categories     in most countries. In addition, they compete with general online     ecommerce sites, such as Quelle and Otto in Germany, Leboncoin.     fr and Price Minister in France, Tradus (recently acquired by     Naspers) in Poland, Yahoo-Kimo in Taiwan, Lotte and Gmarket in     South Korea, Trading Post, OZtion and Aussie Bidder in     Australia, and Amazon in the United Kingdom and other countries.     In some of these countries, there are online sites that have     much larger customer bases and greater brand recognition than we     do, and in certain of these jurisdictions there are competitors     that may have a better understanding of local culture and     commerce than we do.         The principal competitive factors for Marketplaces include the     following:                         ability to attract and retain buyers and sellers;                    volume of transactions and price and selection of goods;                    customer service; and                    brand recognition.           With respect to our online competition, additional competitive     factors include:                         community cohesion, interaction and size;                    website ease-of-use and accessibility;                    level of trust in the seller;                    system reliability;                    reliability of delivery and payment;                    level of service fees; and                    quality of search tools.           Some current and potential competitors have longer operating     histories, larger customer bases and greater brand recognition     in other business and Internet sectors than we do. Other online     trading services may be acquired by, receive investments from,     or enter into other commercial relationships with     well-established and well-financed companies. As a result, some     of our competitors with other revenue sources may be able to     devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns,     adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially     more resources to website and systems development than we can.     Some of our competitors have offered services for free and     others may do this as well. We may be unable to compete     successfully against current and future competitors. In     addition, certain offline competitors may encourage     manufacturers to limit or cease distribution of their products     to dealers who sell through online channels such as eBay, or may     attempt to use existing or future government regulation to     prohibit or limit online commerce in certain categories of goods     or services. The adoption by manufacturers or government     authorities of policies or regulations discouraging the sales of     goods or services over the Internet could force eBay users to     stop selling certain products on our websites. Increased     competition or anti- Internet distribution policies or     regulations may result in reduced operating margins, loss of     market share and diminished value of our brand. In order to     respond to changes in the competitive environment, we may, from     time to time, make pricing, service or marketing decisions or     acquisitions that may be controversial with and lead to     dissatisfaction among a number of our sellers, and which could     harm our profitability.         Conversely, other companies and government agencies have in the     past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the     antitrust or competition laws of the U.S. or other     countries, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. Such     claims, even if without foundation, typically are very expensive     to defend, involve negative publicity and diversion of     management time and effort, and could result in significant     judgments against us.        36    Table of Contents       In several jurisdictions, we have taken actions designed to     improve the safety of transactions on our websites. Beginning in     June 2008, we have required users in the UK to offer PayPal as a     payment alternative on most transactions on our localized UK     website, and since October 2008, we require sellers on eBay.com     to accept one or more accepted payment methods (currently     PayPal, credit or debit cards processed through Internet     merchant accounts,     and/or     ProPay) and no longer allow any forms of paper payment,     including checks and money orders, to be used in the     U.S. for most categories of items. While these initiatives     are intended to improve and make safer our users buying     experience     and/or     increase activity on our sites, certain users may be negatively     affected by or react negatively to these changes. We currently     face inquiries from government regulators in various     jurisdictions related to such actions. For example, the Reserve     Bank of Australia is currently reviewing our policy requiring     sellers to offer PayPal as a payment alternative on most     transactions on our localized Australian website and precluding     them from imposing a surcharge or any other fee for accepting     PayPal or other payment methods. We may face similar inquiries     from other government regulators in the future. Any negative     reaction to these changes by our users or government authorities     could, among other things, force us to change our operating     practices in ways that could harm our business, operating     results and profitability. In addition, certain competitors may     offer or continue to offer free shipping or other transaction     related services, which could be impractical or inefficient for     eBay sellers to match. New technologies may increase the     competitive pressures by enabling our competitors to offer a     lower cost service.         Although we have established Internet traffic arrangements with     several large online services and search engine companies, these     arrangements may not be renewed on commercially reasonable terms     or these companies may decide to promote competitive services.     Even if these arrangements are renewed, they may not result in     increased usage of our services. In addition, companies that     control user access to transactions through network access,     Internet browsers, or search engines, could promote our     competitors, channel current or potential users to their     vertically integrated electronic commerce sites or their     advertisers sites, attempt to restrict our access, or     charge us substantial fees for inclusion. Search engines are     increasingly becoming a starting point for online shopping, and     as the costs of operating an online store decline, online     sellers may increasingly sell goods through multiple channels,     which could reduce the number and value of transactions these     sellers conduct through our sites.     PayPal         The markets for PayPals product are intensely competitive     and are subject to rapid technological change, including but not     limited to: mobile payments, electronic funds transfer networks     starting to allow Internet access, cross-border access to     networks, creation of new networks, expansion of prepaid cards,     and bill pay networks. PayPal competes with existing online and     offline payment methods, including, among others:                         credit card merchant processors that offer their services to     online merchants, including American Express, Cardservice     International, Chase Paymentech, First Data, and Wells Fargo;     and payment gateways, including CyberSource and Authorize.net     (which has merged with CyberSource);                    money remitters such as MoneyGram and Western Union;                    bill payment services, including CheckFree;                    processors that provide online merchants the ability to offer     their customers the option of paying for purchases from their     bank account, including Certegy, eBillMe, Revolution Money and     TeleCheck, a subsidiary of First Data, or to pay on credit;                    providers of traditional payment methods, particularly credit     cards, checks, money orders, and Automated Clearing House     transactions;                    issuers of stored value targeted at online payments, including     VisaBuxx, NetSpend and GreenDot;                    mobile payments, including Obopay, TextPayMe (a subsidiary of     Amazon), Crandy, LUUP and Payforit;                    Amazon Payments, which offers online merchants the ability to     accept credit card- and bank-funded payments from Amazons     base of online customers on the merchants own website; and;                    Google Checkout, which enables the online payment of merchants     using credit cards.          37    Table of Contents         Some of these competitors have longer operating histories,     significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, customer     service and other resources, greater name recognition, or a     larger base of customers in affiliated businesses than PayPal.     PayPals competitors may respond to new or emerging     technologies and changes in customer requirements faster and     more effectively than PayPal. Some of these competitors may also     be subject to lesser licensing, anti-money laundering, and other     regulatory requirements than PayPal, which is subject to     additional regulations based on its licensure as a bank in     Luxembourg. They may devote greater resources to the     development, promotion, and sale of products and services than     PayPal, and they may offer lower prices. For example, Google     Checkout provided free payment processing through     February 1, 2008, and currently offers free payments     processing on transactions in an amount proportionate to certain     advertising spending with Google. Competing services tied to     established banks and other financial institutions may offer     greater liquidity and engender greater consumer confidence in     the safety and efficacy of their services than PayPal.         Overseas, PayPal faces competition from similar channels and     payment methods. In each country, numerous banks provide     standard online credit card acquiring and processing services,     and these banks typically have leading market share. In     addition, PayPal faces competition from Visas Visa Direct,     MasterCards MoneySend, Royal Bank of Scotlands World     Pay and ClickandBuy in the EU, NOCHEX, Moneybookers, NETeller     and FirePay in the United Kingdom, CertaPay and HyperWallet in     Canada, Paymate and BPay in Australia, Alipay, YeePay and     99 Bill in China and Inicis in South Korea. In addition, in     certain countries, such as Germany and Australia, electronic     funds transfer is a leading method of payment for both online     and offline transactions. As in the U.S., established banks and     other financial institutions that do not currently offer online     payments could quickly and easily develop such a service.         Some of PayPals competitors, such as Wells Fargo, First     Data, American Express, and Royal Bank of Scotland, also provide     processing or foreign exchange services to PayPal. If PayPal     were to seek to expand the financial products that it offers,     either alone or through a commercial alliance or an acquisition,     these processing and foreign exchange relationships could be     negatively affected, or these competitors and other processors     could make it more difficult for PayPal to deliver its services.     Skype         The market for Skypes products is also intensely     competitive and characterized by rapid technological change. We     expect Skypes various communications competitors,     including, for example, the providers of online communications     products and telecommunications operators, to continue to     improve the performance of their current products and introduce     new products, software, services and technologies. Many     telecommunications firms offer bundled services,     where a group of services that may include cable or satellite     television, internet services (e.g., cable modem or DSL), and     telecommunications are offered for a single monthly price. If     Skypes competitors successfully introduce new products,     offer bundled services or enhance their existing     products, this could reduce the market for Skypes     products, increase price competition, or make Skypes     products obsolete, which could lower Skypes adoption     rates, decrease its ability to attract new users or cause its     current users to migrate to a competing company.         Additionally, several of Skypes current and potential     competitors have longer operating histories, are substantially     larger, and have greater financial, marketing, technical, and     other resources. Some also have greater name recognition and a     larger installed base of customers than Skype has.     Our     business may be adversely affected by factors that cause our     users to spend less time on our websites, including seasonal     factors, national events and increased usage of other     websites.         Anything that diverts our users from their customary level of     usage of our websites could adversely affect our business. We     would therefore be adversely affected by geopolitical events     such as war, the threat of war, or terrorist activity, and     natural disasters, such as hurricanes or earthquakes. Similarly,     our results of operations historically have been seasonal     because many of our users reduce their activities on our     websites with the onset of good weather during the summer     months, and on and around national holidays. In addition,     increased usage of social networking        38    Table of Contents       or other entertainment websites may decrease the amount of time     users spend on our websites, which could adversely affect our     financial results.     Our     failure to cost-effectively manage certain aspects of our     business could harm us.         We have expanded our headcount, facilities, and infrastructure     in the U.S. and internationally, and anticipate that     further expansion in certain areas will be required as we     continue to expand into new lines of business and geographic     areas. This expansion has placed, and we expect it will continue     to place, a significant strain on our management, operational,     and financial resources. The areas that are put under strain by     our growth include the following:                     Website Usability.  User activity rates on our     websites depend in part on the quality of our users     experiences on those sites. The rapid growth in the number and     complexity of products and features on our sites has     occasionally caused users to become confused or overwhelmed or     has otherwise impaired users experiences on those sites.     We are in the process of making numerous improvements to our     eBay websites, including an attempt to improve the user     experience on those websites. These attempts at improvement     could fail, or could decrease activity among users who had grown     used to or preferred the existing experience on our sites. Any     impairment of customer satisfaction as a result of site     usability issues could lead to a loss of customers or impair our     ability to add customers, either of which would harm our     business.                Website Stability.  We must constantly add new     hardware, update software and add new engineering personnel to     accommodate the increased use of our and our subsidiaries     websites and the new products and features we regularly     introduce. This upgrade process is expensive, and the increased     complexity of our websites and the need to support multiple     platforms as our portfolio of brands grows increases the cost of     additional enhancements. Failure to upgrade our technology,     features, transaction processing systems, security     infrastructure, or network infrastructure to accommodate     increased traffic or transaction volume could harm our business.     Adverse consequences could include unanticipated system     disruptions, slower response times, degradation in levels of     customer support, impaired quality of users experiences of     our services, impaired quality of services for third-party     application developers using our externally accessible     Application Programming Interface, or API, and delays in     reporting accurate financial information. We may be unable to     effectively upgrade and expand our systems in a timely manner or     smoothly integrate any newly developed or purchased technologies     or businesses with our existing systems, and any failure to do     so could result in problems on our sites. Further, steps to     increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems are     expensive, reduce our margins, and may not be successful in     reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime.                Customer Account Billing.  Our revenues depend     on prompt and accurate billing processes. Our failure to grow     our transaction-processing capabilities to accommodate the     increasing number of transactions that must be billed on any of     our websites would harm our business and our ability to collect     revenue.                Customer Support.  We seek to become more     efficient in providing our customer support operations. We     intend to provide an increased level of support (including an     increasing amount of telephone support) in a cost-effective     manner. If we are unable to provide customer support in a     cost-effective manner, users of our websites may have negative     experiences, current and future revenues could suffer, our costs     may increase and our operating margins may decrease.           We must continue to effectively hire, train, and manage new     employees. If our new hires perform poorly, if we are     unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating     these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining     our existing employees, our business may be harmed. To manage     the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will     need to improve our transaction processing, operational and     financial systems, procedures, and controls. This is a special     challenge as we acquire new operations with different systems.     Our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures, and     controls may not be adequate to support our future operations.     Any capital investments that we may make will increase our cost     base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any     future revenue shortfalls by expense reductions in the short     term.        39    Table of Contents   We may     have exposure to greater than anticipated tax     liabilities.         The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes     and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant     judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where     the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Like many other     multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple     U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions and have structured our     operations to reduce our effective tax rate. Our determination     of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by     applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities, and we are     currently undergoing a number of investigations, audits and     reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world, including     with respect to our tax structure. Any adverse outcome of any     such audit or review could have a negative effect on our     business, operating results and financial condition, and the     ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our     financial statements and may materially affect our financial     results in the period or periods for which such determination is     made. While we have take reserves based on assumptions and     estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such     eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient in     the event that any taxing authority is successful in asserting     tax positions that are contrary to our positions.     We     depend on the continued growth of online commerce and     communications.         The business of selling goods over the Internet, particularly     through online trading, is dynamic and relatively new. Concerns     about fraud, privacy, and other problems may discourage     additional consumers from adopting the Internet as a medium of     commerce. In countries such as the U.S., Germany and the U.K.,     where our services and online commerce generally have been     available for some time and the level of market penetration of     our services is high, acquiring new users for our services may     be more difficult and costly than it has been in the past. In     order to expand our user base, we must appeal to and acquire     consumers who historically have used traditional means of     commerce to purchase goods and may prefer Internet analogues to     such traditional retail means to our offerings, such as the     retailers own website. If these consumers prove to be less     active than our earlier users, and we are unable to gain     efficiencies in our operating costs, including our cost of     acquiring new customers, our business could be adversely     impacted.     Our     business depends on the development and maintenance of the     Internet infrastructure.         The success of our services will depend largely on the     development and maintenance of the Internet infrastructure. This     includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the     necessary speed, data capacity, and security, as well as timely     development of complementary products, for providing reliable     Internet access and services. The Internet has experienced, and     is likely to continue to experience, significant growth in the     numbers of users and amount of traffic. The Internet     infrastructure may be unable to support such demands. In     addition, increasing numbers of users, increasing bandwidth     requirements, or problems caused by viruses,     worms, malware and similar programs may harm the     performance of the Internet. The backbone computers of the     Internet have been the targets of such programs. The Internet     has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a     result of damage to portions of its infrastructure, and it could     face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays     could reduce the level of Internet usage generally as well as     the level of usage of our services.     We may     be unable to protect or enforce our own intellectual property     rights adequately.         We regard the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents,     domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets as critical to our     success. We aggressively protect our intellectual property     rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as     well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on     contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in     products and services. We have entered into confidentiality and     invention assignment agreements with our employees and     contractors, and confidentiality agreements with parties with     whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and     disclosure of our proprietary information. These contractual     arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our     intellectual property may not prevent misappropriation of our     technology or deter independent development of similar     technologies by others. We pursue the registration of our domain     names, trademarks, and service marks in the U.S. and     internationally. Effective trademark, copyright, patent, domain     name, trade dress, and trade secret protection is very expensive     to maintain and may require litigation. We must protect our     trademarks, patents, and domain names in an increasing number of     jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be     successful in every location. For example, Skype is in the        40    Table of Contents       process of applying to register the Skype name as a trademark     worldwide. In the EU, Skypes application is being opposed.     If these oppositions to Skypes applications were to be     successful, Skypes ability to protect its brand against     third-party infringers would be compromised. We have licensed in     the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our     proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material,     to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the     value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation.     We are     subject to the risks of owning real property.         We own real property, including land and buildings related to     our operations. We have little experience in managing real     property. Ownership of this property subjects us to risks,     including:                         the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs     associated with fixing any environmental problems;                    adverse changes in the value of these properties, due to     interest rate changes, changes in the neighborhoods in which the     properties are located, or other factors;                    the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply     with zoning, seismic, disability act, or other     requirements; and                    possible disputes with tenants, neighboring owners, or others.       Some     anti-takeover provisions may affect the price of our common     stock.         Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to     10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the     preferences, rights and privileges of those shares without any     further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the     holders of common stock may be harmed by rights granted to the     holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future.     Some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws     could have the effect of making it more difficult for a     potential acquirer to acquire a majority of our outstanding     voting stock. These include provisions that provide for a     classified board of directors, prohibit stockholders from taking     action by written consent and restrict the ability of     stockholders to call special meetings. We are also subject to     provisions of Delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any     business combination with any interested stockholder for a     period of three years from the date the person became an     interested stockholder, unless certain conditions are met. This     restriction could have the effect of delaying or preventing a     change of control.           ITEM 1B:     UNRESOLVED     STAFF COMMENTS           Not applicable.           ITEM 2:     PROPERTIES           We own and lease various properties in the United States and 25     other countries around the world. We use the properties for     executive and administrative offices, data centers, product     development offices and customer service offices. As of     December 31, 2008, our owned and leased properties provided     us with aggregate square footage of approximately     1.7 million and 2.3 million, respectively. Our     corporate headquarters of approximately 0.2 million square     feet are located in San Jose, California. As of     December 31, 2008, the total square footage generally used     by each of our Marketplaces, Payments and Communications     segments was approximately 2.1 million, 1.6 million     and 0.1 million, respectively.         From time to time we consider various alternatives related to     our long-term facilities needs. While we believe our existing     facilities are adequate to meet our immediate needs, it may     become necessary to lease or acquire additional or alternative     space to accommodate any future growth.           ITEM 3:     LEGAL     PROCEEDINGS           In August 2006, Louis Vuitton Malletier and Christian Dior     Couture filed two lawsuits in the Paris Court of Commerce     against eBay Inc. and eBay International AG. Among other things,     the complaint alleges that we violated French tort law by     negligently broadcasting listings posted by third parties     offering counterfeit items        41    Table of Contents       bearing plaintiffs trademarks, and by purchasing certain     advertising keywords. Around September 2006, Parfums Christian     Dior, Kenzo Parfums, Parfums Givenchy, and Guerlain     Société also filed a lawsuit in the Paris Court of     Commerce against eBay Inc. and eBay International AG. The     complaint alleges that we have interfered with the selective     distribution network the plaintiffs established in France and     the European Union by allowing third parties to post listings     offering genuine perfumes and cosmetics for sale on our     websites. In June 2008, the Paris Court of Commerce ruled that     eBay and eBay International AG were liable for failing to     prevent the sale of counterfeit items on its websites that     traded on plaintiffs brand names and for interfering with     the plaintiffs selective distribution network. The court     awarded plaintiffs approximately EUR 38.6 million in     damages and issued an injunction prohibiting all sales of     perfumes and cosmetics bearing the Dior, Guerlain, Givenchy and     Kenzo brands over all worldwide eBay sites to the extent that     they are accessible from France. We have taken measures to     comply with the injunction and have appealed these rulings.     However, these and similar suits may force us to modify our     business practices, which could lower our revenue, increase our     costs, or make our websites less convenient to our customers.     Any such results could materially harm our business. Other     luxury brand owners have also filed suit against us or have     threatened to do so, seeking to hold us liable for, among other     things, alleged counterfeit items listed on our websites by     third parties, for tester and other not for resale     consumer products listed on our websites by third parties, for     the alleged misuse of trademarks in listings, for alleged     violations of selective distribution channel laws, for alleged     non-compliance of consumer protection laws or in connection with     paid search advertisements. We continue to believe that we have     meritorious defenses to these suits and intend to defend     ourselves vigorously.         In June 2006, Net2Phone, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the     U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey     (No. 06-2469)     alleging that eBay Inc., Skype Technologies S.A., and Skype Inc.     infringed five patents owned by Net2Phone relating to     point-to-point Internet protocol. The suit seeks an injunction     against continuing infringement, unspecified damages, including     treble damages for willful infringement, and interest, costs,     and fees. We have filed an answer and counterclaims asserting     that the patents are invalid, unenforceable, and were not     infringed. The parties have completed claim construction     briefing and attended a pre-trial conference hearing. The claim     construction hearing is set for March 2009 and the trial date is     not yet set. We believe that we have meritorious defenses and     intend to defend ourselves vigorously.         In March 2007, a plaintiff filed a purported antitrust class     action lawsuit against eBay in the Western District of Texas     alleging that eBay and its wholly owned subsidiary PayPal     monopolized markets through various anticompetitive     acts and tying arrangements. The plaintiff alleges claims under     sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, as well as related     state law claims. The complaint seeks treble damages and an     injunction. In April 2007, the plaintiff re-filed the complaint     in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of     California     (No. 07-CV-01882-RS),     and dismissed the Texas action. In 2007, the case was     consolidated with other similar lawsuits     (No. 07-CV-01882JF).     In June 2007, we filed a motion to dismiss the class action     complaint. In March 2008, the court granted the motion to     dismiss the tying claims with leave to amend and denied the     motion with respect to the monopolization claims. Plaintiffs     subsequently decided not to refile the tying claims. The class     certification motion is scheduled for June 2009. We believe that     we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves     vigorously.         In May 2007, Netcraft Corporation filed a lawsuit in the Western     District of Wisconsin     (No. 07-C-0254C)     alleging that eBay and PayPal infringed two of its patents     entitled Internet billing methods. The suit seeks an     injunction against continuing infringement, unspecified damages,     and interest, costs, and fees. In September 2007, we filed a     motion for summary judgment of noninfringement on both patents.     In December 2007, the U.S. District Court for the Western     District of Wisconsin entered a judgment granting our motion for     summary judgment of non-infringement on both of the patents that     Netcraft asserted against eBay and PayPal. This judgment was     affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in     December 2008.         In October 2007, PartsRiver filed a lawsuit in the Eastern     District of Texas     (No. 2-07CV-440-DF)     alleging that eBay, Microsoft, Yahoo!, Shopzilla, PriceGrabber     and PriceRunner infringed its patent relating to search methods.     The suit seeks an injunction against continuing infringement,     unspecified damages, and interest, costs, and fees. The     defendants have moved to transfer venue and the parties are     conducting discovery. Fact discovery cutoff is scheduled for     July 2009, the claim construction hearing is scheduled for April     2009 and trial is scheduled for October 2009. We believe that we     have meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves     vigorously.        42    Table of Contents       eBays Korean subsidiary, IAC, has notified a majority of     its approximately 20 million users of a data breach     involving personally identifiable information including name,     address, resident registration number and some transaction and     refund data (but not including credit card information or real     time banking information). Approximately 141,000 users have sued     IAC over this breach in several lawsuits in Korean courts and we     expect more to do so in the future. There is some precedent in     Korea for a court to grant consolation money for     data breaches without a specific finding of harm from the     breach. Such precedents have involved payments of up to     approximately $200 per user. A consumer agency recently made a     non-binding recommendation that IAC make payments of     50,000-100,000 Korean won (approximately $35-70) to consumers     who had complained to it as a result of such breach. IAC intends     to vigorously defend itself in this lawsuit.         Other third parties have from time to time claimed, and others     may claim in the future, that we have infringed their     intellectual property rights. We are subject to additional     patent disputes, and expect that we will increasingly be subject     to patent infringement claims as our services expand in scope     and complexity. In particular, we expect that we may face     additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects     of our Marketplaces, Payments and Communications businesses. We     have in the past been forced to litigate such claims. We may     also become more vulnerable to third-party claims as laws such     as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Lanham Act and the     Communications Decency Act are interpreted by the courts, and as     we become subject to laws in jurisdictions where the underlying     laws with respect to the potential liability of online     intermediaries like ourselves are either unclear or less     favorable. We believe that additional lawsuits alleging that we     have violated copyright or trademark laws will be filed against     us. Intellectual property claims, whether meritorious or not,     are time consuming and costly to resolve, could require     expensive changes in our methods of doing business, or could     require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements.         From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or     regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of     business. The number and significance of these disputes and     inquiries are increasing as our business expands and our company     grows larger. Any claims or regulatory actions against us,     whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in     costly litigation, require significant amounts of management     time, and result in the diversion of significant operational     resources.

In January 2007, our Board     authorized the expansion of this stock repurchase program to     provide for the repurchase of up to an additional     $2.0 billion of our common stock by January 2009. In     January 2008, our Board approved an additional stock repurchase     program for $2.0 billion having no expiration date, giving     us the ability to repurchase up to $2.85 billion of the     common stock under our combined stock repurchase programs. Under     these programs, as of December 31, 2008, we had repurchased     in the aggregate approximately 179.7 million shares of our     common stock at an average price of $29.74 per share. As of     December 31, 2008, $656.5 million remained available     for further purchases under our stock repurchase program.

Overview         We operate three primary business segments: Marketplaces,     Payments and Communications. Our Marketplaces segment provides     the infrastructure to enable global online commerce on a variety     of platforms, including the traditional eBay.com platform, and     our other online platforms, such as our online classifieds     businesses, our secondary tickets marketplace (StubHub), our     online shopping comparison website (Shopping.com), our apartment     listing service platform (Rent.com), as well as our fixed price     media marketplace (Half.com). Our payments segment is comprised     of our online payment solutions  PayPal (which     enables individuals and businesses to securely, easily and     quickly send and receive payments online in approximately 190     markets worldwide) and Bill Me Later (which we acquired in     November 2008 and which enables online U.S. merchants to     offer, and U.S. consumers to obtain, transactional credit     at the point of sale). Our Communications segment, which     consists of Skype, enables VoIP calls between Skype users and     provides low-cost connectivity to traditional fixed-line and     mobile telephones.         Overall, 2008 revenue increased 11% to $8.5 billion,     diluted earnings per share increased from $0.25 to $1.36 and     operating cash flow increased 9% to $2.9 billion. PayPal,     Classifieds, Advertising (in particular text and graphical     advertising) and Skype were the key drivers of growth, with     these businesses achieving a revenue growth rate of 25%, 57%,     40% and 44%, respectively. We also achieved an operating margin     of 24%, with segment margins flat or better across all three of     our business segments despite the deteriorating global economic     environment in the latter half of 2008. However, we experienced     declining revenue growth rates in total and on a segment basis.         During 2008, two of our key priorities were to reaccelerate the     gross merchandise volume (GMV) growth in our Marketplaces core     business and to grow our Payments business off the eBay platform     (PayPals merchant services business). In order to     reaccelerate growth in GMV, we focused our actions in 2008 on     improving eBays Marketplaces by:                         Expanding selection;                    Improving our trust and safety; and                    Making it easier to find great values.           We will continue to focus on evolving a large and complex     marketplace to reaccelerate growth in our core business.         We also made it a priority to expand the presence of PayPal     beyond the eBay.com platform to better diversify our revenue     sources and reduce our dependence on the eBay.com platform.     During the second half of 2008, net total payment volume     generated by PayPals merchant services business exceeded     volume on the eBay.com platform. PayPals merchant services     business grew 45% in 2008 as we expanded adoption of PayPal     across the Internet. Our acquisition of Bill Me Later in     November 2008 is expected to enhance our leadership position in     online payment solutions.         Over the last three years, we have expanded our global footprint     with approximately 54% of revenues now coming from outside the     U.S. and diversified our revenue stream with approximately     45% of revenues now coming from non-Marketplaces transaction     revenues.         Some key operating metrics that members of our senior management     regularly review to evaluate our financial results include GMV,     number of sold items, net total payment volume, Merchant     Services net total payment volume, SkypeOut Minutes, free cash     flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures), and     revenue, excluding acquisitions and foreign currency impact.     Outlook         The current uncertain economic environment and volatile foreign     currency exchange rates make it difficult to identify trends     likely to impact our financial results beyond the first quarter     of 2009. We expect revenues and net        49    Table of Contents       income in the first quarter of 2009 to be lower than the first     quarter of 2008 due primarily to the effect of an anticipated     stronger U.S. dollar as well as the negative impact of the     economic environment on consumer spending and the challenges     associated with reaccelerating growth of GMV in our Marketplaces     core business. Although the current economic environment makes     it difficult to predict the impact on individual types of     expenses, we expect that cost controls, including our     previously-announced restructuring that impacts our employee     related operating expenses, will partially offset the negative     effects of an anticipated year-over-year decline in revenues and     our expected investments in our higher growth businesses such as     Payments, Classifieds and Communications. We also expect diluted     earnings per share will be negatively impacted by lower interest     rates and from dilution resulting from recent acquisitions.     Results     of Operations     Net     Revenues         Our net transaction revenues from our Marketplaces segment are     derived primarily from listing and final value fees paid by     sellers. For our Payments segment, net transaction revenues are     generated primarily by fees paid by merchants for payment     processing services. Our Communications segment net transaction     revenues are generated primarily from fees charged to users to     connect Skypes VoIP product to traditional fixed-line and     mobile telephones. These fees are charged on a per-minute basis     or on a subscription basis and we refer to these minutes as     SkypeOut minutes.         Our marketing services and other revenue are generated from all     three of our business segments. Our marketing services are     derived principally from the sale of advertisements, revenue     sharing arrangements, classifieds fees, lead referral fees. Our     other revenues are derived principally from interest earned from     banks on certain PayPal customer account balances, interest and     fees earned on the Bill Me Later loan portfolio and from     contractual arrangements with third parties that provide     services to all of our users.         Revenues are attributed to U.S. and international     geographies primarily based upon the country in which the     seller, payment recipient, customer, Skype users Internet     protocol address, online property that generates advertising, or     other service provider, as the case may be, is located. Because     we generate the majority of our revenue internationally,     fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will impact our     results of operations. Based on changes in foreign currency     rates year over year, total net revenues for the year ended     December 31, 2008 were positively impacted by foreign     currency translation of approximately $190.9 million     compared to the prior year. On a business segment basis,     Marketplaces, Payments and Communications total net revenues for     the year ended December 31, 2008 were positively impacted     by foreign currency translation of approximately     $158.8 million, $0.3 million and $31.8 million,     respectively. Total net revenues for the year ended     December 31, 2007 were positively impacted by foreign     currency translation of approximately $276.0 million     compared to the prior year. On a business segment basis,     Marketplaces, Payments and Communications total net revenues for     the year ended December 31, 2007 were positively impacted     by foreign currency translation of approximately     $222.4 million, $21.4 million and $32.2 million,     respectively. Impact of foreign currency translation only     includes changes between our functional currencies and our     U.S. dollar reporting currency.        50    Table of Contents       The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, the     breakdown of net revenues by type, segment and geography. In     addition, we have provided a table of certain key operating     metrics that we believe are significant factors affecting our     net revenues.

reflected under Advertising and Other     Revenue. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to     conform to the current presentation.

However, this was not the case in     2008 due to the impact of the global economic environment and     strengthening U.S. dollar, which impacted the fourth     quarter in particular.     Marketplaces     Net Transaction Revenues         Marketplaces net transaction revenues increased     $30.2 million, or 1%, in 2008 compared to 2007, which is     consistent with our 0.5% increase in GMV over the same period.     GMV generated by our largest category, vehicles, declined 9%.     Excluding vehicles, GMV would have increased 3% due primarily to     an increase in our second largest category, consumer     electronics. Although we achieved growth in the number of sold     items on our eBay Marketplaces trading platforms, the average     selling price declined primarily as a result of consumer buying     patterns in a weakening global economic environment.     Expenditures for buyer incentive programs, which are generally     recorded as a reduction in revenue, reduced revenue growth by     approximately 4% in 2008. In addition, pricing discounts and     changes had a negative impact on revenue growth.         Marketplaces net transaction revenues increased     $816.3 million, or 21%, in 2007 compared to 2006 due     primarily to a 13% increase in GMV during 2007 compared to 2006,     and a shift to higher revenue generating categories. GMV growth     in 2007 occurred across all major categories, with the vehicles,     consumer electronics,        52    Table of Contents       home and garden, clothing and accessories and tickets having the     most significant positive dollar impact when compared to 2006.         Marketplaces net transaction revenues earned internationally     were $2.5 billion in 2008 and 2007 and $2.0 billion in     2006, representing 54%, 53% and 51% of total Marketplaces net     transaction revenues, respectively.     Payments     Net Transaction Revenues         Payments net transaction revenues increased $482.0 million,     or 26%, in 2008, compared to 2007, which is consistent with our     year-over-year increase in net total payment volume (TPV) of     27%. Payments net transaction revenues increased due primarily     to growth in our Merchant Services business and the increase in     PayPals penetration of eBay Marketplaces GMV. Our Merchant     Services net TPV experienced 49% year-over-year growth in     2008 and represented 49% of PayPals net TPV in 2008.     The increase in our Merchant Services business resulted from     more online merchants, both domestically and internationally,     adding PayPal as a payment option.         Payments net transaction revenues increased $436.7 million,     or 31%, in 2007 compared to 2006, which is consistent with our     year-over-year increase in net TPV of 33%. Payments net     transaction revenues due primarily to growth in our Merchant     Services business and the increase in PayPals penetration     of eBay Marketplaces GMV. Our Merchant Services net TPV     experienced 59% year-over-year growth in 2007 and represented     42% of PayPals net TPV in 2007. The increase in     Merchant Services business resulted from more online merchants,     both domestically and internationally, adding PayPal as a     payment option.         Payments net transaction revenues earned internationally totaled     $1.0 billion in 2008, $0.8 billion in 2007, and     $0.5 billion in 2006, representing 44%, 42% and 38% of     total Payments net transaction revenues, respectively.     International growth in our Payments segment continues to     benefit from the expansion of our geographical footprint, the     increase in the number of currencies supported by PayPal and the     increase in cross-border payments, which generate larger fees.     Communications     Net Transaction Revenues         Communications net transaction revenues increased     $161.2 million, or 44%, in 2008 compared to 2007. The     increase in net transaction revenues was due primarily to our     year-over-year increase in SkypeOut minutes of 2.7 billion.     The increase in SkypeOut minutes was due primarily to the growth     in the cumulative number of Skype registered users to     405.3 million at December 31, 2008 from     276.3 million at December 31, 2007. The growth in     Skype registered users was primarily due to its marketing     activities and strategic partnership initiatives.         Communications net transaction revenues increased     $175.5 million, or 93%, in 2007 compared to 2006. The     increase in net transaction revenues was due primarily to our     year-over-year increase in SkypeOut minutes of 1.6 billion.     The increase in SkypeOut minutes was due primarily to the growth     in the cumulative number of Skype registered users to     276.3 million at December 31, 2007 from     171.2 million at December 31, 2006.         Net transaction revenues from Communications earned     internationally totaled $0.4 billion in 2008,     $0.3 billion in 2007 and $0.2 billion in 2006,     representing 83%, 84% and 86% of total Communications net     transaction revenues, respectively. Skype revenue is primarily     generated in Europe.     Marketing     Services and Other Revenues         Marketing services and other revenues increased     $195.5 million, or 25%, in 2008 compared to 2007 and     represented 12% of total net revenues in 2008 compared to 10% of     total net revenues in 2007. Marketing services and other     revenues growth was due primarily to an increase in text and     graphical advertising revenue and an increase in classifieds     revenue, partially offset by a decline in Shopping.com revenue     due to the impact of rule changes made by third-party search     engines that adversely affected click-through traffic to     retailers from our Shopping.com website and reduced associated     fees. Additionally, a decline in interest rates reduced interest     earned from banks on certain U.S. PayPal customer account     balances and negatively impacted revenue growth in 2008. The     decrease in interest earned on certain U.S. PayPal customer     account balances was partially offset by interest income from     our Bill Me Later loan portfolio.        53    Table of Contents       Marketing services and other revenues increased     $274.1 million, or 53%, in 2007 compared to 2006 and     represented 10% of total net revenues compared to 9% of total     net revenues in 2006. Marketing services and other revenue     growth in 2007 was due primarily to an increase in text and     graphical advertising revenue, classifieds revenue, Shopping.com     revenue and interest earned from banks on certain     U.S. PayPal customer accounts. Prior to the fourth quarter     of 2006, these certain U.S. PayPal customer account     balances were maintained in non-interest bearing accounts.     Summary     of Cost of Net Revenues, Operating Expenses, Non-Operating Items     and Provision for Income Taxes         In 2008, we reclassified certain operating expenses related to     the provision for transaction losses, customer protection     programs and bad debt expense from Sales and     Marketing and General and Administrative     expenses to Provision for Transaction and Loan     Losses. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to     conform to the current presentation. Consolidated operating     expenses, as well as segment direct costs, are unchanged.         The following table summarizes changes in cost of net revenues,     operating expenses, non-operating items and provision for income     taxes:                                                                                                                      Change from            Change from                  Year Ended December 31,           2006 to 2007           2007 to 2008                 2006           2007           2008           in Dollars           in %           in Dollars           in %                 (in thousands, except percentages)                   Cost of net revenues            $       1,256,792               $       1,762,972               $       2,228,069               $       506,180                   40       %           $       465,097                   26       %          Sales and marketing                1,587,133                   1,882,810                   1,881,551                   295,677                   19       %               (1,259       )               (0       )%          Product development                494,695                   619,727                   725,600                   125,032                   25       %               105,873                   17       %          General and administrative                744,363                   904,681                   998,871                   160,318                   22       %               94,190                   10       %          Provision for transaction and loan losses                266,724                   293,917                   347,453                   27,193                   10       %               53,536                   18       %          Amortization of acquired intangible assets                197,078                   204,104                   234,916                   7,026                   4       %               30,812                   15       %          Restructuring                                                      49,119                                                         49,119                   100       %          Impairment of goodwill                                   1,390,938                                      1,390,938                   100       %               (1,390,938       )               (100       )%          Interest and other income, net                130,017                   154,271                   115,919                   24,254                   19       %               (38,352       )               (25       )%          Interest expense                5,916                   16,600                   8,037                   10,684                   181       %               (8,563       )               (52       )%          Provision for income taxes                421,418                   402,600                   404,090                   (18,818       )               (4       )%               1,490                   0       %         Cost     of Net Revenues                                                          2006           2007           2008                 (in thousands, except percentages)                   Cost of net revenues            $       1,256,792               $       1,762,972               $       2,228,069              As a percentage of net revenues                21.1       %               23.0       %               26.1       %             Cost of net revenues consists primarily of costs associated with     payment processing, customer support and site operations and     Skype telecommunications. Significant components of these costs     include bank transaction fees, credit card interchange fees,     assessments, Bill Me Later related interest charges, employee     compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation     of equipment and amortization expense.         The increase in cost of net revenues of $465.1 million, or     26%, in 2008 compared to 2007 was due primarily to an increase     in customer support and site operations costs, payment     processing costs and Skype telecommunication costs. Aggregate     customer support and site operations costs increased     approximately $205.7 million, or 28%, due primarily to the     development and expansion of our customer support and site     operations infrastructure to support our growth in transaction     volume as demonstrated through the increase in net TPV.     Payment processing costs increased approximately     $165.2 million, or 24%, due primarily to the 27% increase     in net TPV and an increase in        54    Table of Contents       the proportion of customer transactions funded with credit     cards, which have higher associated processing costs, offset by     a more favorable geographic mix and lower per transaction costs.     Skype telecommunications costs increased by $62.9 million,     or 28%, due to the increase of SkypeOut minutes. Cost of net     revenues increased as a percentage of net revenues primarily as     a result of the growth of our lower gross margin businesses,     particularly PayPal and Skype.         The increase in cost of net revenues of $506.2 million, or     40%, in 2007 compared to 2006 was due primarily to an increase     in payment processing costs, customer support and site     operations costs and Skype telecommunications costs. Payment     processing costs increased approximately $200.1 million, or     40%, due primarily to the 33% increase in PayPals     net TPV, an increase in the proportion of customer     transactions funded with credit cards, which have higher     associated processing costs, and increased Marketplaces     transaction activity. Aggregate customer support and site     operations costs increased approximately $153.1 million, or     26%, due to the development and expansion of our customer     support and site operations infrastructure to support our growth     in transaction volume as demonstrated through the increases in     both GMV and net TPV. Skype telecommunications costs     increased by $86.2 million, or 64%, due to the increase of     SkypeOut minutes. Cost of net revenues increased as a percentage     of net revenues primarily as a result of the growth of our lower     gross margin businesses, particularly PayPal and Skype.

Sales and marketing expenses decreased $1.3 million in 2008     compared to 2007 as we increased the use of buyer and seller     incentive programs (for which certain associated expenses are     recorded as a reduction in revenue instead of sales and     marketing expense) as opposed to online and offline marketing     programs as we shifted our marketing focus from customer     acquisition to customer retention. Marketing and advertising     program costs decreased approximately $100.4 million     partially offset by an $87.7 million increase in     employee-related costs due to a net increase in staffing. Our     marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in     revenue and changes in advertising rates. Sales and marketing     expense as a percentage of net revenues decreased from 2007, due     to more efficient spending within our Marketplaces segment as we     shifted the focus of our marketing programs, as well as the     growth of our Payments and Communications segments, each of     which has a lower relative sales and marketing expenses than our     Marketplaces segment.         Sales and marketing expenses increased $295.7 million, or     19%, in 2007 compared to 2006, due to our continued investment     in retaining and growing our active user base. We direct     customers to our websites primarily through a number of online     marketing channels such as sponsored search, portal advertising,     email campaigns and other initiatives. Growth in advertising and     marketing costs, as well as employee-related costs, comprised     the majority of the increases. Combined advertising and     marketing costs increased $222.5 million due to an increase     in global television and online marketing campaigns.     Employee-related costs and the use of contractors increased by     $48.7 million as we continued to expand our domestic and     international operations. Sales and marketing expense as a     percentage of net revenues decreased from 2006, due to more     efficient spending within our Marketplaces segment as we     continued to refine our marketing programs and to the growth of     our Payments and Communications segments, each of which has     lower relative sales and marketing expenses than our     Marketplaces segment.

Product development expenses are net     of required capitalization of major site and other product     development efforts, including the development of our next     generation platform architecture, migration of certain     platforms, seller tools and Payments services projects. These     capitalized costs totaled $112.7 million in 2008,     $110.6 million in 2007 and $67.9 million in 2006, and     are primarily reflected as a cost of net revenues when amortized     in future periods.         Product development expenses increased $105.9 million, or     17%, in 2008 compared to 2007 due primarily to an increase in     staffing, consultant costs, facility costs and equipment related     costs to support several platform development initiatives to     enhance the user experience and expand our existing product     offerings primarily across our Marketplaces and Payments     segments. Product development expenses as a percentage of net     revenues increased slightly from 2007 as we added capacity at a     faster rate than we generated revenue.         Product development expenses increased $125.0 million, or     25%, in 2007 compared to 2006 due primarily to an increase in     staffing, consultant costs, facility costs and equipment related     costs to support several platform development initiatives to     enhance the user experience and expand our existing product     offerings primarily across our Marketplaces and Payments     segments. Product development expenses as a percentage of net     revenues decreased slightly from 2006 as we continued to add     capacity at a slower rate than we generated revenue.

General and administrative expenses increased     $94.2 million, or 10%, in 2008 compared to 2007 due     primarily to an increase in professional services,     employee-related costs and facilities costs. Professional     services costs increased $54.5 million due primarily to     legal related costs incurred in connection with various ongoing     litigation that can fluctuate from period to period.     Employee-related costs and facilities costs increased by     approximately $40.2 million due to a net increase in     headcount. General and administrative expenses as a percentage     of net revenue decreased slightly from 2007 due to our continued     leverage of our existing infrastructure.         General and administrative expenses increased     $160.3 million, or 22%, in 2007 compared to 2006 due     primarily to an increase in employee-related costs, facilities     costs, and professional services. Employee-related costs and     facilities costs increased by approximately $111.6 million     due primarily to an increase in headcount. Professional services     costs increased $35.7 million. General and administrative     expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased from 2006 due     to our continued leverage of our existing infrastructure.

Provision for transaction and loan losses increased     $53.5 million, or 18%, in 2008 compared to 2007 due     primarily to an increase in transaction loss expense and an     increase in bad debt expense. PayPal transaction loss expense     increased by approximately $32.2 million because of the     increase in net TPV. Bad debt expense increased        56    Table of Contents       approximately $22.1 million due to increased revenues and     an increase in our bad debt reserve rate due to the global     economic environment.         Provision for transaction and loan losses increased     $27.2 million, or 10%, in 2007 compared to 2006 due     primarily to an increase in transaction loss expense, losses     from our consumer protection programs and bad debt expense.     PayPals transaction loss rate, which is the transaction     loss expense as a percentage of PayPals net TPV,     decreased to 0.29% during 2007 compared to 0.35% during 2006 as     we continued to refine our fraud prevention tools; however,     transaction loss expense still increased by approximately     $12.8 million because of the increase in net TPV.     Losses from our customer protection programs and bad debt     expense increased $14.4 million due to increased revenues     and a lower bad debt reserve rate.     Amortization     of Acquired Intangible Assets                                                          2006           2007           2008                 (in thousands, except percentages)                   Amortization of acquired intangible assets            $       197,078               $       204,104               $       234,916              As a percentage of net revenues                3.3       %               2.7       %               2.8       %             From time to time we have purchased, and we expect to continue     to purchase, assets or businesses to accelerate category and     geographic expansion, increase the features, functions, and     formats available to our users and maintain a leading role in     ecommerce, online payments and online communications. These     purchase transactions generally result in the creation of     acquired intangible assets with finite lives and lead to a     corresponding increase in the amortization expense in future     periods. We amortize intangible assets over the period of     estimated benefit, using the straight-line method and estimated     useful lives ranging from one to eight years. The increase in     amortization of acquired amortizable intangibles during 2008 and     2007 compared to prior years is due to the business acquisitions     consummated during 2008, 2007 and 2006. See     Note 3  Business Combinations, Goodwill     and Intangible Assets to the consolidated financial     statements included in this report.     Restructuring         In October 2008, we implemented a strategic reduction of our     existing global workforce by approximately 800 employees     worldwide to simplify and streamline our organization and     strengthen the overall competitiveness of our existing     businesses. The majority of the costs will impact our     Marketplaces business in the U.S. As a result of this     initiative, we estimate that we will incur aggregate costs of     approximately $65.0-70.0 million. During the year ended     December 31, 2008, total restructuring charges amounted to     $49.1 million, less than our original 2008 estimate of     $60.0 million to 70.0 million, as disclosed on our Current     Report on     Form 8-K     filed with the SEC on October 6, 2008. The restructuring     activities are expected to be substantially complete by the end     of the first quarter of 2009. Once completed, the restructuring     activities are expected to result in an annual cost savings of     approximately $150.0 million. See     Note 9  Restructuring to the     consolidated financial statements included in this report.     Impairment     of Goodwill         During 2006, 2007 and 2008, we conducted our annual impairment     test of goodwill as of August 31 in accordance with     SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible     Assets. As a result of this test, no goodwill impairment     charges were recorded during 2008 and 2006. However, in 2007, we     recorded a $1.4 billion impairment of goodwill charge     related to our Communications segment. Our estimates of future     operating results for our Communications reporting unit are for     an early stage business with limited financial history, as well     as developing revenue models. These factors increase the risk of     differences between projected and actual performance that could     impact future estimates of fair value of the Communications     reporting unit.

Interest and other income, net decreased $38.4 million, or     25%, in 2008 as compared to 2007 due primarily to lower cash,     cash equivalents, and investments balances and lower interest     rates, as well as losses from our portion of unconsolidated     joint ventures and equity investments, offset by foreign     currency exchange gains. The weighted-average interest rate of     our cash and interest bearing investments portfolio decreased to     3.5% in 2008 from 4.2% in 2007.         Interest and other income, net increased $24.3 million, or     19%, in 2007 as compared to 2006 due primarily to higher cash,     cash equivalents, and investments balances and higher interest     rates, partially offset by losses from our portion of     unconsolidated joint ventures and equity investments. The     weighted-average interest rate of our cash and interest bearing     investments portfolio increased to 4.2% in 2007 from 3.8% in     2006.

The decrease in interest expense during 2008     compared to the prior year is due primarily to less borrowing     and lower interest rates. In addition, as a result of the     acquisition of Bill Me Later, we include a portion of interest     expense within cost of net revenues which represents our     estimated cost of funds associated with Bill Me Later loan     activity. The increase in interest expense in 2007 compared to     2006 was due primarily to more borrowing under our credit     agreement.     Provision     for Income Taxes                                                          2006           2007           2008                 (in thousands, except percentages)                   Provision for income taxes            $       421,418               $       402,600               $       404,090              As a percentage of net revenues                7.1       %               5.2       %               4.7       %          Effective tax rate                27       %               54       %               19       %             The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed     by applying the statutory U.S. federal rate principally due     to foreign income with lower tax rates and from tax credits that     lower the effective tax rate, offset by state taxes, subsidiary     losses and an impairment charge in 2007 for which we have not     provided a benefit and other factors that impact the effective     tax rate.         The lower effective tax rate in 2008 compared to 2007 was due to     the goodwill impairment charge in 2007 with respect to our     Communications reporting unit which is non-deductible for tax     purposes, partially offset by a tax benefit from a ruling issued     by a tax authority related to prior periods recognized in 2007.     The higher effective tax rates in 2007 as compared to 2006     resulted primarily from the goodwill impairment charge in 2007.        58    Table of Contents   Liquidity     and Capital Resources     Cash     Flows                                                          Year Ended December 31,                 2006           2007           2008                 (in thousands)               Consolidated Cash Flow Data:                                                           Net cash provided by (used in):                                                           Operating activities            $       2,247,791               $       2,641,109               $       2,881,995              Investing activities                228,853                   (693,146       )               (2,057,346       )          Financing activities                (1,260,687       )               (693,392       )               (1,673,851       )          Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents                133,255                   303,828                   (183,061       )                                                                Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents            $       1,349,212               $       1,558,399               $       (1,032,263       )                                                               Operating     Activities         We generated cash from operating activities in amounts greater     than net income in 2006, 2007 and 2008, due primarily to     non-cash charges to earnings and tax benefits from stock-based     compensation. Non-cash charges to earnings included depreciation     and amortization on our long-term assets, stock-based     compensation and the provision for transaction and loan losses.     Non-cash charges in 2007 also included a $1.4 billion     goodwill impairment charge (including the $530.3 million     earn out settlement payment).         Cash paid for income taxes in 2006, 2007 and 2008 was     $179.2 million, $363.0 million and     $366.8 million, respectively.     Investing     Activities         The net cash used in investing activities in 2008 and 2007 was     due primarily to cash paid for acquisitions and the purchase of     property and equipment, which was offset in 2007 by cash     generated by the sale of investments. The net cash provided by     investing activities in 2006 reflected the cash generated from     the sale of investments offset by the purchase of property and     equipment. Purchases of property and equipment, net totaled     $565.9 million in 2008, $454.0 million in 2007, and     $515.4 million in 2006, related primarily to purchases of     computer equipment and software to support our site operations,     customer support and international expansion. Cash expended for     acquisitions, net of cash acquired, totaled approximately     $1.4 billion in 2008, $863.6 million in 2007, and     $45.5 million in 2006. In 2008, acquisition activity of     $1.4 billion consisted primarily of the acquisition of     Fraud Sciences, Den Blå Avis and BilBasen and Bill Me     Later. In 2007, acquisition activity primarily consisted of a     $530.3 million earn out settlement payment related to our     2005 Skype acquisition and our acquisition of StubHub. In 2006,     we acquired Tradera.com.     Financing     Activities         The net cash flows used in financing activities of     $1.7 billion in 2008 were due primarily to the repurchase     of approximately 80.6 million shares of our common stock     for an aggregate purchase price of approximately     $2.2 billion and the repayment of a bank obligation of     $434.0 million assumed in the Bill Me Later acquisition,     offset by the proceeds from stock option exercises totaling     $135.1 million and $800.0 million of net proceeds from     borrowings under our credit agreement. The net cash flows used     in financing activities of $693.4 million in 2007 were due     primarily to the repurchase of approximately 44.6 million     shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of     approximately $1.5 billion, offset by the proceeds from     stock option exercises totaling $507.0 million and     $200.0 million of net proceeds from borrowings under our     credit agreement. The net cash flows used in financing     activities of $1.3 billion in 2006 were due primarily to     the repurchase of approximately 54.5 million shares of our     common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately     $1.7 billion, offset by the proceeds from stock option     exercises totaling $313.5 million. Prior to 2006, we had     not repurchased our common stock under a stock repurchase     program.        59    Table of Contents       The negative effect of exchange rates on cash and cash     equivalents during 2008 was due to the strengthening of the     U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, primarily the     Euro. The positive effect of exchange rates on cash and cash     equivalents during 2007 and 2006 was due to the weakening of the     U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, primarily the     Euro.     Stock     Repurchases         In July 2006, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to     $2.0 billion of our common stock within two years from the     date of authorization. During 2006, we repurchased approximately     54.5 million shares of our common stock at an average price     of $30.56 per share for an aggregate purchase price of     $1.7 billion. In January 2007, our Board authorized, and we     announced, an expansion of the stock repurchase program to     provide for the repurchase of up to an additional     $2.0 billion of our common stock over the next two years.     During 2007, we repurchased approximately 44.6 million     shares of our common stock at an average price of $33.42 per     share for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion under     this stock repurchase program. In January 2008, our Board     authorized, and we announced, another stock repurchase program     of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock. During 2008, we     repurchased approximately 80.6 million shares of our common     stock at an average price of $27.15 per share for an aggregate     purchase price of $2.2 billion, under these stock     repurchase programs.         Our stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at     any time without prior notice. Stock repurchases under these     programs may be made through a variety of open market and     privately negotiated transactions, including structured stock     repurchase transactions or other derivative transactions, at     times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and     will be funded from the companys working capital or other     financing alternatives. The timing and actual number of shares     repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including     corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market     conditions and managements determination as to the     appropriate use of our cash. The programs are intended to comply     with the volume, timing and other limitations set forth in     Rule 10b-18     under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.     Credit     Agreement         In August 2007, we entered into an amendment to our 2006 credit     agreement. The amendment agreement increased the lender     commitments and borrowing capacity under the 2006 credit     agreement from its prior level of $1.0 billion to     $2.0 billion, maintained an option to increase borrowing     capacity by an additional $1.0 billion (after giving effect     to the $1.0 billion increase described above) and extended     the maturity date by an additional year to November 7,     2012. Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank was a participating lender     in our $2.0 billion credit agreement. As a result of the     bankruptcy of its parent company, our available line of credit     has been effectively reduced by its commitment of     $160.0 million. As of December 31, 2008,     $1.0 billion was outstanding and $840.0 million was     available under the credit agreement.     Liquidity     and Capital Resource Requirements         At December 31, 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents of     $3.2 billion, compared to $4.2 billion at     December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, we held     balances in cash and cash equivalents outside the U.S. in     certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately     $2.8 billion. If these cash and cash equivalents were     distributed to the U.S. we may be subject to additional     U.S. taxes in certain circumstances. See     Note 16  Income Taxes to the     consolidated financial statements included in this report. Our     available cash and cash equivalents are held in bank deposits     and money market funds. We actively monitor the third-party     depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents.     Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal while     secondarily maximizing yield on those funds. We diversify our     cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize     exposure to any one of these entities. To date, we have     experienced no material loss or lack of access to our invested     cash or cash equivalents; however, we can provide no assurances     that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not     be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.         At any point in time we have funds in our operating accounts and     customer accounts that are with third party financial     institutions. These balances in the U.S. may exceed the     Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance limits.     While we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts,     these cash balances could be        60    Table of Contents       impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or could     be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets.         We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents of     approximately $3.2 billion, together with cash expected to     be generated from operations and cash available through our     credit agreement, will be sufficient to fund our operating     activities, capital expenditures, Bill Me Later loan portfolio,     stock repurchases and other obligations for the foreseeable     future.     Commitments     and Contingencies         We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments     that include future estimated payments for general operating     purposes. Changes in our business needs, contractual     cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other     factors may result in actual payments differing from the     estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and     amounts of these payments. We have presented below a summary of     the most significant assumptions used in our determination of     amounts presented in the tables, in order to assist in the     review of this information within the context of our     consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash     flows. The following table summarizes our fixed contractual     obligations and commitments (in thousands):                                                          Operating            Purchase                       Payments Due By Year Ending December 31,        Leases           Obligations           Total                   2009            $       77,975               $       486,139               $       564,114              2010                63,190                   136,772                   199,962              2011                35,672                   60,552                   96,224              2012                22,834                   45,111                   67,945              2013                16,755                                      16,755              Thereafter                23,109                                      23,109                                                                           $       239,535               $       728,574               $       968,109                                                                       Operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under     our non-cancelable operating leases for office facilities, as     well as limited computer and office equipment that we utilize     under lease arrangements. The amounts presented are consistent     with contractual terms and are not expected to differ     significantly, unless a substantial change in our headcount     needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office     facility early.         Purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments     for advertising, capital expenditures (computer equipment,     software applications, engineering development services,     construction contracts) and other goods and services that were     entered into through our ordinary course of business. For those     contractual arrangements in which there are significant     performance requirements, we have developed estimates to project     expected payment obligations. These estimates have been     developed based upon historical trends, when available, and our     anticipated future obligations. Given the significance of such     performance requirements within our advertising and other     arrangements, actual payments could differ significantly from     these estimates.         We have $1.0 billion outstanding under our credit agreement     at December 31, 2008, which we have classified as a current     liability. We may repay the amount outstanding under the line of     credit within the next twelve months.         As we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement     of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits under FASB     Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in     Income Taxes (FIN 48), the table does not include     $754.0 million of such non-current liabilities recorded on     our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008.     Off-Balance     Sheet Arrangements         As of December 31, 2008, we had no off-balance sheet     arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a     current or future material effect on our consolidated financial     condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital     expenditures or capital resources. In Europe, we have a cash     pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash     management purposes. This arrangement allows for cash     withdrawals from this financial institution based upon our     aggregate operating cash balances held in Europe within the same     financial institution (Aggregate Cash        61    Table of Contents       Deposits). This arrangement also allows us to withdraw     amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an     agreed-upon     limit. The net balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash     Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for     calculating our net interest expense or income. As of     December 31, 2008, we had a total of $1.8 billion in     cash withdrawals offsetting our $1.8 billion in Aggregate     Cash Deposits held within the same financial institution under     this cash pooling arrangement.         Customer balances held as direct claims against us, primarily     PayPal, are included on our consolidated balance sheet in funds     receivable and customer accounts with an offsetting current     liability in funds payable and amounts due to customers, and     totaled approximately $1.1 billion as of December 31,     2008 and 2007. Customer funds held by PayPal as an agent or     custodian on behalf of our customers are not reflected in our     consolidated balance sheets. These funds include funds on behalf     of U.S. customers that are deposited in bank accounts     insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and funds     that U.S. customers choose to invest in the PayPal Money     Market Fund, which totaled approximately $1.9 billion and     $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,     respectively. The PayPal Money Market Fund is invested in a     portfolio managed by Barclays Global Fund Advisors.     Indemnification     Provisions         In the ordinary course of business, we have included limited     indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with     parties with whom we have commercial relations, including our     standard marketing, promotions and     application-programming-interface license agreements. Under     these contracts, we generally indemnify, hold harmless, and     agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or     incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by a     third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos     and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are     applicable to our performance under the subject agreement. In a     limited number of agreements, we have provided an indemnity for     other types of third-party claims, which are indemnities mainly     related to various intellectual property rights. In our PayPal     business, we have provided an indemnity to our payment     processors in the event of certain third-party claims or card     association fines against the processor arising out of conduct     by PayPal or PayPal customers. It is not possible to determine     the maximum potential loss under these indemnification     provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification     claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each     particular provision. To date, no significant costs have been     incurred, either individually or collectively, in connection     with our indemnification provisions.     Critical     Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates     General         The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and     related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and     assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,     liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of     contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates     on historical experience and on various other assumptions that     are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the     results of which form the basis for making judgments about the     carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily     apparent from other sources. Our senior management has discussed     the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates     with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Actual     results may differ from these estimates under different     assumptions or conditions.         An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires     an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about     matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is     made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been     used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably     likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the     consolidated financial statements. We believe the following     critical accounting policies reflect the more significant     estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our     consolidated financial statements. The following descriptions of     critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates should be     read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements     and other disclosures included in this report.        62    Table of Contents   Provision     for Transaction and Loan Losses         We are exposed to losses due to uncollectible receivable and     loan accounts, credit card and other payment misuse, as well as     non-performance of and loan losses from sellers who accept     payment through PayPal. Provisions for these items represent our     estimate of actual losses based on our historical experience,     actuarial techniques, the age and delinquency rates of     receivables, the credit quality of the relevant loan, as well as     economic and regulatory conditions. The following table     illustrates the provision as a percentage of net revenues for     2006, 2007 and 2008 (in thousands, except percentages):                                                          Year Ended December 31,                 2006           2007           2008                   Net revenues            $       5,969,741               $       7,672,329               $       8,541,261              Provision for transaction and loan losses            $       266,724               $       293,917               $       347,453              Provision for transaction and loan losses as a % of net revenues                4.5       %               3.8       %               4.1       %             Determining appropriate allowances for these losses is an     inherently uncertain process, and ultimate losses may vary from     the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance     estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may     impact the settlement or recovery of losses. The allowances are     maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide     for losses incurred at the balance sheet date. An aggregate     50 basis point deviation from our estimates would have     resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income of     approximately $42.7 million resulting in an approximate     $0.03 change in diluted earnings per share.     Legal     Contingencies         In connection with certain pending litigation and other claims,     we have estimated the range of probable loss, net of expected     recoveries, and provided for such losses through charges to our     consolidated statement of income. These estimates have been     based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each     balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new     information and future events.         From time to time, we are involved in disputes that arise in the     ordinary course of business. We are currently involved in     certain legal proceedings as discussed in Item 1A:     Risk Factors, Item 3: Legal Proceedings     and Note 11  Commitments and     Contingencies  Litigation and Other Legal     Matters to the consolidated financial statements included     in this report. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to     the claims against us, and we intend to defend ourselves     vigorously. However, even if successful, our defense against     certain actions will be costly and could divert our     managements time. If the plaintiffs were to prevail on     certain claims, we might be forced to pay significant damages     and licensing fees, modify our business practices or even be     prohibited from conducting a significant part of our business.     Any such results could materially harm our business and could     result in a material adverse impact on the financial position,     results of operations or cash flows of all or any of our three     businesses.     Accounting     for Income Taxes         We are required to recognize a provision for income taxes based     upon the taxable income and temporary differences for each of     the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires     a calculation of taxes payable under currently enacted tax laws     around the world and an analysis of temporary differences     between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities,     including various accruals, allowances, depreciation and     amortization. The tax effect of these temporary differences is     reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our     consolidated balance sheet. We also assess the likelihood that     our net deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable     income. To the extent we believe that it is more likely than not     that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be     realized, we establish a valuation allowance. At     December 31, 2008, we had a valuation allowance on certain     foreign net operating losses based on our assessment that it is     more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be     realized. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or     change the allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a     corresponding increase or decrease in our tax provision in our     consolidated statement of income or against additional     paid-in-capital     in our consolidated balance sheet to the extent any tax benefits     would have otherwise been allocated to equity.        63    Table of Contents       Our U.S. businesses generate sufficient cash flow to fully     fund their operating requirements, and we expect that profits     earned outside the U.S. will be fully utilized to fund our     continued international expansion. Accordingly, we have not     provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding     taxes on     non-U.S. subsidiaries     undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2008, because     such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. In the     event that our future international expansion plans change and     such amounts are not reinvested indefinitely, we would be     subject to U.S. income taxes partially offset by foreign     tax credits.         The following table illustrates our effective tax rates for     2006, 2007 and 2008 (in thousands, except percentages):                                                          Year Ended December 31,                 2006           2007           2008                   Provision for income taxes            $       421,418               $       402,600               $       404,090              As a % of income before income taxes                27       %               54       %               19       %             We believe historically, these provisions have adequately     provided for our actual income tax liabilities. Our future     effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings     being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower     statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where     we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuations of     our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes or     interpretations in tax laws, regulations or accounting     principles. In addition, we are subject to the continuous     examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue     Service, various state tax authorities and other various foreign     tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse     outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the     adequacy of our provision for income taxes.         Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2008,     a one-percentage point change in our provision for income taxes     as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an     increase or decrease in the provision of approximately     $21.8 million, resulting in an approximate $0.02 change in     diluted earnings per share.         We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 as of the beginning of     2007. Prior to adoption, our policy was to establish reserves     that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies.     The effects of final resolution, if any, were recognized as     changes to the effective income tax rate in the period of     resolution. FIN 48 requires application of a more likely     than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of     uncertain tax positions. If the recognition threshold is met,     FIN 48 permits us to recognize a tax benefit measured at     the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is     more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement.     It further requires that a change in judgment related to the     expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be     recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change.         We file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing     jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse     before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally     resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final     outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain     tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes     reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these reserves, as     well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and     circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could     require the use of cash.     Revenue     Recognition         We recognize revenue from services rendered when the following     four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence     of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the     selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is     reasonably assured. We may enter into certain revenue     transactions that involve multiple element arrangements     (arrangements with more than one deliverable). We also may enter     into arrangements to purchase goods     and/or     services from certain customers. As a result, significant     contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine     appropriate accounting for these transactions including:     (1) whether an arrangement exists; (2) how the     arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential     multiple arrangements; (3) when to recognize revenue on the     deliverables; (4) whether all elements of the arrangement     have been delivered; (5) whether the arrangement should be     reported gross (as a principal) versus net (as an agent);     (6) whether we receive a separately identifiable benefit     from the purchase arrangements with our customer for which we     can reasonably estimate fair value; and (7) whether the     arrangement would be characterized as revenue or        64    Table of Contents       reimbursement of costs incurred. Changes in judgments on these     assumptions and estimates could impact the timing or amount of     revenue recognition.     Goodwill     and Intangible Assets         The purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between     intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired     business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as     goodwill. The determination of the value of the intangible     assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates. These     judgments can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows     that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the     appropriate weighted average cost of capital.         At December 31, 2008, our goodwill totaled     $7.0 billion and our identifiable intangible assets totaled     $736.1 million. We assess the impairment of goodwill of our     reporting units annually, or more often if events or changes in     circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be     recoverable. This assessment is based upon a discounted cash     flow analysis and analysis of our market capitalization. The     estimate of cash flow is based upon, among other things, certain     assumptions about expected future operating performance and an     appropriate discount rate determined by our management. Our     estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash     flows due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes     to our business model or changes in operating performance.     Additionally, certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve     businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue     models, which increase the risk of differences between the     projected and actual performance. Significant differences     between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially     affect our future financial results. These factors increase the     risk of differences between projected and actual performance     that could impact future estimates of fair value of all     reporting units, particularly our Communications reporting unit.     We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of     August 31, 2008 in accordance with SFAS No. 142,     Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As a result of     this test we determined that no adjustment to the carrying value     of goodwill for any reportable units was required. As a result     our annual impairment test of goodwill as of August 31,     2007, we concluded that the carrying amount of our     Communications reporting unit exceeded its fair value and     recorded an impairment loss of approximately $1.4 billion     during the year ended December 31, 2007. The impairment     charge includes the impact of the earn out settlement payment     with certain former shareholders of Skype and was determined by     comparing the carrying value of goodwill in our Communications     reporting unit with the implied fair value of the goodwill. See     Note 3  Business Combinations, Goodwill     and Intangible Assets to the consolidated financial     statements included in this report. There was no impairment of     goodwill or identifiable intangible assets in 2006. As of     December 31, 2008, we determined that no events or     circumstances from August 31, 2008 through     December 31, 2008 indicate that a further assessment was     necessary.     Stock-Based     Compensation         On January 1, 2006, we adopted FAS 123(R), which     requires a fair value measurement and recognition of     compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to     our employees and directors, including employee stock options,     employee stock purchases and restricted stock awards over the     service period for awards expected to vest. Stock-based     compensation expense recognized for 2006, 2007 and 2008 was     $317.4 million, $301.8 million and     $353.3 million, respectively. See     Note 15  Benefit Plans to the     consolidated financial statements included in this report.         We calculated the fair value of each restricted stock award     based on our stock price on the date of grant. We calculated the     fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the     Black-Scholes option pricing model. The determination of fair     value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using     an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well     as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and     subjective variables. The use of a Black-Scholes model requires     extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and a number of     complex assumptions including expected life, expected     volatility, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. As a     result, the future stock-based compensation expense may differ     from our historical amounts. The weighted-average        65    Table of Contents       grant-date fair value of stock options granted during 2006, 2007     and 2008 was $10.47, $10.60 and $7.46 per share, respectively,     using the Black-Scholes model with the following     weighted-average assumptions:                                        Year Ended December 31,             2006       2007       2008               Risk-free interest rate            4.7%           4.5%           2.3%          Expected life            3.0 years           3.5 years           3.8 years          Dividend yield            0%           0%           0%          Expected volatility            36%           37%           34%             Our computation of expected volatility for 2006, 2007 and 2008     was based on a combination of historical and market-based     implied volatility from traded options on our stock. Our     computation of expected life was determined based on historical     experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the     contractual terms of the stock-based awards, vesting schedules     and expectations of future employee behavior. The interest rate     for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on     the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of     grant. The estimation of awards that will ultimately vest     requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated     estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will     be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates     are revised. We consider many factors when estimating     forfeitures, including employee class and historical experience.     Recent     Accounting Pronouncements         In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board     (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS)     No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations     (FAS 141(R)). FAS 141(R) establishes principles and     requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination     recognizes and measures in its financial statements the     identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any     noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, as well as the     goodwill acquired. Significant changes from current practice     resulting from FAS 141(R) include the expansion of the     definitions of a business and a business     combination. For all business combinations (whether     partial, full or step acquisitions), the acquirer will record     100% of all assets and liabilities of the acquired business,     including goodwill, generally at their fair values; contingent     consideration will be recognized at its fair value on the     acquisition date and, for certain arrangements, changes in fair     value will be recognized in earnings until settlement; and     acquisition-related transaction and restructuring costs will be     expensed rather than treated as part of the cost of the     acquisition. FAS 141(R) also establishes disclosure     requirements to enable users to evaluate the nature and     financial effects of the business combination. FAS 141(R)     applies prospectively to business combinations for which the     acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first     annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,     2008. FAS 141(R) may have an impact on our consolidated     financial statements. The nature and magnitude of the specific     impact will depend upon the nature, terms, and size of the     acquisitions consummated after the effective date.         In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160,     Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial     Statements  An amendment of ARB No. 51     (FAS 160). FAS 160 amends Accounting Research     Bulletin 51, Consolidated Financial Statements,     to establish accounting and reporting standards for the     noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the     deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a     noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, which is sometimes     referred to as minority interest, is a third-party ownership     interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as a     component of equity in the consolidated financial statements.     Among other requirements, FAS 160 requires the consolidated     statement of income to be reported at amounts that include the     amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling     interest. FAS 160 also requires disclosure on the face of     the consolidated statement of income of the amounts of     consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the     noncontrolling interest. FAS 160 is effective for fiscal     years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning     on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is not     permitted. We do not believe the adoption of FAS 160 will     have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.         In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position     No. 157-2 (FSP 157-2),     which delays the effective date of FAS 157 one year for all     nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those     recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial     statements on a recurring basis.     FSP 157-2     is effective for us beginning January 1, 2009. We do not     believe the adoption of     FSP 157-2     will have a material impact on our consolidated financial     statements.        66    Table of Contents       In March 2008, the FASB issued FAS No. 161,     Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging     Activities (FAS 161). FAS 161 amends and expands     the disclosure requirements of FAS 133, Accounting     for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and     requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies     for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value     amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments, and     disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in     derivative agreements. This statement is effective for financial     statements issued for fiscal periods beginning after     November 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is not permitted. We do     not believe the adoption of FAS 161 will have a material     impact on our consolidated financial statements.         In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position     FAS 142-3,     Determination of Useful Life of Intangible Assets     (FSP 142-3). FSP 142-3     amends the factors that should be considered in developing the     renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful     life of a recognized intangible asset under FAS 142,     Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.     FSP 142-3     also requires expanded disclosure regarding the determination of     intangible asset useful lives.     FSP 142-3     is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,     2008. Earlier adoption is not permitted. We do not believe the     adoption of     FSP 142-3     will have a material impact on our consolidated financial     statements.           ITEM 7A:     QUANTITATIVE     AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Interest     Rate Risk         The primary objective of our investment activities is to     preserve principal while secondarily maximizing yields without     significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective in the     current uncertain global financial markets, as of     December 31, 2008, approximately 92% of our total cash and     investment portfolio were held in bank deposits and money market     funds. As such, changes in interest rates will impact interest     income. As of December 31, 2008, we held no direct     investments in auction rate securities, collateralized debt     obligations, structured investment vehicles or mortgaged-backed     securities. Additionally, changes in interest rates will impact     our interest sensitive credit agreement and accordingly, impact     interest expense or cost of net revenues.     Equity     Price Risk         We are exposed to equity price risk on marketable equity     instruments due to market volatility. At December 31, 2008,     the total fair value of our marketable equity instruments was     $133.3 million, which represented approximately 4% of our     total cash and investment portfolio.     Investment     Risk         As of December 31, 2008, our recorded cost basis and equity     investments was $100.7 million. These investments relate     primarily to equity-method investments in private companies. We     review our investments for impairment when events and     circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets     below carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis     includes review of recent operating results and trends, recent     sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other     publicly available data.     Foreign     Currency Exposures         An increasing proportion of our operations conducted outside the     U.S. Our foreign currency exposure continues to evolve as     we grow internationally. The objective of our foreign exchange     exposure management program is to identify material foreign     currency exposures and to manage these exposures to minimize the     potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported     consolidated cash flow and results of operations.         International net revenues result from transactions by our     foreign operations and are typically denominated in the local     currency of each country. These operations also incur most of     their expenses in the local currency. Accordingly, certain     foreign operations use the local currency, which is primarily     the Euro, and to a lesser extent, the British pound Australian     dollars and Korean won, as their functional currency. Our     international operations are subject to risks typical of     international operations, including, but not limited to,     differing economic conditions, changes in political climate,     differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions,     and foreign exchange rate        67    Table of Contents       volatility. Accordingly, our future results could be materially     adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors.         Our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction, economic     and translation:     Transaction     Exposure         Around the world, we have various assets and liabilities,     primarily receivables, investments and accounts payable     (including inter-company transactions) that are denominated in     currencies other than the relevant entitys functional     currency. In certain circumstances, changes in the functional     currency value of these assets and liabilities create     fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position,     results of operations and cash flows. We may enter into foreign     exchange contracts or other instruments to minimize the     short-term foreign currency fluctuations on such assets and     liabilities. The gains and losses on the foreign exchange     contracts offset the transaction gains and losses on certain     foreign currency receivables, investments and payables     recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2008, we had     outstanding foreign exchange hedge contracts with notional     values equivalent to approximately $132.4 million with     maturity dates within 34 days. Transaction gains and losses     on the contracts and the assets and liabilities are recognized     each period in interest and other income, net included in our     consolidated statement of income.     Economic     Exposure         We transact business in various foreign currencies and have     significant international revenues as well as costs denominated     in foreign currencies, subjecting us to foreign currency risks.     In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries on a     monthly basis for their use of intellectual property and     technology and for certain corporate services provided by eBay     and by PayPal. These charges are denominated in Euros and these     forecasted inter-company transactions represent a foreign     currency cash flow exposure. We purchase foreign exchange     contracts, generally with maturities of 12 months or less,     to reduce the volatility of cash flows related primarily to     forecasted revenue and intercompany transactions denominated in     certain foreign currencies. The objective of the foreign     exchange contracts is to better ensure that the     U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are not adversely     affected by changes in the U.S. dollar/foreign currency     exchange rate. Pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards     No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and     Hedging Activities (FAS 133), we expect the hedge of     certain of these forecasted transactions to be highly effective     in offsetting potential changes in cash flows attributed to a     change in the U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate.     Accordingly, the effective portion of the derivatives gain     or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated     other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified     into the financial statements line item in which the hedged item     is recorded in the same period the forecasted transaction     affects earnings.         During the year ended December 31, 2008 the realized gains     on these hedges were $17.1 million. During the years ended     December 31, 2007 and 2006, the realized gains and losses     related to these hedges were not significant. The notional     amount of our economic hedges designated for hedge accounting     treatment was $428.9 million and $515.7 as of     December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of     December 31, 2008, net of losses, our unrealized gains     related to economic hedges recorded to accumulated other     comprehensive income was $40.5 million. The loss, net of     gains, recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income as of     December 31, 2007 was not significant. We did not have any     economic hedges in place as of December 31, 2006.     Translation     Exposure         As our international operations grow, fluctuations in the     foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of     operations because we are required to consolidate the results of     operations of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries. We     may decide to purchase foreign exchange contracts or other     instruments to offset the earnings impact of currency     fluctuations. Such contracts will be marked-to-market on a     monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss will be recorded     in interest and other income, net.         Foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our     financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign     operations are translated into U.S. dollars in preparing     our consolidated balance sheet. The cumulative effect of foreign     exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial     position at the end of December 31, 2008,        68    Table of Contents       was a net translation gain of approximately $788.2 million.     This gain is recognized as an adjustment to stockholders     equity through accumulated other comprehensive income.     Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely     impact our operating results as the revenues and expenses of our     foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars in     preparing our consolidated statement of income. The effect of     foreign exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted our     consolidated net revenues and operating income for the year     ended December 31, 2008 by approximately     $190.9 million and $130.6 million, respectively,     compared to the prior year. Impact of foreign currency     translation only includes changes between our functional     currencies and our U.S. dollar reporting currency.         We consolidate the earnings of our international subsidiaries by     converting them into U.S. dollars in accordance with     FAS No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation     (FAS 52). Such earnings will fluctuate when there is a     change in foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into     transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency     denominated earnings translation exposure using either exchange     contracts or other instruments. All contracts that hedge     translation exposure mature ratably over the quarter in which     they are executed. During the year ended December 31, 2008,     the realized gains related to these hedges was approximately     $26.3 million.         A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening or weakening in the     value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro, British     pound, Australian dollar, and Korean won in which our revenues     and profits are denominated would result in a decrease/increase     to operating income of approximately $153.8 million. There     are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented,     due primarily to the assumption that foreign exchange rate     movements are linear and instantaneous. As a result, the     analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more     complex market changes that could arise, which may positively or     negatively affect income.

Changes in internal controls.  There were no     changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as     defined in Exchange Act     Rule 13a-15(f)     that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter     that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to     materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.     Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over     Financial Reporting.  Our management is     responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal     control over financial reporting.

In addition,     in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the     index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all     material respects, the information set forth therein when read     in conjunction with the related consolidated financial     statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all     material respects, effective internal control over financial     reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria     established in Internal Control  Integrated     Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring     Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The     Companys management is responsible for these financial     statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining     effective internal control over financial reporting and for its     assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over     financial reporting, included in Managements Report on     Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under     Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these     financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and     on the Companys internal control over financial reporting     based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in     accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting     Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we     plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about     whether the financial statements are free of material     misstatement and whether effective internal control over     financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our     audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test     basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the     financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used     and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the     overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal     control over financial reporting included obtaining an     understanding of internal control over financial reporting,     assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing     and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of     internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also     included performing such other procedures as we considered     necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits     provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.         As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial     statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts     for uncertainty in income taxes in 2007.         A companys internal control over financial reporting is a     process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the     reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of     financial statements for external purposes in accordance with     generally accepted accounting principles. A companys     internal control over financial reporting includes those     policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the     maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately     and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the     assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance     that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit     preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally     accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and     expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance     with authorizations of management and directors of the company;     and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention     or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or     disposition of the companys assets that could have a     material effect on the financial statements.         Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over     financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.     Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future     periods are subject to the risk that controls may become     inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree     of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.     /s/  PricewaterhouseCoopers     LLP         San Jose, California     February 19, 2009        75    Table of Contents   eBay     Inc.

NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     Note 1      The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting     Policies:     The     Company         eBay Inc. (eBay) was incorporated in California in     May 1996, and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.     eBays purpose is to pioneer new communities around the     world, built on commerce, sustained by trust, and inspired by     opportunity. eBay brings together millions of buyers and sellers     every day on a local, national and international basis through     an array of websites. eBay provides online marketplaces for the     sale of goods and services, online payment services and online     communication offerings to a diverse community of individuals     and businesses.         We operate three primary business segments: Marketplaces,     Payments and Communications. Our Marketplaces segment provides     the infrastructure to enable global online commerce on a variety     of platforms, including the traditional eBay.com platform, and     our other online platforms, such as our online classifieds     businesses, our secondary tickets marketplace, StubHub, our     online shopping comparison website, Shopping.com, our apartment     listing service platform, Rent.com, as well as our fixed price     media marketplace (Half.com). Our Payments segment is comprised     of payment solutions PayPal (which enables individuals or     businesses to securely, easily and quickly send and receive     payments online) and Bill Me Later (which we acquired in     November 2008 and which enables online U.S. merchants to     offer, and U.S. consumers to obtain, transactional credit     at the point of sale). Our Communications segment, which     consists of Skype, enables VoIP calls between Skype users and     provides low-cost connectivity to traditional fixed-line and     mobile telephones.         When we refer to we, our, us     or eBay in this document, we mean the current     Delaware corporation (eBay Inc.) and its California predecessor,     as well as all of our consolidated subsidiaries.     Use of     estimates         The preparation of consolidated financial statements in     conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting     principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions     that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and     disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of     the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts     of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an     ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those     related to provisions for transaction and loan losses, legal     contingencies, income taxes, revenue recognition, stock-based     compensation and the recoverability of goodwill and intangible     assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on     various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under     the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those     estimates.     Principles     of consolidation and basis of presentation         The accompanying financial statements are consolidated and     include the financial statements of eBay and our majority-owned     subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and     transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.         The consolidated financial statements include 100% of the assets     and liabilities of these majority-owned subsidiaries and the     ownership interests of minority investors are recorded as a     minority interest. Investments in private entities where we hold     20% or more but less than a 50% ownership interest are accounted     for using the equity method of accounting and the investment     balance is included in long-term investments, while our share of     the investees results of operations is included in     interest and other income, net. Investments in private entities     where we hold less than a 20% ownership interest and where we do     not have the ability to significantly influence the operations     of the investee are accounted for using the cost method of     accounting, where our share of the investees results of     operations is not included in our consolidated statement of     income, and our cost basis of our investments is included in     long-term investments.         Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform     to the current period presentation. Customer accounts were     reclassified from Other Current Assets to     Funds Receivable and Customer Accounts. Operating        81    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)         expenses related to the provision for transaction losses,     customer protection programs and bad debt expense have been     reclassified from Sales and Marketing and     General and Administrative expenses to     Provision for Transaction and Loan Losses.     Derivative     instruments         We use derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to     foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Our primary     use of derivative instruments is through foreign exchange     currency contracts to hedge foreign currency risk. We also may     use other derivative instruments not designated as hedges, such     as forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet     exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for     speculative purposes. The assets or liabilities associated with     our derivative instruments and hedging activities are recorded     at fair value in other current assets or other current     liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheet.     See Note 6  Derivative Instruments     for a full description of our derivative financial instrument     activities and related accounting policies.     Concentrations     of credit risk         Our cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, loans     receivable and funds receivable are potentially subject to     concentration of credit risk. Cash and cash equivalents and     funds receivable are placed with financial institutions that     management believes are of high credit quality. Our accounts     receivable are derived from revenue earned from customers     located in the U.S. and internationally. Our loans     receivable are derived from consumer financing activities for     customers located in the U.S. We maintain an allowance for     doubtful accounts receivable, authorized credits and loans     receivable based upon our historical experience, the age and     delinquency rates of receivables and the credit quality of the     relevant loan, as well as economic and regulatory conditions.     Determining appropriate allowances for these losses is an     inherently uncertain process, and ultimate losses may vary from     the current estimates, resulting in a material impact to future     statements of income or cash flows. Due to the relatively small     dollar amount of individual accounts receivable and loans     receivable, we generally do not require collateral on these     balances. The allowance for doubtful accounts and authorized     credits was $96.2 million and $104.9 million at     December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively. The allowance for     loans receivable was $48.1 million at December 31,     2008.         During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007, and 2008,     no customers accounted for more than 10% of net revenues. As of     December 31, 2007 and 2008, no customers accounted for more     than 10% of net accounts receivable or net loans receivable.     Provision     for transaction and loan losses         We are exposed to losses due to uncollectible receivable and     loan accounts, credit card and other payment misuse, as well as     non-performance of and credit losses from sellers who accept     payment through PayPal. Provisions for these items represent our     estimate of actual losses based on our historical experience,     actuarial techniques, the age and delinquency rates of     receivables and the credit quality of the relevant loan, as well     as economic and regulatory conditions.     Foreign     currency         Most of our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency of their     respective countries as their functional currency. Assets and     liabilities are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the     balance sheet dates. Revenues, costs and expenses are translated     into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates for the period.     Gains and losses resulting from the translation of our     consolidated balance sheet are recorded as a component of     accumulated other comprehensive income.         Realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are     recognized as interest and other income, net.        82    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)     Loans     receivable, net         Loans receivable represent extensions of credit to individual     consumers to purchase goods and services through our Bill Me     Later merchant network. The terms of the consumer relationship     require us to submit monthly bills to the consumer detailing     loan repayment requirements. The terms also allow us to charge     the consumer, in certain circumstances, interest and fees. Loans     receivable are reported at their outstanding principal balances,     net of deferred origination costs and net of allowance, and     include the estimated collectible interest and fees. We charge     off loans receivable in the month in which the customer becomes     180 days past due. Bankrupt accounts are charged off within     60 days of receiving notification from the bankruptcy     courts.     Funds     receivable and funds payable         Funds receivable and payable relate to our Payments segment and     arise due to the time taken to clear transactions through     external payment networks. When customers fund their account     using their bank account or credit card, or withdraw money to     their bank account or through a debit card transaction, there is     a clearing period before the cash is received or settled,     usually one to three business days for U.S. transactions,     and up to five business days for international transactions.     Hence, these funds are treated as a receivable or payable, as     the case may be, until the cash is settled.     Customer     accounts         Based on differences in regulatory requirements and commercial     law in the jurisdictions where PayPal operates, PayPal holds     customer balances either as direct claims against PayPal or as     an agent or custodian on behalf of PayPals customers.     Customer balances held as direct claims against PayPal are     included on our consolidated balance sheet as funds receivable     and customer accounts with an offsetting current liability in     funds payable and amounts due to customers. The customer     balances can be invested only in specified types of liquid     assets.         Customer funds held by PayPal as an agent or custodian on behalf     of our customers are not reflected in our consolidated balance     sheet. These off-balance sheet funds totaled approximately     $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion as of December 31,     2007 and 2008, respectively. These off-balance sheet funds     include funds held in the U.S. that are deposited in bank     accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation     and funds that customers choose to invest in the PayPal Money     Market Fund. The PayPal Money Market Fund is invested in a     portfolio managed by Barclays Global Fund Advisors.     Property     and equipment         Property and equipment are stated at historical cost less     accumulated depreciation. Depreciation and amortization are     computed using the straight-line method over the estimated     useful lives of the assets, generally, one to three years for     computer equipment and software, up to 30 years for     buildings and building improvements, ten years for aviation     equipment, the shorter of five years or the term of the lease     for leasehold improvements, three years for furniture and     fixtures and three years for vehicles.     Goodwill     and intangible assets         Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the     fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible     assets acquired in a business combination. Intangible assets     resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using     the purchase method of accounting are estimated by management     based on the fair value of assets received. Identifiable     intangible assets are comprised of purchased customer lists and     user base, trademarks and trade names, developed technologies,     and other intangible assets. Identifiable intangible assets are     amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the     straight-line method and estimated useful lives ranging from one     to eight years. Goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is     subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment,     applying a fair-value based test.        83    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)         We evaluate goodwill, at a minimum, on an annual basis and     whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the     carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment of goodwill     is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting     units carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair     value of the reporting unit. The fair values of the reporting     units are estimated using an income and discounted cash flow     approach. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds     its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a second     step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if     any.     Impairment     of long-lived assets         We evaluate long-lived assets  (including intangible assets) for     impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate     that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be     recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying     amount exceeds the future net cash flow the asset is expected to     generate. If an asset is considered to be impaired, the     impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which     the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value.     We assess the recoverability of our long-lived and intangible     assets by determining whether the unamortized balances can be     recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the     related assets. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured     using fair market values which are estimated based on projected     discounted future net cash flows.     Revenue     recognition         Revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists,     the fee is fixed and determinable, no significant obligation     remains and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured.     When a revenue agreement involves multiple elements, such as     sales of various services in one arrangement or potentially     multiple arrangements, the entire fee from the arrangement is     allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair     value and recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for     each element is met. In the absence of fair value for a     delivered element, we first allocate revenue to the fair value     of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the     delivered elements. Where the fair value for an undelivered     element cannot be determined, we defer revenue recognition for     the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are     delivered or the fair value is determinable. We evaluate whether     payments made to customers or revenues earned from vendors have     a separate identifiable benefit and whether they are fairly     valued in determining the appropriate classification of the     related revenues and expense.         Our Marketplaces segment generates net transaction revenues     primarily from listing and final value fees paid by sellers.     Listing fee revenues are recognized ratably over the estimated     period of the listing, while revenues related to final value     fees are recognized at the time that the transaction is     successfully concluded. A transaction is considered successfully     concluded when at least one buyer has bid above the     sellers specified minimum price or reserve price,     whichever is higher, at the end of the transaction term.         Our Payments segment earns transaction revenues primarily from     processing transactions for certain customers. Revenues     resulting from a payment processing transaction are recognized     once the transaction is complete.         Our Communications segment transaction revenues are generated     primarily from fees charged to users to connect Skypes     VoIP product to traditional telecommunication networks. These     fees are recognized when the service is provided. The majority     of Communications segment transaction revenues are prepaid. We     record customer advances for prepaid amounts in excess of     revenues recognized as a current liability.         Our marketing services and other revenues, included in all of     our segments, are derived principally from the sale of     advertisements, revenue sharing arrangements, classifieds fees,     lead referral fees and other revenues. Our advertising revenues     are derived principally from the sale of online advertisements.     To date, the duration of our advertising contracts has ranged     from one week to five years, but is generally one week to one     year. Advertising revenues on contracts are recognized as     impressions (i.e., the number of times that an     advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of our websites)     are delivered; as clicks (which are generated each     time users on our        84    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)         websites click through our text-based advertisements to an     advertisers designated website) are provided to     advertisers; or ratably over the term of the agreement where     such agreements provide for minimum monthly or quarterly     advertising commitments or where such commitments are fixed     throughout the term. Revenues related to revenue sharing     arrangements are recognized based on revenue reports received     from our partners, provided that collectibility is reasonably     assured. Revenues related to classified fees are fees for     listing items on our classified websites and are recognized over     the estimated period of the classified listing. Lead referral     fee revenue is generated from lead referral fees based on the     number of times a user clicks through to a merchants     website from our websites. Lead referral fees are recognized in     the period in which the user clicks through to the     merchants website.         Other revenues are derived principally from contractual     arrangements with third parties that provide services to eBay     and PayPal users and interest earned from banks on certain     PayPal customer account balances and interest and fees earned on     the Bill Me Later loan portfolio. Revenues from contractual     arrangements with third parties are recognized as the contracted     services are delivered to end users. Revenues from interest     income are recognized when earned. Interest and fees earned on     the Bill Me Later loan portfolio are computed and recognized     based on the amount of loans outstanding and their contractual     interest and fee rates.         To drive traffic to our websites, we  periodically provide     incentives to our users such as percentage discounts off current     purchases. The incentives used by our users are reported as a     reduction of revenue.     Product     development costs         Costs related to the planning and post implementation phases of     our website development efforts are recorded as an operating     expense. Direct costs incurred in the development phase are     capitalized and amortized over the products estimated     useful life of one to three years as charges to cost of net     revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007     and 2008, we capitalized $67.9 million (including     $8.8 million of stock-based compensation),     $110.6 million (including $8.4 million of stock-based     compensation) and $112.7 million (including     $10.6 million of stock-based compensation) of software     development costs, respectively, the majority of which relates     to site and other product development efforts.     Advertising     expense         We expense the costs of producing advertisements at the time     production occurs and expense the cost of communicating     advertising in the period during which the advertising space or     airtime is used as sales and marketing expense. Internet     advertising expenses are recognized based on the terms of the     individual agreements, which is generally over the greater of     the ratio of the number of impressions delivered over the total     number of contracted impressions,     pay-per-click,     or on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.     Advertising expense totaled $871.0 million,     $1.0 billion and $923.4 million for the years ended     December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively.     Stock-based     compensation         We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)     No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment     (FAS 123(R)) using the modified prospective transition     method beginning January 1, 2006. Accordingly, during 2006,     2007 and 2008, we recorded stock-based compensation expense for     awards granted prior to, but not yet vested, as of     January 1, 2006, as if the fair value method required for     pro forma disclosure under FAS 123 were in effect for     expense recognition purposes, adjusted for estimated     forfeitures. For these awards, we have continued to recognize     compensation expense using the accelerated amortization method     under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation     28 Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other     Variable Stock Option or Award Plans (FIN 28). For     stock-based awards granted after January 1, 2006, we have     recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant     date fair value method using the Black-Scholes valuation model.     For these awards, we have recognized compensation expense using     a straight-line amortization method. As FAS 123(R) requires     that stock-based compensation expense be based on awards that     are ultimately expected to vest.        85    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)         Accordingly, stock-based compensation for 2006, 2007 and 2008     has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. When estimating     forfeitures, we consider voluntary termination behaviors as well     as trends of actual option forfeitures. We recognize a benefit     from stock-based compensation in equity if an incremental tax     benefit is realized by following the ordering provisions of the     tax law. In addition, we account for the indirect effects of     stock-based compensation on the research tax credit and the     foreign tax credit through the income statement.     Income     taxes         We account for income taxes using an asset and liability     approach, which requires the recognition of taxes payable or     refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and     assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been     recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. The     measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities     is based on provisions of enacted tax laws; the effects of     future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. If     necessary, the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by     the amount of any tax benefits that are not expected to be     realized based on available evidence.         We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB     Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in     Income Taxes (FIN 48). Accordingly, we report a     liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain     tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We     recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to     unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.     Recent     accounting pronouncements         In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial     Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 141 (Revised 2007),     Business Combinations (FAS 141(R)).     FAS 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how     an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in     its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired,     liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in the     acquiree, as well as the goodwill acquired. Significant changes     from current practice resulting from FAS 141(R) include the     expansion of the definitions of a business and a     business combination. For all business combinations     (whether partial, full or step acquisitions), the acquirer will     record 100% of all assets and liabilities of the acquired     business, including goodwill, generally at their fair values;     contingent consideration will be recognized at its fair value on     the acquisition date and, for certain arrangements, changes in     fair value will be recognized in earnings until settlement; and     acquisition-related transaction and restructuring costs will be     expensed rather than treated as part of the cost of the     acquisition. FAS 141(R) also establishes disclosure     requirements to enable users to evaluate the nature and     financial effects of the business combination. FAS 141(R)     applies prospectively to business combinations for which the     acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first     annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,     2008. FAS 141(R) may have an impact on our consolidated     financial statements. The nature and magnitude of the specific     impact will depend upon the nature, terms, and size of the     acquisitions consummated after the effective date.         In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160,     Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial     Statements  An amendment of ARB No. 51     (FAS 160). FAS 160 amends Accounting Research     Bulletin 51, Consolidated Financial Statements,     to establish accounting and reporting standards for the     noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the     deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a     noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, which is sometimes     referred to as minority interest, is a third-party ownership     interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as a     component of equity in the consolidated financial statements.     Among other requirements, FAS 160 requires the consolidated     statement of income to be reported at amounts that include the     amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling     interest. FAS 160 also requires disclosure on the face of     the consolidated statement of income of the amounts of     consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the     noncontrolling interest. FAS 160 is effective for fiscal     years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning     on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is not     permitted. We do not believe the adoption of FAS 160 will     have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.        86    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)         In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position     No. 157-2 (FSP 157-2),     which delays the effective date of FAS 157 one year for all     nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those     recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial     statements on a recurring basis.     FSP 157-2     is effective for us beginning January 1, 2009. We do not     believe the adoption of     FSP 157-2     will have a material impact on our consolidated financial     statements.         In March 2008, the FASB issued FAS No. 161,     Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging     Activities (FAS 161). FAS 161 amends and expands     the disclosure requirements of FAS 133, Accounting     for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and     requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies     for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value     amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments, and     disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in     derivative agreements. This statement is effective for financial     statements issued for fiscal periods beginning after     November 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is not permitted. We do     not believe the adoption of FAS 161 will have a material     impact on our consolidated financial statements.         In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position     FAS 142-3,     Determination of Useful Life of Intangible Assets     (FSP 142-3). FSP 142-3     amends the factors that should be considered in developing the     renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful     life of a recognized intangible asset under FAS 142,     Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.     FSP 142-3     also requires expanded disclosure regarding the determination of     intangible asset useful lives.     FSP 142-3     is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,     2008. Earlier adoption is not permitted. We do not believe the     adoption of     FSP 142-3     will have a material impact on our consolidated financial     statements.     Note 2      Net Income Per Share:         Basic net income per share is computed by dividing the net     income for the period by the weighted average number of common     shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per     share is computed by dividing the net income for the period by     the weighted average number of shares of common stock and     potentially dilutive common stock outstanding during the period.     The dilutive effect of outstanding options and restricted stock     is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the     treasury stock method. The calculation of diluted net income per     share excludes all anti-dilutive shares.

NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)     Note 3      Business Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets:         Our acquisitions in 2008, 2007 and 2006 with aggregate purchase     prices in excess of $100 million were as follows:     Bill Me     Later, Inc.         On November 7, 2008 we acquired all the outstanding shares     of Bill Me Later, Inc. (Bill Me Later) for a total purchase     price of approximately $914.6 million. The purchase price     consisted of cash totaling $817.0 million,     $9.9 million in estimated acquisition-related expenses and     the assumption of Bill Me Laters outstanding common stock     options, valued at approximately $87.7 million. The fair     value of Bill Me Laters stock options assumed was     determined using a Black-Scholes model. Bill Me Later is a     payments solution company that provides transactional credit at     the point of sale for ecommerce transactions and is included in     our Payments segment. Bill Me Laters service combines     authentication, credit origination, funding, fulfillment,     settlement, reporting and customer care into a single managed     solution integrated into a merchants existing payment     platform. The rationale for acquiring Bill Me Later is to     enhance our leadership position in online payment solutions.         The purchase price was allocated to the tangible assets and     intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on     their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The fair     value assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired is     determined using the income approach, which discounts expected     future cash flows to present value using estimates and     assumptions determined by management. Purchased identifiable     intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over     the respective useful lives.

Den     Blå Avis and BilBasen         On October 6, 2008 we acquired all the outstanding shares     of Den Blå Avis and BilBasen for a total purchase price of     approximately $394.1 million. The purchase price consisted     of cash totaling $392.0 million and $2.1 million in     estimated acquisition-related expenses. Den Blå Avis and     BilBasen are two leading online classifieds sites in Denmark and     are included in our Marketplaces segment.

Fraud     Sciences Ltd.         On January 30, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding     shares of Fraud Sciences Ltd. (Fraud Sciences) for a     total aggregate purchase price of approximately     $153.6 million. The purchase price consisted of cash     totaling $148.3 million, $0.9 million in estimated     acquisition-related expenses and the assumption of Fraud     Sciences outstanding common stock options, valued at     approximately $4.4 million. The fair value of Fraud     Sciences stock options assumed was determined using a     Black-Scholes model. Fraud Sciences provides online risk     management tools and is included within our Payments segment.     The rationale for acquiring Fraud Sciences is to enhance     PayPals proprietary fraud management systems and     accelerate our development of next generation fraud detection     tools.         The purchase price was allocated to the tangible assets and     intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on     their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess     of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values was     recorded as goodwill.

StubHub,     Inc.         On February 13, 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding     shares of StubHub, Inc. (StubHub) for a total     purchase price of $292.4 million. The purchase price was     comprised of cash totaling $283.2 million,     $1.1 million in estimated acquisition-related expenses and     the assumption of StubHubs outstanding common stock     options, valued        89    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.

Such investments include any related identifiable intangible     assets, deferred tax liabilities and goodwill. Goodwill related     to our equity method investments, included in the table above,     was approximately $27.4 million as of December 31,     2007 and 2008.         The changes in goodwill during the year ended December 31,     2008 were primarily due to the recording of goodwill for new     acquisitions and foreign currency translation adjustments.         We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of     August 31, 2008 and determined that no adjustment to the     carrying value of goodwill for any reportable units was     necessary. As of December 31, 2008, we determined that no     events or circumstances from August 31, 2008 through     December 31, 2008 indicate that a further assessment was     necessary.         We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of     August 31, 2007 and concluded that the carrying amount of     our Communications reporting unit exceeded its fair value and     recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion     during the year ended December 31, 2007.

We     determined the fair value of the Communications reporting unit     using the income approach, which requires estimates of future     operating results and cash flows discounted using an estimated     discount rate. Our estimates resulted from an updated long-term     financial outlook developed as part of our strategic planning     cycle conducted annually during our third quarter. Our estimates     of future operating results for our Communications reporting     unit are for an early stage business with limited financial     history, as well as developing revenue models. These factors     increase the risk of differences between projected and actual     performance that could impact future estimates of fair value of     the Communications reporting unit.

Acquired identifiable intangible assets are     comprised of customer lists and user base, trademarks and trade     names, developed technologies, and other acquired intangible     assets including patents and contractual agreements. No     significant residual value is estimated for the intangible     assets. The increase in intangible assets during the year ended     December 31, 2008 resulted primarily from certain     intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisition of the     outstanding shares of Bill Me Later, Den Blå Avis and     BilBasen, and Fraud Sciences as well as other acquisitions     completed during the year. The net carrying amount of intangible     assets related to our equity investments, included in the table     above, totaled approximately $1.4 million and     $0.5 million, as of December 31, 2007 and 2008,     respectively. Aggregate amortization expense for intangible     assets totaled $220.0 million, $229.2 million and     $281.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006,     2007 and 2008, respectively. Included in amortization of     intangibles for the year ended December 31, 2008, is a     charge of $9.0 million for in-process research and     development related to an asset purchase completed during the     period.        91    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.

Restricted cash is     held primarily in money market funds and interest bearing     accounts for letters of credit related primarily to various     lease arrangements.         Effective during 2007, we began to account for our investment in     MercadoLibre as an available-for-sale marketable equity security     due to MercadoLibres initial public offering of its common     stock in August of 2007. As of December 31, 2008, our     investment was recorded at fair value and reported as a     short-term investment with unrealized gains, net of tax,     excluded from earnings and reported as a component of     accumulated other comprehensive income.        94    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)     Equity     and cost method investments         We have certain investments accounted for using the equity and     cost methods of accounting totaling $112.9 million in 2007     and $100.7 million in 2008. The total of these investments,     including identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax     liabilities and goodwill, are classified on our balance sheet as     long-term investments. Our consolidated results of operations     include, as a component of other income, our share of the net     income or loss of the equity method investments together with     amortization expense relating to acquired intangible assets. Our     share of the results of investees results of operations is     not significant for any period presented.     Note 6      Derivative Instruments:         We recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at     fair value. Changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of     the derivatives are recorded each period in the consolidated     statement of income or accumulated other comprehensive income     (loss). For derivative instruments that are designated and     qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the     derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a     component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and     subsequently reclassified into the financial statements line     item in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the     forecasted transaction affects earnings.     Transaction     Exposure         As of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding foreign     exchange hedge contracts with notional values equivalent to     approximately $132.4 million with maturity dates within     34 days. The hedge contracts are used to offset changes in     the value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign     currencies which differ from the functional currency of the     entity. Transaction gains and losses on the contracts and the     assets and liabilities are recognized each period in interest     and other income, net.     Translation     Exposure         We consolidate the earnings of our international subsidiaries by     converting them into U.S. dollars in accordance with     Financial Accounting Standards No. 52 Foreign     Currency Translation (FAS 52). Such     earnings will fluctuate when there is a change in foreign     currency exchange rates. We enter into transactions to hedge     portions of our foreign currency denominated earnings     translation exposure using foreign exchange contracts. All     contracts that hedge translation exposure mature ratably over     the quarter in which they are executed. Unrealized translation     gains and losses are recorded as a component of accumulated     other comprehensive income. During the year ended     December 31, 2008, the realized gains related to these     hedges was approximately $26.3 million. During the years     ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, the realized gains and     losses related to these hedges were not significant.     Economic     Exposure         We transact business in various foreign currencies and have     significant international revenues as well as costs denominated     in foreign currencies, subjecting us to foreign currency risk.     In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries on a     monthly basis for their use of intellectual property and     technology and for certain corporate services provided by eBay     and PayPal in the U.S. These charges are denominated in     Euros and these forecasted inter-company transactions represent     a foreign currency cash flow exposure. We purchase foreign     currency exchange contracts, generally with maturities of     12 months or less, to reduce the volatility of cash flows     primarily related to forecasted revenue and intercompany     transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies. The     objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure     that the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are not     adversely affected by changes in the U.S. dollar/foreign     currency exchange rate. We expect the hedge of certain of these     forecasted transactions to be highly effective in offsetting     potential changes in cash flows attributed to a change in the     U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate. Accordingly, we     record as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income     all unrealized gains and losses related to the foreign exchange     contracts that receive        95    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.

During the years ended     December 31, 2006 and 2007, the realized gains and losses     related to these hedges were not significant. During the year     ended December 31, 2008 the realized gains on these hedges     were $17.1 million. The notional amount of our economic     hedges receiving cash flow hedge accounting treatment was     $428.9 million as of December 31, 2008.

Level 1 instrument     valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for transactions     in active exchange markets involving identical assets.     Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from     readily-available pricing sources for comparable instruments. As     of December 31, 2008, we did not have any assets or     liabilities without observable market values that would require     a high level of judgment to determine fair value (level 3     assets). Our derivative instruments are valued using pricing     models that take into account the contract terms as well as     multiple inputs where applicable, such as equity prices,     interest rate yield curves, option volatility and currency     rates. Our derivative instruments are short-term in nature,     typically one month to one year in duration. Cash and cash     equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with     original or remaining maturities of three months or less when     purchased.         As of December 31, 2008, we held no direct investments in     auction rate securities, collateralized debt obligations,     structured investment vehicles or mortgage-backed securities.        96    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)         In Europe, we have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial     institution for cash management purposes. This arrangement     allows for cash withdrawals from this financial institution     based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held in Europe     within the same financial institution (Aggregate Cash     Deposits). This arrangement also allows us to withdraw     amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an     agreed-upon     limit. The net balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash     Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for     calculating our net interest expense or income. As of     December 31, 2008, we had a total of $1.8 billion in     cash withdrawals offsetting our $1.8 billion in Aggregate     Cash Deposits held within the same financial institution under     this cash pooling arrangement.         Our financial instruments, including accounts receivable, loans     and interest receivable, funds receivable, accounts payable,     funds payable, amounts due to customers and borrowings under our     line of credit are carried at cost, which approximates their     fair value because of the short-term maturity of these     instruments.

Note 10      Borrowings:     Credit     Agreement         In November 2006, we entered into a credit agreement which     provided for an unsecured $1.0 billion five-year revolving     credit facility. Loans under the credit agreement bore interest     at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from     0.25 percent to 0.45 percent or (ii) a formula     based on the Bank of America, or Agents, prime rate or on     the federal funds effective rate.         In August 2007, we entered into an amendment to our 2006 credit     agreement. The amendment agreement increased the lender     commitments and borrowing capacity under the 2006 credit     agreement from its prior level of $1.0 billion to     $2.0 billion, maintained an option to increase borrowing     capacity by an additional $1.0 billion (after giving effect     to the $1.0 billion increase described above) and extended     the maturity date by an additional year to November 7,     2012. Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank was a participating lender     in our $2.0 billion credit agreement. As a result of the     bankruptcy of its parent company, our available line of credit     has been effectively reduced by its commitment of     $160 million. Loans under the amended credit agreement will     bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin ranging from     0.20 percent to 0.50 percent. Subject to certain     conditions stated in the credit agreement, we may borrow, prepay     and reborrow amounts under the credit facility at any time     during the term of the credit agreement. Funds borrowed under     the credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital     expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes     of eBay and its subsidiaries. The credit agreement contains     customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative     covenants, including a financial covenant and events of default.     The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the     incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, and the entry     into certain agreements that restrict the ability of our     subsidiaries to provide credit support. The financial covenant     requires us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a     maximum consolidated leverage ratio.         As of December 31, 2008, we had $1.0 billion     outstanding under our credit agreement. This amount was     classified as a current liability included in our consolidated     balance sheet. The interest rate at December 31, 2008 was     1.67%. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with     the financial covenants associated with the credit agreement.     Shelf     Registration Statement         At December 31, 2008, we had a shelf registration statement     available which allows us to issue various types of debt     instruments, such as fixed or floating rate notes,     U.S. dollar or foreign currency denominated notes,     redeemable notes, global notes, and dual currency or other     indexed notes.

There were no material capital     leases at December 31, 2007 and 2008.     Litigation     and Other Legal Matters         In August 2006, Louis Vuitton Malletier and Christian Dior     Couture filed two lawsuits in the Paris Court of Commerce     against eBay Inc. and eBay International AG. Among other things,     the complaint alleges that we violated French tort law by     negligently broadcasting listings posted by third parties     offering counterfeit items bearing plaintiffs trademarks,     and by purchasing certain advertising keywords. Around September     2006, Parfums Christian Dior, Kenzo Parfums, Parfums Givenchy,     and Guerlain Société also filed a lawsuit in the Paris     Court of Commerce against eBay Inc. and eBay International AG.     The complaint alleges that we have interfered with the selective     distribution network the plaintiffs established in France and     the European Union by allowing third parties to post listings     offering genuine perfumes and cosmetics for sale on our     websites. In June 2008, the Paris Court of Commerce ruled that     eBay and eBay International AG were liable for failing to     prevent the sale of counterfeit items on its websites that     traded on plaintiffs brand names and for interfering with     the plaintiffs selective distribution network. The court     awarded plaintiffs approximately EUR 38.6 million in     damages and issued an injunction prohibiting all sales of     perfumes and cosmetics bearing the Dior, Guerlain, Givenchy and     Kenzo brands over all worldwide eBay sites to the extent that     they are accessible from France. We have taken measures to     comply with the injunction and have appealed these rulings.     However, these and similar suits may force us to modify our     business practices, which could lower our revenue, increase our     costs, or make our websites less convenient to our customers.     Any such results could materially harm our business. Other     luxury brand owners have also filed suit against us or have     threatened to do so, seeking to hold us liable for, among other     things, alleged counterfeit items listed on our websites by     third parties, for tester and other not for resale     consumer products listed on our websites by third parties, for     the alleged misuse of trademarks in listings, for alleged     violations of selective distribution channel laws, for alleged     non-compliance of consumer protection laws or in connection with     paid search advertisements. We continue to believe that we have     meritorious defenses to these suits and intend to defend     ourselves vigorously.         In June 2006, Net2Phone, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the     U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey     (No. 06-2469)     alleging that eBay Inc., Skype Technologies S.A., and Skype Inc.     infringed five patents owned by Net2Phone relating to     point-to-point Internet protocol. The suit seeks an injunction     against continuing infringement, unspecified damages, including     treble damages for willful infringement, and interest, costs,     and fees. We        100    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)         have filed an answer and counterclaims asserting that the     patents are invalid, unenforceable, and were not infringed. The     parties have completed claim construction briefing and attended     a pre-trial conference hearing. The claim construction hearing     is set for March 2009 and the trial date is not yet set. We     believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend     ourselves vigorously.         In March 2007, a plaintiff filed a purported antitrust class     action lawsuit against eBay in the Western District of Texas     alleging that eBay and its wholly owned subsidiary PayPal     monopolized markets through various anticompetitive     acts and tying arrangements. The plaintiff alleges claims under     sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, as well as related     state law claims. The complaint seeks treble damages and an     injunction. In April 2007, the plaintiff re-filed the complaint     in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of     California     (No. 07-CV-01882-RS),     and dismissed the Texas action. In 2007, the case was     consolidated with other similar lawsuits     (No. 07-CV-01882JF).     In June 2007, we filed a motion to dismiss the class action     complaint. In March 2008, the court granted the motion to     dismiss the tying claims with leave to amend and denied the     motion with respect to the monopolization claims. Plaintiffs     subsequently decided not to refile the tying claims. The class     certification motion is scheduled for June 2009. We believe that     we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves     vigorously.         In May 2007, Netcraft Corporation filed a lawsuit in the Western     District of Wisconsin     (No. 07-C-0254C)     alleging that eBay and PayPal infringed two of its patents     entitled Internet billing methods. The suit seeks an     injunction against continuing infringement, unspecified damages,     and interest, costs, and fees. In September 2007, we filed a     motion for summary judgment of noninfringement on both patents.     In December 2007, the U.S. District Court for the Western     District of Wisconsin entered a judgment granting our motion for     summary judgment of non-infringement on both of the patents that     Netcraft asserted against eBay and PayPal. This judgment was     affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in     December 2008.         In October 2007, PartsRiver filed a lawsuit in the Eastern     District of Texas     (No. 2-07CV-440-DF)     alleging that eBay, Microsoft, Yahoo!, Shopzilla, PriceGrabber     and PriceRunner infringed its patent relating to search methods.     The suit seeks an injunction against continuing infringement,     unspecified damages, and interest, costs, and fees. The     defendants have moved to transfer venue and the parties are     conducting discovery. Fact discovery cutoff is scheduled for     July 2009, the claim construction hearing is scheduled for April     2009 and trial is scheduled for October 2009. We believe that we     have meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves     vigorously.         eBays Korean subsidiary, IAC, has notified a majority of     its approximately 20 million users of a data breach     involving personally identifiable information including name,     address, resident registration number and some transaction and     refund data (but not including credit card information or real     time banking information). Approximately 141,000 users have sued     IAC over this breach in several lawsuits in Korean courts and we     expect more to do so in the future. There is some precedent in     Korea for a court to grant consolation money for     data breaches without a specific finding of harm from the     breach. Such precedents have involved payments of up to     approximately $200 per user. A consumer agency recently made a     non-binding recommendation that IAC make payments of     50,000-100,000 Korean won (approximately $35-70) to consumers     who had complained to it as a result of such breach. IAC intends     to vigorously defend itself in this lawsuit.         Other third parties have from time to time claimed, and others     may claim in the future, that we have infringed their     intellectual property rights. We are subject to additional     patent disputes, and expect that we will increasingly be subject     to patent infringement claims as our services expand in scope     and complexity. In particular, we expect that we may face     additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects     of our Marketplaces, Payments and Communications businesses. We     have in the past been forced to litigate such claims. We may     also become more vulnerable to third-party claims as laws such     as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Lanham Act and the     Communications Decency Act are interpreted by the courts, and as     we become subject to laws in jurisdictions where the underlying     laws with respect to the potential liability of online     intermediaries like ourselves are either unclear or less     favorable. We believe that additional lawsuits alleging that we     have violated copyright or trademark laws will be filed against     us. Intellectual property claims, whether meritorious or not,     are time consuming and costly to        101    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)         resolve, could require expensive changes in our methods of doing     business, or could require us to enter into costly royalty or     licensing agreements.         From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or     regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of     business. The number and significance of these disputes and     inquiries are increasing as our business expands and our company     grows larger. Any claims or regulatory actions against us,     whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in     costly litigation, require significant amounts of management     time, and result in the diversion of significant operational     resources.     Indemnification     Provisions         In the ordinary course of business, we have included limited     indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with     parties with whom we have commercial relations, including our     standard marketing, promotions and     application-programming-interface license agreements. Under     these contracts, we generally indemnify, hold harmless, and     agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or     incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by a     third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos     and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are     applicable to our performance under the subject agreement. In a     limited number of agreements, we have provided an indemnity for     other types of third-party claims, which are indemnities mainly     related to various intellectual property rights. In our PayPal     business, we have provided an indemnity to our payment     processors in the event of certain third-party claims or card     association fines against the processor arising out of conduct     by PayPal or PayPals customers. It is not possible to     determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification     provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification     claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each     particular provision. To date, no significant costs have been     incurred, either individually or collectively, in connection     with our indemnification provisions.           Note 12         Related     Party Transactions:           We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our     directors, executive officers and certain other officers. These     agreements require us to indemnify such individuals, to the     fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain     liabilities to which they may become subject as a result of     their affiliation with us.         All contracts with related parties are at rates and terms that     we believe are comparable with those entered into with     independent third parties. There were no material related party     transactions in 2006, 2007 and 2008. As of December 31,     2008, there were no significant amounts payable or amounts     receivable from related parties.           Note 13         Preferred     Stock:           We are authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware     law to issue Preferred Stock in one or more series; to establish     the number of shares included within each series; to fix the     rights, preferences and privileges of the shares of each wholly     unissued series and any related qualifications, limitations or     restrictions; and to increase or decrease the number of shares     of any series (but not below the number of shares of a series     then outstanding) without any further vote or action by the     stockholders. At December 31, 2007 and 2008, there were     10 million shares of $0.001 par value Preferred Stock     authorized for issuance, and no shares issued or outstanding.

A portion of the     shares issued and outstanding are subject to repurchase or     forfeiture over a four-year period from the earlier of the     issuance date or employee hire date, as applicable. At     December 31, 2008 there were 154,892 shares subject to     repurchase rights or forfeiture, respectively.        102    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)     Treasury     Stock         In June 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a stock     repurchase program for $2.0 billion of our common stock,     excluding broker commissions. In January 2007, our Board     authorized an expansion of the stock repurchase program to     provide for the repurchase of up to an additional     $2.0 billion of our common stock by January 2009. In     January 2008, our Board approved an additional stock repurchase     program to repurchase an additional $2.0 billion of our     common stock. The stock repurchase activity under our stock     repurchase program during 2008 is summarized as follows (in     thousands, except per-share amounts):                                                                                  Average            Value of            Remaining                  Shares            Price per            Shares            Amount                  Repurchased           Share           Repurchased           Authorized                   Balance at January 1, 2008                99,084               $       31.84               $       3,154,682               $       845,318              Authorization of new plan in January 2008                                                                         2,000,000              Repurchase of common stock                80,608                   27.15                   2,188,818                   (2,188,818       )                                                                                Balance at December 31, 2008                179,692               $       29.74               $       5,343,500               $       656,500                                                                                       These repurchased shares are recorded as treasury stock and are     accounted for under the cost method. No repurchased shares have     been retired or reissued.         From time to time, we enter into structured equity hedging     transactions. According to the terms of these transactions, if     the market price of our common stock exceeds a pre-determined     price on the maturity date, we have the option to settle these     transactions in cash or by repurchasing shares of our common     stock. If the market price of our common stock is below that     pre-determined price on the maturity date, we are required to     settle these transactions by repurchasing shares of our common     stock. The number of shares repurchased through the use of     structured equity hedging transactions is included in the table     above. The structured equity hedging transactions that settled     in cash during the year ended December 31, 2008, resulted     in premiums of approximately $12.3 million, which were     recorded as additional paid-in capital.         Our stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at     any time without prior notice. Stock repurchases under these     programs may be made through a variety of open market and     privately negotiated transactions, including structured stock     repurchase transactions or other derivative transactions, at     times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and     will be funded from the companys working capital or other     financing alternatives. The timing and actual number of shares     repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including     corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market     conditions. The programs are intended to comply with the volume,     timing and other limitations set forth in     Rule 10b-18     under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.         In addition to the above, we have withheld shares from employees     to satisfy tax obligations.     Note 15      Benefit Plans:     Equity     Incentive Plans         We have equity incentive plans for directors, officers and     employees that consist of stock options, restricted stock units,     nonvested shares and performance based restricted stock units.     At December 31, 2008, 627.5 million shares were     authorized under our equity incentive plans and     79.4 million shares were available for future grant.         All stock options granted under these plans generally vest 25%     one year from the date of grant (or 12.5% six months from the     date of grant for grants to existing employees) and the     remainder vest at a rate of 2.08% per month thereafter, and     generally expire seven to 10 years from the date of grant.     The cost of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes     option pricing model on the date of grant.         Restricted stock units and nonvested shares are granted to     eligible employees under our equity incentive plans. In general,     restricted stock units and nonvested shares cliff vest over one     to five years, are subject to the employees        103    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)         continuing service to the company and do not have an expiration     date. The cost of restricted stock units and nonvested shares is     determined using the fair value of our common stock on the date     of grant.         In 2007 and 2008, certain executives were eligible for     performance based restricted stock units. The number of     restricted stock units ultimately received depends on our     business performance against specified performance targets set     by the Compensation Committee. If the performance criteria are     satisfied, the performance based restricted stock units will be     granted and one-half of the grant will vest in March following     the end of the performance period and the remaining half will     vest one year later.     Employee     Stock Purchase Plan         We have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible     employees. Under the plan, shares of our common stock may be     purchased over an offering period with a maximum duration of two     years at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first     day of the applicable offering period or on the last day of the     six-month purchase period. Employees may purchase shares having     a value not exceeding 10% of their gross compensation during an     offering period. During the years ended December 31, 2006,     2007, and 2008, employees purchased approximately     1.6 million, 2.0 million, and 3.5 million shares     at average prices of $27.32, $26.84 and $17.78 per share,     respectively. At December 31, 2008, approximately     3.7 million shares of common stock were reserved for future     issuance. Our employee stock purchase plan contains an     evergreen provision that automatically increases, on     each January 1, the number of shares reserved for issuance     under the employee stock purchase plan by the number of shares     purchased under this plan in the preceding calendar year.     Employee     Savings Plans         We have a savings plan, which qualifies under     Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participating     employees may contribute up to 25% of their annual salary, but     not more than statutory limits. In 2006 and 2007, we contributed     one dollar for each dollar a participant contributed, with a     maximum contribution of $1,500 per employee and $2,000 per     employee, respectively. In 2008, we contributed one dollar for     each dollar a participant contributed, with a maximum     contribution of 4% of each employees salary, with a     maximum employer contribution of $9,200 per employee. Our     non-U.S. employees     are covered by various other savings plans. Our expenses for     these plans were $14.9 million in 2006, $20.4 million     in 2007 and $34.2 million in 2008.     Deferred     Stock Unit Plan         Since December 31, 2002, we have granted deferred stock     units to non-employee directors (other than Pierre Omidyar)     elected to our Board of Directors with each new director     receiving a one-time grant of deferred stock units equal to the     result of dividing $150,000 by the fair market value of our     common stock on the date of grant. Beginning with our 2008     annual meeting of stockholders, we have granted deferred stock     units to each non-employee director (other than Mr. Omidyar)     equal to the result of dividing $110,000 by the fair market     value of our common stock on the date of grant. Each deferred     stock unit constitutes an unfunded and unsecured promise by us     to deliver one share of our common stock (or the equivalent     value thereof in cash or property at our election). Each     deferred stock unit award granted to a new non-employee director     upon election to the Board vests 25% one year from the date of     grant, and at a rate of 2.08% per month thereafter. If the     services of the director are terminated at any time, all rights     to the unvested deferred stock units shall also terminate. In     addition, directors may elect to receive, in lieu of annual     retainer and committee chair fees and at the time these fees     would otherwise be payable (i.e., on a quarterly basis in     arrears for services provided), fully vested deferred stock     units with an initial value equal to the amount based on the     fair market value of common stock at the date of grant. Deferred     stock units are payable following the termination of a     directors tenure as a director. As of December 31,     2008, there were approximately 98,000 deferred stock units     outstanding under our equity plans.        104    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)     Stock     Option Valuation Assumptions         We calculated the fair value of each option award on the date of     grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The     following weighted-average assumptions were used for each     respective period:                                        Year Ended December 31,             2006       2007       2008               Risk-free interest rates            4.7%           4.5%           2.3%          Expected life            3.0 years           3.5 years           3.8 years          Dividend yield            0%           0%           0%          Expected volatility            36%           37%           34%             Our computation of expected volatility is based on a combination     of historical and market-based implied volatility from traded     options on our stock. Our computation of expected life was     determined based on historical experience of similar awards,     giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock-based     awards, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee     behavior. The interest rate for periods within the contractual     life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve     in effect at the time of grant.

As of December 31, 2008, there was approximately     $749.9 million of unearned stock-based compensation     estimated to be expensed from 2009 through 2012. If there are     any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested     awards, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any     remaining unearned stock-based compensation expense. Future     unearned stock-based compensation will increase to the extent we     grant additional equity awards or change the mix of grants     between stock options and restricted stock units or assume     unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions.         Prior to the adoption of FAS 123(R), the intrinsic value of     Skypes and Shopping.coms unvested common stock     options assumed in the acquisition was recorded as unearned     stock-based compensation. Upon the adoption of FAS 123(R)     in January 2006, the unearned stock-based compensation balance     of $45.5 million was reclassified to additional paid-in     capital.        105    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.

Of the $263.9 million of     federal net operating loss carryforwards, approximately     $227.5 million relate to acquisitions that occurred during     the year. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards     are subject to various limitations under Section 382 of the     Internal Revenue Code. If not utilized, the federal net     operating loss        108    Table of Contents     eBay     Inc.      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)         carryforwards will begin to expire in 2020, the state net     operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2010. As of     December 31, 2008, our state tax credit carryforwards for     income tax purposes were approximately $20.8 million. If     not utilized, the state tax credit carryforwards will begin to     expire in 2015.         At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we maintained a valuation     allowance with respect to certain of our deferred tax assets     relating primarily to operating losses in certain non-U.S.     jurisdictions that we believe are not likely to be realized.         We have not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign     withholding taxes on $5.6 billion of     non-U.S. subsidiaries     undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2008, because     such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the     operations and potential acquisitions related to our     international operations. Upon distribution of those earnings in     the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to     U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax     credits). It is not practicable to determine the income tax     liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be     distributed.         The Company enjoys tax holidays in several     different jurisdictions, most significantly Singapore and     Switzerland. The tax holidays provide for lower rates of     taxation on certain classes of income and require various     thresholds of investment and employment in those jurisdictions.     These tax holidays are in effect currently and expire over     periods ranging from 2011 to the duration of business operations     in the respective jurisdictions.         On January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of     FIN 48. The adoption of FIN 48 resulted in a $145,000     adjustment to beginning retained earnings.         The following table reflects changes in the unrecognized tax     benefits since January 1, 2007:                                              2007           2008                 (in thousands)                   Gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits as the beginning of     the period            $        385,700               $       494,253              Increases related to prior year tax positions                                   5,220              Increases related to current year tax positions                108,553                   201,901                                                    Gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits as of the end of the     period            $       494,253               $       701,374                                                       The total liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, and the     increase in these liabilities in 2008 relates primarily to the     allocations of revenue and costs among our global operations.     Our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as     deferred and other tax liabilities, net in our consolidated     balance sheet. If recognized, the portion of liabilities for     unrecognized tax benefits that would decrease our provision for     income taxes and increase our net income is $694.9 million.     The impact on net income reflects the liabilities for     unrecognized tax benefits net of certain deferred tax assets and     the federal tax benefit of state income tax items.         Over the next twelve months, our existing tax positions will     continue to generate an increase in liabilities for unrecognized     tax benefits. We recognize interest     and/or     penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax     expense. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of     December 31, 2007 and 2008 was approximately     $16.3 million and $52.6 million, respectively. During     the year, a change in California law was enacted resulting in     the accrual of $18.5 million of potential penalties.         We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various states     and foreign jurisdictions. We are under examination by certain     tax authorities for the 2003 tax year.
