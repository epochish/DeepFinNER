THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET, NET OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $158.6&NBSP;MILLION, TOTALED $58.1&NBSP;MILLION AT DECEMBER&NBSP;31, 2004 AND WAS OFFSET BY DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES OF $183.7&NBSP;MILLION RESULTING IN A NET DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OF $125.5&NBSP;MILLION.

WHILE MANY ASPECTS OF THESE REGULATIONS REMAIN UNCLEAR, THEY PURPORT TO LIMIT AND REQUIRE LICENSING OF VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE PROVISION OF INTERNET INFORMATION SERVICES. THESE REGULATIONS HAVE CREATED SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE LEGALITY OF FOREIGN INVESTMENTS IN PRC INTERNET COMPANIES, INCLUDING EACHNET, AND THE BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF SUCH COMPANIES. IN ORDER TO MEET LOCAL OWNERSHIP AND REGULATORY LICENSING REQUIREMENTS, THE NEW EBAY EACHNET WEBSITE IS OPERATED THROUGH A FOREIGN-OWNED ENTERPRISE INDIRECTLY OWNED BY EBAY&#146;S EUROPEAN OPERATING ENTITY, WHICH ACTS IN COOPERATION WITH A LOCAL PRC COMPANY OWNED BY CERTAIN LOCAL EMPLOYEES. WE BELIEVE EACHNET&#146;S CURRENT OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE COMPLIES WITH ALL EXISTING PRC LAWS, RULES, AND REGULATIONS. THERE ARE, HOWEVER, SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE INTERPRETATION OF CURRENT PRC LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE PRC GOVERNMENT WILL ULTIMATELY TAKE A VIEW CONTRARY TO OURS. THERE ARE ALSO UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING EACHNET&#146;S ABILITY TO ENFORCE CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS IT HAS ENTERED INTO WITH RESPECT TO MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF THE COMPANY&#146;S BUSINESS.

BECAUSE WE CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT AND GROWING PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES BUT REPORT OUR RESULTS IN U.S.&NBSP;DOLLARS, WE FACE EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. IN CONNECTION WITH ITS MULTI-CURRENCY SERVICE, PAYPAL FIXES EXCHANGE RATES TWICE PER DAY, AND MAY FACE FINANCIAL EXPOSURE IF IT INCORRECTLY FIXES THE EXCHANGE RATE. PAYPAL ALSO HOLDS SOME CORPORATE FUNDS IN NON-U.S.&NBSP;CURRENCIES TO FACILITATE CUSTOMER WITHDRAWALS, AND THUS ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY THE TRANSLATION OF THESE NON-U.S.&NBSP;CURRENCIES INTO U.S.&NBSP;DOLLARS.

IF THE U.S.&NBSP;DOLLAR WEAKENS AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES, AS IT DID IN 2004, THE TRANSLATION OF THESE FOREIGN-CURRENCY-DENOMINATED TRANSACTIONS WILL RESULT IN INCREASED NET REVENUES, OPERATING EXPENSES, AND NET INCOME. THE CHANGE IN WEIGHTED AVERAGE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN 2004 RELATIVE TO THE COMPARABLE RATES USED IN PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED 2003 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN NET REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $129.9&NBSP;MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN AGGREGATE COST OF REVENUES AND OPERATING EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $58.4&NBSP;MILLION. SIMILARLY, OUR NET REVENUES, OPERATING EXPENSES, AND NET INCOME WILL DECREASE IF THE U.S.&NBSP;DOLLAR STRENGTHENS AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES. AS EXCHANGE RATES VARY, NET SALES AND OTHER OPERATING RESULTS, WHEN TRANSLATED, MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, TO THE EXTENT THE U.S.&NBSP;DOLLAR STRENGTHENS AGAINST THE EURO AND BRITISH POUND, OUR EUROPEAN REVENUES AND PROFITS WILL BE REDUCED AS A RESULT OF THESE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS AGAINST THE EURO AND THE BRITISH POUND, CROSS-BORDER TRADE RELATED TO PURCHASES OF DOLLAR-DENOMINATED GOODS BY NON-U.S. PURCHASERS MAY DECREASE, AND THAT DECREASE MAY NOT BE OFFSET BY A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN CROSS-BORDER TRADE INVOLVING PURCHASES BY U.S. BUYERS OF GOODS DENOMINATED IN OTHER CURRENCIES. WHILE WE FROM TIME TO TIME ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS TO HEDGE PORTIONS OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION EXPOSURE, THESE HEDGES ARE RELATIVELY COSTLY AND, EVEN WITH THEM IN EFFECT, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PERFECTLY PREDICT OR COMPLETELY ELIMINATE THE EFFECTS OF THIS EXPOSURE. </DIV> <DIV STYLE="MARGIN-TOP: 12PT; MARGIN-LEFT: 0; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF;"></DIV> <TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT;"> <TR> <TD WIDTH="3%"></TD> <TD WIDTH="97%"></TD> </TR> <TR VALIGN="TOP"> <TD></TD> <TD> <B><I>OUR BUSINESS AND USERS MAY BE SUBJECT TO SALES TAX AND OTHER TAXES.</I></B></TD> </TR> </TABLE> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT; MARGIN-LEFT: 0; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF;">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP; THE APPLICATION OF INDIRECT TAXES (SUCH AS SALES AND USE TAX, VALUE ADDED TAX, OR VAT, GOODS AND SERVICES TAX, BUSINESS TAX, AND GROSS RECEIPT TAX) TO E-COMMERCE BUSINESSES SUCH AS EBAY AND OUR USERS IS A COMPLEX AND EVOLVING ISSUE.

THESE PROPOSALS, IF ADOPTED, COULD SUBSTANTIALLY IMPAIR THE GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE, AND COULD DIMINISH OUR OPPORTUNITY TO DERIVE FINANCIAL BENEFIT FROM OUR ACTIVITIES. IN DECEMBER 2004, THE U.S.&NBSP;FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENACTED LEGISLATION EXTENDING THE MORATORIUM ON STATES AND OTHER LOCAL AUTHORITIES IMPOSING ACCESS OR DISCRIMINATORY TAXES ON THE INTERNET THROUGH NOVEMBER 2007.

WE BELIEVE THAT SEVERAL OF PAYPAL&#146;S CURRENT AND FORMER COMPETITORS IN THE ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS BUSINESS HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS OR SIGNIFICANTLY RESTRICTED THEIR BUSINESSES LARGELY DUE TO LOSSES FROM THIS TYPE OF FRAUD. WE EXPECT THAT TECHNICALLY KNOWLEDGEABLE CRIMINALS WILL CONTINUE TO ATTEMPT TO CIRCUMVENT PAYPAL&#146;S ANTI-FRAUD SYSTEMS.

IN ADDITION TO THE DIRECT COSTS OF SUCH LOSSES, IF THEY ARE RELATED TO CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS AND BECOME EXCESSIVE THEY COULD RESULT IN PAYPAL LOSING THE RIGHT TO ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS FOR PAYMENT. IF PAYPAL WERE UNABLE TO ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS, THE VELOCITY OF TRADE ON EBAY COULD DECREASE, IN WHICH CASE OUR BUSINESS WOULD FURTHER SUFFER.

IN NOVEMBER 2004, PAYPAL INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF PROTECTION AVAILABLE UNDER ITS BUYER PROTECTION PROGRAM TO $1,000. IF PAYPAL MAKES SUCH A REFUND, IT SEEKS TO COLLECT REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE SELLER, BUT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RECEIVE ANY FUNDS FROM THE SELLER.

AS A RESULT, PAYPAL MUST RELY ON BANKS OR PAYMENT PROCESSORS TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS, AND MUST PAY A FEE FOR THIS SERVICE. FROM TIME TO TIME, CREDIT CARD ASSOCIATIONS MAY INCREASE THE INTERCHANGE FEES THAT THEY CHARGE FOR EACH TRANSACTION USING ONE OF THEIR CARDS. MASTERCARD HAS ANNOUNCED AN INCREASE IN THE STANDARD INTERCHANGE FEE FOR CREDIT CARDS IN ONLINE COMMERCE TRANSACTIONS EFFECTIVE APRIL 2005. PAYPAL&#146;S CREDIT CARD PROCESSORS HAVE THE RIGHT TO PASS ANY INCREASES IN INTERCHANGE FEES ON TO PAYPAL AS WELL AS INCREASE THEIR OWN FEES FOR PROCESSING. SUCH INCREASED FEES INCREASE PAYPAL&#146;S OPERATING COSTS AND REDUCE ITS PROFIT MARGINS. PAYPAL IS ALSO REQUIRED BY ITS PROCESSORS TO COMPLY WITH CREDIT CARD ASSOCIATION OPERATING RULES, AND PAYPAL HAS AGREED TO REIMBURSE ITS PROCESSORS FOR ANY FINES THEY ARE ASSESSED BY CREDIT CARD ASSOCIATIONS AS A RESULT OF PROCESSING PAYMENTS FOR PAYPAL. THE CREDIT CARD ASSOCIATIONS AND THEIR MEMBER BANKS SET AND INTERPRET THE CREDIT CARD RULES. SOME OF THOSE MEMBER BANKS COMPETE WITH PAYPAL. VISA, MASTERCARD, AMERICAN EXPRESS, OR DISCOVER COULD ADOPT NEW OPERATING RULES OR RE-INTERPRET EXISTING RULES THAT PAYPAL OR ITS PROCESSORS MIGHT FIND DIFFICULT OR EVEN IMPOSSIBLE TO FOLLOW. AS A RESULT, PAYPAL COULD LOSE ITS ABILITY TO GIVE CUSTOMERS THE OPTION OF USING CREDIT CARDS TO FUND THEIR PAYMENTS. IF PAYPAL WERE UNABLE TO ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS, ITS BUSINESS WOULD BE SERIOUSLY DAMAGED. IN ADDITION, THE VELOCITY OF TRADE ON EBAY COULD DECREASE AND OUR BUSINESS WOULD FURTHER SUFFER. </DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT; MARGIN-LEFT: 0; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF;">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP; IN 2002, BOTH VISA AND MASTERCARD ADOPTED NEW OPERATING RULES FOR INTERNET PAYMENT SERVICES LIKE PAYPAL. IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE ASSOCIATIONS&#146; NEW RULES, PAYPAL AND ITS CREDIT CARD PROCESSORS HAVE IMPLEMENTED CHANGES TO EXISTING BUSINESS PROCESSES FOR MERCHANT CUSTOMERS. ANY PROBLEMS WITH THIS IMPLEMENTATION COULD RESULT IN FINES, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH WOULD BE WITHIN VISA&#146;S AND MASTERCARD&#146;S DISCRETION. PAYPAL ALSO COULD BE SUBJECT TO FINES FROM MASTERCARD AND VISA IF IT FAILS TO REGISTER AND CONDUCT ADDITIONAL MONITORING WITH RESPECT TO THE ACTIVITIES OF MERCHANTS THAT ARE CONSIDERED &#147;HIGH RISK,&#148; PRIMARILY CERTAIN MERCHANTS THAT SELL DIGITAL CONTENT. PAYPAL HAS INCURRED FINES FROM ITS CREDIT CARD PROCESSOR IN 2003 AND 2004 RELATING TO PAYPAL&#146;S FAILURE TO DETECT THE USE OF ITS SERVICE BY CERTAIN &#147;HIGH RISK&#148; MERCHANTS USING THE PAYPAL SERVICE. THE AMOUNT OF THESE FINES HAS NOT BEEN MATERIAL, BUT ANY ADDITIONAL FINES IN THE FUTURE WOULD LIKELY BE FOR LARGER AMOUNTS, COULD BECOME MATERIAL, AND COULD RESULT IN A TERMINATION OF PAYPAL&#146;S ABILITY TO ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS, WHICH WOULD SERIOUSLY DAMAGE PAYPAL&#146;S BUSINESS. </DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT; MARGIN-LEFT: 0; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF;">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP; PAYPAL PAYS SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTION FEES WHEN SENDERS FUND PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS USING CREDIT CARDS, NOMINAL FEES WHEN CUSTOMERS FUND PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS BY ELECTRONIC TRANSFER OF FUNDS FROM BANK ACCOUNTS, AND NO FEES WHEN CUSTOMERS FUND PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS FROM AN EXISTING PAYPAL ACCOUNT BALANCE.

HOWEVER, PAYPAL HAS IN THE PAST RECEIVED WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS FROM STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES EXPRESSING THE VIEW THAT ITS SERVICE MIGHT CONSTITUTE AN UNAUTHORIZED BANKING BUSINESS. PAYPAL HAS TAKEN STEPS TO ADDRESS THESE STATES&#146; CONCERNS. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THE STEPS PAYPAL HAS TAKEN TO ADDRESS THESE REGULATORY CONCERNS WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN ALL STATES, AND ONE OR MORE STATES MAY CONCLUDE THAT PAYPAL IS ENGAGED IN AN UNAUTHORIZED BANKING BUSINESS. IF PAYPAL IS FOUND TO BE ENGAGED IN AN UNAUTHORIZED BANKING BUSINESS IN ONE OR MORE STATES, IT MIGHT BE SUBJECT TO MONETARY PENALTIES AND ADVERSE PUBLICITY AND MIGHT BE REQUIRED TO CEASE DOING BUSINESS WITH RESIDENTS OF THOSE STATES. EVEN IF THE STEPS IT HAS TAKEN TO RESOLVE THESE STATES&#146; CONCERNS ARE DEEMED SUFFICIENT BY THE STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, PAYPAL COULD BE SUBJECT TO FINES AND PENALTIES FOR ITS PRIOR ACTIVITIES. THE NEED TO COMPLY WITH STATE LAWS PROHIBITING UNAUTHORIZED BANKING ACTIVITIES COULD ALSO LIMIT PAYPAL&#146;S ABILITY TO ENHANCE ITS SERVICES IN THE FUTURE. ANY CHANGE TO PAYPAL&#146;S BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT MAKES THE SERVICE LESS ATTRACTIVE TO CUSTOMERS OR PROHIBITS ITS USE BY RESIDENTS OF A PARTICULAR JURISDICTION COULD DECREASE THE VELOCITY OF TRADE ON EBAY, WHICH WOULD FURTHER HARM OUR BUSINESS. </DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT; MARGIN-LEFT: 0; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF;">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP; A NUMBER OF U.S.&NBSP;STATES HAVE ENACTED LEGISLATION REGULATING MONEY TRANSMITTERS. TO DATE, PAYPAL HAS OBTAINED LICENSES IN 32 OF THESE JURISDICTIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS IN NINE STATES THAT LICENSING IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER THEIR EXISTING STATUTES. AS A LICENSED MONEY TRANSMITTER, PAYPAL IS SUBJECT TO BONDING REQUIREMENTS, RESTRICTIONS ON ITS INVESTMENT OF CUSTOMER FUNDS, REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, AND INSPECTION BY STATE REGULATORY AGENCIES. IF PAYPAL&#146;S PENDING APPLICATIONS WERE DENIED, OR IF IT WERE FOUND TO BE SUBJECT TO AND IN VIOLATION OF ANY MONEY SERVICES LAWS OR REGULATIONS, PAYPAL ALSO COULD BE SUBJECT TO LIABILITY, FORCED TO CEASE DOING BUSINESS WITH RESIDENTS OF CERTAIN STATES, OR FORCED TO CHANGE ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES. ANY CHANGE TO PAYPAL&#146;S BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT MAKES THE SERVICE LESS ATTRACTIVE TO CUSTOMERS OR PROHIBITS ITS USE BY RESIDENTS OF A PARTICULAR JURISDICTION COULD DECREASE THE VELOCITY OF TRADE ON EBAY, WHICH WOULD FURTHER HARM OUR BUSINESS. EVEN IF PAYPAL IS NOT FORCED TO CHANGE ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES, IT COULD BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN LICENSES OR REGULATORY APPROVALS THAT COULD IMPOSE A SUBSTANTIAL COST ON PAYPAL. </DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT; MARGIN-LEFT: 0; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF;">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP; ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN NO DEFINITIVE INTERPRETATIONS TO DATE, PAYPAL HAS ASSUMED THAT ITS SERVICE IS SUBJECT TO THE ELECTRONIC FUND&NBSP;TRANSFER ACT AND REGULATION&NBSP;E OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. AS A RESULT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PAYPAL MUST PROVIDE ADVANCE DISCLOSURE OF CHANGES TO ITS SERVICE, FOLLOW SPECIFIED ERROR RESOLUTION PROCEDURES AND ABSORB LOSSES ABOVE $50 FROM TRANSACTIONS NOT AUTHORIZED BY THE CONSUMER. IN ADDITION, PAYPAL IS SUBJECT TO THE FINANCIAL PRIVACY PROVISIONS OF THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT, STATE FINANCIAL PRIVACY LAWS, AND RELATED REGULATIONS. AS A RESULT, SOME CUSTOMER FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT PAYPAL RECEIVES IS SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS ON REUSE AND DISCLOSURE. EXISTING AND POTENTIAL FUTURE PRIVACY LAWS MAY LIMIT PAYPAL&#146;S ABILITY TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT MAKE USE OF DATA GATHERED THROUGH ITS SERVICE. THE PROVISIONS OF THESE LAWS AND RELATED REGULATIONS ARE COMPLICATED, AND PAYPAL DOES NOT HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN COMPLYING WITH THEM. EVEN TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS OF THESE LAWS CAN RESULT IN PENALTIES OF UP TO $1,000 FOR EACH NON-COMPLIANT TRANSACTION. PAYPAL PROCESSED AN AVERAGE OF APPROXIMATELY 929,000 TRANSACTIONS PER DAY DURING 2004, AND ANY VIOLATIONS COULD EXPOSE PAYPAL TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY. </DIV> <P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT;">49 <!-- PAGEBREAK --> <P><HR NOSHADE><P> <H5 ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:ALWAYS"><A HREF="#TOC">TABLE OF CONTENTS</A></H5><P> <DIV STYLE="MARGIN-TOP: 12PT; MARGIN-LEFT: 0; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF;"></DIV> <TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT;"> <TR> <TD WIDTH="3%"></TD> <TD WIDTH="97%"></TD> </TR> <TR VALIGN="TOP"> <TD></TD> <TD> <B><I>PAYPAL&#146;S STATUS UNDER BANKING OR FINANCIAL SERVICES LAWS OR OTHER LAWS IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S.&NBSP;IS UNCLEAR.</I></B></TD> </TR> </TABLE> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT; MARGIN-LEFT: 0; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF;">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP; PAYPAL CURRENTLY ALLOWS ITS CUSTOMERS WITH CREDIT CARDS TO SEND PAYMENTS FROM 44 COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S., AND TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS IN 43 OF THOSE COUNTRIES. IN 23 OF THESE COUNTRIES, CUSTOMERS CAN WITHDRAW FUNDS TO LOCAL BANK ACCOUNTS, AND IN EIGHT OF THESE COUNTRIES CUSTOMERS CAN WITHDRAW FUNDS BY RECEIVING A BANK DRAFT IN THE MAIL. PAYPAL OFFERS CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO SEND OR RECEIVE PAYMENTS DENOMINATED IN U.S.&NBSP;DOLLARS, BRITISH POUNDS, EUROS, CANADIAN DOLLARS, YEN, AND, BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2005, AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS. PAYPAL HAS APPLIED FOR AN AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL SERVICES LICENSE, AND HAS RECEIVED AN OFFICIAL EXEMPTION FROM THE BANKING ACT IN AUSTRALIA UNTIL OCTOBER 2005. IN FEBRUARY 2004, PAYPAL (EUROPE) LTD., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF PAYPAL, RECEIVED A LICENSE TO OPERATE AS AN ELECTRONIC MONEY INSTITUTION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AS A VEHICLE FOR PROVIDING LOCALIZED VERSIONS OF PAYPAL&#146;S SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS IN THE EU. FIFTEEN OF THE 44 COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.&NBSP;WHOSE RESIDENTS CAN USE THE PAYPAL SERVICE ARE MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. AS PAYPAL (EUROPE) DEVELOPS LOCALIZED SERVICES FOR THE DOMESTIC MARKET IN THESE COUNTRIES, IT IS IMPLEMENTING SUCH LOCALIZED SERVICES THROUGH AN EXPEDITED &#147;PASSPORT&#148; NOTIFICATION PROCESS THROUGH THE UK REGULATOR TO REGULATORS IN OTHER EU MEMBER STATES, PURSUANT TO EU DIRECTIVES. PAYPAL (EUROPE) HAS FILED &#147;PASSPORT&#148; NOTICES IN AUSTRIA, BELGIUM, FRANCE, GERMANY, THE NETHERLANDS, IRELAND, ITALY, SWEDEN, DENMARK, FINLAND, LUXEMBOURG, PORTUGAL, GREECE AND SPAIN. THE REGULATORS IN THESE COUNTRIES COULD NOTIFY PAYPAL (EUROPE) OF LOCAL CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS THAT WILL APPLY TO ITS BUSINESS, IN ADDITION TO UK CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW. ANY SUCH RESPONSES FROM THESE REGULATORS COULD INCREASE THE COST OF, OR DELAY, PAYPAL&#146;S PLANS FOR EXPANDING ITS BUSINESS. PAYPAL (EUROPE) IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FINES OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT ACTION IF IT VIOLATES THE DISCLOSURE, REPORTING, ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING, CAPITALIZATION, FUNDS MANAGEMENT OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED ON ELECTRONIC MONEY INSTITUTIONS. </DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT; MARGIN-LEFT: 0; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF;">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP; IN MANY COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND THE EUROPEAN UNION, IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER PAYPAL&#146;S U.S.-BASED SERVICE IS SUBJECT TO LOCAL LAW OR, IF IT IS SUBJECT TO LOCAL LAW, WHETHER SUCH LOCAL LAW REQUIRES A PAYMENT PROCESSOR LIKE PAYPAL TO BE LICENSED AS A BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION OR OTHERWISE. EVEN IF PAYPAL IS NOT CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A LICENSE IN THOSE COUNTRIES, FUTURE LOCALIZATION OR TARGETED MARKETING OF PAYPAL&#146;S SERVICE IN THOSE COUNTRIES COULD REQUIRE LICENSURE AND OTHER LAWS OF THOSE COUNTRIES (SUCH AS DATA PROTECTION LAWS) MAY APPLY. IF PAYPAL WERE FOUND TO BE SUBJECT TO AND IN VIOLATION OF ANY FOREIGN LAWS OR REGULATIONS, IT COULD BE SUBJECT TO LIABILITY, FORCED TO CHANGE ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES OR FORCED TO SUSPEND PROVIDING SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN ONE OR MORE COUNTRIES. ALTERNATIVELY, PAYPAL COULD BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN LICENSES OR REGULATORY APPROVALS THAT COULD IMPOSE A SUBSTANTIAL COST ON IT AND INVOLVE CONSIDERABLE DELAY TO THE PROVISION OR DEVELOPMENT OF ITS PRODUCT. DELAY OR FAILURE TO RECEIVE SUCH A LICENSE WOULD REQUIRE PAYPAL TO CHANGE ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES OR FEATURES IN WAYS THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PAYPAL&#146;S INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION PLANS AND COULD REQUIRE PAYPAL TO SUSPEND PROVIDING SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN ONE OR MORE COUNTRIES. </DIV> <DIV STYLE="MARGIN-TOP: 12PT; MARGIN-LEFT: 0; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF;"></DIV> <TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT;"> <TR> <TD WIDTH="3%"></TD> <TD WIDTH="97%"></TD> </TR> <TR VALIGN="TOP"> <TD></TD> <TD> <B><I>WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS RELATING TO CONSUMER PRIVACY.</I></B></TD> </TR> </TABLE> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT; MARGIN-LEFT: 0; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF;">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP; SEVERAL DOMESTIC JURISDICTIONS HAVE PROPOSED, AND CALIFORNIA, MINNESOTA, UTAH, AND VERMONT HAVE RECENTLY PASSED, LEGISLATION THAT LIMITS THE USES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION GATHERED ONLINE OR OFFLINE.

EBAY AND PAYPAL IN CERTAIN INSTANCES ARE SUBJECT TO SOME OF THESE CURRENT LAWS. PAYPAL MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO RECENTLY ENACTED LEGISLATION IN SEVERAL STATES AND COUNTRIES IMPOSING GREATER RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO SHARE USER INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES WITHOUT AFFIRMATIVE USER CONSENT. HOWEVER, THE FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT OF 2003, OR FACT, INCLUDED A PROVISION PREEMPTING CONFLICTING STATE LAWS ON THE SHARING OF INFORMATION BETWEEN CORPORATE AFFILIATES, AND AS A RESULT WE BELIEVE THAT PAYPAL AND EBAY WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE LAWS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL STATE WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF FACT, BUT WILL REMAIN SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF FACT AND THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT.

TODAY, THERE ARE STILL RELATIVELY FEW LAWS SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED TOWARDS ONLINE SERVICES. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE INCREASING POPULARITY AND USE OF THE INTERNET AND ONLINE SERVICES, MANY LAWS RELATING TO THE INTERNET ARE BEING DEBATED AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AROUND THE WORLD AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS WILL BE ADOPTED. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD COVER ISSUES SUCH AS USER PRIVACY, FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, PRICING, FRAUD, CONTENT AND QUALITY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TAXATION, ADVERTISING, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND INFORMATION SECURITY. IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW EXISTING LAWS GOVERNING ISSUES SUCH AS PROPERTY OWNERSHIP, COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ISSUES, TAXATION, LIBEL AND DEFAMATION, OBSCENITY, AND PERSONAL PRIVACY APPLY TO ONLINE BUSINESSES. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE LAWS WERE ADOPTED PRIOR TO THE ADVENT OF THE INTERNET AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES AND, AS A RESULT, DO NOT CONTEMPLATE OR ADDRESS THE UNIQUE ISSUES OF THE INTERNET AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES. THOSE LAWS THAT DO REFERENCE THE INTERNET, SUCH AS THE U.S.&NBSP;DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT AND THE EUROPEAN UNION&#146;S DIRECTIVE ON DISTANCE SELLING AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE HAVE BEGUN TO BE INTERPRETED BY THE COURTS AND IMPLEMENTED BY THE EU MEMBER STATES, BUT THEIR APPLICABILITY AND SCOPE REMAIN SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN. AS OUR ACTIVITIES AND THE TYPES OF GOODS LISTED ON OUR WEBSITE EXPAND, REGULATORY AGENCIES OR COURTS MAY CLAIM OR HOLD THAT WE OR OUR USERS ARE EITHER SUBJECT TO LICENSURE OR PROHIBITED FROM CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESS IN THEIR JURISDICTION, EITHER WITH RESPECT TO OUR SERVICES IN GENERAL, OR IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE SALE OF CERTAIN ITEMS (E.G., REAL ESTATE, EVENT TICKETS, CULTURAL GOODS, BOATS, AUTOMOBILES). </DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT; MARGIN-LEFT: 0; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF;">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP; NUMEROUS STATES AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, WHERE OUR HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED, HAVE REGULATIONS REGARDING &#147;AUCTIONS&#148; AND THE HANDLING OF PROPERTY BY &#147;PAWNBROKERS.&#148; NO FINAL LEGAL DETERMINATION HAS BEEN MADE AS TO WHETHER THE CALIFORNIA REGULATIONS APPLY TO OUR BUSINESS AND LITTLE PRECEDENT EXISTS IN THIS AREA.

IN AUGUST 2002, ILLINOIS AMENDED ITS AUCTION LAW TO PROVIDE FOR A SPECIAL REGULATORY REGIME FOR &#147;INTERNET AUCTION LISTING SERVICES,&#148; AND WE HAVE REGISTERED AS AN INTERNET AUCTION LISTING SERVICE IN ILLINOIS. ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT EXPECT THIS REGISTRATION TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, OTHER REGULATORY AND LICENSURE CLAIMS COULD RESULT IN COSTLY LITIGATION OR COULD REQUIRE US TO CHANGE THE WAY WE OR OUR USERS DO BUSINESS IN WAYS THAT INCREASE COSTS OR REDUCE REVENUES OR FORCE US TO PROHIBIT LISTINGS OF CERTAIN ITEMS FOR SOME LOCATIONS.

AS WE EXPAND AND LOCALIZE OUR INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES, WE BECOME OBLIGATED TO COMPLY WITH THE LAWS OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. LAWS REGULATING INTERNET COMPANIES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.&NBSP;MAY BE LESS FAVORABLE THAN THOSE IN THE U.S., GIVING GREATER RIGHTS TO CONSUMERS, CONTENT OWNERS, AND USERS. COMPLIANCE MAY BE MORE COSTLY OR MAY REQUIRE US TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES OR RESTRICT OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS RELATIVE TO THOSE IN THE U.S.&NBSP;OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH FOREIGN LAWS COULD SUBJECT US TO PENALTIES RANGING FROM CRIMINAL PROSECUTION TO BANS ON OUR SERVICES. </DIV> <DIV STYLE="MARGIN-TOP: 12PT; MARGIN-LEFT: 0; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF;"></DIV> <TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT;"> <TR> <TD WIDTH="3%"></TD> <TD WIDTH="97%"></TD> </TR> <TR VALIGN="TOP"> <TD></TD> <TD> <B><I>PAYPAL HAS LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN MANAGING AND ACCOUNTING ACCURATELY FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF CUSTOMER FUNDS.

ALTHOUGH PAYPAL HAS ADOPTED A PROGRAM TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, ANY ERRORS OR FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM PROPERLY COULD LEAD TO LAWSUITS, ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION, AND PROSECUTION BY THE GOVERNMENT. IN JULY 2003, PAYPAL AGREED WITH THE U.S.&NBSP;ATTORNEY FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI THAT IT WOULD PAY $10&NBSP;MILLION AS A CIVIL FORFEITURE TO SETTLE ALLEGATIONS THAT ITS PROVISION OF SERVICES TO ONLINE GAMBLING MERCHANTS VIOLATED PROVISIONS OF THE USA PATRIOT ACT AND FURTHER AGREED TO HAVE ITS COMPLIANCE PROGRAM REVIEWED BY AN INDEPENDENT AUDIT FIRM. PAYPAL IS ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE IT TO REPORT SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITIES INVOLVING TRANSACTIONS OF $2,000 OR MORE AND MAY BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN AND KEEP MORE DETAILED RECORDS ON THE SENDERS AND RECIPIENTS IN CERTAIN TRANSFERS OF $3,000 OR MORE. THE INTERPRETATION OF SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITIES IN THIS CONTEXT IS UNCERTAIN. FUTURE REGULATIONS UNDER THE USA PATRIOT ACT MAY REQUIRE PAYPAL TO REVISE THE PROCEDURES IT USES TO VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND TO MONITOR MORE CLOSELY INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS. THESE REGULATIONS COULD IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT COSTS ON PAYPAL AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR NEW CUSTOMERS TO JOIN ITS NETWORK. PAYPAL COULD BE REQUIRED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ITS CUSTOMERS BEFORE OPENING AN ACCOUNT, TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL VERIFICATION OF INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS AND TO MONITOR ITS CUSTOMERS&#146; ACTIVITIES MORE CLOSELY. THESE REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS ANY ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY VISA, MASTERCARD, AMERICAN EXPRESS, AND DISCOVER, COULD RAISE PAYPAL&#146;S COSTS SIGNIFICANTLY AND REDUCE THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF ITS PRODUCT.

IN OCTOBER 2002, THE COURT GRANTED IN PART OUR SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION, EFFECTIVELY INVALIDATING THE PATENT RELATED TO ONLINE AUCTION TECHNOLOGY AND RENDERING IT UNENFORCEABLE. THIS RULING LEFT ONLY TWO PATENTS IN THE CASE. TRIAL OF THE MATTER BEGAN IN APRIL 2003.

WE HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF SEVERAL POTENTIAL PATENT DISPUTES, AND EXPECT THAT WE WILL INCREASINGLY BE SUBJECT TO PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AS OUR SERVICES EXPAND IN SCOPE AND COMPLEXITY. IN PARTICULAR, WE EXPECT TO FACE ADDITIONAL PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS INVOLVING SERVICES WE PROVIDE, INCLUDING VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR PAYMENTS BUSINESS. WE HAVE IN THE PAST BEEN FORCED TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS. WE MAY ALSO BECOME MORE VULNERABLE TO THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS AS LAWS SUCH AS THE DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT, THE LANHAM ACT AND THE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT ARE INTERPRETED BY THE COURTS AND AS WE EXPAND GEOGRAPHICALLY INTO JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE UNDERLYING LAWS WITH RESPECT TO THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY OF ONLINE INTERMEDIARIES LIKE OURSELVES ARE EITHER UNCLEAR OR LESS FAVORABLE.

WE WERE INFORMED THAT THE INQUIRY INCLUDES AN EXAMINATION OF OUR PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO THESE TRANSACTIONS. IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE INVESTIGATION, THE COURT HAS ORDERED THAT NO FURTHER PUBLIC DISCLOSURES BE MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE MATTER. ANY CIVIL OR CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST US WOULD LIKELY HARM OUR BUSINESS DUE TO NEGATIVE PUBLICITY, THE COST OF LITIGATION, THE DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT TIME, AND ANY FINES OR PENALTIES ASSESSED. </DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT; MARGIN-LEFT: 0; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF;">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP; A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS OCCUR ON OUR WEBSITES.

IF PAYPAL BECOMES SUBJECT TO AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION, IT COULD BE REQUIRED TO RESTRUCTURE ITS ANTI-FRAUD PROCESSES IN WAYS THAT WOULD HARM ITS BUSINESS, AND TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL FINES. EVEN IF PAYPAL IS ABLE TO DEFEND ITSELF SUCCESSFULLY, AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION COULD CAUSE DAMAGE TO ITS REPUTATION, COULD CONSUME SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF ITS MANAGEMENT&#146;S TIME AND ATTENTION, AND COULD REQUIRE PAYPAL TO CHANGE ITS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND OPERATIONS IN WAYS THAT COULD INCREASE ITS COSTS AND DECREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS ANTI-FRAUD PROGRAM. BOTH EBAY AND PAYPAL ARE LIKELY TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL INQUIRIES FROM REGULATORY AGENCIES IN THE FUTURE, WHICH MAY LEAD TO ACTION AGAINST EITHER COMPANY. WE HAVE RESPONDED TO ALL INQUIRIES FROM REGULATORY AGENCIES BY DESCRIBING OUR CURRENT AND PLANNED ANTIFRAUD EFFORTS, CUSTOMER SUPPORT PROCEDURES AND OPERATING PROCEDURES.

WHILE WE HAVE BEEN LARGELY SUCCESSFUL TO DATE IN DEFENDING AGAINST SUCH LITIGATION, MORE RECENT CASES HAVE BEEN BASED, AT LEAST IN PART, ON DIFFERENT LEGAL THEORIES THAN THOSE OF EARLIER CASES, AND THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR DEFENSE. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT THAT THIS TYPE OF LITIGATION MAY INCREASE AS OUR SITES GAIN PROMINENCE IN MARKETS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., WHERE THE LAWS MAY BE UNSETTLED OR LESS FAVORABLE TO US. SUCH LITIGATION IS COSTLY FOR US, COULD RESULT IN DAMAGE AWARDS OR INCREASED COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS THROUGH ADVERSE JUDGMENT OR SETTLEMENT, COULD REQUIRE US TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES IN EXPENSIVE WAYS, OR COULD OTHERWISE HARM OUR BUSINESS.

SEVERAL PRIVATE LAWSUITS SEEKING TO IMPOSE LIABILITY UPON US UNDER A NUMBER OF THESE THEORIES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST US.

THESE MEASURES HEIGHTEN THE NEED FOR PROMPT AND ACCURATE CUSTOMER SERVICE TO RESOLVE IRREGULARITIES AND DISPUTES. EFFECTIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT PERSONNEL EXPENSE, AND THIS EXPENSE, IF NOT MANAGED PROPERLY, COULD IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY SIGNIFICANTLY. FAILURE TO MANAGE OR TRAIN OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES PROPERLY COULD COMPROMISE OUR ABILITY TO HANDLE CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS EFFECTIVELY.

PAYPAL HAS IN THE PAST RECEIVED NEGATIVE PUBLICITY WITH RESPECT TO ITS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ACCOUNT RESTRICTIONS, AND IS THE SUBJECT OF PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AND STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL INQUIRIES ALLEGING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FAILURE TO RESOLVE ACCOUNT RESTRICTIONS PROMPTLY.

TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, WE MAINTAIN OUR PORTFOLIO OF CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IN A VARIETY OF SECURITIES, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE SECURITIES AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS. THESE SECURITIES ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND CONSEQUENTLY ARE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), NET OF ESTIMATED TAX. </DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT; MARGIN-LEFT: 0; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF;">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP; INVESTMENTS IN BOTH FIXED-RATE AND FLOATING-RATE INTEREST-EARNING INSTRUMENTS CARRY VARYING DEGREES OF INTEREST RATE RISK. THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF OUR FIXED-RATE SECURITIES MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED DUE TO A RISE IN INTEREST RATES. IN GENERAL, SECURITIES WITH LONGER MATURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER INTEREST-RATE RISK THAN THOSE WITH SHORTER MATURITIES. WHILE FLOATING RATE SECURITIES GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT TO LESS INTEREST-RATE RISK THAN FIXED-RATE SECURITIES, FLOATING-RATE SECURITIES MAY PRODUCE LESS INCOME THAN EXPECTED IF INTEREST RATES DECREASE. DUE IN PART TO THESE FACTORS, OUR INVESTMENT INCOME MAY FALL SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS OR WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES IN PRINCIPAL IF SECURITIES ARE SOLD THAT HAVE DECLINED IN MARKET VALUE DUE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. AS OF DECEMBER&NBSP;31, 2004, OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS EARNED A PRETAX YIELD OF APPROXIMATELY 1.7%, WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF SIX MONTHS. IF INTEREST RATES WERE TO INSTANTANEOUSLY INCREASE (DECREASE) BY 100&NBSP;BASIS POINTS, THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE TOTAL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COULD DECREASE (INCREASE) BY APPROXIMATELY $16.8&NBSP;MILLION. </DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT; MARGIN-LEFT: 0; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0; COLOR: #000000; BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF;">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP; WE ENTERED INTO TWO INTEREST RATE SWAPS ON JUNE 19 AND JULY&NBSP;20, 2000, WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS TOTALING $95&NBSP;MILLION TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES ON A PORTION OF THE FLOATING RATE OPERATING LEASE FOR OUR SAN&NBSP;JOSE HEADQUARTERS OFFICE FACILITIES. THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS ALLOW US TO RECEIVE FLOATING RATE RECEIPTS BASED ON THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE, OR LIBOR, IN EXCHANGE FOR MAKING FIXED RATE PAYMENTS WHICH EFFECTIVELY CHANGES OUR INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE ON OUR OPERATING LEASE FROM A FLOATING RATE TO A FIXED RATE ON $95&NBSP;MILLION OF THE TOTAL $126.4&NBSP;MILLION NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF OUR SAN&NBSP;JOSE HEADQUARTERS FACILITY LEASE COMMITMENT.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS OF DECEMBER&NBSP;31, 2004 WAS AN UNREALIZED LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $662,000, NET OF TAX BENEFIT, AND IS RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS ON THE BALANCE SHEET.
