DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS CERTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, SUCH AS STATEMENTS OF EBAY'S PLANS, OBJECTIVES, EXPECTATIONS AND INTENTIONS. WHEN USED IN THIS DOCUMENT, THE WORDS "EXPECTS," "ANTICIPATES," "INTENDS" AND "PLANS" AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS ARE INTENDED TO IDENTIFY CERTAIN OF THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS MADE IN THIS DOCUMENT SHOULD BE READ AS BEING APPLICABLE TO ALL RELATED FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WHEREVER THEY APPEAR IN THIS DOCUMENT. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE DISCUSSED IN THIS DOCUMENT. FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO SUCH DIFFERENCES INCLUDE THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW. OVERVIEW WE PIONEERED ONLINE PERSON-TO-PERSON TRADING BY DEVELOPING A GLOBAL ONLINE TRADING PLATFORM THAT WILL HELP PRACTICALLY ANYONE BUY OR SELL PRACTICALLY ANYTHING. OUR SERVICE PERMITS SELLERS TO LIST ITEMS FOR SALE, BUYERS TO BID ON ITEMS OF INTEREST AND ALL EBAY USERS TO BROWSE THROUGH LISTED ITEMS IN A FULLY-AUTOMATED, TOPICALLY-ARRANGED, INTUITIVE AND EASY-TO-USE ONLINE SERVICE THAT IS AVAILABLE 24 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. WE HAVE EXTENDED OUR ONLINE OFFERINGS TO INCLUDE REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL TRADING, AUTOS, "PREMIUM" PRICED ITEMS, AND THROUGH OUR ACQUISITION OF HALF.COM AND OUR RECENTLY INTRODUCED "BUY IT NOW" FEATURE, WE NOW OFFER FIXED-PRICE FUNCTIONALITY. ADDITIONALLY, BILLPOINT PROVIDES ONLINE BILLING AND PAYMENT SOLUTIONS. WE ALSO EXPANDED INTO THE TRADITIONAL AUCTION BUSINESS, ALSO CALLED OFFLINE TRADING, WITH OUR ACQUISITIONS OF BUTTERFIELDS AND KRUSE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR REVENUES COME FROM FEES AND COMMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ONLINE AND OFFLINE TRADING SERVICES. ONLINE REVENUE IS PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM PLACEMENT FEES, SUCCESS FEES, COMMISSIONS PAID BY SELLERS, AND COMMISSIONS PAID BY BUYERS FOR "PREMIUM" PRICED ITEMS. SELLERS PAY A NOMINAL PLACEMENT FEE, AND BY PAYING ADDITIONAL FEES, SELLERS CAN HAVE ITEMS FEATURED IN VARIOUS WAYS. SELLERS ALSO PAY A SUCCESS FEE BASED ON THE FINAL PURCHASE PRICE. IN ADDITION, WE RECEIVE REVENUES FROM END-TO-END SERVICE PROVIDERS WHOSE SERVICES INCREASE THE VELOCITY OF TRANSACTIONS TO THE SITE, REVENUES FROM COMMERCIAL ALLIANCES DESIGNED TO BUILD OUT A CATEGORY OR OTHER FUNCTIONS AND FROM DIRECT ADVERTISING WHICH INCLUDES PROMOTIONAL PAYMENTS FROM UNRELATED THIRD PARTIES. ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT THESE END-TO-END, COMMERCIAL ALLIANCE AND DIRECT ADVERTISING REVENUES TO INCREASE IN THE FUTURE, THEY ARE SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY. SEE "RISK FACTORS -- OUR REVENUE FROM END-TO-END SERVICE PROVIDERS, COMMERCIAL ALLIANCES AND ADVERTISING IS SUBJECT TO FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL." TO DATE, ONLINE PAYMENT SOLUTIONS PROVIDED BY BILLPOINT AND FIXED PRICE TRADING PROVIDED BY HALF.COM HAVE NOT MADE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO NET REVENUES, ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT BILLPOINT'S AND HALF.COM'S REVENUES TO INCREASE IN THE FUTURE. OFFLINE REVENUE IS DERIVED FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES INCLUDING SELLERS' COMMISSIONS, BUYERS' PREMIUMS, BIDDER REGISTRATION FEES, AND AUCTION-RELATED SERVICES INCLUDING APPRAISAL AND AUTHENTICATION. WE EXPECT THAT THE ONLINE BUSINESS WILL CONTINUE TO REPRESENT THE MAJORITY OF REVENUE GROWTH IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. ACQUISITIONS HALF.COM ON JULY 11, 2000, WE ACQUIRED HALF.COM. HALF.COM PROVIDES A FIXED-PRICE, PERSON-TO-PERSON E-COMMERCE SITE ALLOWING PEOPLE TO BUY AND SELL PREVIOUSLY OWNED GOODS AT DISCOUNTED PRICES. IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, WE ISSUED, OR RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE, A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 5,484,000 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO HALF.COM'S EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS, OPTION HOLDERS AND WARRANT HOLDERS. THE MERGER HAS BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING-OF-INTERESTS. INTERNET AUCTION ON FEBRUARY 15, 2001, WE ACQUIRED A MAJORITY INTEREST IN INTERNET AUCTION CO., LTD., A SOUTH KOREAN COMPANY("INTERNET AUCTION"). INTERNET AUCTION INTRODUCED PERSON-TO-PERSON TRADING IN KOREA WHEN IT 24 <PAGE> 26 LAUNCHED IN APRIL 1998. INTERNET AUCTION IS LISTED ON THE KOSDAQ AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO TRADE ON KOSDAQ. WE ACQUIRED 6,274,795 OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF INTERNET AUCTION, SLIGHTLY MORE THAN 50%, AT A FIXED PRICE OF 24,000 KOREAN WON PER SHARE OR APPROXIMATELY $120 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE. THE TRANSACTION WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND ACCORDINGLY, THE PURCHASE PRICE WILL BE ALLOCATED TO THE TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED ON THE BASIS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES ON THE ACQUISITION DATE. IBAZAR S.A. ON FEBRUARY 21, 2001, WE SIGNED A BINDING AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE IBAZAR S.A. (IBAZAR). IBAZAR IS BASED IN PARIS AND INTRODUCED ONLINE, PERSON-TO-PERSON TRADING IN FRANCE WHEN IT LAUNCHED IN OCTOBER 1998. CURRENTLY, IBAZAR HAS WEBSITES IN BELGIUM, BRAZIL, FRANCE, ITALY, THE NETHERLANDS, PORTUGAL, SPAIN, AND SWEDEN. AS CONSIDERATION FOR 100% OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF IBAZAR, WE WILL ISSUE APPROXIMATELY 2,250,000 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, SUBJECT TO A MINIMUM VALUATION OF APPROXIMATELY $66 MILLION AND A MAXIMUM VALUATION OF APPROXIMATELY $112 MILLION, BASED ON THE VALUE OF OUR STOCK AT CLOSING. THE ACQUISITION WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATION AND IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REGULATORY APPROVALS. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH, FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED, CERTAIN DATA FROM OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUES. THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE TABLE BELOW SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. <TABLE> <CAPTION> YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, ----------------------- 1998 1999 2000 ----- ----- ----- <S> <C> <C> <C> NET REVENUES................................................ 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% COST OF NET REVENUES........................................ 18.7 25.6 22.1 ----- ----- ----- GROSS PROFIT...................................... 81.3 74.4 77.9 ----- ----- ----- OPERATING EXPENSES: SALES AND MARKETING....................................... 41.8 42.8 38.7 PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT....................................... 5.4 11.1 12.9 GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE................................ 18.4 19.5 16.9 PAYROLL EXPENSE ON EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS................. -- -- 0.5 AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES...................... 0.9 0.5 0.3 MERGER RELATED COSTS...................................... -- 1.9 0.4 ----- ----- ----- TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES.......................... 66.5 75.8 69.7 ----- ----- ----- INCOME/(LOSS) FROM OPERATIONS............................... 14.8 (1.4) 8.2 INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET.............................. 2.2 10.6 10.7 INTEREST EXPENSE............................................

ALTHOUGH ACCURATE REVENUE FORECASTS ARE DIFFICULT, WE HAVE BEGUN TO RECOGNIZE THE SEASONAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS BECAUSE MANY OF OUR USERS REDUCE THEIR ACTIVITIES ON OUR WEBSITE DURING THE THANKSGIVING AND CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS AND WITH THE ONSET OF GOOD WEATHER. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED OUR STRONGEST QUARTER OF ONLINE GROWTH IN OUR FIRST FISCAL QUARTER, ALTHOUGH OUR SHIFT TO MORE "PRACTICAL" ITEMS MAY CAUSE OUR SEASONAL PATTERNS TO LOOK MORE LIKE A TYPICAL RETAILER. BOTH BUTTERFIELDS AND KRUSE HAVE SIGNIFICANT QUARTER-TO-QUARTER VARIATIONS IN THEIR RESULTS OF 25 <PAGE> 27 OPERATIONS DEPENDING ON THE TIMING OF AUCTIONS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF HIGH QUALITY ITEMS FROM LARGE COLLECTIONS AND ESTATES. BUTTERFIELDS TYPICALLY HAS ITS BEST OPERATING RESULTS IN THE TRADITIONAL FALL AND SPRING AUCTION SEASONS AND HAS HISTORICALLY INCURRED OPERATING LOSSES IN THE FIRST AND THIRD QUARTERS. KRUSE TYPICALLY SEES A SEASONAL PEAK IN OPERATIONS IN THE THIRD QUARTER. SEASONAL OR CYCLICAL VARIATIONS IN OUR BUSINESS MAY BECOME MORE PRONOUNCED OVER TIME AND MAY HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE. DUE TO THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY IN FORECASTING NET REVENUES, IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO FORECAST INCOME STATEMENT EXPENSE CATEGORIES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUES. QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL INCOME STATEMENT EXPENSE CATEGORIES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUES MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM HISTORICAL OR PROJECTED RATES. AS A GENERAL NOTE, WE EXPECT COSTS TO INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS ACROSS ALL INCOME STATEMENT CATEGORIES. TO A LARGE EXTENT, THE CHANGES IN THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED ARE DUE TO THE GROWTH OF THE ONLINE BUSINESS, WHICH WILL BE THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF OUR YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISONS. NET REVENUES WE DERIVE REVENUE FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES INCLUDING: LISTING, SUCCESS AND FEATURED ITEM FEES, END-TO-END SERVICES, COMMERCIAL ALLIANCES, SPONSORSHIPS AND OTHER ADVERTISING. IN ADDITION, WE DERIVE COMMISSIONS AND RENTAL INCOME FROM OUR TRADITIONAL OFFLINE AUCTION OPERATIONS. OUR NET REVENUES INCREASED FROM $86.1 MILLION TO $224.7 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 AND 1999 AND FURTHER INCREASED TO $431.4 MILLION IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000. THE SUCCESSIVE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH FROM 1998 THROUGH 2000 WAS PREDOMINANTLY THE RESULT OF INCREASED USE OF OUR WEBSITE, REFLECTED IN THE GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF REGISTERED USERS, LISTINGS AND GROSS MERCHANDISE SALES. WE EXPECT THAT FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH WILL BE LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE GROWTH OF ONLINE SERVICES INCLUDING END-TO-END SERVICES, COMMERCIAL ALLIANCE REVENUES AND DIRECT ADVERTISING. THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN ("SAB") NO. 101, "REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS." AS IT RELATES TO EBAY, SAB 101 REQUIRES THAT LISTING AND FEATURED ITEM FEE REVENUE BE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE ESTIMATED PERIOD OF THE AUCTION. WE IMPLEMENTED SAB 101 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2000, AND THE EFFECT WAS INSIGNIFICANT. COST OF NET REVENUES COST OF NET REVENUES FOR ONLINE OPERATIONS CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND SITE OPERATIONS. THE COSTS INCLUDED ARE COMPENSATION, EMPLOYEE AND FACILITIES COSTS FOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND SITE OPERATIONS PERSONNEL, ISP CONNECTIVITY CHARGES AND DEPRECIATION ON SITE EQUIPMENT. COST OF NET REVENUES IN TRADITIONAL AUCTION OPERATIONS PRIMARILY INCLUDES COMPENSATION FOR AUCTION, APPRAISAL, AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT PERSONNEL AND DIRECT AUCTION COSTS, SUCH AS EVENT SITE RENTAL. COST OF NET REVENUES INCREASED FROM $16.1 MILLION OR 18.7% OF NET REVENUES TO $57.6 MILLION OR 25.6% OF NET REVENUES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 AND 1999 AND FURTHER INCREASED IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS BUT DECREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES TO $95.5 MILLION OR 22.1% OF NET REVENUES IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000. THE SUCCESSIVE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH FROM 1998 THROUGH 2000 WAS DUE ALMOST ENTIRELY TO OUR ONLINE BUSINESS, INCLUDING OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS OUR ACQUISITION OF BILLPOINT IN 1999 AND HALF.COM IN 2000. THE INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS IN EXPENDITURES FOR THE ONLINE SERVICE RESULTED FROM THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION OF OUR CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND SITE OPERATIONS DEPARTMENTS, DEPRECIATION OF THE EQUIPMENT REQUIRED FOR SITE OPERATIONS, SOFTWARE LICENSING FEES AND ISP CONNECTIVITY CHARGES. THE DECREASE IN COST OF NET REVENUES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE FROM 1999 TO 2000 RESULTED FROM COST MANAGEMENT IN CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND SITE OPERATIONS AND INCREASES IN HIGHER GROSS MARGIN BUSINESSES SUCH AS AUTOS AND END-TO-END TRADING SOLUTIONS. AS A RESULT OF THESE EFFICIENCIES, WE EXPECT THE COST OF NET REVENUES TO INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS BUT DECREASE AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUES IN 2001. SALES AND MARKETING OUR SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES FOR BOTH THE ONLINE AND TRADITIONAL AUCTION BUSINESSES ARE COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF COMPENSATION FOR OUR SALES AND MARKETING PERSONNEL, ADVERTISING, TRADESHOW AND OTHER PROMOTIONAL COSTS, EMPLOYEE AND FACILITIES COSTS. SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES INCREASED FROM $36.0 MILLION OR 41.8% OF NET REVENUES TO $96.2 MILLION OR 42.8% OF NET REVENUES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 AND 1999 AND 26 <PAGE> 28 FURTHER INCREASED IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS BUT DECREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES TO $166.8 MILLION OR 38.7% OF NET REVENUES IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000. THE SUCCESSIVE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH FROM 1998 THROUGH 2000 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF GROWTH IN ONLINE AND TRADITIONAL ADVERTISING, INCLUDING EXPENSES FOR VARIOUS MARKETING AGREEMENTS, PERSONNEL RELATED COSTS, COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF OUTSIDE SERVICES AND CONSULTANTS AND MISCELLANEOUS USER AND PROMOTIONAL COSTS. ONLINE SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS FOR 2001 AS WE PLAN TO BUILD THE EBAY BRAND MORE BROADLY. WE EXPECT TO BUILD OUR BRAND FURTHER WITH CONTINUED ADVERTISING IMPRESSIONS DELIVERED UNDER THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH AMERICA ONLINE ("AOL"), AUTOTRADER.COM AND GO.COM (A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY) AN INCREASE IN MASS MEDIA ADVERTISING AND THE EXPANSION OF INTERNATIONAL ADVERTISING. SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES IN THE TRADITIONAL AUCTION BUSINESSES ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN COMPARABLE WITH HISTORICAL LEVELS. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF COMPENSATION FOR OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT STAFF, PAYMENTS TO OUTSIDE CONTRACTORS, DEPRECIATION ON EQUIPMENT USED FOR DEVELOPMENT, EMPLOYEE AND FACILITIES COSTS. OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED FROM $4.6 MILLION OR 5.4% OF NET REVENUES TO $24.8 MILLION OR 11.1% OF NET REVENUES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 AND 1999 AND FURTHER INCREASED TO $55.9 MILLION OR 12.9 % OF NET REVENUES IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000. THE SUCCESSIVE YEAR OVER YEAR GROWTH FROM 1998 THROUGH 2000 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN PERSONNEL-RELATED COSTS AS WE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE SIZE OF OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT STAFF, EXPENSES RELATED TO CONTRACTORS AND CONSULTANTS EMPLOYED WITHIN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENTS, AND MAINTENANCE AND DEPRECIATION FOR EQUIPMENT USED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE ALSO RESULTED FROM THE ADDITION OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS AT BILLPOINT IN 1999 AND HALF.COM IN 2000 INCLUDING A ONE-TIME, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AT HALF.COM RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS DURING FUTURE PERIODS PRIMARILY FROM PERSONNEL ADDITIONS, THE CONTINUED IMPACT OF BILLPOINT AND HALF.COM PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, ADDITIONAL DEPRECIATION COSTS AS WE CONTINUE TO PURCHASE EQUIPMENT TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND OPERATIONS BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY AND EXPECTED AMORTIZATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PHASED ROLLOUT OF OUR NEXT GENERATION THREE-TIER ARCHITECTURE. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF COMPENSATION FOR PERSONNEL AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, FEES FOR EXTERNAL PROFESSIONAL ADVISORS, PROVISIONS FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, EMPLOYEE AND FACILITIES COSTS. OUR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED FROM $15.8 MILLION OR 18.4% OF NET REVENUES TO $43.9 MILLION OR 19.5% OF NET REVENUES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 AND 1999 AND INCREASED IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS BUT DECREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES TO $73.0 MILLION OR 16.9% OF NET REVENUES IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASES RESULTED FROM GROWTH IN PERSONNEL-RELATED EXPENSES IN ORDER TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF OUR EXPANDING BUSINESS, INCLUDING OPERATIONS IN NEW COUNTRIES AND THE INTEGRATION OF NEW BUSINESSES, FEES FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, EMPLOYEE AND FACILITIES COSTS. WE EXPECT THAT GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WILL INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS IN FUTURE PERIODS AS WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS NECESSARY FOR OUR BUSINESS. PAYROLL EXPENSE ON EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS WE ARE SUBJECT TO EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAXES ON EMPLOYEE EXERCISES OF NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS. THESE EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAXES ARE RECORDED AS A CHARGE TO OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD SUCH OPTIONS ARE EXERCISED AND SOLD BASED ON ACTUAL GAINS REALIZED BY EMPLOYEES. OUR QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS COULD VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE ACTUAL PERIOD THAT THE STOCK OPTIONS ARE EXERCISED BY EMPLOYEES AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE AMOUNT OF EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAXES ASSESSED. 27 <PAGE> 29 AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FROM TIME TO TIME WE HAVE PURCHASED, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE PURCHASING, ASSETS OR BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR LEADERSHIP ROLE IN ONLINE TRADING. THESE PURCHASES MAY RESULT IN THE CREATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND LEAD TO A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE AMORTIZATION IN THE RELATED PERIODS. OUR AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCREASED IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS FROM $805,000 OR 0.9% OF NET REVENUES TO $1.1 MILLION OR 0.5% OF NET REVENUES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 AND 1999 AND FURTHER INCREASED IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS TO $1.4 MILLION OR 0.3% OF NET REVENUES IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000. WE EXPECT THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO INCREASE IN 2001 DUE TO OUR RECENT ACQUISITION OF INTERNET AUCTION IN KOREA AND OUR AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE IBAZAR S.A. BOTH ACQUISITIONS WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. MERGER-RELATED COSTS IN 1999, EBAY INCURRED DIRECT MERGER RELATED TRANSACTION COSTS OF $4.4 MILLION WHICH WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE ACQUISITIONS OF BILLPOINT, BUTTERFIELDS, KRUSE AND ALANDO.DE.AG. IN 2000, EBAY INCURRED DIRECT MERGER TRANSACTION COSTS OF $1.6 MILLION PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF HALF.COM. THERE WERE NO COMPARABLE EXPENSES FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 1998. AS OPPORTUNITIES PRESENT THEMSELVES, EBAY MAY CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE NEW COMPANIES; SUCH ACQUISITIONS COULD LEAD TO ADDITIONAL DIRECT AND INDIRECT EXPENSES WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT EBAY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET CONSISTS OF INTEREST EARNED ON CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS OFFSET BY FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS OR LOSSES. OUR INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET INCREASED FROM $1.8 MILLION OR 2.2% OF NET REVENUES TO $23.8 MILLION OR 10.6% OF NET REVENUES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 AND 1999 AND INCREASED TO $46.3 MILLION OR 10.7% OF NET REVENUES IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASES RESULTED FROM INTEREST EARNED ON CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS. WE EXPECT INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME WILL CONTINUE TO EXCEED INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2001. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES OUR EFFECTIVE FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX RATES WERE 39.7%, 47.0%, AND 40.4% IN THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1999 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. THE TAX RATES IN 1998 AND 1999 INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF OUR ACQUISITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, WE RECEIVE TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR GAINS REALIZED BY EMPLOYEES ON THE EXERCISE OF NON- QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS FOR WHICH THE BENEFIT IS RECOGNIZED AS A COMPONENT OF PAID-IN CAPITAL. WE HAVE PROVIDED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RELATING TO THESE STOCK OPTION DEDUCTIONS. PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION BY EBAY IN 1999, BUTTERFIELDS WAS TAXED AS AN S CORPORATION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION, BUTTERFIELDS' STATUS AS AN S CORPORATION WAS TERMINATED, AND BUTTERFIELDS BECAME SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAXES. THE SUPPLEMENTAL PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDES AN INCREASE TO THE PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES BASED UPON A COMBINED FEDERAL AND STATE TAX RATE. THIS RATE APPROXIMATES THE STATUTORY TAX RATE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN APPLIED IF BUTTERFIELDS WERE TAXED AS A C CORPORATION PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN CONNECTION WITH GRANTING CERTAIN STOCK OPTIONS FROM MAY 1997 THROUGH MAY 1999, WE RECORDED AGGREGATE UNEARNED COMPENSATION TOTALING $13.1 MILLION, WHICH IS BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE FOUR-YEAR VESTING PERIOD OF THE OPTIONS. IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED BETWEEN JULY 1999 AND MARCH 2000 BY COMPANIES THAT WE SUBSEQUENTLY ACQUIRED, WE RECORDED UNEARNED COMPENSATION TOTALING $4.9 MILLION. OF THE TOTAL UNEARNED STOCK COMPENSATION, APPROXIMATELY $3.1 MILLION, $4.8 MILLION AND $7.1 MILLION WAS AMORTIZED IN 1998, 1999 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. OF THE AMORTIZATION IN 2000, APPROXIMATELY $4.8 WAS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF HALF.COM. WE EXPECT ADDITIONAL AMORTIZATION OF UNEARNED STOCK COMPENSATION AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF INTERNET AUCTION AND POTENTIAL ACQUISITION OF IBAZAR S.A. 28 <PAGE> 30 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES SINCE INCEPTION, EBAY HAS FINANCED OPERATIONS PRIMARILY FROM NET CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. WE OBTAINED ADDITIONAL FINANCING FROM THE SALE OF PREFERRED STOCK AND WARRANTS, PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF THOSE WARRANTS, PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS, AND PROCEEDS FROM OUR INITIAL AND FOLLOW-ON PUBLIC OFFERINGS. NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $6.0 MILLION IN 1998, $62.9 MILLION IN 1999 AND $100.1 MILLION IN 2000. NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM OUR NET INCOME BEFORE NON-CASH CHARGES FOR DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AND CHANGES IN ACCRUED EXPENSES OFFSET BY CHANGES IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND OTHER ASSETS. NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $53.0 MILLION IN 1998, $603.4 MILLION IN 1999, AND $206.1 MILLION IN 2000. THE PRIMARY USE FOR INVESTED CASH IN THE PERIODS PRESENTED WAS PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS, PROPERTY, AND EQUIPMENT. NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $72.2 MILLION IN 1998, $725.0 MILLION IN 1999, AND $86.0 MILLION IN 2000. WE REMAINED CASH FLOW POSITIVE FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR PUBLIC OFFERING IN 1998 AND OUR SUBSEQUENT FOLLOW-ON OFFERING IN 1999. TO A LESSER EXTENT, FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCLUDED THE SALE OF COMMON STOCK UNDER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. IN 2000, NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK TO THIRD PARTIES BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES. WE HAD NO MATERIAL COMMITMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, BUT EXPECT SUCH EXPENDITURES TO APPROXIMATE $86.0 MILLION DURING 2001 WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ANY ACQUISITIONS. OF THE $86.0 MILLION, APPROXIMATELY $20.0 MILLION HAS BEEN COMMITTED FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATING TO HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR NEW ARCHITECTURE. THE REMAINING BALANCE WILL BE USED PRIMARILY FOR COMPUTER EQUIPMENT, FURNITURE AND FIXTURES AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS. WE ALSO HAVE TOTAL MINIMUM LEASE OBLIGATIONS OF $43.9 MILLION UNDER CERTAIN NONCANCELLABLE OPERATING LEASES AND NOTES PAYABLE OBLIGATIONS OF $26.7 MILLION THROUGH AUGUST 2023. UNDER OUR AGREEMENT WITH AOL, WE WILL PAY AOL $75 MILLION OVER THE FOUR-YEAR TERM OF THE CONTRACT. TO DATE, WE HAVE PAID $37.5 MILLION ON THE CONTRACT. IN FEBRUARY 2000, WE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT WITH GO.COM. IN CONSIDERATION FOR THIS AGREEMENT, WE WILL PAY A MINIMUM OF $30 MILLION TO GO.COM OVER THE FOUR-YEAR TERM. IN 2001, DISNEY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS DISSOLVING GO.COM; CONSEQUENTLY, EBAY IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF RENEGOTIATING NEW CONTRACT TERMS WITH DISNEY. WE BELIEVE THAT EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS, AND ANY CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. HOWEVER, IF DURING THAT PERIOD OR THEREAFTER WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN GENERATING SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS OR IN RAISING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL WHEN REQUIRED IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS AND ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, OUR BUSINESS COULD SUFFER. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS IN JUNE 1998, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ("FASB") ISSUED SFAS NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES." SFAS NO. 133 ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EMBEDDED IN OTHER CONTRACTS, AND FOR HEDGING ACTIVITIES. IN JUNE 1999, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 137, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES -- DEFERRAL OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 133," WHICH DEFERRED THE EFFECTIVE DATE UNTIL THE FIRST FISCAL YEAR ENDING ON OR AFTER JUNE 30, 2000. IN JUNE 2000, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS STATEMENT NO. 138, "ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND CERTAIN HEDGING ACTIVITIES-AN AMENDMENT OF SFAS 133." SFAS NO. 138 AMENDS CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SFAS 133. SFAS 133 REQUIRES THAT ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS BE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION. THE ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE (I.E., GAINS OR LOSSES) OF A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT DEPENDS ON WHETHER IT HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AND QUALIFIES AS PART OF A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP AND FURTHER, ON THE TYPE OF HEDGING RELATIONSHIP. WE WILL ADOPT SFAS NO. 133, AS AMENDED, IN OUR QUARTER ENDING MARCH 31, 2001. UPON ADOPTION, THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT TO NET INCOME AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF THIS 29 <PAGE> 31 CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING METHOD IS A GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY $650,000 AND A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $2.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, NET OF TAX. IN JULY 2000, THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ("EITF") REACHED A CONSENSUS WITH RESPECT TO EITF ISSUE NO. 99-19, "REPORTING REVENUE GROSS AS A PRINCIPAL VERSUS NET AS AN AGENT." EITF 99-19 ADDRESSED WHETHER A COMPANY SHOULD REPORT REVENUE BASED ON THE GROSS AMOUNT BILLED TO A CUSTOMER BECAUSE IT HAS EARNED REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF THE GOODS OR SERVICES OR THE NET AMOUNT RETAINED (THAT IS, THE AMOUNT BILLED TO THE CUSTOMER LESS THE AMOUNT PAID TO A SUPPLIER) BECAUSE IT HAS EARNED A COMMISSION OR FEE. WE ADOPTED EITF 99-19, AND SUCH ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN MARCH 2000, THE EITF REACHED A CONSENSUS ON EITF ISSUE NO. 00-14, "ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN SALES INCENTIVES." THIS CONSENSUS PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON THE RECOGNITION, MEASUREMENT, AND INCOME STATEMENT CLASSIFICATION OF SALES INCENTIVES WHICH ARE OFFERED VOLUNTARILY BY A VENDOR WITHOUT CHARGE TO CUSTOMERS THAT CAN BE USED IN, OR THAT ARE EXERCISABLE BY A CUSTOMER AS A RESULT OF, A SINGLE EXCHANGE TRANSACTION. WE EVALUATED THE PROVISIONS OF THE GUIDANCE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR POLICIES AND CONCLUDED THAT WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PRONOUNCEMENT. IN JULY 2000, THE EITF ISSUED EITF ISSUE NO. 00-15, "CLASSIFICATION IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS OF THE INCOME TAX BENEFIT REALIZED BY A COMPANY UPON EMPLOYEE EXERCISE OF A NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION." EITF 00-15 ADDRESSES THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT PRESENTATION OF THE TAX BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXERCISE OF NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS. WE RECEIVE AN INCOME TAX DEDUCTION FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EXERCISE PRICE AND THE MARKET PRICE OF A NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION UPON EXERCISE BY THE EMPLOYEE. EITF 00-15 CONCLUDES THAT THE INCOME TAX BENEFIT REALIZED BY US UPON EMPLOYEE EXERCISE SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED IN THE OPERATING SECTION OF THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT. THE EITF IS EFFECTIVE FOR ALL QUARTERS ENDING AFTER JULY 20, 2000. WE ADOPTED EITF 00-15, AND SUCH ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN JULY 2000, THE EITF ISSUED EITF ISSUE NO. 00-16, "RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAXES ON EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION." THIS ISSUE ADDRESSES HOW AN ENTITY SHOULD ACCOUNT FOR EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAXES ON STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION UNDER ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD OPINION NO. 25, "ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES," AND SFAS NO. 123, "ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION." THIS ISSUE ADDRESSES OUR TIMING FOR RECOGNIZING OUR PAYROLL TAX LIABILITY AND REQUIRES THAT THIS LIABILITY BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE TAX OBLIGATION IS DUE AND PAYABLE. WE ADOPTED EITF 00-16 EFFECTIVE JULY 31, 2000. SUCH ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. RISK FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES FACING EBAY. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY DEEM IMMATERIAL ALSO MAY IMPAIR OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS OR SUCH OTHER RISKS ACTUALLY OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED. WE HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY OUR COMPANY WAS FORMED AS A SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP IN SEPTEMBER 1995 AND WAS INCORPORATED IN MAY 1996. WE HAVE ONLY A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY ON WHICH YOU CAN BASE AN EVALUATION OF OUR BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS. AS AN ONLINE COMMERCE COMPANY STILL RELATIVELY EARLY IN OUR DEVELOPMENT, WE FACE SUBSTANTIAL RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, EXPENSES AND DIFFICULTIES. TO ADDRESS THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES MUST DO THE FOLLOWING: - MAINTAIN AND INCREASE OUR NUMBER OF REGISTERED USERS, ITEMS LISTED ON OUR SERVICE AND COMPLETED SALES; - EXPAND INTO NEW AREAS; - MAINTAIN AND GROW OUR WEBSITE AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT OPERATIONS AT A REASONABLE COST; - CONTINUE TO MAKE TRADING THROUGH OUR SERVICE SAFER FOR USERS; - MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE OUR BRAND; - CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS; 30 <PAGE> 32 - CONTINUE TO ENHANCE AND EXPAND OUR SERVICE TO MEET THE CHANGING REQUIREMENTS OF OUR USERS; - PROVIDE SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE; - REMAIN ATTRACTIVE TO OUR COMMERCIAL PARTNERS; - RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE DEVELOPMENTS; AND - ATTRACT, INTEGRATE, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH ONE OR MORE OF THESE GOALS, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR BUSINESS TO SUFFER. IN ADDITION, ACCOMPLISHING ONE OR MORE OF THESE GOALS MIGHT BE VERY EXPENSIVE, WHICH COULD HARM OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE OUR OPERATING RESULTS HAVE VARIED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS DURING OUR OPERATING HISTORY. OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL. FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: - OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN AN ACTIVE USER BASE, TO ATTRACT NEW USERS WHO LIST ITEMS FOR SALE AND WHO PURCHASE ITEMS THROUGH OUR SERVICE AND TO MAINTAIN CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; - OUR ABILITY TO KEEP OUR WEBSITE OPERATIONAL AND TO MANAGE THE NUMBER OF ITEMS LISTED ON OUR SERVICE; - THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF OPERATING COSTS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATING TO THE MAINTENANCE AND EXPANSION OF OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE; - FOREIGN, FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGULATION, INCLUDING INVESTIGATIONS PROMPTED BY ITEMS IMPROPERLY LISTED OR SOLD BY OUR USERS; - THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW SITES, SERVICES AND PRODUCTS BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS; - VOLUME, SIZE, TIMING AND COMPLETION RATE OF TRADES ON OUR WEBSITES; - CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN THE SECURITY OF TRANSACTIONS ON OUR WEBSITES; - OUR ABILITY TO UPGRADE AND DEVELOP OUR SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO ACCOMMODATE GROWTH; - TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES OR SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS; - OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW PERSONNEL IN A TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE MANNER; - OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES IN BOTH OUR ONLINE BUSINESSES AND OUR ACQUISITIONS; - OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE AND MANAGE OUR ACQUISITIONS; - OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY EXPAND OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS INVOLVING FIXED PRICE TRADING; - THE ABILITY OF OUR LAND-BASED AUCTION BUSINESSES TO ACQUIRE HIGH QUALITY PROPERTIES FOR AUCTION; - THE TIMING, COST AND AVAILABILITY OF ADVERTISING IN TRADITIONAL MEDIA AND ON OTHER WEBSITES AND ONLINE SERVICES; - THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS TO US AND OF MARKETING AND OTHER EXPENSES UNDER EXISTING AND FUTURE CONTRACTS; - CONSUMER TRENDS AND POPULARITY OF SOME CATEGORIES OF COLLECTIBLE ITEMS; - THE SUCCESS OF OUR BRAND BUILDING AND MARKETING CAMPAIGNS; - THE LEVEL OF USE OF THE INTERNET AND ONLINE SERVICES; - INCREASING CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE OF THE INTERNET AND OTHER ONLINE SERVICES FOR COMMERCE AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE TRADING OF PRODUCTS SUCH AS THOSE LISTED ON OUR WEBSITES; AND 31 <PAGE> 33 - GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS SPECIFIC TO THE INTERNET AND E-COMMERCE INDUSTRIES. OUR LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY AND GROWING COMPETITION MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO FORECAST THE LEVEL OR SOURCE OF OUR REVENUES OR EARNINGS ACCURATELY. WE BELIEVE THAT PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY NOT BE MEANINGFUL, AND YOU SHOULD NOT RELY UPON THEM AS AN INDICATION OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE. WE DO NOT HAVE BACKLOG, AND ALMOST ALL OF OUR NET REVENUES EACH QUARTER COME FROM TRANSACTIONS FOR ITEMS THAT ARE LISTED AND SOLD DURING THAT QUARTER. OUR OPERATING RESULTS IN ONE OR MORE FUTURE QUARTERS MAY FALL BELOW THE EXPECTATIONS OF SECURITIES ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS. IN THAT EVENT, THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY DECLINE. OUR FAILURE TO MANAGE GROWTH COULD HARM US WE CURRENTLY ARE EXPERIENCING A PERIOD OF EXPANSION IN OUR HEADCOUNT, FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE, AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT FURTHER EXPANSION WILL BE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL GROWTH IN OUR CUSTOMER BASE AND NUMBER OF LISTINGS AS WELL AS OUR EXPANSION INTO NEW GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, TYPES OF GOODS AND ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF SALE. THIS EXPANSION HAS PLACED, AND WE EXPECT IT WILL CONTINUE TO PLACE, A SIGNIFICANT STRAIN ON OUR MANAGEMENT, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. THE AREAS THAT ARE PUT UNDER STRAIN BY OUR GROWTH INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: - THE WEBSITES. WE MUST CONSTANTLY ADD NEW HARDWARE, UPDATE SOFTWARE AND ADD NEW ENGINEERING PERSONNEL TO ACCOMMODATE THE INCREASED USE OF OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES' WEBSITES AND THE NEW PRODUCTS AND FEATURES WE ARE REGULARLY INTRODUCING. THIS IS EXPENSIVE AND THE INCREASED COMPLEXITY OF OUR WEBSITES INCREASES THE COST OF ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF OUR SYSTEMS AT LEAST AS FAST AS THE GROWTH IN DEMAND FOR THIS CAPACITY, OUR WEBSITES MAY BECOME UNSTABLE AND MAY CEASE TO OPERATE FOR PERIODS OF TIME. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED PERIODIC UNSCHEDULED DOWNTIME. CONTINUED UNSCHEDULED DOWNTIME WOULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND ALSO COULD ANGER USERS OF OUR WEBSITE AND REDUCE FUTURE REVENUES. - CUSTOMER SUPPORT. WE ARE EXPANDING OUR CUSTOMER SUPPORT OPERATIONS TO ACCOMMODATE THE INCREASED NUMBER OF USERS AND TRANSACTIONS ON OUR WEBSITES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE AND SUCCESSFULLY TRAIN SUFFICIENT EMPLOYEES OR CONTRACTORS IN THIS AREA IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER, USERS OF OUR WEBSITES MAY HAVE NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES, AND CURRENT AND FUTURE REVENUES COULD SUFFER OR OUR MARGINS MAY DECREASE. - CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS. OUR REVENUES ARE DEPENDENT ON PROMPT AND ACCURATE BILLING PROCESSES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO GROW OUR TRANSACTION PROCESSING ABILITIES TO ACCOMMODATE THE INCREASING NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS THAT MUST BE BILLED, OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT REVENUE WILL BE HARMED. WE MUST CONTINUE TO HIRE, TRAIN AND MANAGE NEW EMPLOYEES AT A RAPID RATE. THE MAJORITY OF OUR EMPLOYEES TODAY HAVE BEEN WITH US LESS THAN ONE YEAR AND WE EXPECT THAT OUR RATE OF HIRING WILL CONTINUE AT A VERY HIGH PACE. IF OUR NEW HIRES PERFORM POORLY, OR IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN HIRING, TRAINING AND INTEGRATING THESE NEW EMPLOYEES, OR IF WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN RETAINING OUR EXISTING EMPLOYEES, OUR BUSINESS MAY BE HARMED. TO MANAGE THE EXPECTED GROWTH OF OUR OPERATIONS AND PERSONNEL, WE WILL NEED TO IMPROVE OUR TRANSACTION PROCESSING, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL SYSTEMS, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS. THIS IS A SPECIAL CHALLENGE WHEN WE ACQUIRE NEW OPERATIONS WITH DIFFERENT SYSTEMS. OUR CURRENT AND PLANNED PERSONNEL, SYSTEMS, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO HIRE, TRAIN, RETAIN AND MANAGE REQUIRED PERSONNEL OR TO IDENTIFY AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EXISTING AND POTENTIAL STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS AND MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. WE MAY NOT MAINTAIN PROFITABILITY WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CONTINUED PROFITABILITY WILL DEPEND IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO DO THE FOLLOWING: - MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT TRANSACTION VOLUME TO ATTRACT BUYERS AND SELLERS; - MANAGE THE COSTS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MAINTAINING AND DEVELOPING OUR WEBSITES, CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND INTERNATIONAL AND PRODUCT EXPANSION; 32 <PAGE> 34 - INCREASE OUR BRAND NAME AWARENESS; AND - PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH SUPERIOR COMMUNITY AND TRADING EXPERIENCES. WE ARE INVESTING HEAVILY IN MARKETING AND PROMOTION, CUSTOMER SUPPORT, FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF OUR WEBSITES, TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATING INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. THE COSTS OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN SIGNIFICANT INTO THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT ONGOING COMMITMENTS IN SOME OF THESE AREAS. AS A RESULT, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ADJUST OUR SPENDING RAPIDLY ENOUGH TO COMPENSATE FOR ANY UNEXPECTED REVENUE SHORTFALL, WHICH MAY HARM OUR PROFITABILITY. THE EXISTENCE OF SEVERAL LARGER AND MORE ESTABLISHED COMPANIES THAT ARE ENABLING ONLINE SALES AS WELL AS NEW COMPANIES, MANY OF WHOM DO NOT CHARGE FOR TRANSACTIONS ON THEIR SITES AND OTHERS WHO ARE FACILITATING TRADING THROUGH OTHER PRICING FORMATS (E.G. FIXED PRICE, REVERSE AUCTION, GROUP BUYING, ETC.) MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO RAISE USER FEES IN RESPONSE TO DECLINES IN PROFITABILITY. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SPENDING IN ADVANCE OF ANTICIPATED GROWTH, WHICH MAY ALSO HARM OUR PROFITABILITY. IN VIEW OF THE RAPIDLY EVOLVING NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS AND OUR LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY, WE BELIEVE THAT PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY MEANINGFUL. YOU SHOULD NOT RELY UPON OUR HISTORICAL RESULTS AS INDICATIONS OF OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. ACQUISITIONS COULD RESULT IN DILUTION, OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND OTHER HARMFUL CONSEQUENCES WE HAVE ACQUIRED A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITIONS OF HALF.COM AND INTERNET AUCTION COMPANY LTD. IN KOREA AND OUR ANNOUNCED ACQUISITION OF IBAZAR S.A., AND MAY IN THE FUTURE ACQUIRE BUSINESSES, TECHNOLOGIES, SERVICES OR PRODUCTS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE STRATEGIC. THE PROCESS OF INTEGRATING ANY ACQUISITION MAY CREATE UNFORESEEN OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND EXPENDITURES AND IS ITSELF RISKY. THE AREAS WHERE WE MAY FACE DIFFICULTIES INCLUDE: - DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT TIME (AT BOTH COMPANIES) DURING THE PERIOD OF NEGOTIATION THROUGH CLOSING AND FURTHER DIVERSION OF SUCH TIME AFTER CLOSING FROM FOCUS ON OPERATING THE BUSINESSES TO ISSUES OF INTEGRATION AND FUTURE PRODUCTS; - DECLINE IN EMPLOYEE MORALE AND RETENTION ISSUES RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN COMPENSATION, REPORTING RELATIONSHIPS, FUTURE PROSPECTS OR THE DIRECTION OF THE BUSINESS; - THE NEED TO INTEGRATE EACH COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING, MANAGEMENT INFORMATION, HUMAN RESOURCE AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEMS TO PERMIT EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT, AND THE LACK OF CONTROL IF SUCH INTEGRATION IS DELAYED OR NOT IMPLEMENTED; AND - THE NEED TO IMPLEMENT CONTROLS, PROCEDURES AND POLICIES APPROPRIATE FOR A LARGER PUBLIC COMPANY AT COMPANIES THAT PRIOR TO ACQUISITION HAD BEEN SMALLER, PRIVATE COMPANIES. PRIOR TO THE FOUR LARGE ACQUISITIONS WE MADE IN 1999, WE HAD ALMOST NO EXPERIENCE IN MANAGING THIS INTEGRATION PROCESS. MANY OF OUR ACQUISITIONS TO DATE HAVE INVOLVED EITHER FAMILY-RUN COMPANIES OR VERY EARLY STAGE COMPANIES, WHICH MAY WORSEN THESE INTEGRATION ISSUES. FOREIGN ACQUISITIONS INVOLVE SPECIAL RISKS INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO INTEGRATION OF OPERATIONS ACROSS DIFFERENT CULTURES, CURRENCY RISKS AND THE PARTICULAR ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC COUNTRIES. MOREOVER, THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF ANY OR ALL OF OUR ACQUISITIONS MAY NOT BE REALIZED. FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OR MERGERS COULD RESULT IN POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE ISSUANCES OF EQUITY SECURITIES, THE INCURRENCE OF DEBT, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OR AMORTIZATION EXPENSES RELATED TO GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, ANY OF WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OR MERGERS MAY REQUIRE US TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCING, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. EVEN IF AVAILABLE, THIS FINANCING MAY BE DILUTIVE. THE INABILITY TO EXPAND OUR SYSTEMS MAY LIMIT OUR GROWTH WE SEEK TO GENERATE A HIGH VOLUME OF TRAFFIC AND TRANSACTIONS ON OUR SERVICE. THE SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE, RELIABILITY AND AVAILABILITY OF OUR WEBSITES, PROCESSING SYSTEMS AND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE ARE CRITICAL TO OUR REPUTATION AND OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN LARGE NUMBERS OF USERS. OUR REVENUES DEPEND PRIMARILY ON THE NUMBER OF ITEMS LISTED BY USERS, THE VOLUME OF USER TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED AND THE FINAL PRICES PAID FOR THE ITEMS LISTED. WE NEED TO EXPAND AND UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY, 33 <PAGE> 35 TRANSACTION PROCESSING SYSTEMS AND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE BOTH TO MEET INCREASED TRAFFIC ON OUR SITE AND TO IMPLEMENT NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE REQUIRED UNDER OUR CONTRACTS WITH THIRD PARTIES. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ACCURATELY PROJECT THE RATE OR TIMING OF INCREASES, IF ANY, IN THE USE OF OUR SERVICE OR TO EXPAND AND UPGRADE OUR SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO ACCOMMODATE ANY INCREASES IN A TIMELY FASHION. WE USE INTERNALLY DEVELOPED SYSTEMS TO OPERATE OUR SERVICE FOR TRANSACTION PROCESSING, INCLUDING BILLING AND COLLECTIONS PROCESSING. WE MUST CONTINUALLY IMPROVE THESE SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THE LEVEL OF USE OF OUR WEBSITE. IN ADDITION, WE MAY ADD NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY TO OUR SERVICES THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE NEED TO DEVELOP OR LICENSE ADDITIONAL TECHNOLOGIES. WE CAPITALIZE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DEVELOPMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND INCLUDE SUCH AMOUNTS IN PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. OUR INABILITY TO ADD ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE OR TO UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY, TRANSACTION PROCESSING SYSTEMS OR NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE TO ACCOMMODATE INCREASED TRAFFIC OR TRANSACTION VOLUME COULD HAVE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. THESE CONSEQUENCES INCLUDE UNANTICIPATED SYSTEM DISRUPTIONS, SLOWER RESPONSE TIMES, DEGRADATION IN LEVELS OF CUSTOMER SUPPORT, IMPAIRED QUALITY OF THE USERS' EXPERIENCE OF OUR SERVICE AND DELAYS IN REPORTING ACCURATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION. OUR FAILURE TO PROVIDE NEW FEATURES OR FUNCTIONALITY ALSO COULD RESULT IN THESE CONSEQUENCES. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY UPGRADE AND EXPAND OUR SYSTEMS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR TO INTEGRATE SMOOTHLY ANY NEWLY DEVELOPED OR PURCHASED TECHNOLOGIES WITH OUR EXISTING SYSTEMS. THESE DIFFICULTIES COULD HARM OR LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS. UNAUTHORIZED BREAK-INS OR OTHER ASSAULTS ON OUR SERVICE COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS OUR SERVERS ARE VULNERABLE TO COMPUTER VIRUSES, PHYSICAL OR ELECTRONIC BREAK-INS AND SIMILAR DISRUPTIONS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO INTERRUPTIONS, DELAYS, LOSS OF DATA, PUBLIC RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL DATA OR THE INABILITY TO COMPLETE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS. IN ADDITION, UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS MAY IMPROPERLY ACCESS OUR DATA. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED AN UNAUTHORIZED BREAK-IN BY A "HACKER" WHO HAS STATED THAT HE CAN IN THE FUTURE DAMAGE OR CHANGE OUR SYSTEM OR TAKE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. WE HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED "DENIAL OF SERVICE" TYPE ATTACKS ON OUR SYSTEM THAT HAVE MADE ALL OR PORTIONS OF OUR WEBSITE UNAVAILABLE FOR PERIODS OF TIME. THESE AND OTHER TYPES OF ATTACKS COULD HARM US. ACTIONS OF THIS SORT MAY BE VERY EXPENSIVE TO REMEDY AND COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND DISCOURAGE NEW AND EXISTING USERS FROM USING OUR SERVICE. THERE ARE MANY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS WE ARE EXPANDING INTERNATIONALLY. IN 1999, WE ACQUIRED ALANDO.DE.AG, A LEADING ONLINE GERMAN PERSONAL TRADING PLATFORM, AND BEGAN OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND, THROUGH A JOINT VENTURE, IN AUSTRALIA. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2000, WE FURTHER EXPANDED INTO JAPAN AND FORMALLY LAUNCHED OUR LOCALIZED CANADIAN OPERATIONS. IN OCTOBER 2000, WE LAUNCHED OUR FRENCH SITE. IN JANUARY 2001, WE LAUNCHED OUR ITALIAN SITE. IN FEBRUARY 2001, WE COMPLETED OUR ACQUISITION OF A MAJORITY INTEREST IN INTERNET AUCTION COMPANY, LTD. AND ANNOUNCED OUR INTENDED ACQUISITION OF IBAZAR S.A., A FRENCH COMPANY WITH ONLINE TRADING OPERATIONS IN EIGHT COUNTRIES, PRIMARILY IN EUROPE. EXPANSION INTO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES. WE HAVE LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN LOCALIZING OUR SERVICE TO CONFORM TO LOCAL CULTURES, STANDARDS AND POLICIES. IN MOST COUNTRIES, WE WILL HAVE TO COMPETE WITH LOCAL COMPANIES WHO UNDERSTAND THE LOCAL MARKET BETTER THAN WE DO. WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN EXPANDING INTO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS OR IN GENERATING REVENUES FROM FOREIGN OPERATIONS. EVEN IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL, THE COSTS OF OPERATING ARE EXPECTED TO EXCEED OUR NET REVENUES FOR AT LEAST 12 MONTHS IN MOST COUNTRIES. AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND INTERNATIONALLY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: - REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING REGULATION OF "AUCTIONS," THAT MAY LIMIT OR PREVENT THE OFFERING OF OUR SERVICES IN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS, MAY PREVENT ENFORCEABLE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN SELLERS AND BUYERS OR MAY PROHIBIT CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF GOODS; - LEGAL UNCERTAINTY REGARDING LIABILITY FOR THE LISTINGS OF OUR USERS, INCLUDING LESS INTERNET-FRIENDLY LEGAL SYSTEMS, UNIQUE LOCAL LAWS AND LACK OF CLEAR PRECEDENT OR APPLICABLE LAW; - GOVERNMENT-IMPOSED LIMITATIONS ON THE PUBLIC'S ACCESS TO THE INTERNET; 34 <PAGE> 36 - DIFFICULTIES IN STAFFING AND MANAGING FOREIGN OPERATIONS; - LONGER PAYMENT CYCLES, DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING PRACTICES AND PROBLEMS IN COLLECTING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE; - HIGHER TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER COSTS; - MORE STRINGENT CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS; - CULTURAL NON-ACCEPTANCE OF ONLINE TRADING; - STRONGER LOCAL COMPETITORS; - SEASONAL REDUCTIONS IN BUSINESS ACTIVITY; AND - POTENTIALLY ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES. SOME OF THESE FACTORS MAY CAUSE OUR INTERNATIONAL COSTS TO EXCEED OUR DOMESTIC COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS. TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND HAVE ADDITIONAL PORTIONS OF OUR INTERNATIONAL REVENUES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WE ALSO COULD BECOME SUBJECT TO INCREASED DIFFICULTIES IN COLLECTING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND RISKS RELATING TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS. OUR REVENUE FROM END-TO-END SERVICE PROVIDERS, COMMERCIAL PARTNERS AND ADVERTISING IS SUBJECT TO FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL WE ARE RECEIVING REVENUES FROM END-TO-END SERVICE PROVIDERS, COMMERCIAL PARTNERSHIPS AND DIRECT ADVERTISING PROMOTIONS. THESE REVENUES MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE PARTIES WITH WHOM WE HAVE THESE RELATIONSHIPS AND BY THE SUCCESS OF ONLINE PROMOTIONS GENERALLY. THE PROFITABILITY OF ONLINE ADVERTISEMENTS HAS DETERIORATED MARKEDLY RECENTLY. OUR DIRECT ADVERTISING REVENUE IS DEPENDENT IN SIGNIFICANT PART ON THE PERFORMANCE OF AOL'S SALES FORCE, WHICH WE DO NOT CONTROL. REDUCTION IN THESE REVENUES, WHETHER DUE TO THE SOFTENING OF THE DEMAND FOR ONLINE ADVERTISING IN GENERAL OR PARTICULAR PROBLEMS FACING PARTIES WITH WHOM WE HAVE COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS. OUR BUSINESS MAY BE HARMED BY THE LISTING OR SALE BY OUR USERS OF ILLEGAL ITEMS THE LAW RELATING TO THE LIABILITY OF PROVIDERS OF ONLINE SERVICES FOR THE ACTIVITIES OF THEIR USERS ON THEIR SERVICE IS CURRENTLY UNSETTLED. WE ARE AWARE THAT CERTAIN GOODS, SUCH AS FIREARMS, OTHER WEAPONS, ADULT MATERIAL, TOBACCO PRODUCTS, ALCOHOL AND OTHER GOODS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY LOCAL, STATE OR FEDERAL AUTHORITIES, HAVE BEEN LISTED AND TRADED ON OUR SERVICE. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PREVENT THE SALE OF UNLAWFUL GOODS, OR THE SALE OF GOODS IN AN UNLAWFUL MANNER, BY USERS OF OUR SERVICE, AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO ALLEGATIONS OF CIVIL OR CRIMINAL LIABILITY FOR UNLAWFUL ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT BY USERS THROUGH OUR SERVICE. WE HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO SEVERAL LAWSUITS BASED UPON SUCH ALLEGATIONS. SEE "-- WE ARE SUBJECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER LITIGATION" AND "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS." IN ORDER TO REDUCE OUR EXPOSURE TO THIS LIABILITY, WE HAVE PROHIBITED THE LISTING OF CERTAIN ITEMS AND INCREASED THE NUMBER OF PERSONNEL REVIEWING QUESTIONABLE ITEMS. WE MAY IN THE FUTURE IMPLEMENT OTHER PROTECTIVE MEASURES THAT COULD REQUIRE US TO SPEND SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES AND/OR TO REDUCE REVENUES BY DISCONTINUING CERTAIN SERVICE OFFERINGS. ANY COSTS INCURRED AS A RESULT OF LIABILITY OR ASSERTED LIABILITY RELATING TO THE SALE OF UNLAWFUL GOODS OR THE UNLAWFUL SALE OF GOODS, COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT AND CONTINUING MEDIA ATTENTION RELATING TO THE LISTING OR SALE OF UNLAWFUL GOODS ON OUR WEBSITE. THIS NEGATIVE PUBLICITY COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND DIMINISH THE VALUE OF OUR BRAND NAME. IT ALSO COULD MAKE USERS RELUCTANT TO CONTINUE TO USE OUR SERVICES. OUR BUSINESS MAY BE HARMED BY THE LISTING OR SALE BY OUR USERS OF PIRATED ITEMS WE HAVE RECEIVED IN THE PAST, AND WE ANTICIPATE WE WILL RECEIVE IN THE FUTURE, COMMUNICATIONS ALLEGING THAT CERTAIN ITEMS LISTED OR SOLD THROUGH OUR SERVICE BY OUR USERS INFRINGE THIRD-PARTY COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS AND TRADENAMES OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ACTIVELY SOUGHT TO WORK WITH THE CONTENT COMMUNITY TO ELIMINATE INFRINGING LISTINGS ON OUR WEBSITE, SOME CONTENT OWNERS HAVE EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT OUR EFFORTS ARE INSUFFICIENT. CONTENT OWNERS HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN DEFENDING THEIR RIGHTS AGAINST ONLINE COMPANIES, INCLUDING EBAY. AN ALLEGATION OF INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY RESULT 35 <PAGE> 37 IN LITIGATION AGAINST US. ANY SUCH LITIGATION COULD BE COSTLY FOR US, COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS THROUGH ADVERSE JUDGMENT OR SETTLEMENT, COULD REQUIRE US TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES IN EXPENSIVE WAYS, OR COULD OTHERWISE HARM OUR BUSINESS. LITIGATION AGAINST OTHER ONLINE COMPANIES COULD RESULT IN INTERPRETATIONS OF THE LAW THAT COULD ALSO REQUIRE US TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES OR OTHERWISE INCREASE OUR COSTS. SEE "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS" AND "RISK FACTORS -- WE ARE SUBJECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER LITIGATION." OUR BUSINESS MAY BE HARMED BY FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES ON OUR WEBSITE OUR FUTURE SUCCESS WILL DEPEND LARGELY UPON SELLERS RELIABLY DELIVERING AND ACCURATELY REPRESENTING THEIR LISTED GOODS AND BUYERS PAYING THE AGREED PURCHASE PRICE. WE HAVE RECEIVED IN THE PAST, AND ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL RECEIVE IN THE FUTURE, COMMUNICATIONS FROM USERS WHO DID NOT RECEIVE THE PURCHASE PRICE OR THE GOODS THAT WERE TO HAVE BEEN EXCHANGED. IN SOME CASES INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AND CONVICTED FOR FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES USING OUR WEBSITE. WHILE WE CAN SUSPEND THE ACCOUNTS OF USERS WHO FAIL TO FULFILL THEIR DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS TO OTHER USERS, WE DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO REQUIRE USERS TO MAKE PAYMENTS OR DELIVER GOODS OR OTHERWISE MAKE USERS WHOLE OTHER THAN THROUGH OUR LIMITED INSURANCE PROGRAM. OTHER THAN THROUGH THIS PROGRAM, WE DO NOT COMPENSATE USERS WHO BELIEVE THEY HAVE BEEN DEFRAUDED BY OTHER USERS. WE ALSO PERIODICALLY RECEIVE COMPLAINTS FROM BUYERS AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE GOODS PURCHASED. NEGATIVE PUBLICITY GENERATED AS A RESULT OF FRAUDULENT OR DECEPTIVE CONDUCT BY USERS OF OUR SERVICE COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND DIMINISH THE VALUE OF OUR BRAND NAME. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE REQUESTS FROM USERS REQUESTING REIMBURSEMENT OR THREATENING OR COMMENCING LEGAL ACTION AGAINST US IF NO REIMBURSEMENT IS MADE. THIS SORT OF LITIGATION COULD BE COSTLY FOR US, DIVERT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION, RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS, LEAD TO ADVERSE JUDGMENTS OR COULD OTHERWISE HARM OUR BUSINESS. GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES MAY LEAD TO CHARGES OR PENALTIES ON JANUARY 29, 1999, WE RECEIVED INITIAL REQUESTS TO PRODUCE CERTAIN RECORDS AND INFORMATION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RELATING TO AN INVESTIGATION OF POSSIBLE ILLEGAL TRANSACTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR WEBSITE. WE WERE INFORMED THAT THE INQUIRY INCLUDES AN EXAMINATION OF OUR PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO THESE TRANSACTIONS. WE HAVE PROVIDED FURTHER INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH THIS ONGOING INQUIRY. IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE INVESTIGATION, THE COURT HAS ORDERED THAT NO FURTHER PUBLIC DISCLOSURES BE MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE MATTER. ON MARCH 24, 2000, BUTTERFIELDS RECEIVED A GRAND JURY SUBPOENA FROM THE ANTITRUST DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REQUESTING DOCUMENTS RELATING TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGES IN BUTTERFIELDS' SELLER COMMISSIONS AND BUYER PREMIUMS AND DISCUSSIONS, AGREEMENTS OR UNDERSTANDINGS WITH OTHER AUCTION HOUSES, IN EACH CASE SINCE 1992. WE BELIEVE THIS REQUEST MAY BE RELATED TO A PUBLICLY REPORTED CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OF AUCTION HOUSES FOR PRICE FIXING. WE HAVE PROVIDED THE INFORMATION REQUESTED IN THE SUBPOENA. SHOULD THESE OR ANY OTHER INVESTIGATIONS LEAD TO CIVIL OR CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST US, WE WOULD LIKELY BE HARMED BY NEGATIVE PUBLICITY, THE COSTS OF LITIGATION, THE DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT TIME AND OTHER NEGATIVE EFFECTS, EVEN IF WE ULTIMATELY PREVAIL. OUR BUSINESS WOULD SUFFER IF WE WERE NOT TO PREVAIL IN ANY ACTIONS LIKE THESE. EVEN THE PROCESS OF PROVIDING RECORDS AND INFORMATION CAN BE EXPENSIVE, TIME CONSUMING AND RESULT IN THE DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT ATTENTION. A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS OCCUR ON OUR WEBSITE. WE BELIEVE THAT GOVERNMENT REGULATORS HAVE RECEIVED A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS ABOUT US WHICH, WHILE SMALL AS A PERCENTAGE OF OUR TOTAL TRANSACTIONS, ARE LARGE IN AGGREGATE NUMBERS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME BEEN CONTACTED BY VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY AGENCIES AND BEEN TOLD THAT THEY HAVE QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE ADEQUACY OF THE STEPS WE TAKE TO PROTECT OUR USERS FROM FRAUD. WE ARE LIKELY TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL INQUIRIES FROM REGULATORY AGENCIES IN THE FUTURE, WHICH MAY LEAD TO ACTION AGAINST US. WE HAVE RESPONDED TO ALL INQUIRIES FROM REGULATORY AGENCIES BY DESCRIBING OUR CURRENT AND PLANNED ANTIFRAUD EFFORTS. IF ONE OR MORE OF THESE AGENCIES IS NOT SATISFIED WITH OUR RESPONSE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE INQUIRIES, THE RESULTANT INVESTIGATIONS AND POTENTIAL FINES OR OTHER PENALTIES COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. WE HAVE PROVIDED INFORMATION TO THE ANTITRUST DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN CONNECTION WITH AN INQUIRY INTO OUR CONDUCT WITH RESPECT TO "AUCTION AGGREGATORS" INCLUDING OUR LICENSING PROGRAM AND OUR 36 <PAGE> 38 RECENTLY SETTLED LAWSUIT AGAINST BIDDER'S EDGE. SHOULD THE DIVISION DECIDE TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST US, WE WOULD LIKELY BE HARMED BY NEGATIVE PUBLICITY, THE COSTS OF THE ACTION, POSSIBLE PRIVATE ANTITRUST LAWSUITS, THE DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT TIME AND EFFORT AND PENALTIES WE MIGHT SUFFER IF WE ULTIMATELY WERE NOT TO PREVAIL. SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION AND OTHERS MAY BE IN THE FUTURE BOTH BUTTERFIELDS AND KRUSE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION IN SOME JURISDICTIONS GOVERNING THE MANNER IN WHICH LIVE AUCTIONS ARE CONDUCTED. BOTH ARE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN LICENSES IN THESE JURISDICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR BUSINESS OR TO PERMIT THE SALE OF CATEGORIES OF ITEMS (E.G. WINE, AUTOMOBILES AND REAL ESTATE). THESE LICENSES GENERALLY MUST BE RENEWED REGULARLY AND ARE SUBJECT TO REVOCATION FOR VIOLATION OF LAW, VIOLATION OF THE REGULATIONS GOVERNING AUCTIONS IN GENERAL OR THE SALE OF THE PARTICULAR ITEM AND OTHER EVENTS. IF EITHER COMPANY WAS UNABLE TO RENEW A LICENSE OR HAD A LICENSE REVOKED, ITS BUSINESS WOULD BE HARMED. IN ADDITION, CHANGES TO THE REGULATIONS OR THE LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS COULD INCREASE THE COMPLEXITY AND THE COST OF DOING AUCTIONS, THEREBY HARMING US. AS OUR ACTIVITIES AND THE TYPES OF GOODS LISTED ON OUR SITE EXPAND, STATE REGULATORY AGENCIES MAY CLAIM THAT WE ARE SUBJECT TO LICENSURE IN THEIR JURISDICTION. THESE CLAIMS COULD RESULT IN COSTLY LITIGATION OR COULD REQUIRE US TO CHANGE OUR MANNER OF DOING BUSINESS IN WAYS THAT INCREASE OUR COSTS OR REDUCE OUR REVENUES OR FORCE US TO PROHIBIT LISTINGS OF CERTAIN ITEMS. WE COULD ALSO BE SUBJECT TO FINES OR OTHER PENALTIES. ANY OF THESE OUTCOMES COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. AS WE HAVE EXPANDED INTERNATIONALLY, WE HAVE BECOME SUBJECT TO NEW REGULATIONS, INCLUDING REGULATIONS ON THE TRANSMISSION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. THESE LAWS MAY REQUIRE COSTLY CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES. IF WE ARE FOUND TO HAVE VIOLATED ANY OF THESE LAWS, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO FINES OR PENALTIES, AND OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED. COMPANIES THAT HANDLE PAYMENTS, INCLUDING OUR SUBSIDIARIES BILLPOINT AND HALF.COM MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL REGULATION THE HALF.COM BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVES THE HANDLING OF PAYMENTS BY BUYERS FOR THE ITEMS LISTED BY HALF.COM'S SELLERS. INTERNET AUCTION COMPANY, LTD. ALSO HAS A BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVING THE HANDLING OF PAYMENTS BY BUYERS. BILLPOINT HANDLES ITS CUSTOMER FUNDS AS A PROVIDER OF INTERNET PAYMENT SOLUTIONS. BUSINESSES THAT HANDLE CONSUMERS' FUNDS ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO BANKING, CREDIT CARDS, ESCROW, FAIR CREDIT REPORTING AND OTHERS. BILLPOINT IS A NEW BUSINESS WITH A RELATIVELY NOVEL APPROACH TO FACILITATING PAYMENTS. IT IS NOT YET KNOWN HOW REGULATORY AGENCIES WILL TREAT BILLPOINT. THE COST AND COMPLEXITY OF BILLPOINT'S BUSINESS MAY INCREASE IF CERTAIN REGULATIONS ARE DEEMED TO APPLY TO ITS BUSINESS. IN ADDITION TO THE NEED TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS, BILLPOINT'S BUSINESS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO RISKS OF FRAUD, THE NEED TO GROW SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES RAPIDLY IF ITS PRODUCTS ARE WELL RECEIVED, A HIGH LEVEL OF COMPETITION, INCLUDING LARGER AND BETTER FINANCED COMPETITORS AND THE NEED TO COORDINATE SYSTEMS AND POLICIES AMONG ITSELF, US AND WELLS FARGO BANK, WHICH IS THE PROVIDER OF PAYMENT SERVICES. SIMILARLY, HALF.COM MAY BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REGULATIONS REGARDING PAYMENTS AND THE COST AND COMPLEXITY OF ITS BUSINESS MAY INCREASE IF THESE REGULATIONS ARE DEEMED TO APPLY TO ITS BUSINESS. WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INFORMATION DISSEMINATED THROUGH OUR SERVICE THE LAW RELATING TO THE LIABILITY OF ONLINE SERVICES COMPANIES FOR INFORMATION CARRIED ON OR DISSEMINATED THROUGH THEIR SERVICES IS CURRENTLY UNSETTLED. CLAIMS COULD BE MADE AGAINST ONLINE SERVICES COMPANIES UNDER BOTH UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN LAW FOR DEFAMATION, LIBEL, INVASION OF PRIVACY, NEGLIGENCE, COPYRIGHT OR TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT, OR OTHER THEORIES BASED ON THE NATURE AND CONTENT OF THE MATERIALS DISSEMINATED THROUGH THEIR SERVICES. SEVERAL PRIVATE LAWSUITS SEEKING TO IMPOSE LIABILITY UPON US HAVE BROUGHT AGAINST US. IN ADDITION, FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PROPOSED THAT IMPOSES LIABILITY FOR OR PROHIBITS THE TRANSMISSION OVER THE INTERNET OF CERTAIN TYPES OF INFORMATION. OUR SERVICE FEATURES A FEEDBACK FORUM, WHICH INCLUDES INFORMATION FROM USERS REGARDING OTHER USERS. ALTHOUGH ALL SUCH FEEDBACK IS GENERATED BY USERS AND NOT BY US, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A CLAIM OF DEFAMATION OR OTHER INJURY COULD BE MADE AGAINST US FOR CONTENT POSTED IN THE FEEDBACK FORUM. CLAIMS LIKE THESE BECOME MORE LIKELY AND HAVE A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS IN 37 <PAGE> 39 JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. IF WE BECOME LIABLE FOR INFORMATION PROVIDED BY OUR USERS AND CARRIED ON OUR SERVICE IN ANY JURISDICTION IN WHICH WE OPERATE, WE COULD BE DIRECTLY HARMED AND WE MAY BE FORCED TO IMPLEMENT NEW MEASURES TO REDUCE OUR EXPOSURE TO THIS LIABILITY. THIS MAY REQUIRE US TO EXPEND SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES AND/OR TO DISCONTINUE CERTAIN SERVICE OFFERINGS, WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASED ATTENTION FOCUSED UPON LIABILITY ISSUES AS A RESULT OF THESE LAWSUITS AND LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION OR OTHERWISE IMPACT THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS. ANY COSTS INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THIS LIABILITY OR ASSERTED LIABILITY COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. WE ARE SUBJECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER LITIGATION ON SEPTEMBER 1, 1999, WE WERE SERVED WITH A LAWSUIT FILED BY RANDALL STONER, ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC, IN SAN FRANCISCO SUPERIOR COURT (NO. 305666). THE LAWSUIT ALLEGED THAT WE VIOLATED SECTION 17200 OF THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS & PROFESSIONS CODE, A STATUTE THAT RELATES TO UNFAIR COMPETITION, BASED UPON THE LISTING OF "BOOTLEG" OR "PIRATE" RECORDINGS BY EBAY'S USERS, ALLEGEDLY IN VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA PENAL STATUTES RELATING TO THE SALE OF UNAUTHORIZED AUDIO RECORDINGS. THE LAWSUIT SOUGHT DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, RESTITUTION AND LEGAL FEES. WE FILED A GENERAL DEMURRER WHICH WAS SUSTAINED BY THE COURT WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. THE PLAINTIFF SUBSEQUENTLY FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT. WE FILED A MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGEMENT. ON NOVEMBER 7, 2000, OUR MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGEMENT WAS GRANTED. ON DECEMBER 10, 1999, WE SUED BIDDER'S EDGE, INC. IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA ALLEGING TRESPASS, UNFAIR COMPETITION, VIOLATION OF THE COMPUTER FRAUD AND ABUSE ACT, MISAPPROPRIATION, FALSE ADVERTISING, TRADEMARK DILUTION, INJURY TO BUSINESS REPUTATION, INTERFERENCE WITH PROSPECTIVE ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE, AND UNJUST ENRICHMENT. ON FEBRUARY 7, 2000, BIDDER'S EDGE DENIED THESE CLAIMS AND COUNTERCLAIMED AGAINST US ALLEGING THAT WE VIOLATED THE ANTITRUST LAWS BY MONOPOLIZING OR ATTEMPTING TO MONOPOLIZE A MARKET, THAT WE COMPETED UNFAIRLY, AND THAT WE INTERFERED WITH THEIR CONTRACT WITH EBAY MAGAZINE. BIDDER'S EDGE SOUGHT TREBLE DAMAGES, AN INJUNCTION AND ITS FEES AND COSTS. ON MAY 24, 2000, THE COURT GRANTED US A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AGAINST THE USE BY BIDDER'S EDGE OF ROBOTIC MEANS TO COPY OUR SITE. IN FEBRUARY 2001, THE PARTIES SETTLED THIS LAWSUIT. ALL CLAIMS BY BOTH PARTIES WERE DISMISSED, AND BIDDER'S EDGE PAID US AN UNDISCLOSED AMOUNT. ON APRIL 25, 2000, WE WERE SERVED WITH A LAWSUIT, GENTRY ET.AL. V. EBAY, INC. ET.AL, FILED IN SUPERIOR COURT IN SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA. THE LAWSUIT WAS FILED ON BEHALF OF A PURPORTED CLASS OF EBAY USERS WHO PURCHASED ALLEGEDLY FORGED AUTOGRAPHED SPORTS MEMORABILIA ON EBAY. THE LAWSUIT CLAIMS WE WERE NEGLIGENT IN PERMITTING CERTAIN NAMED (AND OTHER UNNAMED) DEFENDANTS TO SELL ALLEGEDLY FORGED AUTOGRAPHED SPORTS MEMORABILIA ON EBAY. IN ADDITION, THE LAWSUIT CLAIMS WE VIOLATED SECTION 17200 AND A SECTION OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE WHICH PROHIBITS "DEALERS" FROM SELLING SPORTS MEMORABILIA WITHOUT A "CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICITY." ON JANUARY 26, 2001, THE COURT ISSUED A RULING DISMISSING ALL CLAIMS AGAINST US IN THE LAWSUIT. THE COURT RULED THAT OUR BUSINESS FALLS WITHIN THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF 47 USC 230, WHICH GRANTS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS SUCH AS EBAY WITH IMMUNITY FROM STATE CLAIMS BASED ON THE CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTIES. THE COURT ALSO NOTED THAT WE WERE NOT A "DEALER" UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW AND THUS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE CERTIFICATES OF AUTHENTICITY WITH AUTOGRAPHS SOLD OVER OUR SITE BY THIRD PARTIES. ALL COUNTS OF THE PLAINTIFFS' SUIT WERE DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE AS TO EBAY. PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED AN APPEAL OF THIS RULING. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE MERITORIOUS DEFENSES AND INTEND TO DEFEND OURSELVES VIGOROUSLY. OTHER THIRD PARTIES HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME CLAIMED AND MAY CLAIM IN THE FUTURE THAT WE HAVE INFRINGED THEIR PAST, CURRENT OR FUTURE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. WE MAY BECOME MORE VULNERABLE TO SUCH CLAIMS AS LAWS SUCH AS THE DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT ARE INTERPRETED BY THE COURTS. WE EXPECT THAT WE WILL INCREASINGLY BE SUBJECT TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AS THE NUMBER OF SERVICES AND COMPETITORS IN OUR SEGMENT GROW. THESE CLAIMS WHETHER MERITORIOUS OR NOT, COULD BE TIME-CONSUMING, RESULT IN COSTLY LITIGATION, CAUSE SERVICE UPGRADE DELAYS REQUIRE EXPENSIVE CHANGES IN OUR METHODS OF DOING BUSINESS OR COULD REQUIRE US TO ENTER INTO COSTLY ROYALTY OR LICENSING AGREEMENTS, IF AVAILABLE. AS A RESULT, THESE CLAIMS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ARE INVOLVED IN DISPUTES THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE DISPUTES WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 38 <PAGE> 40 SYSTEM FAILURES COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SYSTEM FAILURES FROM TIME TO TIME. OUR WEBSITE HAS BEEN INTERRUPTED FOR PERIODS OF UP TO 22 HOURS. IN ADDITION TO PLACING INCREASED BURDENS ON OUR ENGINEERING STAFF, THESE OUTAGES CREATE A FLOOD OF USER QUESTIONS AND COMPLAINTS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BY OUR CUSTOMER SUPPORT PERSONNEL. ANY UNSCHEDULED INTERRUPTION IN OUR SERVICE RESULTS IN AN IMMEDIATE LOSS OF REVENUES THAT CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL AND MAY CAUSE SOME USERS TO SWITCH TO OUR COMPETITORS. IF WE EXPERIENCE FREQUENT OR PERSISTENT SYSTEM FAILURES, OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND COULD BE PERMANENTLY HARMED. WE HAVE BEEN TAKING STEPS TO INCREASE THE RELIABILITY AND REDUNDANCY OF OUR SYSTEM. THESE STEPS ARE EXPENSIVE, REDUCE OUR MARGINS AND MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN REDUCING THE FREQUENCY OR DURATION OF UNSCHEDULED DOWNTIME. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR COMPUTER HARDWARE FOR OPERATING OUR SERVICES (OTHER THAN HALF.COM) CURRENTLY IS LOCATED AT THE FACILITIES OF EXODUS COMMUNICATIONS, INC. IN SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA AND ABOVENET COMMUNICATIONS IN SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA. THE COMPUTER HARDWARE FOR THE HALF.COM SERVICE IS LOCATED IN THE FACILITIES OF LEVEL 3 COMMUNICATIONS IN PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA. THESE SYSTEMS AND OPERATIONS ARE VULNERABLE TO DAMAGE OR INTERRUPTION FROM EARTHQUAKES, FLOODS, FIRES, POWER LOSS, TELECOMMUNICATION FAILURES AND SIMILAR EVENTS. THEY ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO BREAK-INS, SABOTAGE, INTENTIONAL ACTS OF VANDALISM AND SIMILAR MISCONDUCT. WE DO NOT MAINTAIN FULLY REDUNDANT SYSTEMS OR ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS OF HOSTING SERVICES, AND WE DO NOT CARRY BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE SUFFICIENT TO COMPENSATE US FOR LOSSES THAT MAY OCCUR. DESPITE ANY PRECAUTIONS WE MAY TAKE, THE OCCURRENCE OF A NATURAL DISASTER OR OTHER UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS AT ANY OF THE EXODUS, ABOVENET OR LEVEL 3 FACILITIES COULD RESULT IN INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE FAILURE BY EXODUS, ABOVENET OR LEVEL 3 TO PROVIDE OUR REQUIRED DATA COMMUNICATIONS CAPACITY COULD RESULT IN INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR SERVICE. ANY DAMAGE TO OR FAILURE OF OUR SYSTEMS COULD RESULT IN INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR SERVICE. INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR SERVICE WILL REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND PROFITS, AND OUR FUTURE REVENUES AND PROFITS WILL BE HARMED IF OUR USERS BELIEVE THAT OUR SYSTEM IS UNRELIABLE. RISKS RELATING TO POSSIBLE CALIFORNIA POWER OUTAGES THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING A CHRONIC SHORTAGE OF POWER AND, AS A RESULT, POWER OUTAGES MAY OCCUR. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE EMERGENCY BACKUP POWER CAPABILITIES AT THE FACILITIES OF EXODUS, ABOVENET, LEVEL 3 COMMUNICATIONS AND LIMITED BACKUP POWER AT OUR HEADQUARTERS, REPEATED OR LENGTHY POWER OUTAGES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. OUR STOCK PRICE HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE EXTREMELY VOLATILE THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN AND IS LIKELY TO BE EXTREMELY VOLATILE. OUR STOCK PRICE COULD BE SUBJECT TO WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN RESPONSE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: - ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED VARIATIONS IN OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS; - UNSCHEDULED SYSTEM DOWNTIME; - ADDITIONS OR DEPARTURES OF KEY PERSONNEL; - ANNOUNCEMENTS OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS OR NEW SERVICES BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS; - CHANGES IN FINANCIAL ESTIMATES BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS; - CONDITIONS OR TRENDS IN THE INTERNET AND ONLINE COMMERCE INDUSTRIES; - CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUATIONS OF OTHER INTERNET COMPANIES; - DEVELOPMENTS IN INTERNET REGULATION; - ANNOUNCEMENTS BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS OF SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS, JOINT VENTURES OR CAPITAL COMMITMENTS; - SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK OR OTHER SECURITIES IN THE OPEN MARKET; AND - OTHER EVENTS OR FACTORS THAT MAY BE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. 39 <PAGE> 41 IN ADDITION, THE TRADING PRICE OF INTERNET STOCKS IN GENERAL, AND OURS IN PARTICULAR, HAVE EXPERIENCED EXTREME PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS IN RECENT PERIODS. THESE FLUCTUATIONS OFTEN HAVE BEEN UNRELATED OR DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THESE COMPANIES. THE VALUATIONS OF MANY INTERNET STOCKS, INCLUDING OURS, ARE EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH BASED ON CONVENTIONAL VALUATION STANDARDS SUCH AS PRICE-TO-EARNINGS AND PRICE-TO-SALES RATIOS. THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAS INCREASED ENORMOUSLY FROM THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE. THESE TRADING PRICES AND VALUATIONS MAY NOT BE SUSTAINED. ANY NEGATIVE CHANGE IN THE PUBLIC'S PERCEPTION OF THE PROSPECTS OF INTERNET OR E-COMMERCE COMPANIES COULD DEPRESS OUR STOCK PRICE REGARDLESS OF OUR RESULTS. OTHER BROAD MARKET AND INDUSTRY FACTORS MAY DECREASE THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, REGARDLESS OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE. MARKET FLUCTUATIONS, AS WELL AS GENERAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS RECESSION OR INTEREST RATE OR CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ALSO MAY DECREASE THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. IN THE PAST, FOLLOWING DECLINES IN THE MARKET PRICE OF A COMPANY'S SECURITIES, SECURITIES CLASS-ACTION LITIGATION OFTEN HAS BEEN INSTITUTED. LITIGATION OF THIS TYPE, IF INSTITUTED, COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND A DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT'S ATTENTION AND RESOURCES. NEW AND EXISTING REGULATIONS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AS OTHER COMPANIES CONDUCTING BUSINESS ON THE INTERNET. TODAY THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW LAWS SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED TOWARDS ONLINE SERVICES. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE INCREASING POPULARITY AND USE OF THE INTERNET AND ONLINE SERVICES, MANY LAWS RELATING TO THE INTERNET ARE BEING DEBATED AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS (BOTH IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD) AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT LAWS AND REGULATIONS WILL BE ADOPTED WITH RESPECT TO THE INTERNET OR ONLINE SERVICES. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD COVER ISSUES SUCH AS USER PRIVACY, FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, PRICING, FRAUD, CONTENT AND QUALITY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TAXATION, ADVERTISING, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND INFORMATION SECURITY. APPLICABILITY TO THE INTERNET OF EXISTING LAWS GOVERNING ISSUES SUCH AS PROPERTY OWNERSHIP, COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ISSUES, TAXATION, LIBEL, OBSCENITY AND PERSONAL PRIVACY IS UNCERTAIN. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE LAWS WERE ADOPTED PRIOR TO THE ADVENT OF THE INTERNET AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES AND, AS A RESULT, DO NOT CONTEMPLATE OR ADDRESS THE UNIQUE ISSUES OF THE INTERNET AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES. THOSE LAWS THAT DO REFERENCE THE INTERNET, SUCH AS THE DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT, ARE ONLY BEGINNING TO BE INTERPRETED BY THE COURTS AND THEIR APPLICABILITY AND REACH ARE THEREFORE UNCERTAIN. IN ADDITION, NUMEROUS STATES, INCLUDING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, WHERE OUR HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED, HAVE REGULATIONS REGARDING HOW "AUCTIONS" MAY BE CONDUCTED AND THE LIABILITY OF "AUCTIONEERS" IN CONDUCTING SUCH AUCTIONS. NO FINAL LEGAL DETERMINATION HAS BEEN MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICABILITY OF THE CALIFORNIA REGULATIONS TO OUR BUSINESS TO DATE AND LITTLE PRECEDENT EXISTS IN THIS AREA. SEVERAL STATES ARE CONSIDERING IMPOSING THESE REGULATIONS UPON US OR OUR USERS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, AS THE NATURE OF THE PRODUCTS LISTED BY OUR USERS CHANGE, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO NEW REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS. SEVERAL STATES HAVE PROPOSED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD LIMIT THE USES OF PERSONAL USER INFORMATION GATHERED ONLINE OR REQUIRE ONLINE SERVICES TO ESTABLISH PRIVACY POLICIES. THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION ALSO HAS SETTLED SEVERAL PROCEEDINGS REGARDING THE MANNER IN WHICH PERSONAL INFORMATION IS COLLECTED FROM USERS AND PROVIDED TO THIRD PARTIES. CHANGES TO EXISTING LAWS OR THE PASSAGE OF NEW LAWS INTENDED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES COULD DIRECTLY AFFECT THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS OR COULD CREATE UNCERTAINTY ON THE INTERNET. THIS COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES, INCREASE THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS AS A RESULT OF LITIGATION COSTS OR INCREASED SERVICE DELIVERY COSTS, OR OTHERWISE HARM OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OUR SERVICES ARE ACCESSIBLE WORLDWIDE, AND WE FACILITATE SALES OF GOODS TO USERS WORLDWIDE, FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS MAY CLAIM THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THEIR LAWS. FOR EXAMPLE, A FRENCH COURT HAS RECENTLY RULED THAT A U.S. WEBSITE MUST COMPLY WITH FRENCH LAWS REGARDING CONTENT. AS WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES, WE HAVE BECOME OBLIGATED TO COMPLY WITH THE LAWS OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. LAWS REGULATING INTERNET COMPANIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES MAY BE LESS FAVORABLE THEN THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES, GIVING GREATER RIGHTS TO CONSUMERS, CONTENT OWNERS AND USERS. COMPLIANCE MAY BE MORE COSTLY OR MAY REQUIRE US TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES OR RESTRICT OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS RELATIVE TO THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH FOREIGN LAWS COULD SUBJECT US TO PENALTIES RANGING FROM FINES TO BANS ON OUR ABILITY TO OFFER OUR SERVICES. 40 <PAGE> 42 OUR BUSINESS HAS BEEN SEASONAL OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT SEASONAL IN NATURE BECAUSE MANY OF OUR USERS REDUCE THEIR ACTIVITIES ON OUR WEBSITE DURING THE THANKSGIVING AND CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS AND WITH THE ONSET OF GOOD WEATHER. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED OUR STRONGEST QUARTER OF ONLINE GROWTH IN OUR FIRST FISCAL QUARTER, ALTHOUGH OUR SHIFT TO MORE "PRACTICAL" ITEMS MAY CAUSE OUR SEASONAL PATTERNS TO LOOK MORE LIKE A TYPICAL RETAILER. BOTH BUTTERFIELDS AND KRUSE HAVE SIGNIFICANT QUARTER-TO-QUARTER VARIATIONS IN THEIR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DEPENDING ON THE TIMING OF AUCTIONS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF HIGH QUALITY ITEMS FROM LARGE COLLECTIONS AND ESTATES. BUTTERFIELDS TYPICALLY HAS ITS BEST OPERATING RESULTS IN THE TRADITIONAL FALL AND SPRING AUCTION SEASONS AND HAS HISTORICALLY INCURRED OPERATING LOSSES IN THE FIRST AND THIRD QUARTERS. KRUSE TYPICALLY SEES A SEASONAL PEAK IN OPERATIONS IN THE THIRD QUARTER. SEASONAL OR CYCLICAL VARIATIONS IN OUR BUSINESS MAY BECOME MORE PRONOUNCED OVER TIME AND MAY HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE. WE ARE DEPENDENT ON THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF ONLINE COMMERCE THE BUSINESS OF SELLING GOODS OVER THE INTERNET, PARTICULARLY THROUGH PERSONAL TRADING, IS NEW AND DYNAMIC. OUR FUTURE NET REVENUES AND PROFITS WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT UPON THE WIDESPREAD ACCEPTANCE OF THE INTERNET AND ONLINE SERVICES AS A MEDIUM FOR COMMERCE BY CONSUMERS. RAPID GROWTH IN THE USE OF AND INTEREST IN THE INTERNET AND ONLINE SERVICES IS A RECENT PHENOMENON. THIS ACCEPTANCE AND USE MAY NOT CONTINUE. EVEN IF THE INTERNET IS ACCEPTED, CONCERNS ABOUT FRAUD, PRIVACY AND OTHER PROBLEMS MAY MEAN THAT A SUFFICIENTLY BROAD BASE OF CONSUMERS WILL NOT ADOPT THE INTERNET AS A MEDIUM OF COMMERCE. IN PARTICULAR, OUR WEBSITE REQUIRES USERS TO MAKE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE THEIR E-MAIL ADDRESSES AND OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT SOME POTENTIAL USERS MAY BE UNWILLING TO PROVIDE. THESE CONCERNS MAY INCREASE AS ADDITIONAL PUBLICITY OVER PRIVACY ISSUES ON EBAY OR GENERALLY OVER THE INTERNET INCREASE. MARKET ACCEPTANCE FOR RECENTLY INTRODUCED SERVICES AND PRODUCTS OVER THE INTERNET IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN, AND THERE ARE FEW PROVEN SERVICES AND PRODUCTS. IN ORDER TO EXPAND OUR USER BASE, WE MUST APPEAL TO AND ACQUIRE CONSUMERS WHO HISTORICALLY HAVE USED TRADITIONAL MEANS OF COMMERCE TO PURCHASE GOODS. IF THESE CONSUMERS PROVE TO BE LESS ACTIVE THAN OUR EARLIER USERS, AND WE ARE UNABLE TO GAIN EFFICIENCIES IN OUR OPERATING COSTS, INCLUDING OUR COST OF ACQUIRING NEW CUSTOMERS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. OUR BUSINESS MAY BE SUBJECT TO SALES AND OTHER TAXES WE DO NOT COLLECT SALES OR OTHER SIMILAR TAXES ON GOODS SOLD BY USERS THROUGH OUR SERVICE. ONE OR MORE STATES MAY SEEK TO IMPOSE SALES TAX COLLECTION OBLIGATIONS ON COMPANIES SUCH AS OURS THAT ENGAGE IN OR FACILITATE ONLINE COMMERCE. SEVERAL PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN MADE AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL THAT WOULD IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TAXES ON THE SALE OF GOODS AND SERVICES THROUGH THE INTERNET. THESE PROPOSALS, IF ADOPTED, COULD SUBSTANTIALLY IMPAIR THE GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE, AND COULD DIMINISH OUR OPPORTUNITY TO DERIVE FINANCIAL BENEFIT FROM OUR ACTIVITIES. IN 1998, THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENACTED LEGISLATION PROHIBITING STATES OR OTHER LOCAL AUTHORITIES FROM IMPOSING NEW TAXES ON INTERNET COMMERCE FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS. THIS TAX MORATORIUM WILL LAST ONLY FOR A LIMITED PERIOD AND DOES NOT PROHIBIT STATES OR THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE FROM COLLECTING TAXES ON OUR INCOME, IF ANY, OR FROM COLLECTING TAXES THAT ARE DUE UNDER EXISTING TAX RULES. A SUCCESSFUL ASSERTION BY ONE OR MORE STATES OR ANY FOREIGN COUNTRY THAT WE SHOULD COLLECT SALES OR OTHER TAXES ON THE EXCHANGE OF MERCHANDISE ON OUR SYSTEM WOULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. WE ARE DEPENDENT ON KEY PERSONNEL OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON THE CONTINUED SERVICES OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE ALSO WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR OTHER OFFICERS AND KEY PERSONNEL. THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF ANY OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OR OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. WE DO NOT HAVE LONG-TERM EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS WITH ANY OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL, AND WE DO NOT MAINTAIN ANY "KEY PERSON" LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES. OUR NEW BUSINESSES ARE ALL DEPENDENT ON ATTRACTING AND RETAINING KEY PERSONNEL. THE LAND-BASED AUCTION BUSINESSES ARE PARTICULARLY DEPENDENT ON SPECIALISTS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIPS THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE ESTABLISHED WITH SELLERS WHO CONSIGN PROPERTY FOR SALE AT AUCTION. WE HAVE HAD SOME TURNOVER OF THESE PERSONNEL, AND CONTINUED LOSSES COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF SIGNIFICANT FUTURE BUSINESS AND WOULD HARM US. IN 41 <PAGE> 43 ADDITION, EMPLOYEE TURNOVER FREQUENTLY INCREASES DURING THE PERIOD FOLLOWING AN ACQUISITION AS EMPLOYEES EVALUATE POSSIBLE CHANGES IN COMPENSATION, CULTURE, REPORTING RELATIONSHIPS, AND THE DIRECTION OF THE BUSINESS. SUCH INCREASED TURNOVER COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS AND REDUCE OUR FUTURE REVENUES. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS ALSO WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, TRAIN, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE HIGHLY SKILLED TECHNICAL, MANAGERIAL, MARKETING AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT PERSONNEL. COMPETITION FOR THESE PERSONNEL IS INTENSE, ESPECIALLY FOR ENGINEERS AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS, ESPECIALLY IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACT, INTEGRATE OR RETAIN SUFFICIENTLY QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. IN MAKING EMPLOYMENT DECISIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE INTERNET AND HIGH-TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES, JOB CANDIDATES OFTEN CONSIDER THE VALUE OF THE STOCK OPTIONS THEY ARE TO RECEIVE IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR EMPLOYMENT. FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR STOCK PRICE MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE EMPLOYEES WHOSE STOCK OPTION STRIKE PRICES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE CURRENT MARKET PRICES. OUR OFFLINE AUCTION BUSINESSES NEED TO CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE AUCTION PROPERTIES THE BUSINESSES OF BUTTERFIELDS AND KRUSE ARE DEPENDENT ON THE CONTINUED ACQUISITION OF HIGH QUALITY AUCTION PROPERTIES FROM SELLERS. THEIR FUTURE SUCCESS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON THEIR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF HIGH QUALITY AUCTION PROPERTY, PARTICULARLY FINE AND DECORATIVE ARTS AND COLLECTIBLES AND COLLECTIBLE AUTOMOBILES, RESPECTIVELY. THERE IS INTENSE COMPETITION FOR THESE PIECES WITH OTHER AUCTION COMPANIES AND DEALERS. IN ADDITION, A SMALL NUMBER OF KEY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND SPECIALISTS MAINTAIN THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF AUCTION PROPERTY AND THE LOSS OF ANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS COULD HARM THE BUSINESS OF BUTTERFIELDS AND KRUSE. OUR OFFLINE AUCTION BUSINESSES COULD SUFFER LOSSES FROM PRICE GUARANTEES, ADVANCES OR RESCISSIONS OF SALES IN ORDER TO SECURE HIGH QUALITY AUCTION PROPERTIES FROM SELLERS, BUTTERFIELDS AND KRUSE MAY GIVE A GUARANTEED MINIMUM PRICE OR A CASH ADVANCE TO A SELLER, BASED ON THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE PROPERTY. IF THE AUCTION PROCEEDS ARE LESS THAN THE AMOUNT GUARANTEED, OR LESS THAN THE AMOUNT ADVANCED AND THE SELLER DOES NOT REPAY THE DIFFERENCE, THE COMPANY INVOLVED WILL SUFFER A LOSS. IN ADDITION, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES A BUYER WHO BELIEVES THAT AN ITEM PURCHASED AT AUCTION DOES NOT HAVE GOOD TITLE, PROVENANCE OR AUTHENTICITY MAY RESCIND THE PURCHASE. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY INVOLVED WILL LOSE ITS COMMISSIONS AND FEES ON THE SALE EVEN IF THE SELLER, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE, IN TURN ACCEPTS BACK THE ITEM AND RETURNS THE FUNDS HE OR SHE RECEIVED FROM THE SALE. WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF OWNING REAL PROPERTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITIONS OF KRUSE AND BUTTERFIELDS WE ACQUIRED REAL PROPERTY INCLUDING LAND, BUILDINGS AND INTERESTS IN PARTNERSHIPS HOLDING LAND AND BUILDINGS. WE HAVE NO EXPERIENCE IN MANAGING REAL PROPERTY. OWNERSHIP OF THIS PROPERTY SUBJECTS US TO NEW RISKS, INCLUDING: - THE POSSIBILITY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FIXING ANY ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS; - ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THESE PROPERTIES, DUE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES, CHANGES IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN WHICH THE PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED, OR OTHER FACTORS; - THE POSSIBLE NEED FOR STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH ZONING, SEISMIC, DISABILITY ACT OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS; AND - POSSIBLE DISPUTES WITH TENANTS, PARTNERS OR OTHERS. OUR MARKET IS INTENSELY COMPETITIVE DEPENDING ON THE CATEGORY OF PRODUCT, WE CURRENTLY OR POTENTIALLY COMPETE WITH A NUMBER OF COMPANIES SERVING PARTICULAR CATEGORIES OF GOODS AS WELL AS THOSE SERVING BROADER RANGES OF GOODS. THE INTERNET IS A NEW, RAPIDLY EVOLVING AND INTENSELY COMPETITIVE AREA. WE EXPECT COMPETITION TO INTENSIFY IN THE FUTURE AS THE BARRIERS TO ENTRY ARE RELATIVELY LOW, AND CURRENT AND NEW COMPETITORS CAN LAUNCH NEW SITES AT A NOMINAL COST USING COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SOFTWARE. OUR BROAD-BASED COMPETITORS INCLUDE THE VAST MAJORITY OF TRADITIONAL DEPARTMENT AND GENERAL MERCHANDISE STORES AS WELL AS EMERGING ONLINE RETAILERS. THESE INCLUDE MOST 42 <PAGE> 44 PROMINENTLY: WAL-MART, KMART, TARGET, SEARS, MACY'S, JC PENNEY, COSTCO, SAM'S CLUB AS WELL AS AMAZON.COM, BUY.COM, AOL.COM, YAHOO! SHOPPING AND MSN. IN ADDITION, WE FACE COMPETITION FROM SPECIALTY RETAILERS AND EXCHANGES IN EACH OF ITS CATEGORIES OF PRODUCTS.

AUCTIONS AND A LARGE NUMBER OF OTHER COMPANIES USING AN AUCTION FORMAT FOR CONSUMER-TO-CONSUMER OR BUSINESS-TO-CONSUMER SALES. OVERSEAS, WE FACE COMPETITION FROM YAHOO! AUCTIONS IN MOST COUNTRIES AND FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF REGIONAL AND NATIONAL COMPETITORS IN EACH COUNTRY. THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS FOR EBAY INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: - ABILITY TO ATTRACT BUYERS; - VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS AND SELECTION OF GOODS; - CUSTOMER SERVICE; AND 43 <PAGE> 45 - BRAND RECOGNITION. WITH RESPECT TO OUR ONLINE COMPETITION, ADDITIONAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS ARE: - COMMUNITY COHESION AND INTERACTION; - SYSTEM RELIABILITY; - RELIABILITY OF DELIVERY AND PAYMENT; - WEBSITE CONVENIENCE AND ACCESSIBILITY; - LEVEL OF SERVICE FEES; AND - QUALITY OF SEARCH TOOLS. SOME CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS HAVE LONGER COMPANY OPERATING HISTORIES, LARGER CUSTOMER BASES AND GREATER BRAND RECOGNITION IN OTHER BUSINESS AND INTERNET SPACES THAN WE DO. SOME OF THESE COMPETITORS ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER FINANCIAL, MARKETING, TECHNICAL AND OTHER RESOURCES. OTHER ONLINE TRADING SERVICES MAY BE ACQUIRED BY, RECEIVE INVESTMENTS FROM OR ENTER INTO OTHER COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH LARGER, WELL-ESTABLISHED AND WELL-FINANCED COMPANIES. AS A RESULT, SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS WITH OTHER REVENUE SOURCES MAY BE ABLE TO DEVOTE MORE RESOURCES TO MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS, ADOPT MORE AGGRESSIVE PRICING POLICIES AND DEVOTE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE RESOURCES TO WEBSITE AND SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT THAN WE ARE ABLE TO. INCREASED COMPETITION MAY RESULT IN REDUCED OPERATING MARGINS, LOSS OF MARKET SHARE AND DIMINISHED VALUE OF OUR BRAND. SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE OFFERED SERVICES FOR FREE, AND OTHERS MAY DO THIS AS WELL. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST CURRENT AND FUTURE COMPETITORS. IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, MAKE PRICING, SERVICE OR MARKETING DECISIONS OR ACQUISITIONS THAT COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED AN INSURANCE PROGRAM THAT GENERALLY INSURES ITEMS UP TO A VALUE OF $200, WITH A $25 DEDUCTIBLE, FOR USERS WITH A NON-NEGATIVE FEEDBACK RATING AT NO COST TO THE USER. NEW TECHNOLOGIES MAY INCREASE THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES BY ENABLING OUR COMPETITORS TO OFFER A LOWER COST SERVICE. SOME INTERNET-BASED APPLICATIONS THAT DIRECT INTERNET TRAFFIC TO CERTAIN WEBSITES MAY CHANNEL USERS TO TRADING SERVICES THAT COMPETE WITH US. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ESTABLISHED INTERNET TRAFFIC ARRANGEMENTS WITH SEVERAL LARGE ONLINE SERVICES AND SEARCH ENGINE COMPANIES, THESE ARRANGEMENTS MAY NOT BE RENEWED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. EVEN IF THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE RENEWED, THEY MAY NOT RESULT IN INCREASED USAGE OF OUR SERVICE. IN ADDITION, COMPANIES THAT CONTROL ACCESS TO TRANSACTIONS THROUGH NETWORK ACCESS OR INTERNET BROWSERS COULD PROMOTE OUR COMPETITORS OR CHARGE US SUBSTANTIAL FEES FOR INCLUSION. THE OFF-LINE AUCTION BUSINESS IS INTENSELY COMPETITIVE. BUTTERFIELDS COMPETES WITH TWO LARGER AND BETTER KNOWN AUCTION COMPANIES, SOTHEBY'S HOLDINGS, INC. AND CHRISTIE'S INTERNATIONAL PLC, AS WELL AS NUMEROUS REGIONAL AUCTION COMPANIES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE COMPANIES INCREASE THEIR FOCUS ON THE MIDDLE MARKET PROPERTIES THAT FORM THE CORE OF BUTTERFIELDS' BUSINESS OR IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES, ITS BUSINESS MAY SUFFER. KRUSE IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM NUMEROUS REGIONAL COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, COMPETITION WITH INTERNET-BASED AUCTIONS MAY HARM THE LAND-BASED AUCTION BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH BILLPOINT'S BUSINESS IS NEW, SEVERAL NEW COMPANIES HAVE ENTERED THIS SPACE, INCLUDING COMPETITORS WHO ARE OFFERING FREE SERVICES AND SIGNIFICANT PROMOTIONAL INCENTIVES, AND LARGE COMPANIES, INCLUDING BANKS AND CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, ARE ALSO BEGINNING TO ENTER THIS SPACE. HALF.COM COMPETES DIRECTLY WITH ONLINE RETAILERS IN ITS PRODUCT CATEGORIES SUCH AS AMAZON.COM WHICH OFFERS A DIRECTLY COMPETITIVE SERVICE, AS WELL AS WITH TRADITIONAL SELLERS OF USED BOOKS, VIDEOS AND CDS. OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF THE INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE THE SUCCESS OF OUR SERVICE WILL DEPEND LARGELY ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF THE INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS INCLUDES MAINTENANCE OF A RELIABLE NETWORK BACKBONE WITH THE NECESSARY SPEED, DATA CAPACITY AND SECURITY, AS WELL AS TIMELY DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS, FOR PROVIDING RELIABLE INTERNET ACCESS AND SERVICES. THE INTERNET HAS EXPERIENCED, AND IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE, SIGNIFICANT 44 <PAGE> 46 GROWTH IN THE NUMBERS OF USERS AND AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC. IF THE INTERNET CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE INCREASED NUMBERS OF USERS, INCREASED FREQUENCY OF USE OR INCREASED BANDWIDTH REQUIREMENTS, THE INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE MAY BE UNABLE TO SUPPORT THE DEMANDS PLACED ON IT. IN ADDITION, THE PERFORMANCE OF THE INTERNET MAY BE HARMED BY INCREASED NUMBER OF USERS OR BANDWIDTH REQUIREMENTS. THE INTERNET HAS EXPERIENCED A VARIETY OF OUTAGES AND OTHER DELAYS AS A RESULT OF DAMAGE TO PORTIONS OF ITS INFRASTRUCTURE, AND IT COULD FACE OUTAGES AND DELAYS IN THE FUTURE. THESE OUTAGES AND DELAYS COULD REDUCE THE LEVEL OF INTERNET USAGE AS WELL AS THE LEVEL OF TRAFFIC AND THE PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS ON OUR SERVICE. OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO ONLINE COMMERCE SECURITY RISKS A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO ONLINE COMMERCE AND COMMUNICATIONS IS THE SECURE TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OVER PUBLIC NETWORKS. OUR SECURITY MEASURES MAY NOT PREVENT SECURITY BREACHES. OUR FAILURE TO PREVENT SECURITY BREACHES COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. CURRENTLY, A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF OUR USERS AUTHORIZE US TO BILL THEIR CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS DIRECTLY FOR ALL TRANSACTION FEES CHARGED BY US. BILLPOINT'S USERS ROUTINELY PROVIDE CREDIT CARD AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION. WE RELY ON ENCRYPTION AND AUTHENTICATION TECHNOLOGY LICENSED FROM THIRD PARTIES TO PROVIDE THE SECURITY AND AUTHENTICATION TECHNOLOGY TO EFFECT SECURE TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING CUSTOMER CREDIT CARD NUMBERS. ADVANCES IN COMPUTER CAPABILITIES, NEW DISCOVERIES IN THE FIELD OF CRYPTOGRAPHY, OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTS MAY RESULT IN A COMPROMISE OR BREACH OF THE TECHNOLOGY USED BY US TO PROTECT CUSTOMER TRANSACTION DATA. A NUMBER OF WEBSITES HAVE REPORTED BREACHES OF THEIR SECURITY. ANY COMPROMISE OF OUR SECURITY COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION AND, THEREFORE, OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, A PARTY WHO IS ABLE TO CIRCUMVENT OUR SECURITY MEASURES COULD MISAPPROPRIATE PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OR CAUSE INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR OPERATIONS. AN INDIVIDUAL HAS CLAIMED TO HAVE MISAPPROPRIATED SOME OF OUR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION BY BREAKING INTO OUR COMPUTER SYSTEM. WE MAY NEED TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO PROTECT AGAINST SECURITY BREACHES OR TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS CAUSED BY BREACHES. THESE ISSUES ARE LIKELY TO BECOME MORE DIFFICULT AS WE EXPAND THE NUMBER OF PLACES WHERE WE OPERATE. SECURITY BREACHES COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND EXPOSE US TO A RISK OF LOSS OR LITIGATION AND POSSIBLE LIABILITY. OUR INSURANCE POLICIES CARRY LOW COVERAGE LIMITS, WHICH MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO REIMBURSE US FOR LOSSES CAUSED BY SECURITY BREACHES. WE MUST KEEP PACE WITH RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE THE SPACE IN WHICH WE COMPETE IS CHARACTERIZED BY RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY, EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, FREQUENT NEW SERVICE AND PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS AND CHANGING CUSTOMER DEMANDS. THESE CHARACTERISTICS ARE WORSENED BY THE EMERGING AND CHANGING NATURE OF THE INTERNET. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS THEREFORE WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO ADAPT TO RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGIES, TO ADAPT OUR SERVICES TO EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE, FEATURES AND RELIABILITY OF OUR SERVICE. OUR FAILURE TO ADAPT TO SUCH CHANGES WOULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. NEW TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PEER TO PEER PERSONAL TRADING TECHNOLOGY, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US. IN ADDITION, THE WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF NEW INTERNET, NETWORKING OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES OR OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES COULD REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES TO MODIFY OR ADAPT OUR SERVICES OR INFRASTRUCTURE. WE NEED TO DEVELOP NEW SERVICES, FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS IN ORDER TO EXPAND WE PLAN TO EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS BY DEVELOPING NEW OR COMPLEMENTARY SERVICES, PRODUCTS OR TRANSACTION FORMATS OR EXPANDING THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF SERVICES. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS IN A COST-EFFECTIVE OR TIMELY MANNER. EVEN IF WE DO EXPAND, WE MAY NOT MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR OVERALL ACCEPTANCE. IF WE LAUNCH A NEW BUSINESS OR SERVICE THAT IS NOT FAVORABLY RECEIVED BY CONSUMERS, IT COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND DIMINISH THE VALUE OF OUR BRAND. WE ANTICIPATE THAT FUTURE SERVICES WILL INCLUDE PRE-AND POST-TRADE SERVICES. WE ARE PURSUING STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIRD PARTIES TO PROVIDE MANY OF THESE SERVICES. BECAUSE WE USE THIRD PARTIES TO DELIVER THESE SERVICES, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTROL THE QUALITY OF THESE SERVICES AND OUR ABILITY TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS IF ANY OF THESE THIRD PARTIES FAILS TO PERFORM ADEQUATELY WILL BE REDUCED. EXPANDING OUR OPERATIONS IN THIS MANNER ALSO WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL EXPENSES AND DEVELOPMENT, OPERATIONS AND OTHER RESOURCES AND WILL STRAIN OUR MANAGEMENT, FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RESOURCES. THE LACK OF ACCEPTANCE OF ANY NEW SERVICES COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. 45 <PAGE> 47 OUR GROWTH WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP OUR BRAND WE BELIEVE THAT OUR HISTORICAL GROWTH HAS BEEN LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO WORD OF MOUTH. WE HAVE BENEFITED FROM FREQUENT AND HIGH VISIBILITY MEDIA EXPOSURE BOTH NATIONALLY AND LOCALLY. WE BELIEVE THAT CONTINUING TO STRENGTHEN OUR BRAND WILL BE CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING WIDESPREAD ACCEPTANCE OF OUR SERVICE. PROMOTING AND POSITIONING OUR BRAND WILL DEPEND LARGELY ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR MARKETING EFFORTS AND OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY SERVICES. IN ORDER TO PROMOTE OUR BRAND, WE WILL NEED TO INCREASE OUR MARKETING BUDGET AND OTHERWISE INCREASE OUR FINANCIAL COMMITMENT TO CREATING AND MAINTAINING BRAND LOYALTY AMONG USERS. BRAND PROMOTION ACTIVITIES MAY NOT YIELD INCREASED REVENUES, AND EVEN IF THEY DO, ANY INCREASED REVENUES MAY NOT OFFSET THE EXPENSES WE INCURRED IN BUILDING OUR BRAND. IF WE DO ATTRACT NEW USERS TO OUR SERVICE, THEY MAY NOT CONDUCT TRANSACTIONS OVER OUR SERVICE ON A REGULAR BASIS. IF WE FAIL TO PROMOTE AND MAINTAIN OUR BRAND OR INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSES IN AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO PROMOTE AND MAINTAIN OUR BRAND, OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE HARMED. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PROTECT OR ENFORCE OUR OWN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ADEQUATELY WE REGARD THE PROTECTION OF OUR URLS, COPYRIGHTS, SERVICE MARKS, TRADEMARKS, TRADE DRESS AND TRADE SECRETS AS CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS. WE RELY ON A COMBINATION OF PATENT, COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, SERVICE MARK AND TRADE SECRET LAWS AND CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CONFIDENTIALITY AND INVENTION ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENTS WITH OUR EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS, AND NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS WITH PARTIES WITH WHOM WE CONDUCT BUSINESS IN ORDER TO LIMIT ACCESS TO AND DISCLOSURE OF OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND THE OTHER STEPS TAKEN BY US TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY NOT PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR TECHNOLOGY OR DETER INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPMENT OF SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES. WE PURSUE THE REGISTRATION OF OUR URLS, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY. EFFECTIVE COPYRIGHT, SERVICE MARK, TRADEMARK, TRADE DRESS AND TRADE SECRET PROTECTION IS VERY EXPENSIVE TO MAINTAIN, AND PROTECTION MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN EVERY COUNTRY IN WHICH OUR SERVICES ARE MADE AVAILABLE ONLINE. FURTHERMORE, WE MUST ALSO PROTECT OUR URLS IN AN INCREASING NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, A PROCESS THAT IS EXPENSIVE AND MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN EVERY LOCATION. WE HAVE LICENSED IN THE PAST, AND EXPECT TO LICENSE IN THE FUTURE, CERTAIN OF OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, SUCH AS TRADEMARKS OR COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL, TO THIRD PARTIES. THESE LICENSEES MAY TAKE ACTIONS THAT MIGHT DIMINISH THE VALUE OF OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OR HARM OUR REPUTATION. WE ALSO RELY ON CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE LICENSE FROM THIRD PARTIES, SUCH AS ORACLE CORPORATION, MICROSOFT CORPORATION AND SUN MICROSYSTEMS INC., THE SUPPLIERS OF KEY DATABASE TECHNOLOGIES, THE OPERATING SYSTEM AND SPECIFIC HARDWARE COMPONENTS FOR OUR SERVICE. THESE THIRD-PARTY TECHNOLOGY LICENSES MAY NOT CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE TO US ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. THE LOSS OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES COULD REQUIRE US TO OBTAIN SUBSTITUTE TECHNOLOGIES OF LOWER QUALITY OR PERFORMANCE STANDARDS OR AT GREATER COST. OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO CONSUMER TRENDS AND DISCRETIONARY CONSUMER SPENDING WE DERIVE MOST OF OUR REVENUES FROM FEES RECEIVED FROM SELLERS FOR LISTING PRODUCTS FOR SALE ON OUR SERVICE AND FEES RECEIVED FROM SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED TRANSACTIONS. OUR FUTURE REVENUES WILL DEPEND UPON CONTINUED DEMAND FOR THE TYPES OF GOODS THAT ARE LISTED BY USERS OF OUR SERVICE. THE POPULARITY OF CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF ITEMS, SUCH AS TOYS, DOLLS AND MEMORABILIA, AMONG CONSUMERS MAY VARY OVER TIME DUE TO PERCEIVED SCARCITY, SUBJECTIVE VALUE, AND SOCIETAL AND CONSUMER TRENDS IN GENERAL. A DECLINE IN THE POPULARITY OF, OR DEMAND FOR, CERTAIN COLLECTIBLES OR OTHER ITEMS SOLD THROUGH OUR SERVICE COULD REDUCE THE OVERALL VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS ON OUR SERVICE, RESULTING IN REDUCED REVENUES. IN ADDITION, CONSUMER "FADS" MAY TEMPORARILY INFLATE THE VOLUME OF CERTAIN TYPES OF ITEMS LISTED ON OUR SERVICE, PLACING A SIGNIFICANT STRAIN UPON OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSACTION CAPACITY. THESE TRENDS ALSO MAY CAUSE FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS FROM ONE REPORTING PERIOD TO THE NEXT. ANY DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR THE GOODS OFFERED THROUGH OUR SERVICE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN CONSUMER TRENDS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. A DECLINE IN CONSUMER SPENDING WOULD HARM OUR LAND-BASED AUCTION BUSINESSES. SALES OF FINE AND DECORATIVE ART, COLLECTABLE CARS AND OTHER COLLECTIBLES WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A DECLINE IN DISCRETIONARY CONSUMER SPENDING, ESPECIALLY FOR LUXURY ITEMS. CHANGES IN BUYERS' TASTES, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR CONSUMER TRENDS COULD CAUSE DECLINES IN THE NUMBER OR DOLLAR VOLUME OF ITEMS SOLD AND THEREBY HARM THE BUSINESS OF THESE COMPANIES. 46 <PAGE> 48 SOME ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS MAY AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE UP TO 10,000,000 SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK AND TO DETERMINE THE PREFERENCES, RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES OF THOSE SHARES WITHOUT ANY FURTHER VOTE OR ACTION BY THE STOCKHOLDERS. THE RIGHTS OF THE HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK MAY BE HARMED BY THE RIGHTS OF THE HOLDERS OF ANY PREFERRED STOCK THAT MAY BE ISSUED IN THE FUTURE. SOME PROVISIONS OF OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR A THIRD PARTY TO ACQUIRE A MAJORITY OF OUR OUTSTANDING VOTING STOCK. THESE INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT PROVIDE FOR A CLASSIFIED BOARD OF DIRECTORS, PROHIBIT STOCKHOLDERS FROM TAKING ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT AND RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF STOCKHOLDERS TO CALL SPECIAL MEETINGS. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO PROVISIONS OF DELAWARE LAW THAT PROHIBIT US FROM ENGAGING IN ANY BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH ANY INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS FROM THE DATE THE PERSON BECAME AN INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER, UNLESS CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET. THIS RESTRICTION COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF DELAYING OR PREVENTING A CHANGE OF CONTROL. WE ARE CONTROLLED BY CERTAIN STOCKHOLDERS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS (AND THEIR AFFILIATES) OWN APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK. AS A RESULT, THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTROL OUR COMPANY AND DIRECT OUR AFFAIRS AND BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS AND APPROVAL OF SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS. THIS CONCENTRATION OF OWNERSHIP MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF DELAYING, DEFERRING OR PREVENTING A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF OUR COMPANY AND MAY MAKE SOME TRANSACTIONS MORE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF THESE STOCKHOLDERS. ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD DECREASE THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK INTEREST RATE RISK THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF OUR INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES IS TO PRESERVE PRINCIPAL WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAXIMIZING YIELDS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING RISK. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, WE MAINTAIN OUR PORTFOLIO OF CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IN A VARIETY OF SECURITIES, INCLUDING BOTH GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE OBLIGATIONS AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS. THESE SECURITIES ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND CONSEQUENTLY ARE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, NET OF ESTIMATED TAX. INVESTMENTS IN BOTH FIXED RATE AND FLOATING RATE INTEREST EARNING INSTRUMENTS CARRY VARYING DEGREES OF INTEREST RATE RISK. FIXED RATE SECURITIES MAY HAVE THEIR FAIR MARKET VALUE ADVERSELY IMPACTED DUE TO A RISE IN INTEREST RATES. IN GENERAL, LONGER DATED SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER INTEREST RATE RISK THAN SHORTER DATED SECURITIES. WHILE FLOATING RATE SECURITIES GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT TO LESS INTEREST RATE RISK THAN FIXED RATE SECURITIES, FLOATING RATE SECURITIES MAY PRODUCE LESS INCOME THAN EXPECTED IF INTEREST RATES DECREASE. DUE IN PART TO THESE FACTORS, OUR INVESTMENT INCOME MAY FALL SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS OR WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES IN PRINCIPAL IF SECURITIES ARE SOLD THAT HAVE DECLINED IN MARKET VALUE DUE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000, OUR FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS EARNED A PRETAX YIELD OF APPROXIMATELY 6.4% AND HAD A WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF 0.6 YEARS. IF INTEREST RATES WERE TO INSTANTANEOUSLY INCREASE (DECREASE) BY 100 BASIS POINTS USING A DURATION MODELING TECHNIQUE, THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE TOTAL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COULD DECREASE (INCREASE) BY APPROXIMATELY $4.9 MILLION. ASSUMING AN AVERAGE INVESTMENT BALANCE OF $750 MILLION, IF RATES WERE TO INCREASE (DECREASE) BY 100 BASIS POINTS, THIS WOULD TRANSLATE TO AN INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INTEREST INCOME OF $7.5 MILLION ANNUALLY. WE ENTERED INTO TWO INTEREST RATE SWAPS ON JUNE 19 AND JULY 20, 2000 TOTALING $95 MILLION TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES ON A PORTION OF THE FLOATING RATE OPERATING LEASE FOR OUR FACILITIES. THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS ALLOW FOR US TO RECEIVE FLOATING RATE RECEIPTS BASED ON LIBOR IN EXCHANGE FOR MAKING FIXED RATE PAYMENTS WHICH EFFECTIVELY CHANGES OUR INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE ON OUR OPERATING LEASE FROM A FLOATING RATE TO A FIXED RATE ON $95 MILLION OF THE TOTAL $126.4 MILLION OPERATING LEASE. OF THE $126.4 MILLION OPERATING LEASE, THE INTEREST RATE IS FIXED ON $95 MILLION WITH THE BALANCE OF $31.4 MILLION REMAINING AT A FLOATING RATE OF INTEREST BASED ON THE SPREAD OVER 3-MONTH LIBOR. IF THE 3-MONTH LIBOR RATES WERE TO INCREASE (DECREASE) BY 100 BASIS POINTS, THEN OUR LEASE PAYMENTS WOULD INCREASE (DECREASE) BY $78,000 PER QUARTER. 47 <PAGE> 49 EQUITY PRICE RISK WE ARE EXPOSED TO EQUITY PRICE RISK ON THE MARKETABLE PORTION OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS AS SUCH INVESTMENTS WE HOLD, TYPICALLY AS THE RESULT OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN STRATEGIC PARTNERS ARE SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE MARKET RISK DUE TO THEIR VOLATILITY. WE TYPICALLY DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE OUR MARKET EXPOSURE IN THESE EQUITY INVESTMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000, THE POSITION IN EQUITY INVESTMENTS INCLUDED A NET UNREALIZED LOSS OF $1.6 MILLION, NET OF TAX. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK INTERNATIONAL SALES ARE MADE MOSTLY FROM OUR SALES IN THE RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND ARE TYPICALLY DENOMINATED IN THE LOCAL CURRENCY OF EACH COUNTRY. THESE SUBSIDIARIES ALSO INCUR MOST OF THEIR EXPENSES IN THE LOCAL CURRENCY. ACCORDINGLY, ALL FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES USE THE LOCAL CURRENCY AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS TYPICAL OF AN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIFFERING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN POLITICAL CLIMATE, DIFFERING TAX STRUCTURES, OTHER REGULATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS, AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY. ACCORDINGLY, OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN THESE OR OTHER FACTORS. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE TYPICALLY DENOMINATED IN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY IN ORDER TO CENTRALIZE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK WITH THE PARENT COMPANY IN THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AS THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS IN CONSOLIDATION. AS EXCHANGE RATES VARY, THESE RESULTS, WHEN TRANSLATED, MAY VARY FROM EXPECTATIONS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OVERALL EXPECTED PROFITABILITY. THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON EBAY AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000 WAS A TRANSLATION GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY $745,000. ITEM 8:
