FURTHER CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES WILL IMPACT INTEREST EXPENSE ON ANY BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH BEAR INTEREST AT FLOATING RATES, AND THE INTEREST RATE ON ANY COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS WE MAKE AND ANY DEBT SECURITIES WE MAY ISSUE IN THE FUTURE AND, ACCORDINGLY, WILL IMPACT INTEREST EXPENSE. </FONT></DIV><DIV STYLE="LINE-HEIGHT:120%;TEXT-ALIGN:LEFT;TEXT-INDENT:32PX;FONT-SIZE:10PT;"><FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:INHERIT;FONT-SIZE:10PT;"><BR></FONT></DIV><DIV STYLE="LINE-HEIGHT:120%;TEXT-ALIGN:LEFT;TEXT-INDENT:36PX;FONT-SIZE:10PT;"><FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:INHERIT;FONT-SIZE:10PT;">AS OF </FONT><FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:INHERIT;FONT-SIZE:10PT;">DECEMBER&#160;31, 2015</FONT><FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:INHERIT;FONT-SIZE:10PT;">, WE HELD NO DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN AUCTION RATE SECURITIES, COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS, STRUCTURED INVESTMENT VEHICLES OR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES. </FONT></DIV><DIV STYLE="LINE-HEIGHT:120%;TEXT-ALIGN:LEFT;FONT-SIZE:7PT;"><FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:INHERIT;FONT-SIZE:7PT;">&#160;</FONT></DIV><DIV STYLE="LINE-HEIGHT:120%;TEXT-ALIGN:LEFT;TEXT-INDENT:36PX;FONT-SIZE:10PT;"><FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:INHERIT;FONT-SIZE:10PT;">INVESTMENTS IN BOTH FIXED-RATE AND FLOATING-RATE INTEREST-EARNING INSTRUMENTS CARRY VARYING DEGREES OF INTEREST RATE RISK. THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF OUR FIXED-RATE INVESTMENT SECURITIES MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED DUE TO A RISE IN INTEREST RATES. IN GENERAL, FIXED-RATE SECURITIES WITH LONGER MATURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER INTEREST-RATE RISK THAN THOSE WITH SHORTER MATURITIES. WHILE FLOATING RATE SECURITIES GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT TO LESS INTEREST-RATE RISK THAN FIXED-RATE SECURITIES, FLOATING-RATE SECURITIES MAY PRODUCE LESS INCOME THAN EXPECTED IF INTEREST RATES DECREASE AND MAY ALSO SUFFER A DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE IF INTEREST RATES INCREASE. DUE IN PART TO THESE FACTORS, OUR INVESTMENT INCOME MAY FALL SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS OR WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES IN PRINCIPAL IF WE SELL SECURITIES THAT HAVE DECLINED IN MARKET VALUE DUE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES.
