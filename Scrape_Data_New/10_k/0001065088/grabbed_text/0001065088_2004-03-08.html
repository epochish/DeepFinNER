TO SUPPORT THIS GROWTH, WE INCREASED OUR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF FROM 415 AT DECEMBER&NBSP;31, 2001 TO 1,253 AT DECEMBER&NBSP;31, 2002, WHICH INCLUDES THE ADDITION OF APPROXIMATELY 360 GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EMPLOYEES RESULTING FROM OUR ACQUISITION OF PAYPAL.

DURING 2003. </FONT> <P ALIGN="LEFT"> <B><I><FONT SIZE="2">NON-OPERATING ITEMS</FONT></I></B> <P ALIGN="LEFT"> <I><FONT SIZE="2">INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET</FONT></I> <CENTER> <TABLE WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="CENTER" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0" BORDER="0"> <TR> <TD WIDTH="48%"><FONT SIZE="2">&NBSP;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH="3%"><FONT SIZE="2">&NBSP;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH="3%"><FONT SIZE="2">&NBSP;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH="1%"><FONT SIZE="2">&NBSP;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH="3%"><FONT SIZE="2">&NBSP;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH="3%"><FONT SIZE="2">&NBSP;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH="3%"><FONT SIZE="2">&NBSP;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH="3%"><FONT SIZE="2">&NBSP;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH="2%"><FONT SIZE="2">&NBSP;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH="3%"><FONT SIZE="2">&NBSP;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH="3%"><FONT SIZE="2">&NBSP;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH="1%"><FONT SIZE="2">&NBSP;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH="3%"><FONT SIZE="2">&NBSP;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH="3%"><FONT SIZE="2">&NBSP;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH="4%"><FONT SIZE="2">&NBSP;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH="1%"><FONT SIZE="2">&NBSP;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH="3%"><FONT SIZE="2">&NBSP;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH="3%"><FONT SIZE="2">&NBSP;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH="3%"><FONT SIZE="2">&NBSP;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH="1%"><FONT SIZE="2">&NBSP;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH="3%"><FONT SIZE="2">&NBSP;</FONT></TD> </TR> <TR> <TD></TD> <TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN="3"></TD> <TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN="3" ALIGN="CENTER" NOWRAP><B><FONT SIZE="1">PERCENT</FONT></B></TD> <TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN="3"></TD> <TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN="3" ALIGN="CENTER" NOWRAP><B><FONT SIZE="1">PERCENT</FONT></B></TD> <TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN="3"></TD> </TR> <TR> <TD></TD> <TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN="3" ALIGN="CENTER" NOWRAP><B><FONT SIZE="1">2001</FONT></B></TD> <TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN="3" ALIGN="CENTER" NOWRAP><B><FONT SIZE="1">CHANGE</FONT></B></TD> <TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN="3" ALIGN="CENTER" NOWRAP><B><FONT SIZE="1">2002</FONT></B></TD> <TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN="3" ALIGN="CENTER" NOWRAP><B><FONT SIZE="1">CHANGE</FONT></B></TD> <TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN="3" ALIGN="CENTER" NOWRAP><B><FONT SIZE="1">2003</FONT></B></TD> </TR> <TR> <TD></TD> <TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN="3" ALIGN="CENTER" NOWRAP><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></TD> <TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN="3" ALIGN="CENTER" NOWRAP><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></TD> <TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN="3" ALIGN="CENTER" NOWRAP><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></TD> <TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN="3" ALIGN="CENTER" NOWRAP><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></TD> <TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN="3" ALIGN="CENTER" NOWRAP><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></TD> </TR> <TR> <TD></TD> <TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN="19"></TD> </TR> <TR> <TD></TD> <TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN="19" ALIGN="CENTER" NOWRAP><B><FONT SIZE="1">(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENT CHANGES)</FONT></B></TD> </TR> <TR> <TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"> <DIV STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT:10PX;

NON-CASH CHARGES TO EARNINGS INCLUDED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ON OUR LONG-TERM ASSETS, TAX BENEFITS ON THE EXERCISE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS RESULTING FROM OUR INCREASING STOCK PRICE AND THE RELATED INCREASES IN THE PERSONAL GAINS RECOGNIZED BY OUR EMPLOYEES, PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND AUTHORIZED CREDITS RESULTING FROM INCREASING REVENUES, PROVISION FOR TRANSACTION LOSSES RESULTING FROM INCREASED TOTAL PAYMENT VOLUMES PROCESSED BY OUR PAYPAL SUBSIDIARY AND OTHER COSTS. IN 2001, OPERATING CASH FLOWS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CASH USED TO SUPPORT WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS. IN 2002 AND 2003, OPERATING CASH FLOWS WERE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY THE NET CASH AMOUNTS PROVIDED BY YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. DURING 2003, WE USED NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES TO FUND PURCHASES OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, ACQUISITIONS AND REPAYMENTS OF BORROWINGS. NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASE IN OUR AGGREGATE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS BALANCE BY $979.8&NBSP;MILLION IN 2003 TO APPROXIMATELY $2.8&NBSP;BILLION. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT FISCAL 2004 CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO EXCEED NET INCOME. WE BELIEVE THAT EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS, TOGETHER WITH ANY CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. HOWEVER, IF DURING THAT PERIOD OR THEREAFTER WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN GENERATING SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS OR IN RAISING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL WHEN REQUIRED IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS AND ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, OUR BUSINESS COULD SUFFER. </FONT> <P ALIGN="LEFT">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP; <FONT SIZE="2">THE NET CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2001, 2002 AND 2003 WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO THE MOVEMENT OF CASH BETWEEN CASH AND INVESTMENTS, THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, AND ACQUISITIONS.

PURCHASES OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT IN 2003 ALSO INCLUDED AMOUNTS FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO VARIOUS FACILITIES IN THE U.S. AND AROUND THE WORLD AS WELL AS COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE TO SUPPORT OUR SITE OPERATIONS, CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION. WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT TO APPROXIMATE $250&NBSP;MILLION DURING 2004, WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ANY ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE POTENTIAL PURCHASE OF ADDITIONAL FACILITIES.

IN 2001, WE EXPENDED CASH TO ACQUIRE A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN INTERNET AUCTION, LOCATED IN SOUTH KOREA. OUR CASH ACQUISITIONS IN 2002 INCLUDED ACQUIRING THE REMAINING OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN OUR BILLPOINT SUBSIDIARY AND A 38% INTEREST IN EACHNET, LOCATED IN CHINA.

THIS PROCESS REQUIRES A CALCULATION OF TAXES PAYABLE UNDER CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX LAWS AROUND THE WORLD AND AN ANALYSIS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE BOOK AND TAX BASES OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, INCLUDING VARIOUS ACCRUALS, ALLOWANCES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. THE TAX EFFECT OF THESE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES AND THE ESTIMATED TAX BENEFIT FROM OUR TAX NET OPERATING LOSSES ARE REPORTED AS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. WE ALSO ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE REALIZED FROM FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME PORTION, OR ALL OF, THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL NOT BE REALIZED, WE ESTABLISH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE. TO THE EXTENT WE ESTABLISH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OR CHANGE THE ALLOWANCE IN A PERIOD, WE REFLECT THE CHANGE WITH A CORRESPONDING INCREASE OR DECREASE IN OUR TAX PROVISION IN OUR INCOME STATEMENT. WHERE THE CHANGE IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATES TO THE DEDUCTION FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXERCISES, THE CHANGE IS REFLECTED AS A CREDIT TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL. AS EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXERCISES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON OUR STOCK PRICE, IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE AMOUNT OF DEDUCTIONS THAT WILL BE GENERATED FROM FUTURE OPTION EXERCISES AND, THEREFORE, FOR US TO ASCERTAIN THE AMOUNT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXERCISES THAT MAY BE REALIZED IN FUTURE PERIODS.

WHILE MANY ASPECTS OF THESE REGULATIONS REMAIN UNCLEAR, THEY PURPORT TO LIMIT AND REQUIRE LICENSING OF VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE PROVISION OF INTERNET INFORMATION SERVICES. THESE REGULATIONS HAVE CREATED SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE LEGALITY OF FOREIGN INVESTMENTS IN PRC INTERNET COMPANIES, INCLUDING EACHNET AND THE BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF SUCH COMPANIES. IN ORDER TO MEET LOCAL OWNERSHIP AND REGULATORY LICENSING REQUIREMENTS, THE EACHNET WEBSITE IS OPERATED THROUGH A FOREIGN-OWNED ENTERPRISE INDIRECTLY OWNED BY EACHNET INC., WHICH ACTS IN COOPERATION WITH A LOCAL PRC COMPANY OWNED BY CERTAIN EACHNET EMPLOYEES. WE BELIEVE EACHNET&#146;S CURRENT OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE COMPLIES WITH ALL EXISTING PRC LAWS, RULES, AND REGULATIONS. THERE ARE, HOWEVER, SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE INTERPRETATION OF CURRENT PRC LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE PRC GOVERNMENT WILL ULTIMATELY TAKE A VIEW CONTRARY TO OURS. THERE ARE ALSO UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING EACHNET&#146;S ABILITY TO ENFORCE CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS IT HAS ENTERED INTO WITH RESPECT TO MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF THE COMPANY&#146;S BUSINESS.

BECAUSE WE CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT AND GROWING PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WE FACE EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN NON-U.S.&NBSP;CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. IN CONNECTION WITH ITS MULTI-CURRENCY SERVICE, PAYPAL FIXES EXCHANGE RATES TWICE PER DAY, AND MAY FACE FINANCIAL EXPOSURE IF IT INCORRECTLY FIXES THE EXCHANGE RATE. PAYPAL ALSO HOLDS SOME CORPORATE FUNDS IN NON-U.S.&NBSP;CURRENCIES TO FACILITATE CUSTOMER WITHDRAWALS, AND THUS ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY THE TRANSLATION OF THESE NON-U.S.&NBSP;CURRENCIES INTO U.S.&NBSP;DOLLARS. IN ADDITION, THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF OUR INTERNATIONALLY FOCUSED WEBSITES ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AS THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THE APPLICABLE SUBSIDIARIES ARE TRANSLATED FROM THE LOCAL CURRENCY INTO U.S.&NBSP;DOLLARS UPON CONSOLIDATION. IF THE U.S.&NBSP;DOLLAR WEAKENS AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES, AS IT DID DURING 2003, THE TRANSLATION OF THESE FOREIGN-CURRENCY-DENOMINATED TRANSACTIONS WILL RESULT IN INCREASED NET REVENUES, OPERATING EXPENSES, AND NET INCOME. THE CHANGE IN WEIGHTED AVERAGE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN 2003 RELATIVE TO THE COMPARABLE RATES USED IN PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED 2002 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN NET REVENUE OF APPROXIMATELY $82.0&NBSP;MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $37.9&NBSP;MILLION.

AS EXCHANGE RATES VARY, NET SALES AND OTHER OPERATING RESULTS, WHEN TRANSLATED, MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTATIONS.
