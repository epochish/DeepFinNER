Business Overview       Goldman Sachs is a leading global investment banking and securities firm that provides a wide range of services worldwide to a substantial and diversified client base. As of November 24, 2000, we operated offices in over 20 countries and approximately 35% of our 22,627 employees were based outside the United States.        Goldman Sachs is the successor to a commercial paper business founded in 1869 by Marcus Goldman. On May 7, 1999, we converted from a partnership to a corporation and completed an initial public offering of our common stock.        All references to 2000, 1999 and 1998 refer to our fiscal year ended, or the date, as the context requires, November 24, 2000, November 26, 1999 and November 27, 1998, respectively.        When we use the terms Goldman Sachs, we and our, we mean, after our conversion to corporate form, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries and, prior to our conversion to corporate form, The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and its consolidated subsidiaries.        Financial information concerning our business segments and geographic regions for each of 2000, 1999 and 1998 is set forth in Managements Discussion and Analysis, and the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, in our 2000 Annual Report to Shareholders, which are incorporated by reference in Part II, Items 5, 6, 7, 7A and 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Business Segments       Our activities are divided into two segments:               Global Capital Markets; and             Asset Management and Securities Services.   2    Table of Contents       These segments consist of various product and service offerings that are set forth in the following chart:  Primary Products and Activities by Business Segment                  Asset Management and   Global Capital Markets  Securities Services          Trading and Principal     Investment Banking  Investments               Equity and debt underwriting   Financial restructuring advisory services   Mergers and acquisitions       advisory services   Real estate advisory services      Bank loans   Commodities   Currencies   Equity and fixed income derivatives   Equity and fixed income securities   Principal investments   Proprietary arbitrage   Specialist in securities and options      Commissions   Institutional and       high-net-worth asset       management   Margin lending   Matched book   Merchant banking fees   Increased share of       merchant banking fund       income and gains   Mutual funds   Prime brokerage   Securities lending   Securities and options       clearing services    Global Capital Markets       The Global Capital Markets segment, which represented 72% of 2000 net revenues, consists of the following:              Investment Banking. Investment Banking consists of our  Financial Advisory and Underwriting businesses; and            Trading and Principal Investments. Trading and Principal  Investments consists of our Fixed Income, Currency and  Commodities (FICC), Equities and Principal  Investments businesses.     Investment Banking       Investment Banking represented 32% of 2000 net revenues. We provide a broad range of investment banking services to a diverse group of corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals and seek to develop and maintain long-term relationships with these clients as their lead investment bank.        Our current structure, which is organized along regional, product and industry groups, seeks to combine client-focused investment bankers with execution and industry expertise. Because our businesses are global, we have adapted our organization to meet the demands of our clients in each geographic region. Through our commitment to teamwork, we believe that we provide services in an integrated fashion for the benefit of our clients.        Our investment banking activities are divided into two categories:              Financial Advisory. Financial Advisory includes advisory  assignments with respect to mergers and acquisitions,  divestitures, corporate defense activities, restructurings and  spin-offs; and            Underwriting. Underwriting includes public offerings and  private placements of equity and debt securities.   3   Table of Contents       Financial Advisory. Goldman Sachs is a leading investment bank in worldwide mergers and acquisitions. Our mergers and acquisitions capabilities are evidenced by our significant share of assignments in large, complex transactions for which we provide multiple services, including one-stop acquisition financing, currency hedging and cross-border structuring expertise.        Underwriting. We underwrite a wide range of securities and other instruments, including common and preferred stock, convertible securities, investment-grade debt, high-yield debt, sovereign and emerging markets debt, municipal debt, bank loans, asset-backed securities and real estate-related securities, such as mortgage-backed securities and the securities of real estate investment trusts.        Equity Underwriting. Equity underwriting has been a long-term core strength of Goldman Sachs. As with mergers and acquisitions, we have been particularly successful in winning mandates for large, complex equity underwritings. We believe our leadership in large initial public offerings reflects our expertise in complex transactions, research strength, track record and distribution capabilities. We have also acted as lead manager on many of the largest initial public offerings in the international arena.        We believe that a key factor in our equity underwriting success is the close working relationship among the investment bankers, research analysts and sales force as coordinated by our Equity Capital Markets group. With institutional sales professionals and high-net-worth relationship managers located in every major market around the world, Goldman Sachs has relationships with a large and diverse group of investors.        Debt Underwriting. We engage in the underwriting and origination of various types of debt instruments that we broadly categorize as follows:               investment-grade debt for corporations, governments,  municipalities and agencies;             leveraged finance, which includes high-yield debt and bank loans  for non-investment-grade issuers;             emerging market debt, which includes corporate and sovereign  issues; and             asset-backed securities.         We have employed a focused approach in debt underwriting, emphasizing high value-added areas in servicing our clients.    Trading and Principal Investments       Trading and Principal Investments represented 40% of 2000 net revenues. Our Trading and Principal Investments business facilitates transactions with a diverse group of corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals and takes proprietary positions through market making in, and trading of, fixed income and equity products, currencies, commodities, and swaps and other derivatives. In addition, we engage in floor-based market making as a specialist on U.S. equities and options exchanges. In order to meet the needs of our clients, our Trading and Principal Investments business is diversified across a wide range of products. For example, we make markets in traditional investment-grade debt securities, structure complex derivatives and securitize mortgages and insurance risk. We believe our willingness and ability to take risk distinguishes us from our competitors and substantially enhances our client relationships.        Trading and Principal Investments is divided into three categories:              Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities. We make markets  in and trade fixed income products, currencies and commodities,  structure and enter into a wide variety of derivative  transactions, and engage in proprietary trading and arbitrage  activities;   4    Table of Contents              Equities. We make markets in, act as a specialist for,  and trade equities and equity-related products, structure and  enter into equity derivative transactions, and engage in  proprietary trading and equity arbitrage; and            Principal Investments. Principal Investments primarily  represents net revenues from our merchant banking investments.         Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities. FICC is a large and diversified operation through which we engage in a variety of customer-driven market making and proprietary trading and arbitrage activities. FICCs principal products are:               Bank loans             Commodities             Currencies             Derivatives             Emerging market debt             Global government securities             High-yield securities             Investment-grade corporate securities             Money market instruments             Mortgage securities and loans             Municipal securities         We generate trading net revenues from our customer-driven business in three ways. First, in large, highly liquid markets, we undertake a high volume of transactions for modest spreads. Second, by capitalizing on our strong market relationships and capital position, we also undertake transactions in less liquid markets where spreads are generally larger. Finally, we generate net revenues from structuring and executing transactions that address complex client needs.        In its customer-driven business, FICC strives to deliver high-quality service by offering broad market-making, research and market knowledge to our clients on a global basis and by creating innovative solutions to complex client problems by drawing upon our structuring and trading expertise. In addition, we use our expertise to take positions in markets to facilitate customer transactions when we believe the return is at least commensurate with the risk.        In our proprietary activities, we assume a variety of risks and devote substantial resources to identify, analyze and benefit from these exposures. We leverage our strong research capabilities and capitalize on our proprietary analytical models to analyze information and make informed trading judgments. We seek to benefit from perceived disparities in the value of assets in the trading markets and from macroeconomic and company-specific trends.        A core activity in FICC is market making in a broad array of securities and products. For example, we are a primary dealer in many of the largest government bond markets around the world, including the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom. We are a member of the major futures exchanges, and also have interbank dealer status in the currency markets in New York, London, Tokyo and Hong Kong. Our willingness to make markets in a broad range of fixed income, currency and commodity products and their derivatives is crucial both to our client relationships and to support our underwriting business by providing secondary market liquidity. Our research capabilities include quantitative and qualitative analyses of global economic,  5    Table of Contents  currency and financial market trends, as well as credit analyses of corporate and sovereign fixed income securities.        Equities. Goldman Sachs engages in a variety of market-making, proprietary trading and arbitrage activities in equity securities and equity-related products (such as convertible securities and equity derivative instruments) on a global basis. Goldman Sachs makes markets and positions blocks of stock to facilitate customers transactions and to provide liquidity in the marketplace. Goldman Sachs is a member of most of the major stock exchanges, including New York, London, Frankfurt, Tokyo and Hong Kong.        As agent, we execute brokerage transactions in equity securities for institutional and individual customers that generate commission revenues. Commissions earned on agency transactions are recorded in Asset Management and Securities Services.        In equity trading, as in FICC, we generate net revenues from our customer-driven business in three ways. First, in large, highly liquid principal markets, such as the over-the-counter market for equity securities, we undertake a high volume of transactions for modest spreads. Second, by capitalizing on our strong market relationships and capital position, we also undertake large transactions, such as block trades and positions in securities, in which we benefit from spreads that are generally larger. Finally, we also benefit from structuring complex transactions.        Goldman Sachs is active in the execution of large block trades (trades of 50,000 or more shares). Block transactions, however, expose us to increased risks, including those arising from holding large and concentrated positions. We are also facing decreasing spreads for these trades.        We are active in the listed options and futures markets, and we structure, distribute and execute over-the-counter derivatives on market indices, industry groups and individual company stocks to facilitate customer transactions and our proprietary activities. We develop quantitative strategies and render advice with respect to portfolio hedging and restructuring and asset allocation transactions. We also create specially tailored instruments to enable sophisticated investors to undertake hedging strategies and establish or liquidate investment positions. We are one of the leading participants in the trading and development of equity derivative instruments. We are an active participant in the trading of futures and options on most of the major exchanges in the United States, Europe and Asia.        Our equity arbitrage trading businesses include risk arbitrage (which focuses on event-oriented special situations such as mergers and acquisitions, corporate restructurings, recapitalizations, and legal and regulatory events) and statistical arbitrage (which involves trading strategies based on analyses of historical price relationships among sectors of the equity markets).        On October 31, 2000, we completed our combination with SLK LLC. The combination expanded our existing clearing, off-floor market making and options specialist businesses and resulted in our entering the floor-based securities specialist business.        Trading Risk Management. We believe that our trading and market-making capabilities are key ingredients to our success. While these businesses have generally earned attractive returns, we have in the past incurred significant trading losses in periods of market turbulence, such as in 1994 and the second half of 1998.        Our trading risk management process seeks to balance our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential losses. Risk management includes input from all levels of Goldman Sachs, from the trading desks to the Firmwide Risk Committee. For a further discussion of our risk management policies and procedures, see Managements Discussion and Analysis  Risk Management in the 2000 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated by reference in Part II, Items 7 and 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  6    Table of Contents       Principal Investments. In connection with our merchant banking activities, we invest by making principal investments directly and through funds that we raise and manage. As of November 2000, we managed merchant banking funds with total equity capital commitments from our clients and from Goldman Sachs of $30.85 billion, including funded amounts. Of that total, Goldman Sachs had outstanding commitments to invest up to $1.74 billion. The funds investments generate capital appreciation or depreciation and, upon disposition, realized gains or losses. See  Asset Management and Securities Services  Asset Management  Merchant Banking for a discussion of our merchant banking funds. As of November 2000, the aggregate carrying value of our principal investments held directly or through our merchant banking funds was approximately $3.52 billion, which consisted of corporate principal investments with an aggregate carrying value of approximately $2.51 billion and real estate investments with an aggregate carrying value of approximately $1.01 billion.  Asset Management and Securities Services       The components of the Asset Management and Securities Services segment, which represented 28% of 2000 net revenues, are set forth below:              Asset Management. Asset Management generates management  fees by providing investment advisory services to a diverse  client base of institutions and individuals;            Securities Services. Securities Services includes prime  brokerage, financing services and securities lending, and our  matched book businesses, all of which generate revenue primarily  in the form of fees or interest rate spreads; and            Commissions. Commissions includes clearing and agency  transactions for clients on major stock, options and futures  exchanges and revenues from the increased share of the income  and gains derived from our merchant banking funds.     Asset Management       Goldman Sachs is seeking to build a premier global asset management business. We offer a broad array of investment strategies and advice across all major asset classes: global equity; fixed income, including money markets; currency; and alternative investment products (i.e., investment vehicles with non-traditional investment objectives and/or strategies). We have devoted, and continue to devote, significant resources to our asset management business.        Assets under supervision consist of assets under management and other client assets. Assets under management typically generate fees based on a percentage of their value and include our mutual funds, separate accounts managed for institutional and individual investors, our merchant banking funds and other alternative investment funds. Other client assets consist of assets in brokerage accounts of primarily high-net-worth individuals, on which we earn commissions. Substantially all assets under supervision are valued as of calendar month-end.  7    Table of Contents       Our growth in assets under supervision is set forth in the graph below:  Assets Under Supervision  (in billions)   [BAR CHART: ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION]           As of November 30, 2000, equities and alternative investments represented 56% of our total assets under management. Since 1996, these two asset classes have been the primary drivers of our growth in assets under management.        The following table sets forth the amount of assets under management by asset class:  Assets Under Management by Asset Class  (in billions)                                        As of November          2000  1999  1998              Asset Class                                Equity    $ 107     $ 98     $ 69         Fixed income and currency      57       58       50         Money markets      72       48       46         Alternative investments(1)      58       54       30                                 Total    $ 294     $ 258     $ 195                                        (1)    Includes private equity, real estate, quantitative asset  allocation and other similar funds that we manage.            Clients. Our primary clients are institutions, high-net-worth individuals and retail investors. We access clients through both direct and third-party channels. Our institutional clients include corporations, insurance companies, pension funds, foundations and endowments. In the third-party distribution channel, we distribute our mutual funds on a worldwide basis through banks, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries.  8   Table of Contents       The table below sets forth the amount of assets under supervision by distribution channel and client category as of November 30, 2000:  Assets Under Supervision by Distribution Channel  (in billions)                             Assets Under       Supervision(1)  Primary Investment Vehicles              Directly distributed                           Institutional    $ 132       Separate managed accounts            High-net-worth individuals      274       Commingled vehicles                   Brokerage accounts                   Limited partnerships                   Separate managed accounts          Third-party distributed                           Institutional and retail      67       Mutual funds                           Total    $ 473                                          (1)    Excludes $19 billion in our merchant banking funds.     Merchant Banking. Goldman Sachs has also established a successful record in the corporate and real estate merchant banking business, sponsoring funds with $30.85 billion of committed capital as of November 2000, of which $19.27 billion has been funded. We have provided a portion of those amounts, as we describe above under  Global Capital Markets  Trading and Principal Investments  Principal Investments. Our clients, including pension plans, endowments, charitable institutions and high-net-worth individuals, have provided the remainder.        Our strategy with respect to our merchant banking funds generally is to invest opportunistically to build a portfolio of investments that is diversified by industry, product type, geographic region and transaction structure and type. Some of these investment funds pursue, on a global basis, long-term investments in equity and debt securities in privately negotiated transactions, leveraged buyouts and acquisitions. As of November 2000, our corporate merchant banking funds had total committed capital of $21.23 billion. Other funds, with total committed capital of $9.62 billion as of November 2000, invest in real estate operating companies, debt and equity interests in real estate assets, and other real estate-related investments.        Merchant banking activities generate three revenue streams. First, we receive a management fee that is generally a percentage of a funds committed capital, invested capital, total gross acquisition cost or asset value. These annual management fees are included in our Asset Management revenues. Second, Goldman Sachs, as a substantial investor in these funds, is allocated its proportionate share of the funds unrealized appreciation or depreciation arising from changes in fair value as well as gains and losses upon realization. These items are included in the Trading and Principal Investments component of Global Capital Markets. Finally, after the fund has achieved a minimum return for fund investors, we receive an increased share of the funds income and gains that is a percentage, typically 20%, of the income and gains from the funds investments. Revenues from the increased share of the funds income and gains are included in Commissions.    Securities Services       Securities Services consists predominantly of Global Securities Services, which provides prime brokerage, financing services and securities lending to a diversified U.S. and international customer base, including hedge funds, pension funds and high-net-worth individuals. Securities Services also includes our matched book businesses.  9    Table of Contents       We offer prime brokerage services to our clients, allowing them the flexibility to trade with most brokers while maintaining a single source for financing and portfolio reports. Our prime brokerage activities provide multi-product clearing and custody in 49 markets, consolidated multi-currency accounting and reporting and offshore fund administration and also provide servicing for our most active clients. Additionally, we provide financing to our clients through margin loans collateralized by securities held in the clients account.        Securities lending activities principally involve the borrowing and lending of equity securities to cover customer and Goldman Sachs short sales and to finance Goldman Sachs long positions. In addition, we are an active participant in the broker-to-broker securities lending business and the third-party agency lending business.    Commissions       Goldman Sachs generates commissions by executing clearing and agency transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide. We effect agency transactions for clients located throughout the world. As discussed above, commissions also includes the increased share of income and gains from merchant banking funds as well as commissions earned from brokerage transactions. For a discussion regarding our increased share of the income and gains from our merchant banking funds, see  Asset Management  Merchant Banking above.  Global Investment Research       Our Global Investment Research Department provides fundamental research on economies, debt and equity markets, commodities markets, industries and companies on a worldwide basis.        Global Investment Research employs a team approach that as of November 2000 provided research coverage of approximately 2,400 companies worldwide, over 50 economies and 25 stock markets. This is accomplished by four groups:               the Commodities Research group, which provides research on the  global commodity markets;             the Company/Industry group, which provides fundamental analysis,  forecasts and investment recommendations for companies and  industries worldwide. Equity research analysts are organized  regionally by sector and globally into more than 20 industry  teams, which allows for extensive collaboration and knowledge  sharing on important investment themes;             the Economic Research group, which formulates macroeconomic  forecasts for economic activity, foreign exchange and interest  rates based on the globally coordinated views of its regional  economists; and             the Portfolio Strategy group, which forecasts equity market  returns and provides recommendations on both asset allocation  and industry representation.   Technology and Internet Strategy       Technology, in general, and the Internet, in particular, are fundamental to our overall business strategy. Goldman Sachs is committed to the ongoing development, maintenance and use of technology throughout the organization. We have developed significant software and systems over the past several years. Our technology initiatives can be broadly categorized into three efforts:               enhancing client service through increased connectivity and the  provision of high value-added, tailored services;             risk management; and             overall efficiency and control.   10   Table of Contents       We have tailored our services to our clients by providing them with electronic access to our products and services. For example, we developed the GS Financial WorkbenchSM, an Internet Web site that clients and employees can use to download research reports, access earnings and valuation models, submit trades, monitor accounts, build and view presentations, calculate derivative prices and view market data. First made available in 1995, the GS Financial WorkbenchSM represents a joint effort among all of our business areas to create one comprehensive site for clients and employees to access our products and services.        We have also developed software that enables us to monitor and analyze our market and credit risks. This risk management software not only analyzes market risk on firmwide, divisional and trading desk levels, but also breaks down our risk into its underlying exposures, permitting management to evaluate exposures on the basis of specific interest rate, currency rate, equity price or commodity price changes. To assist further in the management of our credit exposures, data from many sources are aggregated daily into credit management systems that give senior management and professionals in the Credit and Controllers departments the ability to receive timely information with respect to credit exposures worldwide, including netting information, and the ability to analyze complex risk situations effectively. Our software accesses this data, allows for quick analysis at the level of individual trades, and interacts with other Goldman Sachs systems.        Technology has also been a significant factor in improving the overall efficiency of many areas of Goldman Sachs. By automating many trading procedures and operational and accounting processes, we have substantially increased our efficiency and accuracy.        We remain committed to being at the forefront of technological innovation in the global capital markets. To pursue our strategy of expanding our electronic market-making capabilities, in 1999 we acquired The Hull Group, a leading global electronic market maker in exchange-traded equity derivatives and an active market maker in equity securities worldwide. In October 2000 we combined with SLK. The SLK transaction extended our leadership in the development and application of sophisticated trading, execution and clearing technology. For example, SLK is a leading handler of electronic order flow on the New York Stock Exchange and a leader in developing advanced trading technology, such as its proprietary suite of REDI® products. The REDI® products give clients real-time electronic access to equity and options markets.        We believe that Internet technology and electronic commerce will, over time, change the ways that securities and other financial products are traded and distributed, which will create both opportunities and challenges for our businesses. In response, we have established a program of internal development and external investment.        Internally, we are extending our global electronic trading and information distribution capabilities to our clients via the Internet. These capabilities cover many of our fixed income, currency, commodity, equity and mutual fund products around the world. We are also using the Internet to improve the ease and quality of communication with our institutional and high-net-worth clients. For example, investors have on-line access to our investment research, mutual fund data and valuation models. In addition, our high-net-worth clients are increasingly accessing their portfolio information over the Internet. We are developing a more advanced Internet platform to enhance the services we provide to our high-net-worth clients and in our wealth management business.        Externally, we have invested in several electronic commerce concerns that provide new trading platforms and services. Through these investments, we gain an increased understanding of business developments and opportunities for increased automation and efficiency.  11    Table of Contents Employees       Management believes that one of the strengths and principal reasons for the success of Goldman Sachs is the quality and dedication of its people and the shared sense of being part of a team. We strive to maintain a work environment that fosters professionalism, excellence, diversity and cooperation among our employees worldwide.        Instilling the Goldman Sachs culture in all employees is a continuous process, in which training plays an important part. All employees are offered the opportunity to participate in education and periodic seminars that we sponsor at various locations throughout the world. Another important part of instilling the Goldman Sachs culture is our employee review process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors, co-workers and employees they supervise in a 360-degree review process that is integral to our team approach.        As of November 2000, we had 22,627 employees, which includes employees of our SLK subsidiaries but excludes employees of Goldman Sachs two property management subsidiaries. Substantially all of the costs of these property management employees are reimbursed to Goldman Sachs by the real estate investment funds to which these subsidiaries provide property management services.  Competition       The financial services industry  and all of our businesses  are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. Our competitors are other brokers and dealers, investment banking firms, insurance companies, investment advisors, mutual funds, hedge funds, commercial banks and merchant banks. We compete with some of our competitors globally and with others on a regional, product or niche basis. Our competition is based on a number of factors, including transaction execution, our products and services, innovation, reputation and price.        We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees.        In recent years, there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry. In particular, a number of large commercial banks, insurance companies and other broad-based financial services firms have established or acquired broker-dealers or have merged with other financial institutions. Many of these firms have the ability to offer a wide range of products, from loans, deposit taking and insurance to brokerage, asset management and investment banking services, which may enhance their competitive position. They also have the ability to support investment banking and securities products with commercial banking, insurance and other financial services revenues in an effort to gain market share, which could result in pricing pressure in our businesses. Moreover, we have faced, and expect to continue to face, pressure to retain market share by committing capital to businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may not be commensurate with their risks.        U.S. federal financial modernization legislation has expanded the activities permissible for firms affiliated with a U.S. bank. The legislation, among other things, enables U.S. banks and insurance firms to affiliate, facilitates affiliations between U.S. banks and securities firms, and expands the permissible principal investing activities of U.S. banking organizations. This legislation may further accelerate consolidation and increase competition in the financial services industry and will enable banking organizations to compete more effectively across a broad range of activities.        The trend toward consolidation and convergence has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors. This trend has also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions. In order to take  12    Table of Contents  advantage of some of our most significant challenges and opportunities, we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions that are larger and better capitalized and that may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history outside the United States.        We have experienced intense price competition in some of our businesses in recent years. For example, equity and debt underwriting discounts have been under pressure for a number of years and the ability to execute trades electronically, through the Internet and through other alternative trading systems, may increase the pressure on trading commissions. It appears that this trend toward alternative trading systems will continue and probably accelerate. Similarly, underwriting spreads in certain privatizations have been subject to considerable pressure. We believe that we may experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices.  Regulation       Goldman Sachs, as a participant in the securities and commodity futures and options industries, is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and elsewhere. As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies in the United States and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of customers participating in those markets. They are not, however, charged with protecting the interests of Goldman Sachs shareholders or creditors. In the United States, the SEC is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws. Our principal broker-dealer in the United States is Goldman, Sachs & Co., which is registered as a broker-dealer and as an investment adviser with the SEC and as a broker-dealer in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Self-regulatory organizations, such as the NYSE and the NASD, adopt rules and examine broker-dealers such as Goldman, Sachs & Co. In addition, state securities and other regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over Goldman, Sachs & Co. Similarly, our businesses are also subject to regulation by various non-U.S. governmental and regulatory bodies and self-regulatory authorities in virtually all countries where we have offices. Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, L.P. and certain of its affiliates are registered U.S. broker-dealers and futures commission merchants, and are regulated by the SEC, the NYSE and the NASD.        Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales methods, trade practices among broker-dealers, use and safekeeping of customers funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping, the financing of customers purchases, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, either in the United States or elsewhere, may directly affect the mode of operation and profitability of Goldman Sachs.        The U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies, regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the United States, are empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer or its directors, officers or employees. Occasionally, our subsidiaries have been subject to investigations and proceedings, and sanctions have been imposed for infractions of various regulations relating to our activities, none of which has had a material adverse effect on us or our businesses.        The commodity futures and options industry in the United States is subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended. The CFTC is the federal agency charged with the administration of the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder. Several of Goldman Sachs subsidiaries, including Goldman, Sachs & Co., are registered with the CFTC and act as futures commission merchants, commodity pool operators or commodity trading advisors. The rules and regulations of various self-regulatory organizations, such as the Chicago Board of  13    Table of Contents  Trade, other futures exchanges and the National Futures Association, govern the futures and futures options businesses of these entities.        As a registered broker-dealer and member of various self-regulatory organizations, Goldman, Sachs & Co. is subject to the SECs uniform net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1. This rule specifies the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a significant part of its assets be kept in relatively liquid form. Goldman, Sachs & Co. is also subject to the net capital requirements of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and various securities and commodity exchanges. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.        The SEC and various self-regulatory organizations impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, limit the ratio of subordinated debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the SECs uniform net capital rule imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the SEC for certain withdrawals of capital.        Our specialist businesses are subject to extensive regulation by a number of securities exchanges. The rules of these exchanges generally require our specialists to maintain orderly markets in the securities in which they are specialists. These requirements, in turn, may require us to commit significant amounts of capital to our specialist businesses.        Recently enacted commodities and futures legislation makes significant changes to the commodities and futures markets, as well as to the over-the-counter derivative markets. This legislation contemplates the development of new exchanges to trade commodity and futures products and removes a broad range of over-the-counter derivatives from SEC and CFTC regulation. This legislation, which increases legal certainty for over-the-counter derivative products and hybrid securities, may increase the types of products we offer and may also lead to an increase in competition with respect to some of these products.        Goldman Sachs Financial Markets, L.P. is registered with the SEC as an over-the-counter derivatives dealer and conducts certain over-the-counter derivatives businesses previously conducted by other affiliates.        Goldman Sachs is an active participant in the international fixed income and equity markets. Many of our affiliates that participate in those markets are subject to comprehensive regulations that include some form of capital adequacy rule and other customer protection rules. Goldman Sachs provides investment services in and from the United Kingdom under a regulatory regime that is undergoing comprehensive restructuring aimed at establishing the Financial Services Authority as the United Kingdoms unified financial services regulator. The relevant Goldman Sachs entities in London are at present regulated by the Securities and Futures Authority Limited in respect of their investment banking, individual asset management, brokerage and principal trading activities, and the Investment Management Regulatory Organization in respect of their institutional asset management and fund management activities. Some of these Goldman Sachs entities are also regulated by the London Stock Exchange and other U.K. securities, derivatives and commodities exchanges of which they are members. It is expected, however, that during 2001, all the responsibilities of the Securities and Futures Authority Limited and Investment Management Regulatory Organization will be taken over by the Financial Services Authority. The investment services that are subject to oversight by U.K. regulators are regulated in accordance with European Union directives requiring, among other things, compliance with certain capital adequacy standards, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. These standards, requirements and rules are similarly implemented, under the same directives, throughout the European Union and are broadly comparable in scope and purpose to the regulatory capital and customer protection requirements imposed under the SEC and CFTC rules.  14    Table of Contents  European Union directives also permit local regulation in each jurisdiction, including those in which we operate, to be more restrictive than the requirements of such directives and these local requirements can result in certain competitive disadvantages to Goldman Sachs. In addition, the Japanese Ministry of Finance, the Financial Services Agency, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Osaka Securities Exchange, the Nagoya Stock Exchange, the Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange and the Japan Securities Dealers Association in Japan, the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong, the Bundesbank and other regulatory authorities in Germany, as well as French and Swiss banking authorities, among others, regulate various of our subsidiaries and also have capital standards and other requirements comparable to the rules of the SEC.        Compliance with net capital requirements of these and other regulators could limit those operations of our subsidiaries that require the intensive use of capital, such as underwriting and trading activities, specialist activities and the financing of customer account balances, and also could restrict our ability to withdraw capital from our regulated subsidiaries, which in turn could limit our ability to repay debt or pay dividends on our common stock.  Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business       As an investment banking and securities firm, our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. Over the last year, the financial markets in the United States and elsewhere have exhibited increased volatility and a number of financial indices have declined substantially from their record levels. Also, it is unclear how much longer the U.S. economic expansion will continue.        Uncertain or unfavorable economic and market conditions may adversely affect our businesses and profitability in many ways, including the following:               We generally maintain large trading, specialist and investment  positions. Market fluctuations and volatility may adversely  affect the value of our trading, specialist and investment  positions, including our merchant banking and real estate  investments, and our fixed income, currency, commodity and  equity positions.             The number and size of transactions in which we provide  underwriting, mergers and acquisitions advisory, and other  services may decline. In particular, a decline in the investment  banking services we provide to the technology and related  sectors, including communications, media and entertainment, may  adversely affect our results of operations.             The volume of transactions that we execute for our customers and  as a specialist may decline, which would reduce the revenues we  receive from commissions and spreads. We may also suffer a  decline in the fees we earn for managing assets. Moreover, even  in the absence of uncertain or unfavorable economic or market  conditions, investment performance by our asset management  business below the performance of benchmarks or competitors  could result in a decline in assets under management and  therefore in the fees we receive.             Concentration of risk in the past has increased the losses that  we have incurred in our arbitrage, market making, block trading,  merchant banking, underwriting and lending businesses and may  continue to do so in the future.             In our specialist businesses, we may be obligated by stock  exchange rules to maintain an orderly market, including by  purchasing shares in a declining market. This may result in our  incurring trading losses and an increase in our need for  liquidity.             A prolonged period of uncertain or unfavorable economic or  market conditions could impair our operating results for a long  period of time. In such a case, our revenues may   15    Table of Contents             decline and, if we were unable to reduce expenses at the same  pace, our profit margins would erode.         In addition to the foregoing, we face a number of other risks that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results.        For example, if any of the variety of instruments and strategies we utilize to hedge or otherwise manage our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses. Our hedging strategies and other risk management techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated.        Liquidity, i.e., ready access to funds, is essential to our businesses. Our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the long-term or short-term debt capital markets, an inability to access the repurchase and securities lending markets, or an impairment of our ability to sell assets. Our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time. In addition, a reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and our competitive position and could increase our borrowing costs.        We are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money, securities or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. The amount and duration of our credit exposures have been increasing over the past several years. In addition, we have also experienced, due to competitive factors, pressure to extend credit against less liquid collateral and price more aggressively the credit risks we take. As a clearing member firm, we finance our customer positions and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our customers. Although we regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect Goldman Sachs.        Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies, and the transactions we process have become increasingly complex. If any of our financial, accounting or other data processing systems do not operate properly or are disabled, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses.        Substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against Goldman Sachs could have a material adverse financial effect or cause significant reputational harm to Goldman Sachs, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. We face significant legal risks in our businesses and the volume and amount of damages claimed in litigation against financial intermediaries are increasing. In addition, we would expect legal claims by customers and clients to increase in a market downturn.        Goldman Sachs, as a participant in the financial services industry, is subject to extensive regulation in jurisdictions around the world. We face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Among other things, we could be fined or prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities. New laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our clients may also adversely affect our businesses.        There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years, and we run the risk that employee  16    Table of Contents  misconduct could occur. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases.        The financial services industry  and all of our businesses  are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including transaction execution, our products and services, innovation, reputation and price. We believe that we may experience pricing pressures in the future as some of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices. In recent years, there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry. U.S. federal financial modernization legislation, which significantly expands the activities permissible for firms affiliated with a U.S. bank, may accelerate this consolidation and further increase competition. This trend toward consolidation and convergence has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors. This trend has also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions.        Technology is fundamental to our overall business strategy. The rapid growth of the Internet and e-commerce, and the introduction of new technologies, is changing our business and presenting us with new challenges. Among other things:               We have made a significant commitment to providing investment  banking advisory and underwriting services to the technology and  related sectors and have made substantial investments in  technology and related businesses through our merchant banking  activities. Volatility or a downturn in any of these sectors has  in the past affected adversely, and is likely in the future to  affect adversely, our investment banking and advisory revenues  and the value of our investments.             In addition, securities and futures transactions are now being  conducted through the Internet and other alternative,  non-traditional trading systems, and it appears that the trend  toward alternative trading systems will continue and probably  accelerate. Some of these alternative trading systems compete  with our trading businesses, including our specialist  businesses. A dramatic increase in computer-based or other  electronic trading may adversely affect our commission and  trading revenues, including our market-making revenues, reduce  our participation in the trading markets and associated access  to market information and lead to the creation of new and  stronger competitors. These developments may also require us to  make additional investments in technology or trading systems.         Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Competition in the financial services industry for qualified employees is intense. Our continued ability to compete effectively in our businesses depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. The steps we have taken to encourage the continued service of employees may not be effective. In addition, growth in the number of our employees may lead to an increase in our compensation and non-compensation expenses that may exceed the growth in our revenues.        We expect to achieve growth in our core businesses principally through internal expansion and also through acquisitions. To the extent we make acquisitions or enter into combinations, such as our combination with SLK LLC, we face numerous risks and uncertainties combining the businesses and systems, including the need to combine accounting and data processing systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with customers and business partners. We may not be able to meet these operational and business challenges.        Because The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a holding company, it depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to fund all payments on its obligations, including debt obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including Goldman, Sachs & Co., our principal U.S. subsidiary, are subject to laws that authorize regulatory  17    Table of Contents  bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. needs to make dividend payments or payments on obligations, including debt obligations.        In conducting our businesses in major markets around the world, we are subject to political, economic, legal, operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in other countries, including risks of possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls, exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market. Our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular foreign market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally. We are also subject to the risk that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in all cases.        In the last several years, various emerging market countries have experienced severe economic and financial disruptions, including significant devaluations of their currencies and low or negative growth rates in their economies. The possible effects of these conditions include an adverse impact on our businesses and increased volatility in financial markets generally. As we expand our businesses in emerging and other markets, our exposure to these risks will increase.        A significant amount of our outstanding shares of common stock are held by our former limited partners. While these shares are subject to restrictions on transfer, our board of directors and/or the shareholders committee under our shareholders agreement have in the past waived, and may in the future from time to time waive, these transfer restrictions. Future sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock.    Item 2.  Properties       Our principal executive offices are located at 85 Broad Street, New York, New York, and comprise approximately 969,000 square feet of leased space, pursuant to a lease agreement expiring in June 2008 (with options to renew for up to 20 additional years). We also occupy over 675,000 square feet at One New York Plaza, and over 520,000 square feet at 10 Hanover Square, in New York, New York, pursuant to lease agreements expiring in September 2004 (with options to renew for up to ten additional years) and June 2018, respectively. Additionally, we have a 15-year lease for approximately 768,000 square feet at 180 Maiden Lane in New York, New York, that expires in March 2014 (with options to renew for up to ten additional years). In total, we lease over 4.4 million square feet in the New York area. We have additional offices in the United States and elsewhere in the Americas. Together, these offices comprise approximately 1.5 million square feet of leased space.        In the first quarter of 2000, we executed a contract to purchase approximately six acres of unimproved land in Jersey City, New Jersey. This project is being developed to complement our offices in lower Manhattan. The initial phase of development is expected to include approximately 1.4 million usable square feet of office space, with occupancy planned for early 2003.        We also have offices in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. In Europe, we have offices that totaled approximately 1.7 million square feet as of the end of January 2001. Our largest presence in Europe is in London, where we leased approximately 1.4 million square feet through various leases as of January 2001, with the majority of the leased space at Peterborough Court, River Court and Christ Church Court. The Peterborough Court lease expires in 2016, and the River Court and Christ Church Court leases expire in 2025.        In Asia, we have offices that total approximately 955,000 square feet. Our largest offices in this region are in Tokyo and Hong Kong. In Tokyo, we currently lease approximately 382,000  18    Table of Contents  square feet under renewable leases with current terms extending, in some cases, to June 2005. In Hong Kong, we currently lease approximately 302,000 square feet under a lease, the majority of which expires in 2012.        Our space requirements have increased significantly over the last several years. Currently, we have adequately met the significant demand for space in all of the regions where we have offices.    Item 3.  Legal Proceedings       We are involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings (including those described below) concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our businesses. We believe, based on currently available information, that the results of such proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but might be material to our operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.    Antitrust Matters       Goldman, Sachs & Co. is one of numerous financial services companies that have been named as defendants in certain purported class actions brought in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by purchasers of securities in public offerings, who claim that the defendants engaged in conspiracies in violation of federal antitrust laws in connection with these offerings. The plaintiffs in each instance seek treble damages as well as injunctive relief. One of the actions, which was commenced on August 21, 1998, alleges that the defendants have conspired to discourage or restrict the resale of securities for a period after the offerings, including by imposing penalty bids. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint in November 1998. The plaintiffs amended their complaint in February 1999, modifying their claims in various ways, including limiting the proposed class to retail purchasers of public offerings. The defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on May 7, 1999, the motion was granted by a decision dated December 7, 2000, and the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration of that decision was denied by an order dated January 22, 2001.        Several other actions were commenced, beginning on November 3, 1998 by purchasers of securities in public offerings as well as certain purported issuers of such offerings, that allege that the defendants, many of whom are also named in the other action discussed above, have conspired to fix at 7% the discount that underwriting syndicates receive from issuers of shares in certain offerings. On March 15, 1999, the purchaser plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on April 29, 1999. On February 14, 2001, the Court granted with prejudice the defendants motion to dismiss the claims asserted by the purchasers of securities. Defendants have not yet responded to the claims asserted by the issuer plaintiffs.        Goldman, Sachs & Co. received a Civil Investigative Demand on April 29, 1999 from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting information with respect to its investigation of an alleged conspiracy among securities underwriters to fix underwriting fees.        Hull Trading Co. L.L.C. and Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, L.P., affiliates of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., are among the numerous market makers in listed equity options which have been named as defendants, together with five national securities exchanges, in a purported class action brought in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of persons who purchased or sold listed equity options. The consolidated class action complaint, filed on October 4, 1999 (which consolidated certain previously pending actions and added Hull Trading Co. L.L.C. and other market makers as defendants), generally alleges that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to preclude the multiple listing of certain equity options on the exchanges and seeks treble damages under the antitrust laws as well as injunctive relief.  19    Table of Contents  Certain of the parties, including Hull Trading Co. L.L.C. and Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, L.P., have entered into a stipulation of settlement, subject to court approval, pursuant to which Hull Trading Co. L.L.C. will be required to pay an aggregate of $2.48 million and Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, L.P. an aggregate of $19.59 million. On February 14, 2001, the Court granted the motion of certain defendants for summary judgment.    Rockefeller Center Properties, Inc. Litigation       Several former shareholders of Rockefeller Center Properties, Inc. brought purported class actions in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and the Delaware Court of Chancery arising from the acquisition of Rockefeller Center Properties, Inc. by an investor group in July 1996. The defendants in the actions include, among others, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Whitehall Real Estate Partnership V, a merchant banking fund advised by Goldman, Sachs & Co., a Goldman, Sachs & Co. managing director and other members of the investor group. The federal court actions, which have since been consolidated, were filed beginning on November 15, 1996, and the state court action was filed on May 29, 1998.        The complaints generally allege that the proxy statement disseminated to former Rockefeller Center Properties, Inc. stockholders in connection with the transaction was deficient, in violation of the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws. The plaintiffs are seeking, among other things, unspecified damages, rescission of the acquisition, and/or disgorgement.        In a series of decisions, the federal district court granted summary judgment dismissing all the claims in the federal action. The plaintiffs appealed those rulings.        On July 19, 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rendered its decision affirming in part and vacating in part the lower courts entry of summary judgment dismissing the action. With respect to the claim as to which summary judgment was vacated, the appellate court held that the district court had committed a procedural error in converting the defendants motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment and remanded for the district court to reconsider that claim under appropriate standards applicable to motions to dismiss. Plaintiffs have since been granted leave to amend the complaint as to the remanded claim, and the defendants have renewed their motion to dismiss with respect to the amended complaint.        The state action has been stayed pending disposition of the federal action.    Matters Relating to Municipal Securities       Goldman, Sachs & Co. is one of many municipal underwriting firms that have been named as defendants in a purported class action brought on November 24, 1998 in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida by the Clerk of Collier County, Florida on behalf of municipal issuers that purchased escrow securities since October 1986 in connection with advance refundings. The amended complaint alleges that the securities were excessively marked up in violation of the Investment Advisers Act and Florida law, and that the defendants violated the federal antitrust laws in connection with the prices at which escrow securities were sold to municipal issuers. The complaint seeks to recover the difference between the actual and alleged fair prices of the escrow securities and to treble the alleged damages with respect to the antitrust claim. On October 29, 1999, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.    AMF Securities Litigation       The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and a Goldman, Sachs & Co. managing director have been named as defendants in several purported class action lawsuits beginning on April 27, 1999 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuits, which have been consolidated, were brought on behalf of purchasers of stock of AMF Bowling, Inc. in an underwritten initial public offering of 15,525,000 shares of common stock in  20    Table of Contents  November 1997 at a price of $19.50 per share. Defendants are AMF Bowling, Inc., certain officers and directors of AMF Bowling, Inc. (including the Goldman, Sachs & Co. managing director), and the lead underwriters of the offering (including Goldman, Sachs & Co.). The consolidated amended complaint alleges violations of the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws and seeks compensatory damages and/or rescission. The complaint also asserts that The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P. and the Goldman, Sachs & Co. managing director are liable as controlling persons of AMF Bowling, Inc. under the federal securities laws because certain merchant banking funds managed by Goldman Sachs owned a majority of the outstanding common stock of AMF Bowling, Inc. and the managing director served as its chairman at the time of the offering. On December 22, 1999, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.    Iridium Securities Litigation       Goldman, Sachs & Co. has been named as a defendant in two purported class action lawsuits commenced, beginning on May 26, 1999, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. These lawsuits were brought on behalf of purchasers of Class A common stock of Iridium World Communications, Ltd. in a January 1999 underwritten secondary offering of 7,500,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $33.40 per share, as well as in the secondary market. The defendants in the actions include Iridium, certain of its officers and directors, Motorola, Inc. (an investor in Iridium) and the lead underwriters in the offering, including Goldman, Sachs & Co.        The complaints in both actions allege violations of the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws and seek compensatory and/or rescissory damages. Goldman, Sachs & Co. underwrote 996,500 shares of common stock and Goldman Sachs International underwrote 320,625 shares of common stock for a total offering price of approximately $44 million.        On August 13, 1999, Iridium World Communications, Ltd. filed for protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws.    Laidlaw Bondholders Litigation       Goldman, Sachs & Co. has been named as a defendant in purported class actions filed beginning on September 22, 2000 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York arising from certain offerings of debentures by Laidlaw, Inc. from 1997 to 1999. The defendants include Laidlaw, certain of its officers and directors, the lead underwriters for the offerings (including Goldman, Sachs & Co., which was lead manager in the offerings), and Laidlaws outside auditors. The offerings included a total of $1.125 billion principal amount of debentures, of which Goldman, Sachs & Co. underwrote $286.25 million.        The lawsuits, brought by certain institutional purchasers of the debentures as well as purchasers and sellers of options exercisable for the debentures, allege that the prospectuses issued in connection with the offerings were false and misleading in violation of the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws. The plaintiffs are seeking, among other things, unspecified damages.    World Online Litigation       Goldman Sachs has become aware that a Dutch shareholders association intends to initiate legal proceedings in the Netherlands courts based on alleged misstatements and omissions relating to the initial public offering of World Online in March 2000. Goldman Sachs and ABN AMRO Rothschild served as joint global coordinators of the offering, which raised approximately $2.9 billion. Goldman Sachs International underwrote 20,268,846 shares and Goldman, Sachs & Co. underwrote 6,756,282 shares for a total offering price of approximately E1.16 billion. Goldman Sachs has not been informed of the amount of damages that may be sought.  21    Table of Contents       On September 11, 2000, several Dutch World Online shareholders as well as a Dutch entity purporting to represent the interests of certain World Online shareholders commenced a proceeding in Amsterdam District Court against ABN AMRO Bank N.V., also acting under the name of ABN AMRO Rothschild, alleging misrepresentations and omissions relating to the initial public offering of World Online. The lawsuit seeks, among other things, the return of the purchase price of the shares purchased by the plaintiffs or unspecified damages. Neither Goldman, Sachs & Co. nor Goldman Sachs International has been named in the proceeding.  Item 4.

As of February 5, 2001, there were 1,917 holders of record of our common stock.        During fiscal 1999 and 2000, dividends of $0.12 per share of common stock (and nonvoting common stock with respect to dividends declared prior to August 2000, when the nonvoting stock was converted into voting common stock) were declared on June 23, 1999, September 20, 1999, December 20, 1999, March 20, 2000, June 19, 2000 and September 18, 2000.

The declaration of dividends by Goldman Sachs is subject to the discretion of our board of directors.
