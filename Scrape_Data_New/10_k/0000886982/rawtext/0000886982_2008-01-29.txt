Business        Introduction          Goldman Sachs is a leading global investment banking, securities     and investment management firm that provides a wide range of     services worldwide to a substantial and diversified client base     that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments     and     high-net-worth     individuals. Goldman Sachs is the successor to a commercial     paper business founded in 1869 by Marcus Goldman. On May 7,     1999, we converted from a partnership to a corporation and     completed an initial public offering of our common stock.         Our activities are divided into three segments:     (i) Investment Banking, (ii) Trading and Principal     Investments and (iii) Asset Management and Securities     Services.         All references to 2007, 2006 and 2005 refer to our fiscal years     ended, or the dates, as the context requires, November 30,     2007, November 24, 2006 and November 25, 2005,     respectively. When we use the terms Goldman Sachs,     the firm, we, us and     our, we mean The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., a     Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.     References herein to the Annual Report on     Form 10-K     are to our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007.         Financial information concerning our business segments and     geographic regions for each of 2007, 2006 and 2005 is set forth     in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial     Condition and Results of Operations, and the consolidated     financial statements and the notes thereto, which are in     Part II, Items 7, 7A and 8 of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K.         Our Internet address is www.gs.com and the investor     relations section of our web site is located at     www.gs.com/shareholders. We make available free of     charge, on or through the investor relations section of our web     site, annual reports on     Form 10-K,     quarterly reports on     Form 10-Q     and current reports on     Form 8-K     and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to     Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of     1934, as well as proxy statements, as soon as reasonably     practicable after we electronically file such material with, or     furnish it to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.     Also posted on our web site, and available in print upon request     of any shareholder to our Investor Relations Department, are our     certificate of incorporation and by-laws, charters for our Audit     Committee, Compensation Committee, and Corporate Governance and     Nominating Committee, our Policy Regarding Director Independence     Determinations, our Policy on Reporting of Concerns Regarding     Accounting and Other Matters, our Corporate Governance     Guidelines and our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics governing     our directors, officers and employees. Within the time period     required by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, we will     post on our web site any amendment to the Code of Business     Conduct and Ethics and any waiver applicable to any executive     officer, director or senior financial officer (as defined in the     Code). In addition, our web site includes information concerning     purchases and sales of our equity securities by our executive     officers and directors, as well as disclosure relating to     certain non-GAAP financial measures (as defined in the     SECs Regulation G) that we may make public     orally, telephonically, by webcast, by broadcast or by similar     means from time to time.         Our Investor Relations Department can be contacted at The     Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., 85 Broad Street,     17th Floor, New York, New York 10004, Attn: Investor     Relations, telephone:     212-902-0300, e-mail: gs-investor-relations@gs.com.        1    Table of Contents      Cautionary     Statement Pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform     Act of 1995          We have included or incorporated by reference in the Annual     Report on     Form 10-K,     and from time to time our management may make, statements that     may constitute forward-looking statements within the     meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities     Litigation Reform Act of 1995.     Forward-looking     statements are not historical facts but instead represent only     our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their     nature, are inherently uncertain and outside our control. These     statements include statements other than historical information     or statements of current condition and may relate to our future     plans and objectives and results, among other things, and may     also include our belief regarding the effect of various legal     proceedings, as set forth under Legal Proceedings in     Part I, Item 3 of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K,     as well as statements about the objectives and effectiveness of     our risk management and liquidity policies, statements about     trends in or growth opportunities for our businesses and     statements about our investment banking transaction backlog, in     Part II, Item 7 of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     By identifying these statements for you in this manner, we are     alerting you to the possibility that our actual results and     financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the     anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these     forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause     our actual results and financial condition to differ from those     indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among     others, those discussed below and under Risk Factors     in Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K     and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial     Condition and Results of Operations in Part II,     Item 7 of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K.         In the case of statements about our investment banking     transaction backlog, such statements are subject to the risk     that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that     they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues,     if any, that we actually earn from these transactions may     differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected.     Important factors that could result in a modification of the     terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed     include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline in     general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility     in the securities markets generally or an adverse development     with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of     financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities     markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse     development with respect to a party to the transaction or a     failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a     discussion of other important factors that could adversely     affect our investment banking transactions, see Risk     Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report     on     Form 10-K     and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial     Condition and Results of Operations in Part II,     Item 7 of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K.        2    Table of Contents      Segment Operating     Results (in     millions)                                                                              Year Ended November                          2007             2006             2005               Investment           Net revenues           $       7,555               $       5,629               $       3,671          Banking            Operating expenses               4,985                   4,062                   3,258                                                                                   Pre-tax earnings           $       2,570               $       1,567               $       413                                                                                                                                     Trading and Principal            Net revenues           $       31,226               $       25,562               $       16,818          Investments            Operating expenses               17,998                   14,962                   10,600                                                                                   Pre-tax earnings           $       13,228               $       10,600               $       6,218                                                                                                                                     Asset Management and           Net revenues           $       7,206               $       6,474               $       4,749          Securities Services            Operating expenses               5,363                   4,036                   3,070                                                                                   Pre-tax earnings           $       1,843               $       2,438               $       1,679                                                                                                                                      Total            Net revenues           $       45,987               $       37,665               $       25,238                     Operating expenses     (1)               28,383                   23,105                   16,965                                                                                   Pre-tax earnings           $       17,604               $       14,560               $       8,273                                                                                     (1)   Includes net provisions for a     number of litigation and regulatory proceedings of     $37 million, $45 million and $37 million for the     years ended November 2007, November 2006 and November 2005,     respectively, that have not been allocated to our segments.              3    Table of Contents      Where We Conduct     Business          As of November 30, 2007, we operated offices in over 25     countries and 43% of our 30,522 employees were based     outside the United States. In 2007, we derived 49% of our net     revenues and 57% of our pre-tax earnings outside of the     Americas. See geographic information in Note 16 to the     consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8     of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K.         Our clients and customers are located worldwide, and we are an     active participant in financial markets around the world. We     have developed and continue to build strong investment banking     relationships in new and developing markets. We also continue to     expand our presence throughout these markets to invest     strategically when opportunities arise and to work more closely     with our asset management clients in these regions. Our global     reach is illustrated by the following:                         we are a member of and an active participant in most of the     worlds major stock, options and futures exchanges and     marketplaces;                    we are a primary dealer in many of the largest government bond     markets around the world;                    we have interbank dealer status in currency markets around the     world; and                    we are a member of or have relationships with major commodities     exchanges worldwide.           Our businesses are supported by our Global Investment Research     division, which, as of November 2007, provided research coverage     of over 3,250 companies worldwide and over 50 national     economies, and maintained a presence in locations around the     world.         We continue to expand our geographic reach. For example, over     the past two years we have opened offices in Mumbai, Moscow, Sao     Paulo, Dubai, Qatar and Tel Aviv, become licensed as a     broker-dealer in Russia, India and China, opened a bank in     Brazil and entered into the asset management business in South     Korea. In December 2007, we established two wholly owned banks     in Dublin, Ireland. Through this banking presence, we will     initially focus on our private client business, underwrite     commercial bank loans, undertake fund administration for our     European global securities services business and facilitate     funding transactions for the firm.        4    Table of Contents      Business     Segments          The primary products and activities of our business segments are     set forth in the following chart:                       Business     Segment/Component           Primary Products and     Activities      Investment Banking:                   Financial Advisory                  Mergers and acquisitions advisory services                        Financial restructuring advisory services                         Underwriting                  Equity and debt underwriting                               Trading and Principal Investments:                   Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities                  Commodities and commodity derivatives, including     power generation and related activities                        Credit products, including trading and investing in     credit derivatives, investment-grade corporate securities,     high-yield securities, bank and secured loans, municipal     securities, emerging market and distressed debt, public and     private equity securities and real estate                        Currencies and currency derivatives                        Interest rate products, including interest rate     derivatives, global government securities and money market     instruments, including matched book positions                        Mortgage-related securities and loan products and     other asset-backed instruments                         Equities                  Equity securities and derivatives                        Securities, futures and options clearing services                        Market-making and specialist activities in equity     securities and options                        Insurance activities                         Principal Investments                  Principal investments in connection with merchant     banking activities                        Investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and     Commercial Bank of China Limited                        Investment in the convertible preferred stock of     Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc.

We     provide a broad range of investment banking services to a     diverse group of corporations, financial institutions,     investment funds, governments and individuals and seek to     develop and maintain long-term relationships with these clients     as their lead investment bank.         Our current structure, which is organized by regional, industry     and product groups, seeks to combine client-focused investment     bankers with execution and industry expertise. We continually     assess and adapt our organization to meet the demands of our     clients in each geographic region. Through our commitment to     teamwork, we believe that we provide services in an integrated     fashion for the benefit of our clients.         Our goal is to make available to our clients the entire     resources of the firm in a seamless fashion, with investment     banking serving as front of the house. To accomplish     this objective, we focus on coordination among our equity and     debt underwriting activities and our corporate risk and     liability management activities. This coordination is intended     to assist our investment banking clients in managing their asset     and liability exposures and their capital.         Our Investment Banking segment is divided into two components:     Financial Advisory and Underwriting.     Financial     Advisory         Financial Advisory includes advisory assignments with respect to     mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense     activities, restructurings and spin-offs. Our mergers and     acquisitions capabilities are evidenced by our significant share     of assignments in large, complex transactions for which we     provide multiple services, including one-stop     acquisition financing and cross-border structuring expertise, as     well as services in other areas of the firm, such as interest     rate and currency hedging. In particular, a significant number     of the loan commitments and bank and bridge loan facilities that     we enter into arise in connection with our advisory assignments.     Underwriting         Underwriting includes public offerings and private placements of     a wide range of securities and other financial instruments,     including common and preferred stock, convertible and     exchangeable securities, investment-grade debt, high-yield debt,     sovereign and emerging market debt, municipal debt, bank loans,     asset-backed securities and real estate-related securities, such     as mortgage-related securities and the securities of real estate     investment trusts.     Equity Underwriting.  Equity underwriting has     been a long-term core strength of Goldman Sachs. As with mergers     and acquisitions, we have been particularly successful in     winning mandates for large, complex transactions. We believe our     leadership in worldwide initial public offerings and worldwide     public common stock offerings reflects our expertise in complex     transactions, prior experience and distribution capabilities.     Debt Underwriting.  We engage in the     underwriting and origination of various types of debt     instruments, including investment-grade debt securities,     high-yield debt securities, bank and bridge loans and emerging     market debt securities, which may be issued by, among others,     corporate, sovereign and agency issuers. In addition, we     underwrite and originate structured securities, which include     mortgage-related securities and other asset-backed securities     and collateralized debt obligations.        6    Table of Contents   Trading and     Principal Investments         Trading and Principal Investments represented 68% of     2007 net revenues. Trading and Principal Investments     facilitates client transactions with a diverse group of     corporations, financial institutions, investment funds,     governments and individuals and takes proprietary positions     through market making in, trading of and investing in fixed     income and equity products, currencies, commodities and     derivatives on these products. In addition, we engage in     market-making and specialist activities on equities and options     exchanges, and we clear client transactions on major stock,     options and futures exchanges worldwide. In connection with our     merchant banking and other investing activities, we make     principal investments directly and through funds that we raise     and manage.         To meet the needs of our clients, Trading and Principal     Investments is diversified across a wide range of products. We     believe our willingness and ability to take risk to facilitate     client transactions distinguishes us from many of our     competitors and substantially enhances our client relationships.         Our Trading and Principal Investments segment is divided into     three components: Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities;     Equities; and Principal Investments.     Fixed Income,     Currency and Commodities and Equities         Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and Equities are     large and diversified operations through which we engage in a     variety of customer-driven and proprietary trading and investing     activities.         In our customer-driven businesses, FICC and Equities strive to     deliver high-quality service by offering broad market-making and     market knowledge to our clients on a global basis. In addition,     we use our expertise to take positions in markets, by committing     capital and taking risk, to facilitate client transactions and     to provide liquidity. Our willingness to make markets, commit     capital and take risk in a broad range of fixed income,     currency, commodity and equity products and their derivatives is     crucial to our client relationships and to support our     underwriting business by providing secondary market liquidity.         We generate trading net revenues from our customer-driven     businesses in three ways:                         First, in large, highly liquid markets, we undertake a high     volume of transactions for modest spreads and fees.                    Second, by capitalizing on our strong relationships and capital     position, we undertake transactions in less liquid markets where     spreads and fees are generally larger.                    Finally, we structure and execute transactions that address     complex client needs.           Our FICC and Equities businesses operate in close coordination     to provide clients with services and cross-market knowledge and     expertise.         In our proprietary activities in both FICC and Equities, we     assume a variety of risks and devote resources to identify,     analyze and benefit from these exposures. We capitalize on our     analytical models to analyze information and make informed     trading judgments, and we seek to benefit from perceived     disparities in the value of assets in the trading markets and     from macroeconomic and issuer-specific trends.        7    Table of Contents   FICC         We make markets in and trade interest rate and credit products,     mortgage-related securities and loan products and other     asset-backed instruments, currencies and commodities, structure     and enter into a wide variety of derivative transactions, and     engage in proprietary trading and investing. FICC has five     principal businesses: commodities; credit products; currencies;     interest rate products, including money market instruments; and     mortgage-related securities and loan products and other     asset-backed instruments.     Commodities.  We enter into trades with our     clients in, make markets in, and trade for our own account a     wide variety of commodities, commodity derivatives and interests     in commodity-related assets, including oil and oil products,     metals, natural gas and electricity, and forest products.         As part of our commodities business, we acquire and dispose of     interests in, and engage in the development and operation of,     electric power generation facilities and related activities. In     November 2007, we disposed of approximately 80% of our     ownership interests in 14 power plants, and we have entered     into contractual arrangements to manage these plants. In     addition to our remaining minority interest in these facilities,     we have a portfolio of four other power generation facilities.     Credit Products.  We offer to and trade for our     clients a broad array of credit and credit-linked products all     over the world, including credit derivatives, investment-grade     corporate securities, high-yield securities, bank and secured     loans (origination and trading), municipal securities, and     emerging market and distressed debt. For example, we enter, as     principal, into complex structured transactions designed to meet     client needs.         In addition, we provide credit through bridge and other loan     facilities to a broad range of clients. Commitments that are     extended for contingent acquisition financing are often intended     to be short-term in nature, as borrowers often seek to replace     them with other funding sources. As part of our ongoing credit     origination activities, we may seek to reduce our credit risk on     commitments by syndicating all or substantial portions of     commitments to other investors or, upon funding, by securitizing     the positions through investment vehicles sold to other     investors. Underwriting fees from syndications of these     commitments are recorded in debt underwriting in our Investment     Banking segment. However, to the extent that we recognize losses     on these commitments, such losses are recorded within our     Trading and Principal Investments segment, net of any related     underwriting fees. See Managements Discussion and     Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of     Operations  Contractual Obligations and     Commitments in Part II, Item 7 of the Annual     Report on     Form 10-K     for additional information on our commitments.         Our credit products business includes making significant     long-term and short-term investments for our own account     (sometimes investing together with our merchant banking funds)     in a broad array of asset classes (including distressed debt)     globally. We opportunistically invest in debt and equity     securities and secured loans, and in private equity, real estate     and other assets.     Currencies.  We act as a dealer in foreign     exchange and trade for our clients and ourselves in most     currencies on exchanges and in cash and derivative markets     globally.     Interest Rate Products.  We trade and make     markets in a variety of interest rate products, including     interest rate swaps, options and other derivatives, and     government bonds, as well as money market instruments, such as     commercial paper, treasury bills, repurchase agreements and     other highly liquid securities and instruments. This business     includes our matched book, which consists of short-term     collateralized financing transactions.        8    Table of Contents     Mortgage Business.  We make markets in and     trade for our clients and ourselves commercial and residential     mortgage-related securities and loan products (including prime,     subprime and other nontraditional mortgages) and other     asset-backed and derivative instruments. We acquire positions in     these products for proprietary trading purposes as well as for     securitization or syndication. We also originate and service     commercial and residential mortgages.     Equities         We make markets in and trade equities and equity-related     products, structure and enter into equity derivative     transactions, and engage in proprietary trading. We generate     commissions from executing and clearing client transactions on     major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide through our     Equities customer franchise and clearing activities.         Equities includes two principal businesses: our customer     franchise business and principal strategies. We also engage in     specialist and insurance activities.     Customer Franchise Business.  Our customer     franchise business includes primarily customer-driven activities     in the shares, equity derivatives and convertible securities     markets. These activities also include clearing client     transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges     worldwide, as well as our options specialist and market-making     businesses. Our customer franchise business increasingly     involves providing our clients with access to electronic     low-touch equity trading platforms, and electronic     trades now account for the majority of our customer trading     activity in this business. However, a majority of our net     revenues in this business continues to be derived from our     traditional high-touch handling of more complex     trades. We expect both types of trading activities to remain     important components of our customer franchise business.         We trade equity securities and equity-related products,     including convertible securities, options, futures and     over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments, on a global basis     as an agent, as a market maker or otherwise as a principal. As a     principal, we facilitate client transactions, often by     committing capital and taking risk, to provide liquidity to     clients with large blocks of stocks or options. For example, we     are active in the execution of large block trades. We also     execute transactions as agent and offer clients direct     electronic access to trading markets.         In the options and futures markets, we structure, distribute and     execute derivatives on market indices, industry groups,     financial measures and individual company stocks to facilitate     client transactions and our proprietary activities. We develop     strategies and render advice with respect to portfolio hedging     and restructuring and asset allocation transactions. We also     create specially tailored instruments to enable sophisticated     investors to undertake hedging strategies and to establish or     liquidate investment positions. We are one of the leading     participants in the trading and development of equity derivative     instruments. In options, we are a specialist and/or market maker     on the International Securities Exchange, the Chicago Board     Options Exchange, NYSE Arca, the Boston Options Exchange, the     Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange.     Principal Strategies.  Our principal strategies     business is a multi-strategy proprietary investment business     that invests and trades for our own account. Principal     strategies trades and invests our capital across global markets     employing strategies that are primarily focused on public     markets. Most strategies involve fundamental equities and     relative value trading (which involves trading strategies     designed to take advantage of perceived discrepancies in the     relative value of financial instruments, including equity,     equity-related and debt instruments). Other strategies involve     event-driven investments (which focus on event-oriented special     situations such as corporate restructurings, bankruptcies,     recapitalizations, mergers and acquisitions, and legal and     regulatory events) as well as convertible bond trading, various     types of volatility trading and principal finance (which     includes private structured investments in public or private     companies).         At the start of our first fiscal quarter of 2008, we reassigned     approximately one-half of the traders and other personnel and     transferred approximately one-half of the firms assets     comprising our principal strategies business in an effort to     strengthen and diversify our asset management offerings. These     assets are now invested in a new alternative investment fund     managed by our asset        9    Table of Contents       management business. Over time, we intend to replace the     reassigned personnel and transferred assets of our principal     strategies business.     Specialist Activities.  Our specialist     activities business consists of our stock and exchange-traded     funds (ETF) specialist and market-making businesses. We engage     in specialist and market-making activities on equities     exchanges. In the United States, we are one of the leading stock     specialists on the NYSE. For ETFs, we are a specialist on the     NYSE, the American Stock Exchange and NYSE Arca.     Insurance Activities.  Through our insurance     subsidiaries, we buy, sell and originate variable annuity and     life insurance contracts, and we participate opportunistically     in reinsurance activities, including life and annuity     reinsurance and property catastrophe reinsurance.     Principal     Investments         Principal Investments primarily represents net revenues from     four primary sources: returns on corporate and real estate     investments, overrides on corporate and real estate investments,     our investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and     Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC) and our investment in     the convertible preferred stock of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial     Group, Inc. (SMFG).     Returns on Corporate and Real Estate     Investments.  As of November 2007, the aggregate     carrying value of our principal investments held directly or     through our merchant banking funds, excluding our investment in     the ordinary shares of ICBC and the convertible preferred stock     of SMFG, was $11.93 billion, comprised of corporate     principal investments with an aggregate carrying value of     $9.50 billion and real estate investments with an aggregate     carrying value of $2.43 billion. In addition, as of     November 2007, we had outstanding unfunded equity capital     commitments of up to $15.25 billion.     Overrides.  Consists of the increased share of     the income and gains derived from our merchant banking funds     when the return on a funds investments over the life of     the fund exceeds certain threshold returns (typically referred     to as an override). Overrides are recognized in net revenues     when all material contingencies have been resolved.     ICBC.  Our investment in the ordinary shares of     ICBC was acquired on April 28, 2006. The ordinary shares     acquired from ICBC are subject to transfer restrictions that,     among other things, prohibit any sale, disposition or other     transfer until April 28, 2009. From April 28, 2009 to     October 20, 2009, we may transfer up to 50% of the     aggregate ordinary shares of ICBC that we owned as of     October 20, 2006. We may transfer the remaining shares     after October 20, 2009. As of November 2007, the carrying     value of our investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC was     $6.81 billion. A portion of our interest is held by     investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs.     SMFG.  Our investment in the convertible     preferred stock of SMFG is generally nontransferable without the     consent of SMFG but is freely convertible into SMFG common     stock. As of November 2007, we had hedged approximately 90% of     the common stock underlying our investment in SMFG and there     were no restrictions on our ability to hedge the remainder. As     of November 2007, the carrying value of our investment in the     SMFG preferred stock was $4.06 billion.         For further information regarding our investments in the     ordinary shares of ICBC and the convertible preferred stock of     SMFG, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of     Financial Condition and Results of Operations      Critical Accounting Policies  Fair Value      Cash Instruments in Part II, Item 7 of the     Annual Report on     Form 10-K.        10    Table of Contents   Asset Management     and Securities Services         Asset Management and Securities Services represented 16% of     2007 net revenues. Our asset management business provides     investment advisory and financial planning services and offers     investment products (primarily through separately managed     accounts and commingled vehicles) across all major asset classes     to a diverse group of institutions and individuals worldwide and     primarily generates revenues in the form of management and     incentive fees. Securities Services provides prime brokerage     services, financing services and securities lending services to     institutional clients, including hedge funds, mutual funds,     pension funds and foundations, and to     high-net-worth     individuals worldwide, and generates revenues primarily in the     form of interest rate spreads or fees.         Our Asset Management and Securities Services segment is divided     into two components: Asset Management and Securities Services.     Asset     Management         We offer a broad array of investment strategies, advice and     planning. We provide asset management services and offer     investment products (primarily through separately managed     accounts and commingled vehicles, such as mutual funds and     private investment funds) across all major asset classes: money     markets, fixed income, equities and alternative investments     (including hedge funds, private equity, real estate, currencies,     commodities and asset allocation strategies). Through our     subsidiary, The Ayco Company, L.P. (Ayco), we also provide     fee-based financial counseling and financial education in the     United States.         Assets under management (AUM) typically generate fees as a     percentage of asset value, which is affected by investment     performance and by inflows or redemptions. The fees that we     charge vary by asset class, as do our related expenses. In     certain circumstances, we are also entitled to receive incentive     fees based on a percentage of a funds return or when the     return on assets under management exceeds specified benchmark     returns or other performance targets. Incentive fees are     recognized when the performance period ends and they are no     longer subject to adjustment. We have numerous incentive fee     arrangements, many of which have annual performance periods that     end on December 31. For that reason, incentive fees have     been seasonally weighted to our first quarter.         AUM includes our mutual funds, alternative investment funds and     separately managed accounts for institutional and individual     investors. Alternative investments include our merchant banking     funds, which generate revenues as described below under     Management of Merchant Banking Funds. AUM includes     assets in clients brokerage accounts to the extent that     they generate fees based on the assets in the accounts rather     than commissions on transactional activity in the accounts.         AUM does not include assets in brokerage accounts that generate     commissions,     mark-ups and     spreads based on transactional activity, or our own investments     in funds that we manage. Net revenues from these assets are     included in our Trading and Principal Investments segment. AUM     also does not include non-fee-paying assets, including     interest-bearing deposits held through Goldman Sachs Bank USA     (GS Bank USA).         See Trading and Principal Investments      Equities  Principal Strategies above for a     discussion of the personnel and assets that we moved from our     principal strategies business to our asset management business     at the start of our first fiscal quarter of 2008.        11    Table of Contents       The amount of AUM is set forth in the graph below.

Our clients are institutions and     individuals, including both     high-net-worth     and retail investors. We access institutional and     high-net-worth     clients through both direct and third-party channels and retail     clients primarily through third-party channels. Our     institutional clients include pension funds, governmental     organizations, corporations, insurance companies, banks,     foundations and endowments. In third-party distribution     channels, we distribute our mutual funds, alternative investment     funds and separately managed accounts through brokerage firms,     banks, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries.

Goldman     Sachs sponsors numerous corporate and real estate private     investment funds. Our strategy with respect to these funds     generally is to invest opportunistically to build a portfolio of     investments that is diversified by industry, product type,     geographic region, and transaction structure and type. Our     corporate investment funds pursue, on a global basis, long-term     investments in equity and debt securities in privately     negotiated transactions, leveraged buyouts, acquisitions and     investments in funds managed by external parties. Our real     estate investment funds invest in real estate operating     companies, debt and equity interests in real estate assets, and     other real estate-related investments. In addition, our merchant     banking funds include a fund that invests in infrastructure and     infrastructure-related assets and companies on a global basis.         Since inception, we have raised $118 billion of committed     equity capital in these funds, consisting of $96 billion     related to our corporate funds and $22 billion related to     our real estate funds. As of November 2007, $68 billion of     the committed equity capital was funded and the amount of AUM     remaining in these funds after distributions was     $64 billion.         Merchant banking activities generate three primary revenue     streams. First, we receive a management fee that is generally a     percentage of a funds committed capital, invested capital,     total gross acquisition cost or asset value. These annual     management fees are included in our Asset Management net     revenues. Second, Goldman Sachs, as a substantial investor in     some of these funds, is allocated its proportionate share of the     funds unrealized appreciation or depreciation arising from     changes in fair value as well as gains and losses upon     realization. Third, after a fund has achieved a minimum return     for fund investors, we receive an increased share of the     funds income and gains that is a percentage of the income     and gains from the funds investments. The second and third     of these revenue streams are included in Principal Investments     within our Trading and Principal Investments segment.        13    Table of Contents   Securities     Services         Securities Services provides prime brokerage services, financing     services and securities lending services to institutional     clients, including hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds and     foundations, and to     high-net-worth     individuals worldwide.     Prime brokerage services.  We offer prime     brokerage services to our clients, allowing them the flexibility     to trade with most brokers while maintaining a single source for     financing and consolidated portfolio reports. Our prime     brokerage business provides clearing and custody in     49 markets and provides consolidated multi-currency     accounting and reporting, fund administration and other     ancillary services.     Financing services.  A central element of our     prime brokerage business involves providing financing to our     clients for their securities trading activities through margin     and securities loans that are collateralized by securities, cash     or other acceptable collateral.     Securities lending services.  Securities     lending services principally involve the borrowing and lending     of securities to cover clients and Goldman Sachs     short sales and otherwise to make deliveries into the market. In     addition, we are an active participant in the broker-to-broker     securities lending business and the third-party agency lending     business. Net revenues in securities lending services are, as a     general matter, weighted toward our second and third quarters     each year due to seasonally higher activity levels in Europe.      Global Investment     Research          Global Investment Research provides fundamental research on     companies, industries, economies, currencies and commodities and     macro strategy research on a worldwide basis.         Global Investment Research employs a team approach that as of     November 2007 provided research coverage of over     3,250 companies worldwide and over 50 national economies.     This is accomplished by the following departments:                         The Equity Research Departments provide fundamental analysis,     earnings forecasts and investment opinions for equity securities;                    The Credit Research Department provides fundamental analysis,     forecasts and investment opinions as to investment-grade and     high-yield corporate bonds and credit derivatives;                    The Economic Research Department formulates macroeconomic     forecasts for economic activity, foreign exchange and interest     rates;                    The Commodities Research Department provides research on the     commodity markets; and                    The Strategy Research Department provides equity market     forecasts, opinions on both asset and industry sector     allocation, equity trading strategies, credit trading strategies     and options research.           Further information regarding research at Goldman Sachs is     provided below under  Regulation      Regulations Applicable in and Outside the United States     and Legal Proceedings  Research Independence     Matters in Part I, Item 3 of the Annual Report     on     Form 10-K.        14    Table of Contents      Technology          Goldman Sachs is committed to the ongoing development,     maintenance and use of technology throughout the organization.     Our technology initiatives can be broadly categorized into four     efforts:                         Enhancing client service through increased connectivity and the     provision of value-added, tailored products and services;                    Improving our trading, execution and clearing capabilities;                    Risk management; and                    Overall efficiency, productivity and control.           We have tailored our services to our clients by providing them     with electronic access to our products and services. In     particular, we provide global electronic trading and information     distribution capabilities covering many of our fixed income,     currency, commodity, equity and mutual fund products around the     world.         Electronic commerce and technology have changed and will     continue to change the ways that securities and other financial     products are traded, distributed and settled. This creates both     opportunities and challenges for our businesses. We remain     committed to being at the forefront of technological innovation     in the global capital markets.      Business     Continuity and Information Security          Business continuity and information security are high priorities     for Goldman Sachs. Our Business Continuity Program has been     developed to provide reasonable assurance of business continuity     in the event of disruptions at the firms critical     facilities and to comply with the regulatory requirements of the     Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). The SEC also     reviews our Business Continuity Program. The key elements of the     program are crisis management, people recovery facilities,     business recovery, systems and data recovery, and process     improvement. In the area of information security, we have     developed and implemented a framework of principles, policies     and technology to protect the information assets of the firm and     our clients. Safeguards are applied to maintain the     confidentiality, integrity and availability of information     resources.      Employees          Management believes that a major strength and principal reason     for the success of Goldman Sachs is the quality and dedication     of our people and the shared sense of being part of a team. We     strive to maintain a work environment that fosters     professionalism, excellence, diversity, cooperation among our     employees worldwide and high standards of business ethics.         Instilling the Goldman Sachs culture in all employees is a     continuous process, in which training plays an important part.     All employees are offered the opportunity to participate in     education and periodic seminars that we sponsor at various     locations throughout the world. Another important part of     instilling the Goldman Sachs culture is our employee review     process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors, co-workers and     employees they supervise in a     360-degree     review process that is integral to our team approach.         As of November 2007, we had 30,522 employees, excluding     4,572 employees of certain consolidated entities that are     held for investment purposes only. Consolidated entities held     for investment purposes include entities that are held strictly     for capital appreciation, have a defined exit strategy and are     engaged in activities that are not closely related to our     principal businesses.        15    Table of Contents      Competition          The financial services industry  and all of our     businesses  are intensely competitive, and we expect     them to remain so. Our competitors are other brokers and     dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, insurance     companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds,     private equity funds and merchant banks. We compete with some of     our competitors globally and with others on a regional, product     or niche basis. Our competition is based on a number of factors,     including transaction execution, our products and services,     innovation, reputation and price.         We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining     qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete     effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to     attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing     employees.         Over time, there has been substantial consolidation and     convergence among companies in the financial services industry,     due in part to U.S. federal legislation that has expanded     the activities permissible for firms affiliated with a     U.S. bank. In particular, a number of large commercial     banks, insurance companies and other broad-based financial     services firms have established or acquired broker-dealers or     have merged with other financial institutions. Many of these     firms have the ability to offer a wide range of products, from     loans, deposit-taking and insurance to brokerage, asset     management and investment banking services, which may enhance     their competitive position. They also have the ability to     support investment banking and securities products with     commercial banking, insurance and other financial services     revenues in an effort to gain market share, which has resulted     in pricing pressure in our investment banking and trading     businesses and could result in pricing pressure in other of our     businesses.         Moreover, we have faced, and expect to continue to face,     pressure to retain market share by committing capital to     businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may     not be commensurate with their risks. In particular, corporate     clients increasingly seek such commitments (such as agreements     to participate in their commercial paper backstop or other loan     facilities) from financial services firms in connection with     investment banking and other assignments. We provide these     commitments through our William Street entities or through GS     Bank USA, primarily for investment-grade clients, or through     Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. or our other subsidiaries,     primarily for other clients. With respect to most of the William     Street commitments, SMFG provides us with credit loss protection     that is generally limited to 95% of the first loss we realize on     approved loan commitments, up to a maximum of     $1.00 billion. In addition, subject to the satisfaction of     certain conditions, upon our request, SMFG will provide     protection for 70% of the second loss on such commitments, up to     a maximum of $1.13 billion. We also use other financial     instruments to mitigate credit risks related to certain William     Street commitments not covered by SMFG. See     Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial     Condition and Results of Operations  Contractual     Obligations and Commitments in Part II, Item 7     of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K     and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for more information regarding the William Street entities and     for a description of the credit loss protection provided by     SMFG. An increasing number of our commitments in connection with     investment banking and other assignments do not meet the     criteria established for the William Street entities and do not     benefit from the SMFG loss protection. These commitments are     issued through Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P., GS Bank USA     or our other subsidiaries.         The trend toward consolidation and convergence has significantly     increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our     competitors. This trend has also hastened the globalization of     the securities and other financial services markets. As a     result, we have had to commit capital to support our     international operations and to execute large global     transactions. To take advantage of some of our most significant     challenges and opportunities, we will have to compete     successfully with financial institutions that are larger and     better capitalized and that may have a stronger local presence     and longer operating history outside the United States.        16    Table of Contents       We have experienced intense price competition in some of our     businesses in recent years. There has been considerable pressure     in the pricing of block trades. Also, equity and debt     underwriting discounts, as well as trading spreads, have been     under pressure for a number of years and the ability to execute     trades electronically, through the Internet and through other     alternative trading systems, has increased the pressure on     trading commissions. It appears that this trend toward     electronic and other low-touch, low-commission     trading will continue. We believe that we will continue to     experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the     future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by     reducing prices.      Regulation          Goldman Sachs, as a participant in the securities and commodity     futures and options industries, is subject to extensive     regulation in the United States and the other countries in which     we operate. As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies     around the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of     the securities and other financial markets and with protecting     the interests of clients participating in those markets. They     are not, however, charged with protecting the interests of     Goldman Sachs shareholders or creditors.         Broker-dealers, in particular, are subject to regulations that     cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales     methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of clients     funds and securities, capital structure, recordkeeping, the     financing of clients purchases, and the conduct of     directors, officers and employees. A number of our affiliates     are regulated by investment advisory laws in the countries in     which we operate. See Risk Factors  Our     businesses and those of our clients are subject to extensive and     pervasive regulation around the world in Part I,     Item 1A of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for a further discussion of the effect that regulation may have     on our businesses.       Regulation in the     United States         In the United States, the SEC is the federal agency responsible     for the administration of the federal securities laws. The     Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is subject to regulation by the SEC as     a Consolidated Supervised Entity. As such, it is subject to     group-wide supervision and examination by the SEC and to minimum     capital standards on a consolidated basis. As part of a     Consolidated Supervised Entity, Goldman, Sachs & Co.     (GS&Co.), our principal U.S. broker-dealer, is     permitted to calculate its regulatory capital requirements in     accordance with the market and credit risk standards of     Appendix E of     Rule 15c3-1     under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We may be required or     may determine to disclose publicly our group-wide Consolidated     Supervised Entity capital ratios on an ongoing basis beginning     in mid-2008.         GS&Co. is registered as a broker-dealer and as an     investment adviser with the SEC and as a     broker-dealer     in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.     Self-regulatory organizations, such as FINRA and the NYSE, adopt     rules that apply to, and examine, broker-dealers such as     GS&Co. FINRA was formed when the NASD and the NYSE merged     their regulatory operations, although the NYSE continues to have     oversight over NYSE-related market activities. In addition,     state securities and other regulators also have regulatory or     oversight authority over GS&Co. Similarly, our businesses     are also subject to regulation by various     non-U.S. governmental     and regulatory bodies and self-regulatory authorities in     virtually all countries where we have offices. Goldman Sachs     Execution & Clearing, L.P. (GSEC) and two of its     subsidiaries are registered U.S. broker-dealers and are     regulated by the SEC, the NYSE and FINRA. Goldman Sachs     Financial Markets, L.P. is registered with the SEC as an OTC     derivatives dealer and conducts certain OTC derivatives     businesses.         The commodity futures and commodity options industry in the     United States is subject to regulation under the Commodity     Exchange Act. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is the     federal agency charged with the administration of the Commodity     Exchange Act. Several of Goldman Sachs subsidiaries,     including GS&Co. and GSEC, are registered with the CFTC and     act as futures        17    Table of Contents       commission merchants, commodity pool operators or commodity     trading advisors and are subject to the Commodity Exchange Act.     The rules and regulations of various self-regulatory     organizations, such as the Chicago Board of Trade and the     Chicago Mercantile Exchange, other futures exchanges and the     National Futures Association, also govern the commodity futures     and commodity options businesses of these entities.         GS&Co. and GSEC are subject to     Rule 15c3-1     of the SEC and Rule 1.17 of the CFTC, which specify uniform     minimum net capital requirements and also effectively require     that a significant part of the registrants assets be kept     in relatively liquid form. GS&Co. and GSEC have elected to     compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with     the Alternative Net Capital Requirement as permitted     by     Rule 15c3-1.     As of November 2007, GS&Co. and GSEC had net capital in     excess of their minimum capital requirements. In addition to its     alternative minimum net capital requirements, GS&Co. is     also required to hold tentative net capital in excess of     $1 billion and net capital in excess of $500 million     in accordance with the market and credit risk standards of     Appendix E of     Rule 15c3-1.     GS&Co. is required to notify the SEC in the event that its     tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. As of     November 2007, GS&Co. had tentative net capital and net     capital in excess of both the minimum and the notification     requirements. These net capital requirements may have the effect     of prohibiting these entities from distributing or withdrawing     capital and may require prior notice to the SEC for certain     withdrawals of capital. See Note 15 to the consolidated     financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual     Report on     Form 10-K.         Goldman Sachs three limited purpose trust companies     operate under state or federal law. They are not permitted to     and do not accept deposits (other than as incidental to their     trust activities) or make loans and, as a result, are not     considered to be banks for purposes of the Bank Holding Company     Act, nor are they insured by the FDIC or subject to the     Community Reinvestment Act. The Goldman Sachs     Trust Company, N.A., a national bank that is limited to     fiduciary activities, is regulated by the Office of the     Comptroller of the Currency and is a member bank of the Federal     Reserve System. The Goldman Sachs Trust Company, a New York     limited purpose trust company, is regulated by the New York     State Banking Department. The Goldman Sachs Trust Company     of Delaware, a Delaware limited purpose trust company, is     regulated by the Office of the Delaware State Bank Commissioner.         Goldman Sachs has established GS Bank USA, a wholly owned     industrial bank, to extend credit and to take deposits, other     than demand deposits. GS Bank USA is regulated by the FDIC and     the State of Utah Department of Financial Institutions and is     subject to minimum capital requirements. As of November 2007, GS     Bank USA was in compliance with all regulatory capital     requirements. Because it does not accept demand deposits, GS     Bank USA is not considered to be a bank for purposes of the Bank     Holding Company Act. The deposits maintained at GS Bank USA are     insured by the FDIC to the extent provided by law.         Our specialist businesses are subject to extensive regulation by     a number of securities exchanges. The rules of these exchanges     generally require our specialists to maintain orderly markets in     the securities in which they are specialists.         J. Aron & Company is authorized by the Federal     Energy Regulatory Commission to sell wholesale physical power at     market-based rates. As a FERC-authorized power marketer,     J. Aron & Company is subject to regulation     under the Federal Power Act and FERC regulations and to the     oversight of FERC. As a result of our investing activities,     GS&Co. is also an exempt holding company under     FERC rules.         In addition, as a result of our power-related activities, we are     subject to extensive and evolving energy, environmental and     other governmental laws and regulations, as discussed under     Risk Factors  Our power generation interests     and related activities subject us to extensive regulation, as     well as environmental and other risks associated with power     generation activities in Part I, Item 1A of the     Annual Report on     Form 10-K.        18    Table of Contents       Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to state     insurance regulation and oversight in the states in which they     are domiciled and in the other states in which they are     licensed, and we are subject to oversight as an insurance     holding company in states where our insurance subsidiaries are     domiciled. In addition, a number of our other businesses,     including our lending and mortgage businesses, require us to     obtain licenses, adhere to applicable regulations and be subject     to the oversight of various regulators in the states in which we     conduct these businesses.         The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 contains anti-money laundering and     financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of     various new regulations applicable to broker-dealers and other     financial services companies, including standards for verifying     client identification at account opening, and obligations to     monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities.     Through these and other provisions, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001     seeks to promote the identification of parties that may be     involved in terrorism, money laundering or other suspicious     activities. Anti-money laundering laws outside the United States     contain some similar provisions. The obligation of financial     institutions, including Goldman Sachs, to identify their     clients, to monitor for and report suspicious transactions, to     respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities     and law enforcement agencies, and to share information with     other financial institutions, has required the implementation     and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls     that have increased, and may continue to increase, our costs,     and any failure with respect to our programs in this area could     subject us to substantial liability and regulatory fines.       Regulation Outside     the United States         Goldman Sachs provides investment services in and from the     United Kingdom under the regulation of the Financial Services     Authority (FSA). Goldman Sachs International (GSI), our     regulated U.K.     broker-dealer,     is subject to the capital requirements of the FSA. As of     November 2007, GSI was in compliance with the FSA capital     requirements. Other subsidiaries, including Goldman Sachs     International Bank, are also regulated by the FSA.         Goldman Sachs has established two wholly owned banks in Dublin,     Ireland. These banks are regulated by the Irish Financial     Services Regulatory Authority. Because our Irish banks have no     branches, agencies or banking subsidiaries in the United States,     they do not subject Goldman Sachs to the U.S. Bank Holding     Company Act. As of the commencement of business in December     2007, these banks were in compliance with all regulatory capital     requirements.         Various other Goldman Sachs entities are regulated by the     banking, insurance and securities regulatory authorities of the     European countries in which they operate, including, among     others, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and     the Bundesbank in Germany, Banque de France and the     Autorité des Marchés Financiers in France, Banca     dItalia and the Commissione Nazionale per le Società     e la Borsa (CONSOB) in Italy, the Federal Financial Markets     Service in Russia and the Swiss Federal Banking Commission.     Certain Goldman Sachs entities are also regulated by the     European securities, derivatives and commodities exchanges of     which they are members.         The investment services that are subject to oversight by the FSA     and other regulators within the European Union are regulated in     accordance with national laws, many of which implement European     Union directives requiring, among other things, compliance with     certain capital adequacy standards, customer protection     requirements and market conduct and trade reporting rules. These     standards, requirements and rules are similarly implemented,     under the same directives, throughout the European Union.         On November 1, 2007, the national implementing legislation     to the European Unions Markets in Financial Instruments     Directive (Directive 2004/39/EC, known as MiFID) became     effective in countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany and     France. MiFID affects several of our subsidiaries by imposing     detailed pan-European requirements in areas such as internal     organization (including conflict management, outsourcing and     recordkeeping), best execution, real-time disclosure of     completed transactions in shares, quoting obligations for     internalized client orders in shares, transaction reporting        19    Table of Contents       to regulators, client classification and documentation,     disclosure of fees and other payments received from or paid to     third parties in relation to investment services and the     regulation of investment services related to commodity     derivatives. The lack of detailed regulatory practice under this     regime could lead to regulatory uncertainties.         Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), our regulated Japanese     broker-dealer, is subject to the capital requirements of     Japans Financial Services Agency. As of November 2007,     GSJCL was in compliance with its capital adequacy requirements.     GSJCL is also regulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Osaka     Securities Exchange, the Tokyo Financial Exchange, the Japan     Securities Dealers Association, the Tokyo Commodity Exchange and     the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in Japan.         Also in Asia, the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong     Kong, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the China Securities     Regulatory Commission, the Korean Financial Supervisory Service     and the Securities and Exchange Board of India, among others,     regulate various of our subsidiaries and also have capital     standards and other requirements comparable to the rules of the     SEC.         Various Goldman Sachs entities are regulated by the banking and     regulatory authorities of other     non-U.S. countries     in which Goldman Sachs operates, including, among others, Brazil     and Dubai. In addition, certain of our insurance subsidiaries     are regulated by the Bermuda Registrar of Companies.       Regulations     Applicable in and Outside the United States         The U.S. and     non-U.S. government     agencies, regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations,     as well as state securities commissions and other state     regulators in the United States, are empowered to conduct     administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the     issuance of cease and desist orders, or the suspension or     expulsion of a broker-dealer or its directors, officers or     employees. From time to time, our subsidiaries have been subject     to investigations and proceedings, and sanctions have been     imposed for infractions of various regulations relating to our     activities, none of which has had a material adverse effect on     us or our businesses.         The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has issued the     Basel II capital standards, which are designed to promote     enhanced risk management practices among large, international     financial services firms by aligning regulatory capital     requirements more closely with the underlying risks faced by     these firms. GSI, as well as our other subsidiaries in the     United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe, became subject to the     Basel II requirements on January 1, 2008. The     Consolidated Supervised Entity rules described above under      Regulation in the United States, which     provide for group-wide supervision, are consistent with Basel     II. Complying with these new standards has required us to     develop and apply new and sophisticated measurement techniques     to determine our regulatory capital adequacy. As an increasing     number of financial institutions become subject to Basel II, new     interpretations may arise, and harmonization among regulators     could then impact the regulatory capital standards under which     we operate as a Consolidated Supervised Entity, as well as the     requirements for some of our regulated subsidiaries.         The research areas of investment banks have been and remain the     subject of regulatory scrutiny. The SEC, the NYSE and FINRA have     adopted rules governing research analysts, including rules     imposing restrictions on the interaction between equity research     analysts and investment banking personnel at member securities     firms. Various     non-U.S. jurisdictions     have imposed both substantive and     disclosure-based     requirements with respect to research and may impose additional     regulations. In 2003, GS&Co. agreed to a global settlement     with certain federal and state securities regulators and     self-regulatory organizations to resolve investigations into     equity research analysts alleged conflicts of interest.     The global settlement includes certain restrictions and     undertakings that have imposed additional costs and limitations     on the conduct of our businesses, including restrictions on the     interaction between research and investment banking areas.        20    Table of Contents       In connection with the research settlement, we have also     subscribed to a voluntary initiative imposing restrictions on     the allocation of shares in initial public offerings to     executives and directors of public companies. The FSA in the     United Kingdom has imposed requirements on the conduct of the     allocation process in equity and fixed income securities     offerings (including initial public offerings and secondary     distributions). The SEC, the FSA, the NYSE, FINRA and other     U.S. or     non-U.S. regulators     may in the future adopt additional and more stringent rules with     respect to offering procedures and the management of conflicts     of interest, and we cannot fully predict the effect that any new     requirements will have on our business.         Our investment management businesses are subject to significant     regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world relating     to, among other things, the safeguarding of client assets and     our management of client funds.         As discussed above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to     regulatory capital requirements in jurisdictions throughout the     world. Subsidiaries not subject to separate regulation may hold     capital to satisfy local tax guidelines, rating agency     requirements or internal policies, including policies concerning     the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based     upon its underlying risk.         Certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with     regulations enacted by U.S. federal and state governments,     the European Union or other jurisdictions     and/or     enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges     relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees     or others, and any failure to comply with these regulations     could expose us to liability     and/or     reputational damage.      Item 1A.  Risk     Factors          We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in     our businesses, including market, liquidity, credit,     operational, legal and regulatory risks. The following are some     of the more important factors that could affect our businesses.     Our businesses     may be adversely affected by conditions in the global financial     markets and economic conditions generally.         Our business, by its nature, does not produce predictable     earnings. While we have achieved record earnings per common     share in each of our last four fiscal years, reflecting a     favorable trading and investing environment and an increase in     investment banking activity, an adverse change in these market     conditions may adversely affect our results of operations.         Our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the     global financial markets and economic conditions generally, and     these conditions may change suddenly and dramatically. A     favorable business environment is generally characterized by,     among other factors, high global gross domestic product growth,     stable geopolitical conditions, transparent, liquid and     efficient capital markets, low inflation, high business and     investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable     or uncertain economic and market conditions, which can be caused     by: outbreaks of hostilities or other geopolitical instability;     declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or     business confidence; limitations on the availability or     increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in     inflation, interest rates, exchange rate volatility, default     rates or the price of basic commodities; corporate, political or     other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital     markets; natural disasters or pandemics; or a combination of     these or other factors, have adversely affected, and may in the     future adversely affect, our business and profitability in many     ways, including the following:                         Increasing or high interest rates     and/or     widening credit spreads, especially if such changes are rapid,     may create a less favorable environment for certain of our     businesses, and may affect the fair value of financial     instruments that we issue or hold. For example, beginning in the     second half of 2007, difficulties in the mortgage and broader     credit markets in the United States and elsewhere resulted in a     relatively sudden and substantial decrease in the          21    Table of Contents                  availability of credit and a corresponding increase in funding     costs. Credit spreads widened significantly, affecting     volatility and liquidity in the debt and equity markets,     particularly in the markets for mortgage-related securities and     non-investment-grade debt securities and loans. This negatively     impacted prices of these securities and loans (as well as     commitments for these loans), and, to the extent that we sought     to do so, our ability to sell these securities and loans (and     loan commitments). The sudden decline in liquidity and prices of     these types of securities and loans made it generally more     difficult to value them. These conditions have persisted through     the end of 2007 and we cannot predict how long these conditions     will exist or how our businesses may be affected.                           We have been committing increasing amounts of capital in many of     our businesses and generally maintain large trading, specialist     and investing positions. Market fluctuations and volatility may     adversely affect the value of those positions, including, but     not limited to, our interest rate and credit products, currency,     commodity and equity positions, and our merchant banking     investments, or may reduce our willingness to enter into new     transactions. From time to time, we have incurred significant     trading losses in periods of market turbulence. Conversely,     certain of our trading businesses depend on market volatility to     provide trading and arbitrage opportunities, and decreases in     volatility may reduce these opportunities and adversely affect     the results of these businesses.                    Increases in interest rates or credit spreads, as well as     limitations on the availability of credit, such as occurred in     the second half of 2007, can affect our ability to borrow on a     secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our     liquidity and results of operations. We seek to finance our less     liquid assets on a secured basis and disruptions in the credit     markets are likely to make it harder and more expensive to fund     these assets. In difficult credit markets, we may be forced to     fund our operations at a higher cost or we may be unable to     raise as much funding as we need to support our business     activities. This could cause us to curtail our business     activities and could increase our cost of funding, both of which     could reduce our profitability.                    Our investment banking business is affected by changes in market     conditions. Industry-wide declines in the size and number of     underwritings and mergers and acquisitions may have an adverse     effect on our revenues and, because we may be unable to reduce     expenses correspondingly, our profit margins. In particular,     because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues     are derived from our participation in large transactions, a     decrease in the number of large transactions due to uncertain or     unfavorable market conditions may adversely affect our     investment banking business. Our clients engaging in mergers and     acquisitions often rely on access to the secured and unsecured     credit markets to finance their transactions. The lack of     available credit or increased cost of credit may adversely     affect the size, volume and timing of our clients merger     and acquisition transactions  particularly large     transactions  and adversely affect our financial     advisory and underwriting businesses.                    We receive asset-based management fees based on the value of our     clients portfolios and, in some cases, we also receive     incentive fees based on increases in the value of our     clients portfolios. Reductions in the level of the equity     markets or increases in interest rates tend to reduce the value     of our clients portfolios, which in turn may reduce the     fees we earn for managing assets. Increases in interest rates or     attractive conditions in other investments could cause our     clients to transfer their assets out of our funds or other     products. Even in the absence of uncertain or unfavorable     economic or market conditions, investment performance by our     asset management business below the performance of benchmarks or     competitors could result in a decline in assets under     management, including through redemptions, and in the incentive     and management fees we receive and might make it more difficult     to attract new investors.          22    Table of Contents                         Market volatility has been relatively low in recent years,     although it generally increased in the second half of 2007. An     increase in volatility increases our measured risk, which might     cause us to reduce our proprietary positions or to reduce     certain of our business activities. In such circumstances, we     may not be able to reduce our positions or our exposure in a     timely, cost-effective way or in a manner sufficient to offset     the increase in measured risk.                    The volume of transactions that we execute for our clients and     as a specialist or market maker may decline, which would reduce     the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads. In our     specialist businesses, we are obligated by stock exchange rules     to maintain an orderly market, including by purchasing shares in     a declining market. This may result in trading losses and an     increased need for liquidity. Weakness in global equity markets     and the trading of securities in multiple markets and on     multiple exchanges could adversely impact our trading businesses     and impair the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible     assets.                    The emergence of a pandemic or other widespread health     emergency, or concerns over the possibility of such an     emergency, could create economic and financial disruptions in     emerging markets and other areas throughout the world, and could     lead to operational difficulties (including travel limitations)     that could impair our ability to manage our businesses around     the world. In addition, unforeseen or catastrophic events,     including health emergencies, terrorist attacks or natural     disasters, could expose our insurance subsidiaries to     significant losses.       We may incur     losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and     strategies.         We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk     and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but     complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and     legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review     processes and other mechanisms. Our trading risk management     process seeks to balance our ability to profit from trading     positions with our exposure to potential losses. While we employ     a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk     mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that     accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and     financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes.     Thus, we may, in the course of our activities, incur losses.         The models that we use to assess and control our risk exposures     reflect assumptions about the degrees of correlation or lack     thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market     indicators, and in times of market stress or other unforeseen     circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become     correlated, or conversely previously correlated indicators may     move in different directions. In the past, these types of market     movements have at times limited the effectiveness of our hedging     strategies and have caused us to incur significant losses, and     they may do so in the future. These changes in correlation can     be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or     trading models with assumptions or algorithms that are similar     to ours. In these cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk     positions due to the activity of other market participants. In     addition, we are increasingly investing our own capital in our     alternative investment and merchant banking funds, and     limitations on our ability to withdraw some or all of our     investments in these funds, whether for legal, reputational or     other reasons, may make it more difficult for us to control the     risk exposures relating to these investments.         For a further discussion of our risk management policies and     procedures, see Managements Discussion and Analysis     of Financial Condition and Results of Operations      Risk Management in Part II, Item 7 of the Annual     Report on     Form 10-K.     Our liquidity,     profitability and businesses may be adversely affected by an     inability to access the debt capital markets or to sell assets,     by a reduction in our credit ratings or by an inability of The     Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. to access funds from its     subsidiaries.         Liquidity is essential to our businesses. Our liquidity could be     impaired by an inability to access secured     and/or     unsecured debt markets, an inability to sell assets or redeem     our investments, or        23    Table of Contents       unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral. This situation may     arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control,     such as a general market disruption or an operational problem     that affects third parties or us, or even by the perception     among market participants that we are experiencing greater     liquidity risk. The financial instruments that we hold and the     contracts to which we are a party are increasingly complex, as     we employ structured products to benefit our clients and     ourselves, and these complex structured products often do not     have readily available markets to access in times of liquidity     stress. Growth of our proprietary investing activities may lead     to situations where the holdings from these activities represent     a significant portion of specific markets, which could restrict     liquidity for our positions. Further, our ability to sell assets     may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell     similar assets at the same time, as is likely to occur in a     liquidity or other market crisis. In addition, financial     institutions with which we interact may exercise set-off rights     or the right to require additional collateral, including in     difficult market conditions, which could further impair our     access to liquidity.         Our credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction     in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and     competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, limit our     access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under     certain bilateral provisions in some of our trading and     collateralized financing contracts. Under these provisions,     counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with     Goldman Sachs or require us to post additional collateral.     Termination of our trading and collateralized financing     contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our     liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or     to make significant cash payments or securities movements.         The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a holding company and,     therefore, depends on dividends, distributions and other     payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to     fund all payments on its obligations, including debt     obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including GS&Co.,     are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or     reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to The Goldman     Sachs Group, Inc. Regulatory action of that kind could impede     access to funds that The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. needs to make     payments on obligations, including debt obligations, or dividend     payments.     Our     businesses, profitability and liquidity may be adversely     affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults     by, third parties who owe us money, securities or other assets     or whose securities or obligations we hold.         The amount and duration of our credit exposures have been     increasing over the past several years, as has the breadth and     size of the entities to which we have credit exposures. We are     exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money,     securities or other assets will not perform their obligations.     These parties may default on their obligations to us due to     bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other     reasons. We are also subject to the risk that our rights against     third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. In     addition, deterioration in the credit quality of third parties     whose securities or obligations we hold could result in losses     and/or     adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use     those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes. A     significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our     counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results.     While in many cases we are permitted to require additional     collateral from counterparties that experience financial     difficulty, disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we     are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets. The     termination of contracts and the foreclosure on collateral may     subject us to claims for the improper exercise of our rights.     Default rates, downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to     the valuation of collateral tend to increase in times of market     stress and illiquidity.         In addition, as part of our clearing business, we finance our     client positions, and we could be held responsible for the     defaults or misconduct of our clients. Although we regularly     review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties     and to specific industries, countries and regions that we     believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from     events or circumstances that are        24    Table of Contents       difficult to detect or foresee. In addition, concerns about, or     a default by, one institution could lead to significant     liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions,     which in turn could adversely affect Goldman Sachs.     Concentration     of risk increases the potential for significant     losses.         Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant     losses in our market-making, proprietary trading and investing,     block trading, merchant banking, underwriting and lending     businesses. This risk may increase to the extent we expand our     proprietary trading and investing businesses or commit capital     to facilitate customer-driven business. The number and size of     such transactions may affect our results of operations in a     given period. For example, we regularly enter into large     transactions as part of our trading businesses, including large     blocks of securities sold in block trades rather than on a     marketed basis. Moreover, because of concentration of risk, we     may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are     generally favorable for our competitors. In addition, we extend     large commitments as part of our credit origination activities.     Our inability to reduce our credit risk by selling, syndicating     or securitizing these positions could negatively affect our     results of operations due to a decrease in the fair value of the     positions, as well as the loss of revenues associated with     selling such securities or loans.         While our activities expose us to many different industries and     counterparties, we routinely execute a high volume of     transactions with counterparties in the financial services     industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks,     investment funds and other institutional clients, resulting in     significant credit concentration with respect to this industry.     In the ordinary course of business, we may also be subject to a     concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty,     borrower or issuer.     The financial     services industry is highly competitive.         The financial services industry  and all of our     businesses  are intensely competitive, and we expect     them to remain so. We compete on the basis of a number of     factors, including transaction execution, our products and     services, innovation, reputation and price. We believe that we     will continue to experience pricing pressures in the future as     some of our competitors seek to increase market share by     reducing prices. Over time, there has been substantial     consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial     services industry. U.S. federal legislation, which     significantly expanded the activities permissible for firms     affiliated with a U.S. bank, has accelerated this     consolidation and further increased competition. This trend     toward consolidation and convergence has significantly increased     the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors. This     trend has also hastened the globalization of the securities and     other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to     commit capital to support our international operations and to     execute large global transactions. As we expand into new     business areas and new geographic regions, we will face     competitors with more experience and more established     relationships with clients, regulators and industry participants     in the relevant market, which could adversely affect our ability     to expand.         Pricing and other competitive pressures in our investment     banking business, as well as our other businesses, have     continued to increase. For example, the trend in the     underwriting business toward multiple book runners and     co-managers handling transactions, where previously there would     have been a single book runner, has adversely affected our     business and reduced our revenues. In addition, we have     experienced, due to competitive factors, pressure to extend and     price credit at levels that may not always fully compensate us     for the risks we take. In particular, corporate clients     sometimes seek to require credit commitments from us in     connection with investment banking and other assignments.     Finally, competitive pressures and other industry factors,     including the increasing use by our clients of low-cost     electronic trading, have caused and could continue to cause a     reduction in commissions and spreads.        25    Table of Contents   We face     enhanced risks as new business initiatives lead us to transact     with a broader array of clients and expose us to new asset     classes and new markets.         A number of our recent and planned business initiatives and     expansions of existing businesses may bring us into contact,     directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are     not within our traditional client base and expose us to new     asset classes and new markets. For example, in recent years we     have begun providing loans to small and mid-sized businesses,     originating and acquiring life insurance policies and     originating residential mortgages, and we are increasingly     transacting business and investing in new regions, including a     wider range of emerging markets. In addition, we are     increasingly offering complex structured products, including     securitized derivatives, and alternative investments to a wider     investor base, including retail investors, both directly and     through third-party distribution channels. Furthermore, a number     of our businesses, including our proprietary investing and     merchant banking activities, cause us to directly or indirectly     own interests in, or otherwise become affiliated with the     ownership and operation of, public services, such as airports,     toll roads, shipping ports, electric power generation facilities     and other commodities infrastructure components, both within and     outside the United States. Recent market conditions are likely     to lead to an increase in opportunities to acquire distressed     assets, and we may determine opportunistically to increase our     exposure to these types of assets. These business activities     expose us to new and enhanced risks, including reputational     concerns arising from dealing with less sophisticated     counterparties and investors, greater regulatory scrutiny of     these activities, increased credit-related and operational     risks, risks arising from accidents or acts of terrorism, and     reputational concerns with the manner in which these assets are     being operated or held.     Derivative     transactions may expose us to unexpected risk and potential     losses.         We are party to a large number of derivative transactions,     including credit derivatives that require that we deliver to the     counterparty the underlying security, loan or other obligation     in order to receive payment. In a number of cases, we do not     hold the underlying security, loan or other obligation and may     have difficulty obtaining, or be unable to obtain, the     underlying security, loan or other obligation through the     physical settlement of other transactions. As a result, we are     subject to the risk that we may not be able to obtain the     security, loan or other obligation within the required     contractual time frame for delivery, particularly if default     rates increase from the historically low levels over the past     several years. This could cause us to forfeit the payments due     to us under these contracts or result in settlement delays with     the attendant credit and operational risk as well as increased     costs to the firm.         Derivative contracts and other transactions entered into with     third parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties on     a timely basis. While the transaction remains unconfirmed, we     are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the     event of a default may find it more difficult to enforce the     contract. In addition, as new and more complex derivative     products are created, covering a wider array of underlying     credit and other instruments, disputes about the terms of the     underlying contracts could arise, which could impair our ability     to effectively manage our risk exposures from these products and     subject us to increased costs.     A failure in     our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third     parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses,     result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our     reputation and cause losses.         Shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or     systems could lead to impairment of our liquidity, financial     loss, disruption of our businesses, liability to clients,     regulatory intervention or reputational damage. Our businesses     are highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor, on a     daily basis, a large number of transactions, many of which are     highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets in many     currencies. These transactions, as well as information     technology services we provide to clients, often must adhere to     client-specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory     standards. As our client base and our geographical reach     expands, developing and maintaining our operational systems and     infrastructure becomes increasingly challenging. Our financial,     accounting,        26    Table of Contents       data processing or other operating systems and facilities may     fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of     events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as     a spike in transaction volume, adversely affecting our ability     to process these transactions or provide these services. The     inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of     transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our     businesses.         We also face the risk of operational failure, termination or     capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges,     clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to     facilitate our securities transactions, and as our     interconnectivity with our clients grows, we will increasingly     face the risk of operational failure with respect to our     clients systems. In recent years, there has been     significant consolidation among clearing agents, exchanges and     clearing houses, which has increased our exposure to operational     failure, termination or capacity constraints of the particular     financial intermediaries that we use and could affect our     ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives in the     event of any such failure, termination or constraint. Any such     failure, termination or constraint could adversely affect our     ability to effect transactions, service our clients and manage     our exposure to risk.         Despite the contingency plans and facilities we have in place,     our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a     disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses     and the communities in which we are located. This may include a     disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation     or other services used by Goldman Sachs or third parties with     which we conduct business. These disruptions may occur, for     example, as a result of events that affect only the buildings of     Goldman Sachs or such third parties, or as a result of events     with a broader impact globally, regionally or in the cities     where those buildings are located. Nearly all of our employees     in our primary locations, including the New York metropolitan     area, London, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Bangalore, work in     close proximity to one another, in one or more buildings.     Notwithstanding our efforts to maintain business continuity,     given that our headquarters and the largest concentration of our     employees are in the New York metropolitan area, depending on     the intensity and longevity of the event, a catastrophic event     impacting our New York metropolitan area offices could very     negatively affect our business. If a disruption occurs in one     location and our employees in that location are unable to occupy     our offices or communicate with or travel to other locations,     our ability to service and interact with our clients may suffer,     and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency     plans that depend on communication or travel.         Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and     transmission of confidential and other information in our     computer systems and networks. Although we take protective     measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant,     our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to     unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code     and other events that could have a security impact. If one or     more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our     or our clients or counterparties confidential and     other information processed and stored in, and transmitted     through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause     interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients, our     counterparties or third parties operations, which     could result in significant losses or reputational damage. We     may be required to expend significant additional resources to     modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate     vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to     litigation and financial losses that are either not insured     against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by     us.         We routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and     proprietary information by email and other electronic means. We     have discussed and worked with clients and counterparties to     develop secure transmission capabilities, but we do not have,     and may be unable to put in place, secure capabilities with all     of our clients and counterparties. An interception or     mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information     being sent to or received from a client or counterparty could     result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational     harm. We are exposed to similar risks arising from the     interception of personal, confidential or proprietary     information sent to or received from, or the misuse or     mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information     by, vendors, service        27    Table of Contents       providers and other third parties who may receive such     information from us, and our efforts to ensure that these third     parties have appropriate controls in place may not be successful.     Conflicts of     interest are increasing and a failure to appropriately identify     and deal with conflicts of interest could adversely affect our     businesses.         Our reputation is one of our most important assets. As we have     expanded the scope of our businesses and our client base, we     increasingly have to address potential conflicts of interest,     including situations where our services to a particular client     or our own proprietary investments or other interests conflict,     or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of another     client, as well as situations where one or more of our     businesses have access to material non-public information that     may not be shared with other businesses within the firm.         The SEC, the NYSE, FINRA, other federal and state regulators and     regulators outside the United States, including in the United     Kingdom and Japan, have announced their intention to increase     their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest, including     through detailed examinations of specific transactions. There     have been complaints filed against financial institutions,     including Goldman Sachs, alleging the violation of antitrust     laws arising from their joint participation in certain leveraged     buyouts, referred to as club deals, as discussed     under Legal Proceedings  Private     Equity-Sponsored Acquisitions Litigation in Part I,     Item 3 of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     In addition, a number of class action complaints have also been     filed in connection with certain specific club deal     transactions which name the relevant club deal     participants among the defendants, including Goldman Sachs     affiliates in several cases, and generally allege that the     transactions constitute a breach of fiduciary duty by the target     company and that the club participants aided and     abetted such breach. We cannot predict the outcome of the     litigation to which we are a party, and we may become subject to     further litigation or regulatory scrutiny in the future in this     regard.         We have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to     identify and address conflicts of interest, including those     designed to prevent the improper sharing of information among     our businesses. However, appropriately identifying and dealing     with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our     reputation could be damaged and the willingness of clients to     enter into transactions in which such a conflict might arise may     be affected if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify and deal     appropriately with conflicts of interest. In addition, potential     or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or     enforcement actions.     Our businesses     and those of our clients are subject to extensive and pervasive     regulation around the world.         Goldman Sachs, as a participant in the financial services     industry, is subject to extensive regulation in jurisdictions     around the world. We face the risk of significant intervention     by regulatory authorities in all jurisdictions in which we     conduct our businesses. Among other things, we could be fined,     prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities or     subject to limitations or conditions on our business activities.         New laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing     laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or those of our     clients may also adversely affect our businesses. Regulatory     changes could lead to business disruptions, could require us to     change certain of our business practices and could expose us to     additional costs and liabilities as well as reputational harm.     For a discussion of the extensive regulation to which our     businesses are subject, see Business      Regulation in Part I, Item 1 of the Annual     Report on     Form 10-K.         Our firm is subject to regulatory capital requirements at a     number of levels, as described above under     Business  Regulation in Part I,     Item 1 of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     As a Consolidated Supervised Entity, we are subject to minimum     capital standards on a consolidated basis. A number of our     subsidiaries, including GS&Co., GSEC, GSI, GS Bank USA, our     Irish banking entities, GSJCL and Goldman, Sachs & Co.     oHG, are separately subject to their own minimum capital        28    Table of Contents       requirements imposed by various regulatory bodies. Complying     with these requirements may cause us to limit our business     activities or require us to liquidate assets or otherwise raise     capital in a manner that adversely affects our shareholders and     creditors. While we currently disclose these ratios to the SEC     and the FSA and to rating agencies, we may be required or may     determine to disclose publicly our group-wide Consolidated     Supervised Entity capital ratios beginning in mid-2008. It is     unclear how our ratios will compare to those of our competitors,     or how our investors, counterparties or clients may react to any     difference, positive or negative, in such ratios.         Firms in the financial services industry have been operating in     a difficult regulatory environment. The industry has experienced     increased scrutiny from a variety of regulators, both within and     outside the United States. Penalties and fines sought by     regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the     last several years, and certain regulators have been more likely     in recent years to commence enforcement actions. For example,     regulators, both within and outside the United States, continue     to scrutinize complex, structured finance transactions and have     brought enforcement actions against a number of financial     institutions in connection with such transactions. We seek to     create innovative solutions to address our clients needs,     and we have entered into, and continue to enter into, structured     transactions with clients.         This environment has led some of our clients to be less willing     to engage in transactions that may carry a risk of increased     scrutiny by regulators and has created uncertainty with respect     to a number of transactions that had historically been entered     into by financial services firms, including our firm, and that     were generally believed to be permissible and appropriate. This     environment also has led us and our competitors to modify     transaction structures and, in some cases, to limit or cease our     execution of some types of transactions. While we have policies     and procedures in place that are intended to ensure that the     transactions we enter into are appropriately reviewed and comply     with applicable laws and regulations, it is possible that     certain transactions could give rise to litigation or     enforcement actions or that the regulatory scrutiny of, and     litigation in connection with, transactions will make our     clients less willing to enter into these transactions with us,     and will adversely affect our business.     Substantial     legal liability or significant regulatory action against Goldman     Sachs could have material adverse financial effects or cause     significant reputational harm to Goldman Sachs, which in turn     could seriously harm our business prospects.         We face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the     volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in     litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial     institutions remain high. See Legal Proceedings in     Part I, Item 3 of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for a discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are     involved.         There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving     fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services     industry in recent years, and we run the risk that employee     misconduct could occur. It is not always possible to deter or     prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to     prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all     cases.     The growth of     electronic trading and the introduction of new technology may     adversely affect our business and may increase     competition.         Technology is fundamental to our business and our industry. The     growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new     technologies is changing our businesses and presenting us with     new challenges. Securities, futures and options transactions are     increasingly occurring electronically, both on our own systems     and through other alternative trading systems, and it appears     that the trend toward alternative trading systems will continue     and probably accelerate. Some of these alternative trading     systems compete with our trading businesses, including our     specialist businesses, and we may experience continued     competitive pressures in these and other areas. In addition, the     increased use by our clients of low-cost electronic trading     systems and direct electronic access to trading        29    Table of Contents       markets could cause a reduction in commissions and spreads. As     our clients increasingly use our systems to trade directly in     the markets, we may incur liabilities as a result of their use     of our order routing and execution infrastructure. The     NYSEs adoption and continued refinement of its hybrid     market for trading securities may increase pressure on our     Equities business as customers execute more of their     NYSE-related trades electronically. We have invested significant     resources into the development of electronic trading systems and     expect to continue to do so, but there is no assurance that the     revenues generated by these systems will yield an adequate     return on our investment, particularly given the relatively     lower commissions arising from electronic trades.     Our businesses     may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain     qualified employees.         Competition from within the financial services industry and from     businesses outside the financial services industry, such as     hedge funds, private equity funds and venture capital funds, for     qualified employees is intense. This is particularly the case in     emerging markets, where we are often competing for qualified     employees with entities that have a significantly greater     presence or more extensive experience in the region. Our     performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of     highly skilled individuals; therefore, our continued ability to     compete effectively in our businesses and to expand into new     businesses and geographic areas depends on our ability to     attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing     employees. In addition, current and future laws (including laws     relating to immigration and outsourcing) may restrict our     ability to move responsibilities or personnel from one     jurisdiction to another. This may impact our ability to take     advantage of business opportunities or potential efficiencies.     Our power     generation interests and related activities subject us to     extensive regulation, as well as environmental and other risks     associated with power generation activities.         The power generation facilities that we own and those that we     operate, as well as our other power-related activities, are     subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local     energy, environmental and other governmental laws and     regulations, including environmental laws and regulations     relating to, among others, air quality, water quality, waste     management, natural resources, site remediation and health and     safety. In the past several years, intensified scrutiny of the     energy market by federal, state and local authorities and the     public has resulted in increased regulatory and legal     proceedings involving companies engaged in electric power     generation and wholesale sales and trading of electricity and     natural gas.         In addition, we may incur substantial costs in complying with     current or future laws and regulations relating to power     generation, including having to commit significant capital     toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution     control equipment, payment of emission fees and carbon or other     taxes, and application for, and holding of, permits and licenses     at our power generation facilities. In certain instances,     compliance with applicable laws and regulations may require us     to cease or curtail operations of one or more of our power     generation facilities.         Our power generation facilities are also subject to the risk of     unforeseen or catastrophic events, including terrorist attacks,     natural disasters or other hostile or catastrophic events. We     may not have insurance against these risks or other risks,     including environmental risks, that such facilities face, and,     in cases in which we do have insurance, the insurance proceeds     may be inadequate to cover our losses. Our overall businesses     and reputation may be adversely affected by legal and regulatory     proceedings, particularly those related to environmental     matters, arising out of our power generation business, as well     as by the occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events or     negative publicity associated with our power-related activities.         The operation of our power generation facilities may be     disrupted for many reasons, many of which are outside our     control, including the breakdown or failure of power generation     equipment, transmission lines or other equipment or processes,     and performance below expected levels of output        30    Table of Contents       or efficiency. In addition, these facilities could be adversely     affected by the failure of any of our third-party suppliers or     service providers to perform their contractual obligations,     including the failure to obtain raw materials necessary for     operation at reasonable prices. Market conditions or other     factors could cause a failure to satisfy or obtain waivers under     agreements with third parties, including lenders and utilities,     which impose significant obligations on our subsidiaries that     own such facilities. The occurrence of any of such events may     prevent the affected facilities from performing under applicable     power sales agreements, may impair their operations or financial     results and may result in litigation or other reputational harm.     In conducting     our businesses around the world, we are subject to political,     economic, legal, operational and other risks that are inherent     in operating in many countries.         In conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our     global operations, we are subject to risks of possible     nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital     controls, exchange controls and other restrictive governmental     actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities. In many     countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the securities     and financial services industries and many of the transactions     in which we are involved are uncertain and evolving, and it may     be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local     laws in every market. Any determination by local regulators that     we have not acted in compliance with the application of local     laws in a particular market or our failure to develop effective     working relationships with local regulators could have a     significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in     that market but also on our reputation generally. We are also     subject to the enhanced risk that transactions we structure     might not be legally enforceable in all cases.         Our businesses and operations are increasingly expanding into     new regions throughout the world, including emerging markets,     and we expect this trend to continue. Various emerging market     countries have experienced severe economic and financial     disruptions, including significant devaluations of their     currencies, capital and currency exchange controls, and low or     negative growth rates in their economies. The possible effects     of any of these conditions include an adverse impact on our     businesses and increased volatility in financial markets     generally.      Item 1B.  Unresolved     Staff Comments          There are no material unresolved written comments that were     received from the SEC staff 180 days or more before the end     of our fiscal year relating to our periodic or current reports     under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.      Item 2.  Properties          Our principal executive offices are located at 85 Broad Street,     New York, New York, and comprise approximately one million     rentable square feet of leased space, pursuant to a lease     agreement expiring in June 2011. We also occupy over     680,000 rentable square feet at One New York Plaza under     lease agreements expiring primarily in 2009 (with options to     renew for up to five additional years), and we lease space at     various other locations in the New York metropolitan area. In     total, we lease approximately 3.8 million rentable square     feet in the New York metropolitan area.         In August 2005, we leased from Battery Park City Authority a     parcel of land in lower Manhattan, pursuant to a ground lease.     We are currently constructing a 2.1 million gross square     foot office building on the site that will serve as our world     headquarters. Under the lease, Battery Park City Authority holds     title to all improvements, including the office building,     subject to Goldman Sachs right of exclusive possession and     use through May 2069, the expiration date of the lease.         Under the terms of the ground lease, we made a lump-sum ground     rent payment in June 2007 of $161 million, which was paid     into escrow, to be released to the Battery Park City Authority     pending performance of specified state and city obligations. We     are required to make additional periodic payments during the     term of the lease. We are obligated under the ground lease to     construct the office building by 2011 (subject to extensions in     the case of force majeure) in accordance with certain        31    Table of Contents       pre-approved design standards. Construction began on the     building in November 2005, and we expect initial occupancy of     the building during 2009. The building is projected to cost     between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, including     acquisition, development, fitout and furnishings, financing and     other related costs.         We are receiving a number of benefits from the City and State of     New York based on our agreement to construct our world     headquarters in lower Manhattan. These benefits are subject to     recoupment or recapture if we do not proceed in accordance with     our agreements with the City and State of New York.         We have offices at 30 Hudson Street in Jersey City, New Jersey,     which we own and which include approximately 1.6 million     gross square feet of office space, and we own over     575,000 square feet of additional office space spread among     four locations in New York and New Jersey. We have additional     offices in the U.S. and elsewhere in the Americas, which     together comprise approximately 2.5 million rentable square     feet of leased space.         In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, we have offices that     total approximately 2.0 million rentable square feet. Our     European headquarters is located in London at Peterborough     Court, pursuant to a lease expiring in 2026. In total, we lease     approximately 1.5 million rentable square feet in London     through various leases, relating to various properties.         In Asia, we have offices that total approximately     1.3 million rentable square feet. Our headquarters in this     region are in Tokyo, at the Roppongi Hills Mori Tower, and in     Hong Kong, at the Cheung Kong Center. In Tokyo, we currently     lease approximately 390,000 rentable square feet through a     lease that will expire in 2018. In Hong Kong, we currently lease     approximately 220,000 rentable square feet under lease     agreements, the majority of which will expire in 2011.         Our occupancy expenses include costs associated with office     space held in excess of our current requirements. This excess     space, the cost of which is charged to earnings as incurred, is     being held for potential growth or to replace currently occupied     space that we may exit in the future. We regularly evaluate our     current and future space capacity in relation to current and     projected staffing levels. In 2007, we incurred exit costs of     $128 million related to office space in New York. We may     incur additional exit costs in 2008 and thereafter to the extent     we (i) reduce our space capacity or (ii) commit to, or     occupy, new properties in the locations in which we operate and,     consequently, dispose of existing space that had been held for     potential growth. These exit costs may be material to our     results of operations in a given period.      Item 3.  Legal     Proceedings          We are involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and     arbitration proceedings (including those described below)     concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our     businesses. We believe, based on currently available     information, that the results of such proceedings, in the     aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our     financial condition, but might be material to our operating     results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the     operating results for such period. Given the range of litigation     and investigations presently under way, our litigation expenses     can be expected to remain high.     IPO Process     Matters         The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co.     are among the numerous financial services companies that have     been named as defendants in a variety of lawsuits alleging     improprieties in the process by which those companies     participated in the underwriting of public offerings in recent     years.         Certain purported class actions have been brought in the     U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York,     beginning on November 3, 1998, by purchasers of securities     in public offerings as well as certain purported issuers of such     offerings, that allege that the defendants have conspired        32    Table of Contents       to fix at 7% the discount that underwriting syndicates receive     from issuers of shares in certain offerings in violation of     federal antitrust laws. On March 15, 1999, the purchaser     plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint seeking treble     damages as well as injunctive relief. The district court has     granted a motion to dismiss with prejudice the purchasers     damages claims. The district court denied class certification     with respect to the damages claims asserted by the issuers of     securities, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second     Circuit granted the issuer plaintiffs petition to review     that certification decision on an interlocutory basis and     reversed and remanded by a decision, dated     September 11, 2007. The issuer plaintiffs have renewed     their request for certification on remand.         Goldman, Sachs & Co. has also, together with other     underwriters in certain offerings as well as the issuers and     certain of their officers and directors, been named as a     defendant in a number of related lawsuits filed in the     U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York     alleging, among other things, that the prospectuses for the     offerings violated the federal securities laws by failing to     disclose the existence of alleged arrangements tying allocations     in certain offerings to higher customer brokerage commission     rates as well as purchase orders in the aftermarket, and that     the alleged arrangements resulted in market manipulation. The     federal district court denied the motion to dismiss in all     material respects relating to the underwriter defendants and     generally granted plaintiffs motion for class     certification in six focus cases. The     U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the     district courts order granting class certification, denied     plaintiffs applications for rehearing and rehearing en     banc, and remanded. On August 14, 2007, plaintiffs     amended their complaints in the six focus cases as     well as their master allegations for all such cases to reflect     new class related allegations. On September 27, 2007,     plaintiffs filed a new motion for class certification in the     district court, and on November 14, 2007, Goldman,     Sachs & Co. and the other defendants moved to dismiss     the amended complaints.         The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is among numerous underwriting     firms named as defendants in a number of complaints filed     commencing October 3, 2007, in the U.S. District     Court for the Western District of Washington alleging violations     of the federal securities laws in connection with offerings of     securities for 16 issuers during 1999 and 2000. The complaints     generally assert that the underwriters, together with each     issuers directors, officers and principal shareholders,     entered into purported agreements to tie allocations in the     offerings to increased brokerage commissions and aftermarket     purchase orders. The complaints further allege that, based upon     these and other purported agreements, the underwriters violated     the reporting provisions of, and are subject to short-swing     profit recovery under, Section 16 of the Securities     Exchange Act of 1934. On October 29, 2007, the cases     were reassigned to a single district judge.         Goldman, Sachs & Co. has been named as a defendant in     an action commenced on May 15, 2002 in New York     Supreme Court, New York County, by an official committee of     unsecured creditors on behalf of eToys, Inc., alleging that the     firm intentionally underpriced eToys, Inc.s initial public     offering. The action seeks, among other things, unspecified     compensatory damages resulting from the alleged lower amount of     offering proceeds. The court granted Goldman, Sachs &     Co.s motion to dismiss as to five of the claims; plaintiff     appealed from the dismissal of the five claims, and Goldman,     Sachs & Co. appealed from the denial of its motion as     to the remaining claim. The New York Appellate Division, First     Department affirmed in part and reversed in part the lower     courts ruling on the firms motion to dismiss,     permitting all claims to proceed except the claim for fraud, as     to which the appellate court granted leave to replead, and the     New York Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part,     dismissing claims for breach of contract, professional     malpractice and unjust enrichment, but permitting claims for     breach of fiduciary duty and fraud to continue. On remand to the     lower court, Goldman, Sachs & Co. moved to dismiss the     surviving claims or, in the alternative, for summary judgment,     but the motion was denied by a decision dated     March 21, 2006. Plaintiff has moved for leave to amend     the complaint again, and Goldman, Sachs & Co. has     cross-moved to dismiss.         The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and certain of its affiliates     have, together with various underwriters in certain offerings,     received subpoenas and requests for documents and information        33    Table of Contents       from various governmental agencies and self-regulatory     organizations in connection with investigations relating to the     public offering process. Goldman Sachs has cooperated with these     investigations.     Iridium     Securities Litigation         Goldman, Sachs & Co. has been named as a defendant in     two purported class action lawsuits commenced, beginning on     May 26, 1999, in the U.S. District Court for the     District of Columbia brought on behalf of purchasers of     Class A common stock of Iridium World Communications, Ltd.     in a January 1999 underwritten secondary offering of     7,500,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price of     $33.50 per share, as well as in the secondary market. Goldman,     Sachs & Co. underwrote 996,500 shares of common     stock and Goldman Sachs International underwrote     320,625 shares of common stock for a total offering price     of approximately $44 million.         The defendants in the actions include Iridium, certain of its     officers and directors, Motorola, Inc. (an investor in Iridium)     and the lead underwriters in the offering, including Goldman,     Sachs & Co. The complaints in both actions allege     violations of the disclosure requirements of the federal     securities laws and seek compensatory     and/or     rescissory damages. Defendants motion to dismiss was     denied. The district court has certified two subclasses. The     district court denied the plaintiffs motion for summary     judgment as to claims under Section 11 of the Securities     Act of 1933, but granted summary judgment dismissing claims     under Section 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act against     Goldman, Sachs & Co. and all but one of the other     underwriter defendants. On November 3, 2006, the     underwriter defendants entered into an agreement in principle to     settle all claims against them for a settlement payment of     $8.25 million. The settlement is subject to, among other     things, documentation and court approval.         On August 13, 1999, Iridium World Communications, Ltd.     filed for protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws.     World Online     Litigation         Several lawsuits have been commenced in the Netherlands courts     based on alleged misstatements and omissions relating to the     initial public offering of World Online in March 2000.     Goldman Sachs and ABN AMRO Rothschild served as joint global     coordinators of the approximately 2.9 billion     offering. Goldman Sachs International underwrote     20,268,846 shares and Goldman, Sachs & Co.     underwrote 6,756,282 shares for a total offering price of     approximately 1.16 billion.         On September 11, 2000, several Dutch World Online     shareholders as well as a Dutch entity purporting to represent     the interests of certain World Online shareholders commenced a     proceeding in Amsterdam District Court against ABN AMRO     Bank N.V., also acting under the name of ABN AMRO     Rothschild, alleging misrepresentations and omissions     relating to the initial public offering of World Online. The     lawsuit seeks, among other things, the return of the purchase     price of the shares purchased by the plaintiffs or unspecified     damages. The court held that the claims failed and dismissed the     complaint and the Amsterdam Court of Appeal affirmed dismissal     of the complaint.         In March 2001, a Dutch shareholders association initiated legal     proceedings for an unspecified amount of damages against Goldman     Sachs International in Amsterdam District Court in connection     with the World Online offering. The court rejected the claims     against Goldman Sachs International, but found World Online     liable in an amount to be determined. The Dutch shareholders     association appealed from the dismissal of their claims against     Goldman Sachs International. By a decision dated     May 3, 2007, the Netherlands Court of Appeals affirmed     in part and reversed in part the decision of the district court     dismissing the complaint, holding that certain of the alleged     disclosure deficiencies were actionable. On     July 24, 2007, the shareholder association appealed     from the Netherlands Court of Appeals decision to the extent     that it affirmed the decision of the district court dismissing     the complaint. On November 2, 2007, Goldman Sachs     International joined the other defendants in        34    Table of Contents       appealing from the Court of Appeals decision to the extent that     it reversed the district courts dismissal.     Research     Independence Matters         Goldman, Sachs & Co. is one of several investment     firms that have been named as defendants in substantively     identical purported class actions filed in the     U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York     alleging violations of the federal securities laws in connection     with research coverage of certain issuers and seeking     compensatory damages. In one such action, relating to coverage     of RSL Communications, Inc. commenced on     July 15, 2003, Goldman, Sachs & Co.s     motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. The district court     granted the plaintiffs motion for class certification and     the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, by an     order dated January 26, 2007, vacated the district     courts class certification and remanded for     reconsideration. Goldman, Sachs & Co. is also a     defendant in several actions relating to research coverage of     Exodus Communications, Inc. that commenced beginning in May     2003. The actions were consolidated, Goldman, Sachs &     Co.s motion to dismiss was granted with leave to replead,     and plaintiff filed a second amended complaint. The     defendants motion to dismiss the second amended complaint     was granted by order dated December 4, 2007. Plaintiff     moved for reconsideration on December 21, 2007.         A purported shareholder derivative action was filed in New York     Supreme Court, New York County on June 13, 2003     against The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and its board of     directors, which, as amended on March 3, 2004 and     June 14, 2005, alleges that the directors breached their     fiduciary duties in connection with the firms research as     well as the firms IPO allocations practices.         The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co.     and Henry M. Paulson, Jr., the former Chairman and Chief     Executive Officer of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., have been     named as defendants in a purported class action filed originally     on July 18, 2003 in the U.S. District Court for     the District of Nevada on behalf of purchasers of The Goldman     Sachs Group, Inc. stock from July 1, 1999 through     May 7, 2002. The complaint alleges that defendants     breached their fiduciary duties and violated the federal     securities laws in connection with the firms research     activities. The complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified     compensatory damages     and/or     rescission. The action was transferred on consent to the     U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York,     and the district court granted the defendants motion to     dismiss with leave to amend. Plaintiffs filed a second amended     complaint, and defendants filed a motion to dismiss. In a     decision dated September 29, 2006, the federal     district court granted Mr. Paulsons motion to dismiss     with leave to replead but otherwise denied the motion.     Plaintiffs have moved for class certification.         The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and its affiliates, together with     other financial services firms, have received requests for     information from various governmental agencies and     self-regulatory organizations in connection with their review of     research independence issues. Goldman Sachs has cooperated with     these requests. See Business      Regulation  Regulations Applicable in and Outside the     United States in Part I, Item 1 of the Annual     Report on     Form 10-K     for a discussion of our global research settlement.     Enron Litigation     Matters         Goldman Sachs affiliates are defendants in certain actions     arising relating to Enron Corp., which filed for protection     under the U.S. bankruptcy laws on     December 2, 2001.         Goldman, Sachs & Co. and co-managing underwriters have     been named as defendants in certain purported securities class     and individual actions commenced beginning on     December 14, 2001 in the U.S. District Court for     the Southern District of Texas and California Superior Court     brought by purchasers of $255,875,000, (including     over-allotments) of Exchangeable Notes of Enron Corp. in August     1999. The notes were mandatorily exchangeable in 2002 into     shares of Enron Oil & Gas Company held by Enron Corp.     or their cash equivalent. The complaints also name as defendants     The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. as well as certain past and     present officers and directors of Enron Corp.        35    Table of Contents       and the companys outside accounting firm. The complaints     generally allege violations of the disclosure requirements of     the federal securities laws     and/or state     law, and seek compensatory damages. Goldman, Sachs &     Co. underwrote $127,937,500 (including over-allotments)     principal amount of the notes. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and     Goldman, Sachs & Co. moved to dismiss the class action     complaint in the Texas federal court and the motion was granted     as to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. but denied as to Goldman,     Sachs & Co. One of the plaintiffs has moved for class     certification. Goldman, Sachs & Co. has moved for     judgment on the pleadings against all plaintiffs. On     October 18, 2007, the parties reached a settlement     agreement in principle pursuant to which Goldman,     Sachs & Co. has contributed $11.5 million to a     settlement fund, subject to definitive documentation and court     approval. Plaintiffs in various consolidated actions relating to     Enron entered into a settlement with Banc of America Securities     LLC on July 2, 2004 and with Citigroup, Inc. on     June 10, 2005, including with respect to claims relating to     the Exchangeable Notes offering, as to which affiliates of those     settling defendants were two of the three underwriters (together     with Goldman, Sachs & Co.).         Several funds which allegedly sustained investment losses of     approximately $125 million in connection with secondary     market purchases of the Exchangeable Notes as well as Zero     Coupon Convertible Notes of Enron Corp. commenced an action in     the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New     York on January 16, 2002. As amended, the lawsuit     names as defendants the underwriters of the August 1999 offering     and the companys outside accounting firm, and alleges     violations of the disclosure requirements of the federal     securities laws, fraud and misrepresentation. The Judicial Panel     on Multidistrict Litigation has transferred that action to the     Texas federal district court for purposes of coordinated or     consolidated pretrial proceedings with other matters relating to     Enron Corp. Goldman, Sachs & Co. moved to dismiss the     complaint and the motion was granted in part and denied in part.     The district court granted the funds motion for leave to     file a second amended complaint on January 22, 2007.         Goldman, Sachs & Co. is among numerous defendants in     two substantively identical actions filed in the     U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York     beginning in November 2003 seeking to recover as fraudulent     transfers     and/or     preferences payments made by Enron Corp. in repurchasing its     commercial paper shortly before its bankruptcy filing. Goldman,     Sachs & Co., which had acted as a commercial paper     dealer for Enron Corp., resold to Enron Corp. approximately     $30 million of commercial paper as principal, and as an     agent facilitated Enron Corp.s repurchase of approximately     $340 million additional commercial paper from various     customers who have also been named as defendants. The bankruptcy     court denied Goldman, Sachs & Co.s motion to     dismiss as well as similar motions by other defendants. On     August 1, 2005, various defendants including Goldman,     Sachs & Co. petitioned to have the denial of their     motion to dismiss reviewed by the U.S. District Court for     the Southern District of New York. On     November 21, 2007, Goldman, Sachs & Co.     moved to remove the standing reference by the federal district     court.     Exodus Securities     Litigation         By an amended complaint dated July 11, 2002, Goldman,     Sachs & Co. and the other lead underwriters for the     February 2001 offering of 13,000,000 shares of common stock     and $575,000,000 of     51/4%     convertible subordinated notes of Exodus Communications, Inc.     were added as defendants in a purported class action pending in     the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of     California. The complaint, which also names as defendants     certain officers and directors of Exodus Communications, Inc.,     alleges violations of the disclosure requirements of the federal     securities laws and seeks compensatory damages. The district     court granted the defendants motion to dismiss with leave     to replead, and the plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint.     The district court denied the underwriter defendants     motion to dismiss the third amended complaint. The underwriter     defendants motion for reconsideration and clarification     was denied. By a decision dated June 2, 2006, the     district court granted summary judgment dismissing the complaint     on the grounds that the plaintiffs purchases of Exodus     securities were not traceable to the relevant offerings. Two new     putative plaintiffs filed motions        36    Table of Contents       to intervene, those motions were denied and a motion by the     putative intervenors to vacate the resulting judgment was also     denied. Plaintiffs filed an appeal and the underwriter     defendants cross-appealed on December 11, 2006 to the     extent that certain earlier grounds for dismissal had been     rejected by the district court.         Goldman, Sachs & Co. underwrote 5,200,000 shares     of common stock for a total offering price of approximately     $96,200,000, and $230,000,000 principal amount of the notes. On     September 26, 2001, Exodus Communications, Inc. filed     for protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws.     Montana Power     Litigation         Goldman, Sachs & Co. and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.     have been named as defendants in a purported class action     commenced originally on October 1, 2001 in Montana     District Court, Second Judicial District on behalf of former     shareholders of Montana Power Company. The complaint generally     alleges that Montana Power Company violated Montana law by     failing to procure shareholder approval of certain corporate     strategies and transactions, that the companys board     breached its fiduciary duties in pursuing those strategies and     transactions, and that Goldman, Sachs & Co. aided and     abetted the boards breaches and rendered negligent advice     in its role as financial advisor to the company. The complaint     seeks, among other things, compensatory damages. In addition to     Goldman, Sachs & Co. and The Goldman Sachs Group,     Inc., the defendants include Montana Power Company, certain of     its officers and directors, an outside law firm for the Montana     Power Company, and certain companies that purchased assets from     Montana Power Company and its affiliates. The Montana state     court denied the Goldman Sachs defendants motions to     dismiss. Following the bankruptcies of certain defendants in the     action, defendants removed the action to federal court, the     U.S. District Court for the District of Montana, Butte     Division.         On October 26, 2004, a creditors committee of Touch     America Holdings, Inc. brought an action against Goldman,     Sachs & Co., The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and a     former outside law firm for Montana Power Company in Montana     District Court, Second Judicial District. The complaint asserts     that Touch America Holdings, Inc. is the successor to Montana     Power Corporation and alleges substantially the same claims as     in the purported class action. Defendants removed the action to     federal court. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, but     the motion was denied by a decision dated     June 10, 2005.     Adelphia     Communications Fraudulent Conveyance Litigation         Goldman, Sachs & Co. is among numerous entities named     as defendants in two adversary proceedings commenced in the     U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New     York, one on July 6, 2003 by a creditors committee,     and the second on or about July 31, 2003 by an equity     committee of Adelphia Communications, Inc. Those proceedings     have now been consolidated in a single amended complaint filed     by the Adelphia Recovery Trust on October 31, 2007.     The complaint seeks, among other things, to recover, as     fraudulent conveyances, payments made allegedly by Adelphia     Communications, Inc. and its affiliates to certain brokerage     firms, including approximately $62.9 million allegedly paid     to Goldman, Sachs & Co., in respect of margin calls     made in the ordinary course of business on accounts owned by     members of the family that formerly controlled Adelphia     Communications, Inc. Goldman, Sachs & Co. moved to     dismiss the claim related to such margin payments on     December 21, 2007.     Specialist     Matters         Spear, Leeds & Kellogg Specialists LLC (SLKS) and     certain affiliates have received requests for information from     various governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations     as part of an     industry-wide     investigation relating to activities of floor specialists in     recent years. Goldman Sachs has cooperated with the requests.        37    Table of Contents       On March 30, 2004, certain specialist firms on the     NYSE, including SLKS, without admitting or denying the     allegations, entered into a final global settlement with the SEC     and the NYSE covering certain activities during the years 1999     through 2003. The SLKS settlement involves, among other things,     (i) findings by the SEC and the NYSE that SLKS violated     certain federal securities laws and NYSE rules, and in some     cases failed to supervise certain individual specialists, in     connection with trades that allegedly disadvantaged customer     orders, (ii) a cease and desist order against SLKS,     (iii) a censure of SLKS, (iv) SLKS agreement to     pay an aggregate of $45.3 million in disgorgement and a     penalty to be used to compensate customers, (v) certain     undertakings with respect to SLKS systems and procedures,     and (vi) SLKS retention of an independent consultant     to review and evaluate certain of SLKS compliance systems,     policies and procedures. Comparable findings were made and     sanctions imposed in the settlements with other specialist     firms. The settlement did not resolve the related private civil     actions against SLKS and other firms or regulatory     investigations involving individuals or conduct on other     exchanges.         SLKS, Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, L.P. and The Goldman     Sachs Group, Inc. are among numerous defendants named in     purported class actions brought beginning in October 2003 on     behalf of investors in the U.S. District Court for the     Southern District of New York alleging violations of the federal     securities laws and state common law in connection with NYSE     floor specialist activities. The actions seek unspecified     compensatory damages, restitution and disgorgement on behalf of     purchasers and sellers of unspecified securities between     October 17, 1998 and October 15, 2003. Plaintiffs     filed a consolidated amended complaint on     September 16, 2004. The defendants motion to     dismiss the amended complaint was granted in part and denied in     part by a decision dated December 13, 2005. On     June 28, 2007, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to     certify a class.         Spear, Leeds & Kellogg Specialists LLC and The Goldman     Sachs Group, Inc. are among numerous defendants named in a     purported class action brought in June 2007 on behalf of     investors in the U.S. District Court for the Southern     District of New York alleging violations of the federal     antitrust and securities laws, as well as common law, in     connection with execution of transactions through the New York     Stock Exchanges SuperDot system. The complaint seeks,     among other things, unspecified treble damages.     Treasury     Matters         On September 4, 2003, the SEC announced that Goldman,     Sachs & Co. had settled an administrative proceeding     arising from certain trading in U.S. Treasury bonds over an     approximately eight-minute period after Goldman,     Sachs & Co. received an October 31, 2001     telephone call from a Washington, D.C.-based political     consultant concerning a forthcoming Treasury refunding     announcement. Without admitting or denying the allegations,     Goldman, Sachs & Co. consented to the entry of an     order that, among other things, (i) censured Goldman,     Sachs & Co.; (ii) directed Goldman,     Sachs & Co. to cease and desist from committing or     causing any violations of Section 15(c)(1)(A) and     (C) and 15(f) of, and     Rule 15c1-2     under, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (iii) ordered     Goldman, Sachs & Co. to pay disgorgement and     prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,742,642, and a civil     monetary penalty of $5 million; and (iv) directed     Goldman, Sachs & Co. to conduct a review of its     policies and procedures and adopt, implement and maintain     policies and procedures consistent with the order and that     review. Goldman, Sachs & Co. also undertook to pay     $2,562,740 in disgorgement and interest relating to certain     trading in U.S. Treasury bond futures during the same     eight-minute period.         Goldman, Sachs & Co. has been named as a defendant in     a purported class action filed on March 10, 2004 in     the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of     Illinois on behalf of holders of short positions in     30-year     U.S. Treasury futures and options on the morning of     October 31, 2001. The complaint alleges that the firm     purchased     30-year     bonds and futures prior to the Treasurys refunding     announcement that morning based on non-public information about     that announcement, and that such purchases increased the costs     of covering such short positions. The complaint also names as     defendants the Washington, D.C.-based political consultant     who allegedly was the source of the information, a former     Goldman, Sachs & Co. economist who allegedly received     the information, and        38    Table of Contents       another company and one of its employees who also allegedly     received and traded on the information prior to its public     announcement. The complaint alleges violations of the federal     commodities and antitrust laws, as well as Illinois statutory     and common law, and seeks, among other things, unspecified     damages including treble damages under the antitrust laws. The     district court dismissed the antitrust and Illinois state law     claims but permitted the federal commodities law claims to     proceed. On December 20, 2006, plaintiff moved for     class certification.     Mutual     Fund Matters         Goldman, Sachs & Co. and certain mutual fund     affiliates have received subpoenas and requests for information     from various governmental agencies and self-regulatory     organizations including the SEC as part of the industry-wide     investigation relating to the practices of mutual funds and     their customers. Goldman, Sachs & Co. and its     affiliates have cooperated with such requests.     Refco Securities     Litigation         Goldman, Sachs & Co. and the other lead underwriters     for the August 2005 initial public offering of     26,500,000 shares of common stock of Refco Inc. are among     the defendants in various putative class actions filed in the     U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York     beginning in October 2005 by investors in Refco Inc. in response     to certain publicly reported events that culminated in the     October 17, 2005 filing by Refco Inc. and certain     affiliates for protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. The     actions, which have been consolidated, allege violations of the     disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws and seek     compensatory damages. In addition to the underwriters, the     consolidated complaint names as defendants Refco Inc. and     certain of its affiliates, certain officers and directors of     Refco Inc., Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (which held a majority     of Refco Inc.s equity through certain funds it manages),     Grant Thornton (Refco Inc.s outside auditor), and BAWAG     P.S.K. Bank fur Arbeit und Wirtschaft und Osterreichische     Postsparkasse Aktiengesellschaft (BAWAG). Lead plaintiffs     entered into a settlement with BAWAG, which was approved     following certain amendments on June 29, 2007.     Goldman, Sachs & Co. underwrote 5,639,200 shares     of common stock at a price of $22 per share for a total offering     price of approximately $124 million.         A purported shareholder derivative action was filed in the     U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York     on November 2, 2005 on behalf of The Goldman Sachs     Group, Inc. against certain of its officers and directors. The     complaint alleges that the individual defendants breached their     fiduciary duties by failing to ensure that adequate due     diligence was conducted in connection with the Refco Inc.     initial public offering.         Goldman, Sachs & Co. has, together with other     underwriters of the Refco Inc. initial public offering, received     requests for information from various governmental agencies and     self-regulatory organizations. Goldman, Sachs & Co. is     cooperating with those requests.     Short-Selling     Litigation         The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co.     and Goldman Sachs Execution & Clearing, L.P. are among     the numerous financial services firms that have been named as     defendants in a purported class action filed on April 12,     2006 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District     of New York by customers who engaged in short-selling     transactions in equity securities since     April 12, 2000. The amended complaint generally     alleges that the customers were charged fees in connection with     the short sales but that the applicable securities were not     necessarily borrowed to effect delivery, resulting in failed     deliveries, and that the defendants conspired to set a minimum     threshold borrowing rate for securities designated as hard to     borrow. The complaint asserts a claim under the federal     antitrust laws, as well as claims under the New York Business     Law and common law, and seeks treble damages as well as     injunctive relief. Defendants motion to dismiss the     complaint was granted by a decision dated     December 20, 2007. On January 18, 2008, plaintiffs     appealed from this decision.        39    Table of Contents   Fannie Mae     Litigation         Goldman, Sachs & Co. was added as a defendant in an     amended complaint filed on August 14, 2006 in a     purported class action, and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and     Goldman, Sachs & Co. were added as defendants in an     amended complaint filed on September 1, 2006 in a     separate shareholder derivative action, both pending in the     U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The     complaints allegations generally arise from allegations     concerning Fannie Maes accounting practices and, insofar     as they relate to the Goldman Sachs defendants, assert     violations of the federal securities laws and common law in     connection with certain Fannie Mae-sponsored REMIC transactions     that were allegedly arranged by Goldman, Sachs & Co.     The other defendants include Fannie Mae, certain of its past and     present officers and directors, accountants and other financial     services firms. On November 28, 2006, the plaintiffs     in the derivative action voluntarily dismissed the Goldman Sachs     defendants without prejudice, subject to an agreement to toll     the statute of limitations. By a decision dated     May 8, 2007, the district court granted Goldman,     Sachs & Co.s motion to dismiss.         The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. was named as a defendant in two     purported derivative actions, and Goldman, Sachs & Co.     is named as a defendant in one of such actions, commenced     beginning on June 29, 2007 in the U.S. District     Court for the District of Columbia by Fannie Mae shareholders on     behalf of Fannie Mae. The claims against the Goldman Sachs     defendants are substantively identical to the claims raised in     the previous derivative action which had been voluntarily     dismissed subject to a tolling agreement. Both complaints     generally allege that the firms conduct in connection with     the REMIC transactions constituted aiding and abetting a breach     of fiduciary duty by certain Fannie Mae officers and directors     as well as a breach of contract. The complaints also name as     defendants certain former officers and directors of Fannie Mae     as well as an outside accounting firm. The complaints seek,     inter alia, unspecified damages.     General American     Litigation         On February 13, 2007, the liquidators of General     American Mutual Holding Corporation amended a pre-existing     complaint pending in Missouri Circuit Court against one of the     companys former officers to assert new claims against The     Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. The     amended complaint asserts that the Goldman Sachs defendants     breached certain duties and violated Missouri law in the course     of acting as the companys financial advisor during     1998-1999 in     connection with the exploration of a potential demutualization     and initial public offering, and the ensuing sale of certain     company assets. The complaint seeks compensatory and punitive     damages. On July 18, 2007, the court denied motions by     The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co.     to dismiss the complaint, and to drop them as parties from the     pre-existing action.     Executive     Compensation Litigation         On March 16, 2007, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., its     board of directors, executive officers and members of its     management committee were named as defendants in a purported     shareholder derivative action in the U.S. District Court     for the Eastern District of New York challenging the sufficiency     of the firms February 21, 2007 Proxy Statement     and the compensation of certain employees. The complaint     generally alleges that the Proxy Statement undervalues stock     option awards disclosed therein, that the recipients received     excessive awards because the proper methodology was not     followed, and that the firms senior management received     excessive compensation, constituting corporate waste. The     complaint seeks, among other things, an injunction against the     2007 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the voiding of any election     of directors in the absence of an injunction and an equitable     accounting for the allegedly excessive compensation. On     July 20, 2007, defendants moved to dismiss the     complaint.         On January 17, 2008, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., its     board of directors, executive officers and members of its     management committee were named as defendants in a related     purported        40    Table of Contents       shareholder derivative action brought by the same plaintiff in     the same court predicting that the firms 2008 Proxy     Statement will violate the federal securities laws by     undervaluing certain stock option awards and alleging that     senior management received excessive compensation for 2007. The     complaint seeks, among other things, an injunction against the     distribution of the 2008 Proxy Statement, the voiding of any     election of directors in the absence of an injunction and an     equitable accounting for the allegedly excessive compensation.     On January 25, 2008, the plaintiff moved for a preliminary     injunction to prevent the 2008 Proxy Statement from using     options valuations that the plaintiff alleges are incorrect and     to require the amendment of SEC Form 4s filed by certain of     the executive officers named in the complaint to reflect the     stock option valuations alleged by the plaintiff. Defendants     have yet to respond.     Mortgage-Related     Matters         Goldman, Sachs & Co. and certain of its affiliates,     together with other financial services firms, have received     requests for information from various governmental agencies and     self-regulatory organizations relating to subprime mortgages,     and securitizations, collateralized debt obligations and     synthetic products related to subprime mortgages. Goldman,     Sachs & Co. and its affiliates are cooperating with     the requests.         On January 10, 2008, the City of Cleveland filed an     action in the Ohio Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County,     against numerous financial institutions, including The Goldman     Sachs Group, Inc., alleging that the defendants activities     in connection with securitizations of subprime mortgages created     a public nuisance in Cleveland. The complaint seeks,     among other things, unspecified compensatory damages. The     defendants have yet to respond. The action was removed to the     U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio,     Eastern Division, and on January 17, 2008, the City of     Cleveland moved to remand the action to state court.     Private     Equity-Sponsored Acquisitions Litigation         The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and GS Capital     Partners are among numerous private equity firms and     investment banks named as defendants in a federal antitrust     action filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of     Massachusetts in December 2007. The complaint generally alleges     that the defendants have colluded to limit competition in     bidding for private equity-sponsored acquisitions of public     companies, thereby resulting in lower prevailing bids and, by     extension, less consideration for shareholders of those     companies in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and     common law.         Defendants have yet to respond.      Item 4.

(2)   No shares were purchased other than     through our publicly announced repurchase program during the     fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended November 30, 2007.           (3)   On March 21, 2000, we     announced that our board of directors had approved a repurchase     program, pursuant to which up to 15 million shares of our     common stock may be repurchased. This repurchase program was     increased by an aggregate of 280 million shares by     resolutions of our board of directors adopted on June 18,     2001, March 18, 2002, November 20, 2002,     January 30, 2004, January 25, 2005, September 16,     2005, September 11, 2006 and December 17, 2007.     We use our share repurchase program to help maintain the     appropriate level of common equity and to substantially offset     increases in share count over time resulting from employee     share-based              44    Table of Contents             compensation. The repurchase     program is effected primarily through regular open-market     purchases, the amounts and timing of which are determined     primarily by our current and projected capital positions (i.e.,     comparisons of our desired level of capital to our actual level     of capital) but which may also be influenced by general market     conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our     common stock. Taking into account the increased authorization in     December 2007, the total remaining authorization under the     repurchase program was 65,412,649 shares as of     January 18, 2008; the repurchase program has no set     expiration or termination date.

Our activities are divided into three segments:                     Investment Banking. We provide a broad range of     investment banking services to a diverse group of corporations,     financial institutions, investment funds, governments and     individuals.                Trading and Principal Investments. We facilitate     client transactions with a diverse group of corporations,     financial institutions, investment funds, governments and     individuals and take proprietary positions through market making     in, trading of and investing in fixed income and equity     products, currencies, commodities and derivatives on these     products. In addition, we engage in market-making and specialist     activities on equities and options exchanges and clear client     transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges     worldwide. In connection with our merchant banking and other     investing activities, we make principal investments directly and     through funds that we raise and manage.                Asset Management and Securities Services. We provide     investment advisory and financial planning services and offer     investment products (primarily through separately managed     accounts and commingled vehicles, such as mutual funds and     private investment funds) across all major asset classes to a     diverse group of institutions and individuals worldwide and     provide prime brokerage services, financing services and     securities lending services to institutional clients, including     hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds and foundations, and to     high-net-worth     individuals worldwide.           Unless specifically stated otherwise, all references to 2007,     2006 and 2005 refer to our fiscal years ended, or the dates, as     the context requires, November 30, 2007, November 24,     2006 and November 25, 2005, respectively.         When we use the terms Goldman Sachs, we,     us and our, we mean The Goldman Sachs     Group, Inc. (Group Inc.), a Delaware corporation, and its     consolidated subsidiaries. References herein to the Annual     Report on     Form 10-K     are to our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007.         In this discussion, we have included statements that may     constitute forward-looking statements within the     meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities     Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are     not historical facts but instead represent only our beliefs     regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are     inherently uncertain and outside our control. These statements     include statements other than historical information or     statements of current condition and may relate to our future     plans and objectives and results, among other things, and may     also include statements about the objectives and effectiveness     of our risk management and liquidity policies, statements about     trends in or growth opportunities for our businesses and     statements about our investment banking transaction backlog. By     identifying these statements for you in this manner, we are     alerting you to the possibility that our actual results and     financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the     anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these     forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause     our actual results and financial condition to differ from those     indicated in these forward-looking statements include, among     others, those discussed below under  Certain     Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business as well as     Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the     Annual Report on     Form 10-K     and Cautionary Statement Pursuant to the Private     Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 in Part I,     Item 1 of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K.        47    Table of Contents      Executive     Overview          Our diluted earnings per common share were $24.73 for 2007     compared with $19.69 for 2006. During 2007, we achieved record     results in the Americas, Europe and Asia, and derived over     one-half of our pre-tax earnings outside of the Americas. Return     on average tangible common shareholders     equity (1)     was 38.2% and return on average common shareholders equity     was 32.7% for 2007. Book value per common share increased 25% to     $90.43 at year end. During 2007, we repurchased     41.2 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of     $8.96 billion.         In 2007, we generated record diluted earnings per common share,     which exceeded the prior year record results by 26%. Each of our     three segments produced record net revenues. The increase in     Trading and Principal Investments reflected higher net revenues     in Equities, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and     Principal Investments. Net revenues in Equities increased 33%     compared with 2006, reflecting significantly higher net revenues     in both our customer franchise businesses and principal     strategies. During 2007, Equities operated in an environment     characterized by strong customer-driven activity, generally     higher equity prices and higher levels of volatility,     particularly during the second half of the year. The increase in     FICC reflected significantly higher net revenues in currencies     and interest rate products. In addition, net revenues in     mortgages were higher despite a significant deterioration in the     mortgage market throughout the year, while net revenues in     credit products were strong, but slightly lower compared with     2006. Credit products included substantial gains from equity     investments, including a gain of approximately $900 million     related to the disposition of Horizon Wind Energy L.L.C., as     well as a loss of approximately $1 billion, net of hedges,     related to non-investment-grade credit origination activities.     During 2007, FICC operated in an environment generally     characterized by strong customer-driven activity and favorable     market opportunities. However, during the year, the mortgage     market experienced significant deterioration and, in the second     half of the year, the broader credit markets were characterized     by wider spreads and reduced levels of liquidity. We continued     to capitalize on trading and investing opportunities for our     clients and ourselves and, accordingly, our market risk     increased, particularly in interest rate and equity products. In     addition, our total assets surpassed $1 trillion during the     year, as we grew our balance sheet in order to support these     opportunities, as well as to support increased activity in     Securities Services. The increase in Principal Investments     reflected strong results in both corporate and real estate     investing.         The increase in Investment Banking reflected a 64% increase in     Financial Advisory net revenues and a strong performance in our     Underwriting business. The increase in Financial Advisory     primarily reflected growth in industry-wide completed mergers     and acquisitions. The increase in Underwriting reflected higher     net revenues in debt underwriting, as leveraged finance activity     was strong during the first half of our fiscal year, while net     revenues in equity underwriting were strong but essentially     unchanged from 2006. Our investment banking transaction backlog     at the end of 2007 was higher than it was at the end of     2006. (2)         Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services also     increased. The increase in Securities Services primarily     reflected significant growth in global customer balances. The     increase in Asset Management reflected significantly higher     asset management fees, partially offset by significantly lower     incentive fees. During the year, assets under management     increased $192 billion, or 28%, to a record     $868 billion, including net inflows of $161 billion.              (1)       Return on average tangible common shareholders equity     (ROTE) is computed by dividing net earnings applicable to common     shareholders by average monthly tangible common     shareholders equity. See  Results of     Operations  Financial Overview below for     further information regarding our calculation of ROTE.       (2)       Our investment banking transaction backlog represents an     estimate of our future net revenues from investment banking     transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is     more likely than not.          48    Table of Contents       In 2008, we will remain focused on our clients, geographic     expansion and the importance of effective risk management. We     continue to see opportunities for growth in the businesses and     geographic areas in which we operate and, in particular, we     believe continued expansion of the economies of Brazil, Russia,     India and China, as well as those of the Middle East, will offer     opportunities for us to increase our presence in those markets.         Though we generated particularly strong results in 2007, our     business, by its nature, does not produce predictable earnings.     Our results in any given period can be materially affected by     conditions in global financial markets and economic conditions     generally. For a further discussion of the factors that may     affect our future operating results, see      Certain Risk Factors That May Affect Our     Business below as well as Risk Factors in     Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K.        49    Table of Contents      Business     Environment          As an investment banking, securities and investment management     firm, our businesses are materially affected by conditions in     the financial markets and economic conditions generally, both in     the United States and elsewhere around the world. A favorable     business environment is generally characterized by, among other     factors, high global gross domestic product growth, stable     geopolitical conditions, transparent, liquid and efficient     capital markets, low inflation, high business and investor     confidence and strong business earnings. These factors provide a     positive climate for our investment banking activities, for many     of our trading and investing businesses and for wealth creation,     which contributes to growth in our asset management business.     During the first half of 2007, global economic growth was     generally solid, inflation remained contained, global equity     markets rose and corporate activity levels were strong. However,     during the second half of 2007, significant weakness and     volatility in global credit markets, particularly in the U.S.     and Europe, spread to broader financial markets and began to     affect global economic growth. For a further discussion of how     market conditions can affect our businesses, see      Certain Risk Factors That May Affect Our     Business below as well as Risk Factors in     Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     A further discussion of the business environment in 2007 is set     forth below.     Global. Growth in the global economy slowed over the     course of 2007. Although the pace of economic growth was solid     through the beginning of our third fiscal quarter, global growth     in the latter part of our fiscal year was impacted by volatility     in the credit markets, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, and     accelerated weakness in the U.S. housing market. Fixed income     and equity markets experienced high volatility, particularly     during the second half of the year. The U.S. mortgage market     experienced significant deterioration throughout the year,     particularly in subprime loans and securities. The broader     global credit markets were characterized by significant weakness     in the second half of the year, which was evident in the     significant dislocation in money market rates in the U.S. and     Europe. The U.S. Federal Reserve lowered its federal funds     target rate towards the end of our fiscal year, while central     banks in the Eurozone, United Kingdom, Japan and China all     raised rates during the year. Oil prices rose significantly     during our fiscal year and, in the currency markets, the U.S.     dollar weakened against most major currencies, particularly     against the Euro and the British pound. Corporate activity was     generally strong during our fiscal year, reflecting significant     growth in mergers and acquisitions and equity underwritings, as     well as strength in leveraged finance during the first half of     our fiscal year.     United States. Real gross domestic product growth in     the U.S. economy slowed to an estimated 2.2% in calendar year     2007, down from 2.9% in 2006. While economic growth was     generally solid during the first nine months of our fiscal year,     activity appeared to decelerate sharply during the fourth     quarter. Much of the slowdown was attributable to the housing     market, as sales of new and existing homes and residential real     estate investment declined, as well as to the weakness in credit     markets. Growth in industrial production slowed from 2006     levels, reflecting reduced growth in domestic demand, partially     offset by stronger growth in net exports. Although business     confidence remained fairly strong, consumer confidence declined     over the course of the year. Growth in consumer expenditure was     strong in the first quarter but declined thereafter, as concerns     about the housing market intensified and oil prices rose. The     unemployment rate rose during the second half of our fiscal year     and ended the year higher. The rate of inflation increased     sharply over our fiscal year, as energy prices rose     significantly. Measures of core inflation, while slowing from     2006 levels, accelerated towards the end of the year. The U.S.     Federal Reserve reduced its federal funds target rate by a total     of 75 basis points to 4.50% during our fourth quarter, the     first reductions since 2003. Beginning in August, the U.S.     Federal Reserve also took other measures to improve liquidity in     credit markets. Although the     10-year U.S.     Treasury note yield rose during the first half of our fiscal     year, it subsequently declined as credit concerns took hold, and     ended the year 58 basis points lower at 3.97%. The Dow Jones     Industrial Average, the S&P 500 Index and the NASDAQ     Composite Index ended our fiscal year higher by 9%, 6% and 8%,     respectively.        50    Table of Contents   Europe. Real gross domestic product growth in the     Eurozone economies slowed to an estimated 2.7% in calendar year     2007, down from 2.9% in 2006. Industrial production and fixed     investment slowed as the year progressed, while growth in     consumer expenditure was weak throughout the year. Surveys of     business and consumer confidence declined. However, the labor     market strengthened, as evidenced by a decline in the     unemployment rate. Measures of core inflation increased during     the year. The European Central Bank (ECB) continued to raise     interest rates, increasing its main refinancing operations rate     by a total of 75 basis points to 4.00% by the end of June. The     ECB left the rate unchanged for the rest of our fiscal year, but     engaged in measures to improve liquidity conditions in the last     four months of the year. In the United Kingdom, real gross     domestic product rose by an estimated 3.1% for calendar year     2007, up from 2.9% in 2006, but showed signs of slowing late in     the year due to credit market concerns and a slowdown in the     U.K. housing market. Measures of inflation remained elevated     during the year. The Bank of England increased interest rates,     raising its official bank rate by a total of 75 basis points to     5.75%. Long-term bond yields in both the Eurozone and the U.K.     ended the year higher. The Euro and British pound appreciated by     11% and 7%, respectively, against the U.S. dollar during our     fiscal year. Major European equity markets ended our fiscal year     higher.     Asia. In Japan, real gross domestic product growth     slowed to an estimated 1.9% in calendar year 2007 from 2.4% in     2006. Measures of investment activity in the housing sector and     growth in consumption declined during the year. Export growth     remained solid but showed signs of deterioration towards year     end as the environment outside of Japan worsened. The rate of     inflation remained near zero percent during the year. The Bank     of Japan raised its target overnight call rate by 25 basis     points for the second consecutive year, bringing it to 0.50%,     while the yield on     10-year     Japanese government bonds declined slightly during our fiscal     year. The yen appreciated by 4% against the U.S. dollar. The     Nikkei 225 Index rose during the first eight months of our     fiscal year but declined significantly in August, and ended our     fiscal year essentially unchanged.         In China, real gross domestic product growth accelerated to an     estimated 11.4% in calendar year 2007 from 11.1% in 2006, with     continued strength in exports, as demonstrated by Chinas     large and growing current account surplus and foreign exchange     reserves. Industrial production accelerated during the year,     while domestic demand softened but remained solid. The rate of     inflation increased, particularly during the second half of the     year. The Peoples Bank of China raised its one-year     benchmark lending rate by a total of 117 basis points to 7.29%     and took additional measures to reduce liquidity in the     financial system. The government continued to allow the steady     appreciation of its currency, which ended our fiscal year nearly     6% higher against the U.S. dollar. Elsewhere in Asia, real gross     domestic product growth in India slowed to an estimated 8.7% in     calendar year 2007 from 9.4% in 2006, as its currency     strengthened and the central bank tightened monetary policy. The     rate of wholesale inflation fell, but the rate of consumer price     inflation remained elevated. Other currencies in the region also     generally appreciated against the U.S. dollar. Equity markets     rose sharply across the region, with the Shanghai Composite     Index up 138%, and markets in Hong Kong, India and South Korea     ending the year significantly higher.     Other Markets. Real gross domestic product in Brazil     rose by an estimated 5.4% in calendar year 2007, supported by     strong capital inflows, strong demand and rising prices in     commodities, and expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. The     central bank reduced interest rates even as the rate of     inflation rose. In Russia, real gross domestic product rose by     an estimated 7.3% in calendar year 2007, supported by strong     household consumption and increased capital investment,     particularly in the first half of the year. The rate of     inflation rose sharply in the latter part of the year. Brazilian     and Russian equity prices ended our fiscal year significantly     higher.        51    Table of Contents      Certain Risk     Factors That May Affect Our Business          We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in     our businesses, including market, liquidity, credit,     operational, legal and regulatory risks. For a discussion of how     management seeks to manage some of these risks, see      Risk Management below. A summary of the     more important factors that could affect our business follows     below. For a further discussion of these and other important     factors that could affect our business, see Risk     Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report     on     Form 10-K.     Market Conditions and Market Risk. Our     businesses are materially affected by conditions in the global     financial markets and economic conditions generally, and these     conditions may change suddenly and dramatically. A favorable     business environment is generally characterized by, among other     factors, high global gross domestic product growth, stable     geopolitical conditions, transparent, liquid and efficient     capital markets, low inflation, high business and investor     confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or     uncertain economic and market conditions, which can be caused     by: outbreaks of hostilities or other geopolitical instability;     declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or     business confidence; limitations on the availability or     increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in     inflation, interest rates, exchange rate volatility, default     rates or the price of basic commodities; corporate, political or     other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital     markets; natural disasters or pandemics; or a combination of     these or other factors, have adversely affected, and may     in the future adversely affect, our business and profitability     in many ways, including the following:                         Increasing or high interest rates and/or widening credit     spreads, especially if such changes are rapid, may create a less     favorable environment for certain of our businesses, and may     affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or     hold. For example, beginning in the second half of 2007,     difficulties in the mortgage and broader credit markets resulted     in a relatively sudden and substantial decrease in the     availability of credit and credit spreads widened significantly,     affecting volatility and liquidity in the debt and equity     markets.                    We have been committing increasing amounts of capital in many of     our businesses and generally maintain large trading, specialist     and investing positions. Market fluctuations and volatility may     adversely affect the value of those positions or may reduce our     willingness to enter into new transactions. Conversely, certain     of our trading businesses depend on market volatility to provide     trading and arbitrage opportunities, and decreases in volatility     may reduce these opportunities and adversely affect the results     of these businesses.                    Increases in interest rates or credit spreads, as well as     limitations on the availability of credit, can affect our     ability to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis, which may     adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. We     seek to finance our less liquid assets on a secured basis and     disruptions in the credit markets are likely to make it harder     and more expensive to fund these assets. In difficult credit     markets, we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher     cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to     support our business activities. This could cause us to curtail     our business activities and could increase our cost of funding,     both of which could reduce our profitability.                    Industry-wide declines in the size and number of underwritings     and mergers and acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our     revenues and, because we may be unable to reduce expenses     correspondingly, our profit margins. Our clients engaging in     mergers and acquisitions often rely on access to the secured and     unsecured credit markets to finance their transactions. The lack     of available credit or increased cost of credit may adversely     affect the size, volume and timing of our clients merger     and acquisition transactions  particularly large     transactions  and adversely affect our financial     advisory and underwriting businesses.                    Reductions in the level of the equity markets or increases in     interest rates tend to reduce the value of our clients     portfolios, which in turn may reduce the fees we earn for     managing assets.          52    Table of Contents                  Increases in interest rates or attractive conditions in other     investments could cause our clients to transfer their assets out     of our funds or other products. Even in the absence of uncertain     or unfavorable economic or market conditions, investment     performance by our asset management business below the     performance of benchmarks or competitors could result in a     decline in assets under management and in the incentive and     management fees we receive and might make it more difficult to     attract new investors.                           Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant     losses in our market-making, proprietary trading and investing,     block trading, merchant banking, underwriting and lending     businesses. This risk may increase to the extent we expand our     proprietary trading and investing businesses or commit capital     to facilitate customer-driven business.                    An increase in market volatility increases our measured risk,     which might cause us to reduce our proprietary positions or to     reduce certain of our business activities. In such     circumstances, we may not be able to reduce our positions or our     exposure in a timely, cost-effective way or in a manner     sufficient to offset the increase in measured risk.                    The volume of transactions that we execute for our clients and     as a specialist or market maker may decline, which would reduce     the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads. In our     specialist businesses, we are obligated by stock exchange rules     to maintain an orderly market, including by purchasing shares in     a declining market. This may result in trading losses and an     increased need for liquidity. Weakness in global equity markets     and the trading of securities in multiple markets and on     multiple exchanges could adversely impact our trading businesses     and impair the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible     assets.       Liquidity Risk. Liquidity is essential to our     businesses. Our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to     access secured and/or unsecured debt markets, an inability to     access funds from our subsidiaries, an inability to sell assets     or redeem our investments, or unforeseen outflows of cash or     collateral. This situation may arise due to circumstances that     we may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption     or an operational problem that affects third parties or us, or     even by the perception among market participants that we are     experiencing greater liquidity risk. The financial instruments     that we hold and the contracts to which we are a party are     increasingly complex, as we employ structured products to     benefit our clients and ourselves, and these complex structured     products often do not have readily available markets to access     in times of liquidity stress. Growth of our proprietary     investing activities may lead to situations where the holdings     from these activities represent a significant portion of     specific markets, which could restrict liquidity for our     positions. Further, our ability to sell assets may be impaired     if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets     at the same time, as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other     market crisis. In addition, financial institutions with which we     interact may exercise set-off rights or the right to require     additional collateral, including in difficult market conditions,     which could further impair our access to liquidity.         Our credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction     in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and     competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, limit our     access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under     certain bilateral provisions in some of our trading and     collateralized financing contracts. Under these provisions,     counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with     Goldman Sachs or require us to post additional collateral.     Termination of our trading and collateralized financing     contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our     liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or     to make significant cash payments or securities movements. For a     discussion of the potential impact on Goldman Sachs of a     reduction in our credit ratings, see  Liquidity     and Funding Risk  Credit Ratings below.     Credit Risk. The amount and duration of our     credit exposures have been increasing over the past several     years, as has the breadth and size of the entities to which we     have credit exposures. We are exposed to the risk that third     parties that owe us money, securities or other assets will not     perform their obligations. These parties may default on their     obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity,     operational failure or other reasons. We are also subject to the     risk that our rights against        53    Table of Contents       third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. In     addition, deterioration in the credit quality of third parties     whose securities or obligations we hold could result in losses     and/or adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or     otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity     purposes. A significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our     counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results.     While in many cases we are permitted to require additional     collateral for counterparties that experience financial     difficulty, disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we     are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets.         In addition, as part of our clearing business, we finance our     client positions, and we could be held responsible for the     defaults or misconduct of our clients. Although we regularly     review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties     and to specific industries, countries and regions that we     believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from     events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee,     particularly as new business initiatives lead us to transact     with a broader array of clients and expose us to new asset     classes and new markets. In addition, concerns about, or a     default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity     problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, which in     turn could adversely affect us.         We have experienced, due to competitive factors, pressure to     extend and price credit at levels that may not always fully     compensate us for the risks we take. In particular, corporate     clients sometimes seek to require credit commitments from us in     connection with investment banking and other assignments.     Operational Risk. Shortcomings or failures in our     internal processes, people or systems, or external events could     lead to impairment of our liquidity, financial loss, disruption     of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention     or reputational damage. Our businesses are highly dependent on     our ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a large     number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across     numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. These     transactions, as well as information technology services we     provide to clients, often must adhere to client-specific     guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory standards. Despite     the contingency plans and facilities we have in place, our     ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a     disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses     and the communities in which we are located. This may include a     disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation     or other services used by us or third parties with which we     conduct business.     Legal and Regulatory Risk. We are subject to     extensive and evolving regulation in jurisdictions around the     world. Several of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory     capital requirements and, as a Consolidated Supervised Entity     (CSE), we are subject to minimum capital standards on a     consolidated basis. Substantial legal liability or a significant     regulatory action against us could have material adverse     financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us,     which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. Firms     in the financial services industry have been operating in a     difficult regulatory environment. We face significant legal     risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of     damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory     proceedings against financial institutions remain high. For a     discussion of how we account for our legal and regulatory     exposures, see  Use of Estimates below.        54    Table of Contents      Critical     Accounting Policies      Fair     Value         The use of fair value to measure financial instruments, with     related unrealized gains or losses generally recognized in     Trading and principal investments in our     consolidated statements of earnings, is fundamental to our     financial statements and our risk management processes and is     our most critical accounting policy. The fair value of a     financial instrument is the amount that would be received to     sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly     transaction between market participants at the measurement date     (the exit price). Instruments that we own (long positions) are     marked to bid prices, and instruments that we have sold, but not     yet purchased (short positions) are marked to offer prices.         We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)     No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, as of the     beginning of 2007. See Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated     financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual     Report on     Form 10-K     for further information on SFAS No. 157.         In determining fair value, we separate our Financial     instruments, owned at fair value and Financial     instruments sold, but not yet purchased, at fair value     into two categories: cash instruments and derivative contracts,     as set forth in the following table:     Financial     Instruments by Category (in     millions)                                                                            As of November                 2007           2006                             Financial                        Financial                  Financial            Instruments            Financial            Instruments                  Instruments            Sold, but not Yet            Instruments            Sold, but not Yet                  Owned, at            Purchased, at            Owned, at            Purchased, at                   Fair Value             Fair Value             Fair Value             Fair Value                    Cash trading instruments            $       324,181               $       112,018               $       253,056               $       87,244              ICBC                6,807        (2)                                  5,194        (2)                             SMFG (1)                4,060                   3,627        (5)               4,505                   3,065        (5)          Other principal investments                11,933        (3)                                  4,263        (3)                                                                                                   Principal investments                22,800                   3,627                   13,962                   3,065                                                                                    Cash instruments                346,981                   115,645                   267,018                   90,309              Exchange-traded                13,541                   12,280                   14,407                   13,851              Over-the-counter                92,073                   87,098                   53,136                   51,645                                                                                    Derivative contracts                105,614        (4)               99,378        (6)               67,543        (4)               65,496        (6)                                                                                Total            $       452,595               $       215,023               $       334,561               $       155,805                                                                                              (1)   The fair value of our Japanese     yen-denominated investment in the convertible preferred stock of     Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc.

(6)   Net of cash paid pursuant to credit     support agreements of $27.76 billion and     $16.00 billion as of November 2007 and November 2006,     respectively.           Cash Instruments. Cash instruments include cash     trading instruments, public principal investments and private     principal investments.                     Cash Trading Instruments. Our cash trading     instruments are generally valued using quoted market prices in     active markets, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative     pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.     The types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in     active markets include most U.S. government and agency     securities, many other sovereign government obligations, active     listed equities and most money market securities.           The types of instruments valued based on quoted prices in     markets that are not active, broker or dealer quotations, or     alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price     transparency include most investment-grade and high-yield     corporate bonds, most mortgage products, certain corporate bank     and bridge loans, less liquid listed equities, state, municipal     and provincial obligations, most physical commodities and     certain loan commitments.         Certain cash trading instruments trade infrequently and     therefore have little or no price transparency. Such instruments     include private equity and real estate fund investments, certain     corporate bank and bridge loans, less liquid mortgage whole     loans, distressed debt instruments and certain loan commitments.     The transaction price is initially used as the best estimate of     fair value. Accordingly, when a pricing model is used to value     such an instrument, the model is adjusted so that the model     value at inception equals the transaction price. This valuation     is adjusted only when changes to inputs and assumptions are     corroborated by evidence such as transactions in similar     instruments, completed or pending third-party transactions in     the underlying investment or comparable entities, subsequent     rounds of financing, recapitalizations and other transactions     across the capital structure, offerings in the equity or debt     capital markets, and changes in financial ratios or cash flows.         For positions that are not traded in active markets or are     subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to     reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, and such     adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In     the absence of such evidence, managements best estimate is     used.                     Public Principal Investments. Our public principal     investments held within the Principal Investments component of     our Trading and Principal Investments segment tend to be large,     concentrated holdings resulting from initial public offerings or     other corporate transactions, and are valued based on quoted     market prices. For positions that are not traded in active     markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are     adjusted to reflect illiquidity     and/or     non-transferability, and such adjustments are generally based on     available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence,     managements best estimate is used.          56    Table of Contents       Our most significant public principal investment is our     investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC. Our investment in     ICBC is valued using the quoted market prices adjusted for     transfer restrictions. The ordinary shares acquired from ICBC     are subject to transfer restrictions that, among other things,     prohibit any sale, disposition or other transfer until     April 28, 2009. From April 28, 2009 to     October 20, 2009, we may transfer up to 50% of the     aggregate ordinary shares of ICBC that we owned as of     October 20, 2006. We may transfer the remaining shares     after October 20, 2009. A portion of our interest is held     by investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs.         We also have an investment in the convertible preferred stock of     SMFG. This investment is valued using a model that is     principally based on SMFGs common stock price. As of     November 2007, the conversion price of our SMFG convertible     preferred stock into shares of SMFG common stock was     ¥318,800. This price is subject to downward adjustment if     the price of SMFG common stock at the time of conversion is less     than the conversion price (subject to a floor of ¥105,100).     As a result of downside protection on the conversion stock     price, the relationship between changes in the fair value of our     investment and changes in SMFGs common stock price would     be nonlinear for a significant decline in the SMFG common stock     price. As of November 2007, we had hedged approximately 90% of     the common stock underlying our investment in SMFG and there     were no restrictions on our ability to hedge the remainder.                     Private Principal Investments. Our private principal     investments held within the Principal Investments component of     our Trading and Principal Investments segment include     investments in private equity, debt and real estate, primarily     held through investment funds. By their nature, these     investments have little or no price transparency. We value such     instruments initially at transaction price and adjust valuations     when evidence is available to support such adjustments. Such     evidence includes transactions in similar instruments, completed     or pending third-party transactions in the underlying investment     or comparable entities, subsequent rounds of financing,     recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital     structure, offerings in the equity or debt capital markets, and     changes in financial ratios or cash flows.       Derivative Contracts. Derivative contracts can be     exchange-traded or over-the-counter (OTC). We generally value     exchange-traded derivatives within portfolios using models which     calibrate to market clearing levels and eliminate timing     differences between the closing price of the     exchange-traded     derivatives and their underlying cash instruments.         OTC derivatives are valued using market transactions and other     market evidence whenever possible, including market-based inputs     to models, model calibration to market clearing transactions,     broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with     reasonable levels of price transparency. Where models are used,     the selection of a particular model to value an OTC derivative     depends upon the contractual terms of, and specific risks     inherent in, the instrument as well as the availability of     pricing information in the market. We generally use similar     models to value similar instruments. Valuation models require a     variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices,     yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment     rates and correlations of such inputs. For OTC derivatives that     trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and     options, model inputs can generally be verified and model     selection does not involve significant management judgment.         Certain OTC derivatives trade in less liquid markets with     limited pricing information, and the determination of fair value     for these derivatives is inherently more difficult. Where we do     not have corroborating market evidence to support significant     model inputs and cannot verify the model to market transactions,     transaction price is initially used as the best estimate of fair     value. Accordingly, when a pricing model is used to value such     an instrument, the model is adjusted so that the model value at     inception equals the transaction price. Subsequent to initial     recognition, we only update valuation inputs when corroborated     by evidence such as similar market transactions, third-party        57    Table of Contents       pricing services and/or broker or dealer quotations, or other     empirical market data. In circumstances where we cannot verify     the model value to market transactions, it is possible that a     different valuation model could produce a materially different     estimate of fair value. See  Credit     Risk  Derivatives below for further information     on our OTC derivatives.         When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors     such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads and credit considerations.     Such adjustments are generally based on available market     evidence. In the absence of such evidence, managements     best estimate is used.     Fair Value Hierarchy  Level 3     Assets. SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value     hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques     used to measure fair value. The objective of a fair value     measurement is to determine the price that would be received to     sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly     transaction between market participants at the measurement date     (an exit price). The hierarchy gives the highest priority to     unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets     or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest     priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).     Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on     the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value     measurement. See Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated     financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual     Report on     Form 10-K     for further information regarding SFAS No. 157.        58    Table of Contents       The following table sets forth the fair values of assets     classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy,     along with a brief description of the valuation technique for     each type of asset:     Level 3     Assets at Fair Value (in     millions)                                                    As of                    Valuation       Description        November 2007                   Technique               Private equity and real estate fund     investments (1)                $18,006                       Initially valued at transaction price. Subsequently valued based     on third-party investments, pending transactions or changes in     financial ratios (e.g., earnings multiples) and discounted cash     flows.                                                Bank     loans (2)                13,334                      Initially valued at transaction price. Subsequently valued using     market data for similar instruments (e.g., recent transactions     or broker quotes), comparisons to benchmark derivative indices     or movements in underlying credit spreads.

Subsequently valued using     transactions for similar instruments and discounted cash flow     techniques (calibrated to trading activity, where applicable).                                                                                      Loans and securities backed by residential real     estate (5)                2,484                       Initially valued at transaction price. Subsequently valued by     comparison to transactions in instruments with similar     collateral and risk profiles, discounted cash flow techniques,     option adjusted spread analyses, and hypothetical securitization     analyses.                                                Loan     portfolios (6)                6,106                       Initially valued at transaction price.

Subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the     valuation model (e.g., interest rates, credit spreads,     volatilities, etc.). Model inputs are changed only when     corroborated by market data.

We securitize,     underwrite and make markets in subprime mortgages. As of     November 2007, the fair value of our long position in subprime     mortgage cash instruments was $2.11 billion (of which     $507 million was classified as level 3 within the fair     value hierarchy), including $316 million of collateralized     debt obligations (CDOs) backed by subprime mortgages. At any     point in time, we may use cash instruments as well as     derivatives to manage our long or short risk position in the     subprime mortgage market.     Other Financial Assets and Financial     Liabilities.  In addition to Financial     instruments owned, at fair value and Financial     instruments sold, but not yet purchased, at fair value, we     have elected to account for certain of our other financial     assets and financial liabilities at fair value under     SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid     Financial Instruments  an amendment of FASB     Statements No. 133 and 140, or     SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for     Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. Such financial     assets and financial liabilities include (i) certain     unsecured     short-term     borrowings, consisting of all promissory notes and commercial     paper and certain hybrid financial instruments;     (ii) certain other secured financings, primarily transfers     accounted for as financings rather than sales under     SFAS No. 140 and debt raised through our William     Street program; (iii) certain unsecured long-term     borrowings, including prepaid physical commodity transactions;     (iv) resale and repurchase agreements; (v) securities     borrowed and loaned within Trading and Principal Investments,     consisting of our matched book and certain firm financing     activities; (vi) corporate loans, loan commitments and     certificates of deposit issued by Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS     Bank USA) as well as securities held by GS Bank USA (previously     accounted for as available-for-sale); (vii) receivables     from customers and counterparties arising from transfers     accounted for as secured loans rather than purchases under     SFAS No. 140; and (viii) in general, investments     acquired after the adoption of SFAS No. 159 where we     have significant influence over the investee and would otherwise     apply the equity method of accounting. See      Recent Accounting Developments below for     a discussion of the impact of adopting SFAS No. 159.     Controls Over Valuation of Financial     Instruments.  A control infrastructure,     independent of the trading and investing functions, is     fundamental to ensuring that our financial instruments are     appropriately valued and that fair value measurements are     reliable. This is particularly important where prices or     valuations that require inputs are less observable.         We employ an oversight structure that includes appropriate     segregation of duties. Senior management, independent of the     trading and investing functions, is responsible for the     oversight of control and valuation policies and for reporting     the results of these policies to our Audit Committee. We seek to     maintain the necessary resources to ensure that control     functions are performed to the highest standards. We employ     procedures for the approval of new transaction types and     markets, price verification, review of daily profit and loss,     and review of valuation models by personnel with appropriate     technical knowledge of relevant products and markets. These     procedures are performed by personnel independent of the trading     and investing functions. For trading and principal investments     where prices or valuations that require inputs are less     observable, we employ, where possible, procedures that include     comparisons with similar observable positions, analysis of     actual to projected cash flows, comparisons with subsequent     sales and discussions with senior business leaders. See      Market Risk below for a further     discussion of how we manage the risks inherent in our trading     and principal investing businesses.        60    Table of Contents      Goodwill and     Identifiable Intangible Assets          As a result of our acquisitions, principally SLK LLC (SLK) in     2000, The Ayco Company, L.P. (Ayco) in 2003 and our variable     annuity and life insurance business in 2006, we have acquired     goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill is the     cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net     assets, including identifiable intangible assets, at the     acquisition date.     Goodwill. We test the goodwill in each of our     operating segments, which are components one level below our     three business segments, for impairment at least annually in     accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other     Intangible Assets, by comparing the estimated fair value     of each operating segment with its estimated net book value. We     derive the fair value of each of our operating segments     primarily based on price-earnings and price-book multiples. We     derive the net book value of our operating segments by     estimating the amount of shareholders equity required to     support the activities of each operating segment. Our last     annual impairment test was performed during our 2007 fourth     quarter and no impairment was identified.

Identifiable Intangible Assets. We amortize our     identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives     in accordance with SFAS No. 142, and test for     potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances     suggest that an assets or asset groups carrying     value may not be fully recoverable in accordance with     SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or     Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. An impairment loss,     calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value     and the carrying value of an asset or asset group, is recognized     if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to     the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying     value.        61    Table of Contents       The following table sets forth the carrying value and range of     remaining useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets by     major asset class:     Identifiable     Intangible Assets by Asset Class ($ in     millions)                                                                As of November                 2007       2006                             Range of Estimated                                      Remaining Useful                          Carrying            Lives        Carrying                   Value            (in years)        Value                    Customer     lists (1)            $       732                  3  18              $       737              New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) specialist rights                502                  14                  542              Insurance-related     assets (2)                372                  7                  362              Exchange-traded fund (ETF) specialist rights                100                  20                  105              Power     contracts (3)                20                  1  18                  667              Other (4)                45                  1  5                  89                                                                Total            $       1,771                             $       2,502                                                                          (1)   Primarily includes our clearance     and execution and NASDAQ customer lists related to SLK and     financial counseling customer lists related to Ayco.           (2)   Consists of the value of business     acquired (VOBA) and deferred acquisition costs (DAC). VOBA     represents the present value of estimated future gross profits     of the variable annuity and life insurance business. DAC results     from commissions paid by Goldman Sachs to the primary insurer     (ceding company) on life and annuity reinsurance agreements as     compensation to place the business with us and to cover the     ceding companys acquisition expenses. VOBA and DAC are     amortized over the estimated life of the underlying contracts     based on estimated gross profits, and amortization is adjusted     based on actual experience. The seven-year useful life     represents the weighted average remaining amortization period of     the underlying contracts (certain of which extend for     approximately 30 years).           (3)   The reduction in power contracts     from November 2006 is due to the sale of the majority of our     ownership interests in 14 power generation facilities during     2007.           (4)   Primarily includes marketing and     technology-related assets.                  A prolonged period of weakness in global equity markets and the     trading of securities in multiple markets and on multiple     exchanges could adversely impact our businesses and impair the     value of our goodwill and/or identifiable intangible assets. In     addition, certain events could indicate a potential impairment     of our identifiable intangible assets, including     (i) changes in market structure that could adversely affect     our specialist businesses (see discussion below), (ii) an     adverse action or assessment by a regulator, or     (iii) adverse actual experience on the contracts in our     variable annuity and life insurance business.         During the fourth quarter of 2007, as a result of continuing     weak operating results in our NYSE specialist business, we     tested our NYSE specialist rights for impairment in accordance     with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment     or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Under     SFAS No. 144, an impairment loss is recognized if the     carrying amount of our NYSE specialist rights exceeds the     projected undiscounted cash flows of the business over the     estimated remaining useful life of our NYSE specialist rights.     Projected undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying amount     of our NYSE specialist rights, and accordingly, we did not     record an impairment loss.        62    Table of Contents       We expect that the NYSE will enact numerous rule changes in 2008     that will further align its model with investor requirements for     speed and efficiency of execution and will establish specialists     as Designated Market Makers (DMMs). As DMMs, specialists will     retain their obligation to commit capital but for the first     time, specialists will be able to trade on parity with other     market participants. In addition, we understand that the NYSE     plans to introduce a reserve order system that will allow for     anonymous trade execution and is expected to increase liquidity     and market share. The new rules are expected to bolster the     NYSEs competitive position by simplifying trading and     advancing the NYSEs goal of increasing execution speeds.         In projecting the undiscounted cash flows of the business for     the purpose of performing our impairment test, we made several     important assumptions about the potential beneficial effects of     the expected rule and market structure changes described above.     Specifically, we assumed that:                         overall equity trading volumes will continue to grow at a rate     consistent with recent historical trends;                    the NYSE will be able to recapture approximately one-half of the     market share that it lost in 2007; and                    we will increase the market share of our NYSE specialist     business and, as a DMM, the profitability of each share traded.           There can be no assurance that the assumptions, rule or     structure changes described above will result in sufficient cash     flows to avoid future impairment of our NYSE specialist rights.     As of November 30, 2007, the carrying value of our NYSE     specialist rights was $502 million. To the extent that     there were to be an impairment in the future, it could result in     a significant writedown in the carrying value of these     specialist rights.      Use of     Estimates          The use of generally accepted accounting principles requires     management to make certain estimates and assumptions. In     addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value     measurements and the accounting for goodwill and identifiable     intangible assets, the use of estimates and assumptions is also     important in determining provisions for potential losses that     may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax     audits.         We estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out     of litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits to the     extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated, in     accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for     Contingencies. Significant judgment is required in making     these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be     materially different. Our total estimated liability in respect     of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a     case-by-case     basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after     considering, among other factors, the progress of each case or     proceeding, our experience and the experience of others in     similar cases or proceedings, and the opinions and views of     legal counsel. Given the inherent difficulty of predicting the     outcome of our litigation and regulatory matters, particularly     in cases or proceedings in which substantial or indeterminate     damages or fines are sought, we cannot estimate losses or ranges     of losses for cases or proceedings where there is only a     reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.

(2)        Tangible common shareholders equity equals total     shareholders equity less preferred stock, goodwill and     identifiable intangible assets, excluding power contracts.     Identifiable intangible assets associated with power contracts     are not deducted from total shareholders equity because,     unlike other intangible assets, less than 50% of these assets     are supported by common shareholders equity.           Management believes that return on average tangible common     shareholders equity (ROTE) is meaningful because it     measures the performance of businesses consistently, whether     they were acquired or developed internally. ROTE is computed by     dividing net earnings applicable to common shareholders by     average monthly tangible common shareholders equity.         The following table sets forth a reconciliation of average total     shareholders equity to average tangible common     shareholders equity:                                                           Average for the                  Year Ended November                  2007             2006             2005                      (in millions)                   Total shareholders equity            $       37,959               $       31,048               $       26,264              Preferred stock                (3,100       )               (2,400       )               (538       )                                                                Common shareholders equity            $       34,859               $       28,648               $       25,726              Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, excluding power     contracts                (4,971       )               (5,013       )               (4,737       )                                                                Tangible common shareholders equity            $       29,888               $       23,635               $       20,989                                                                       64    Table of Contents   Net     Revenues     2007 versus 2006.  Our net revenues were     $45.99 billion in 2007, an increase of 22% compared with     2006, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in Trading     and Principal Investments and Investment Banking, and higher net     revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services. The     increase in Trading and Principal Investments reflected higher     net revenues in Equities, FICC and Principal Investments. Net     revenues in Equities increased 33% compared with 2006,     reflecting significantly higher net revenues in both our     customer franchise businesses and principal strategies. During     2007, Equities operated in an environment characterized by     strong customer-driven activity, generally higher equity prices     and higher levels of volatility, particularly during the second     half of the year. The increase in FICC reflected significantly     higher net revenues in currencies and interest rate products. In     addition, net revenues in mortgages were higher despite a     significant deterioration in the mortgage market throughout the     year, while net revenues in credit products were strong, but     slightly lower compared with 2006. Credit products included     substantial gains from equity investments, including a gain of     approximately $900 million related to the disposition of     Horizon Wind Energy L.L.C., as well as a loss of approximately     $1 billion, net of hedges, related to non-investment-grade     credit origination activities. During 2007, FICC operated in an     environment generally characterized by strong customer-driven     activity and favorable market opportunities. However, during the     year, the mortgage market experienced significant deterioration     and, in the second half of the year, the broader credit markets     were characterized by wider spreads and reduced levels of     liquidity. The increase in Principal Investments reflected     strong results in both corporate and real estate investing.         The increase in Investment Banking reflected a 64% increase in     Financial Advisory net revenues and a strong performance in our     Underwriting business. The increase in Financial Advisory     primarily reflected growth in industry-wide completed mergers     and acquisitions. The increase in Underwriting reflected higher     net revenues in debt underwriting, as leveraged finance activity     was strong during the first half of our fiscal year, while net     revenues in equity underwriting were strong but essentially     unchanged from 2006.         Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services also     increased. The increase in Securities Services primarily     reflected significant growth in global customer balances. The     increase in Asset Management reflected significantly higher     asset management fees, partially offset by significantly lower     incentive fees. During the year, assets under management     increased $192 billion, or 28%, to a record     $868 billion, including net inflows of $161 billion.     2006 versus 2005.  Our net revenues were     $37.67 billion in 2006, an increase of 49% compared with     2005, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in Trading     and Principal Investments, Investment Banking, and Asset     Management and Securities Services. The increase in Trading and     Principal Investments reflected significantly higher net     revenues in FICC, Equities and Principal Investments. The     increase in FICC reflected particularly strong performances     across all major businesses. During 2006, FICC operated in an     environment characterized by strong customer-driven activity and     favorable market opportunities. In addition, corporate credit     spreads tightened, the yield curve flattened and volatility     levels were generally low in interest rate and currency markets.     The increase in Equities primarily reflected significantly     higher net revenues in our customer franchise businesses. During     2006, Equities operated in a favorable environment characterized     by strong customer-driven activity, generally higher equity     prices and favorable market opportunities, although volatility     levels were generally low. The increase in Principal Investments     reflected a significant gain related to our investment in the     ordinary shares of ICBC and higher gains and overrides from     other principal investments, partially offset by a smaller, but     still significant, gain related to our investment in the     convertible preferred stock of SMFG.         The increase in Investment Banking was due to significantly     higher net revenues in Underwriting and Financial Advisory, as     we benefited from strong client activity levels, reflecting     favorable equity and financing markets, strong CEO confidence     and growth in financial sponsor activity.        65    Table of Contents       The increase in Asset Management and Securities Services was     primarily due to higher assets under management and     significantly higher incentive fees, as well as significantly     higher global customer balances in Securities Services. Assets     under management increased $144 billion or 27% to a record     $676 billion, including net asset inflows of     $94 billion during 2006.     Operating     Expenses         Our operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation,     headcount and levels of business activity. A substantial portion     of our compensation expense represents discretionary bonuses     which are significantly impacted by, among other factors, the     level of net revenues, prevailing labor markets, business mix     and the structure of our share-based compensation programs. For     2007, our ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was     43.9% compared with 43.7% for 2006.

Consolidated entities held for investment     purposes are entities that are held strictly for capital     appreciation, have a defined exit strategy and are engaged in     activities that are not closely related to our principal     businesses.

For example, these     investments include consolidated entities that hold real estate     assets, such as hotels, but exclude investments in entities that     primarily hold financial assets. We believe that it is     meaningful to review non-compensation expenses excluding     expenses related to these consolidated entities in order to     evaluate trends in non-compensation expenses related to our     principal business activities. Revenues related to such entities     are included in Trading and principal investments in     the consolidated statements of earnings.          2007 versus 2006.  Operating expenses were     $28.38 billion for 2007, 23% higher than 2006. Compensation     and benefits expenses of $20.19 billion increased 23%     compared with 2006, reflecting increased discretionary     compensation and growth in employment levels. The ratio of     compensation and benefits to net revenues for 2007 was 43.9%     compared with 43.7% for 2006. Employment levels increased 15%     compared with November 2006.         Non-compensation expenses of $8.19 billion for 2007     increased 23% compared with 2006, primarily attributable to     higher levels of business activity and continued geographic     expansion.     One-half of     this increase was attributable to brokerage, clearing, exchange     and distribution fees, principally reflecting higher transaction     volumes in Equities. Other expenses, professional fees and     communications and technology expenses also increased, primarily     due to higher levels of business activity. Occupancy and     depreciation and amortization expenses included exit costs of     $128 million related to the firms office space.     2006 versus 2005.  Operating expenses were     $23.11 billion for 2006, 36% higher than 2005. Compensation     and benefits expenses of $16.46 billion increased 40%     compared with 2005, primarily reflecting increased discretionary     compensation due to higher net revenues, and increased levels of     employment. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net     revenues for 2006 was 43.7% compared with 46.6% for 2005. This     lower ratio primarily reflected our strong net revenues in 2006.     Employment levels increased 12% compared with November 2005.        67    Table of Contents       In the first quarter of 2006, we adopted     SFAS No. 123-R,     which requires that share-based awards granted to     retirement-eligible employees be expensed in the year of grant.     In addition to expensing current year awards, prior year awards     must continue to be amortized over the relevant service period.     Therefore, our compensation and benefits in 2006 included both     amortization of prior year share-based awards held by employees     that were retirement-eligible on the date of adoption of     SFAS No. 123-R     and new awards granted to those employees.         Compensation and benefits expenses in 2006 included     $637 million in continued amortization of prior year awards     held by employees that were retirement-eligible on the date of     adoption of     SFAS No. 123-R.     This amount represents the majority of the expense to be     recognized with respect to these awards.         Non-compensation expenses of $6.65 billion for 2006     increased 28% compared with 2005. Excluding non-compensation     expenses related to consolidated entities held for investment     purposes, non-compensation expenses were 24% higher than 2005,     primarily due to higher brokerage, clearing, exchange and     distribution fees in Equities and FICC, and increased other     expenses, primarily due to costs related to our insurance     business, which was acquired in 2006. In addition, market     development costs and professional fees were higher, reflecting     increased levels of business activity, and occupancy expenses     increased, primarily reflecting new office space and higher     facility expenses.     Provision for     Taxes         The effective income tax rate was 34.1% for 2007, down from     34.5% for 2006, primarily due to changes in the geographic mix     of earnings. The effective income tax rate was 34.5% for 2006,     up from 32.0% for 2005. The increase in the effective income tax     rate for 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily related to a     reduction in the impact of permanent benefits due to higher     levels of earnings in 2006 and audit settlements in 2005.         Our effective income tax rate can vary from period to period     depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business     mix of our earnings, the level of our pre-tax earnings, the     level of our tax credits and the effect of tax audits. Certain     of these and other factors, including our history of pre-tax     earnings, are taken into account in assessing our ability to     realize our net deferred tax assets. See Note 14 to the     consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8     of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for further information regarding our provision for taxes.        68    Table of Contents      Segment Operating     Results          The following table sets forth the net revenues, operating     expenses and pre-tax earnings of our segments:     Segment Operating     Results (in     millions)                                                                              Year Ended November                          2007             2006             2005                Investment            Net revenues           $       7,555               $       5,629               $       3,671          Banking            Operating expenses               4,985                   4,062                   3,258                                                                                   Pre-tax earnings           $       2,570               $       1,567               $       413                                                                                                                                      Trading and Principal            Net revenues           $       31,226               $       25,562               $       16,818          Investments            Operating expenses               17,998                   14,962                   10,600                                                                                   Pre-tax earnings           $       13,228               $       10,600               $       6,218                                                                                                                                      Asset Management and            Net revenues           $       7,206               $       6,474               $       4,749          Securities Services            Operating expenses               5,363                   4,036                   3,070                                                                                   Pre-tax earnings           $       1,843               $       2,438               $       1,679                                                                                                                                      Total            Net revenues           $       45,987               $       37,665               $       25,238                     Operating expenses     (1)               28,383                   23,105                   16,965                                                                                   Pre-tax earnings           $       17,604               $       14,560               $       8,273                                                                                      (1)   Operating expenses include net     provisions for a number of litigation and regulatory proceedings     of $37 million, $45 million and $37 million for     the years ended November 2007, November 2006 and November 2005,     respectively, that have not been allocated to our segments.

The cost drivers of Goldman Sachs taken as a whole      compensation, headcount and levels of business     activity  are broadly similar in each of our business     segments. Compensation and benefits expenses within our segments     reflect, among other factors, the overall performance of Goldman     Sachs as well as the performance of individual business units.     Consequently, pre-tax margins in one segment of our business may     be significantly affected by the performance of our other     business segments. A discussion of segment operating results     follows.        69    Table of Contents   Investment     Banking         Our Investment Banking segment is divided into two components:                     Financial Advisory.  Financial Advisory     includes advisory assignments with respect to mergers and     acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense activities,     restructurings and     spin-offs.                Underwriting.  Underwriting includes public     offerings and private placements of a wide range of securities     and other financial instruments.

Net revenues in Investment     Banking of $7.56 billion for 2007 increased 34% compared     with 2006. Net revenues in Financial Advisory of     $4.22 billion increased 64% compared with 2006, primarily     reflecting growth in industry-wide completed mergers and     acquisitions. Net revenues in our Underwriting business of     $3.33 billion increased 9% compared with 2006, due to     higher net revenues in debt underwriting, primarily reflecting     strength in leveraged finance during the first half of 2007. Net     revenues in equity underwriting were also strong, but     essentially unchanged from 2006. Our investment banking     transaction backlog at the end of 2007 was higher than at the     end of 2006.     (1)         Operating expenses of $4.99 billion for 2007 increased 23%     compared with 2006, primarily due to increased compensation and     benefits expenses resulting from higher discretionary     compensation and growth in employment levels. Pre-tax earnings     of $2.57 billion in 2007 increased 64% compared with 2006.     2006 versus 2005.  Net revenues in Investment     Banking of $5.63 billion for 2006 increased 53% compared     with 2005. Net revenues in Financial Advisory of     $2.58 billion increased 35% compared with 2005, primarily     reflecting strong growth in industry-wide completed mergers and     acquisitions. Net revenues in our Underwriting business of     $3.05 billion increased 73% compared with 2005. Net     revenues were significantly higher in equity underwriting,     reflecting increased client activity. Net revenues were also     significantly higher in debt underwriting, primarily due to a     significant increase in leveraged finance activity and, to a     lesser extent, an increase in investment-grade activity. Our     investment banking transaction backlog at the end of 2006 was at     its highest level since 2000.     (1)         Operating expenses of $4.06 billion for 2006 increased 25%     compared with 2005, substantially all of which was due to     increased compensation and benefits expenses resulting from     higher levels of discretionary compensation. Pre-tax earnings     were $1.57 billion in 2006 compared with $413 million     in 2005.     Trading and     Principal Investments         Our Trading and Principal Investments segment is divided into     three components:                     FICC.  We make markets in and trade interest     rate and credit products, mortgage-related securities and loan     products and other asset-backed instruments, currencies and     commodities, structure and enter into a wide variety of     derivative transactions, and engage in proprietary trading and     investing.                Equities.  We make markets in and trade     equities and equity-related products, structure and enter into     equity derivative transactions and engage in proprietary     trading. We generate commissions from executing and clearing     client transactions on major stock, options and futures     exchanges worldwide through our Equities customer franchise and     clearing activities. We also engage in specialist and insurance     activities.                Principal Investments.  We make real estate and     corporate principal investments, including our investments in     the ordinary shares of ICBC and the convertible preferred stock     of SMFG. We generate net revenues from returns on these     investments and from the increased share of the income and gains     derived from our merchant banking funds when the return on a     funds investments over the life of the fund exceeds     certain threshold returns (typically referred to as an override).           Substantially all of our inventory is marked-to-market daily     and, therefore, its value and our net revenues are subject to     fluctuations based on market movements. In addition, net     revenues derived from our principal investments in privately     held concerns and in real estate may fluctuate significantly     depending on the revaluation of these investments in any given     period. We also regularly enter into large transactions as part     of our trading businesses. The number and size of such     transactions may affect our results of operations in a given     period.         Net revenues from Principal Investments do not include     management fees generated from our merchant banking funds. These     management fees are included in the net revenues of the Asset     Management and Securities Services segment.      (1) Our     investment banking transaction backlog represents an estimate of     our future net revenues from investment banking transactions     where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely     than not.        71    Table of Contents       The following table sets forth the operating results of our     Trading and Principal Investments segment:     Trading and     Principal Investments Operating Results (in     millions)                                                                Year Ended November                  2007             2006             2005                    FICC            $       16,165               $       14,262               $       8,940                                                                    Equities trading                6,725                   4,965                   2,675              Equities commissions                4,579                   3,518                   2,975                                                                    Total Equities                11,304                   8,483                   5,650                                                                    ICBC                495                   937                                 SMFG                (129       )               527                   1,475              Gross gains                3,728                   1,534                   767              Gross losses                (814       )               (585       )               (198       )                                                                Net other corporate and real estate investments                2,914                   949                   569              Overrides                477                   404                   184                                                                    Total Principal Investments                3,757                   2,817                   2,228                                                                    Total net revenues                31,226                   25,562                   16,818              Operating expenses                17,998                   14,962                   10,600                                                                    Pre-tax earnings            $       13,228               $       10,600               $       6,218                                                                       2007 versus 2006. Net revenues in Trading and     Principal Investments of $31.23 billion for 2007 increased     22% compared with 2006.         Net revenues in FICC of $16.17 billion for 2007 increased     13% compared with 2006, reflecting significantly higher net     revenues in currencies and interest rate products. In addition,     net revenues in mortgages were higher despite a significant     deterioration in the mortgage market throughout 2007, while net     revenues in credit products were strong, but slightly lower     compared with 2006. Credit products included substantial gains     from equity investments, including a gain of approximately     $900 million related to the disposition of Horizon Wind     Energy L.L.C., as well as a loss of approximately     $1 billion, net of hedges, related to non-investment-grade     credit origination activities. Net revenues in commodities were     also strong but lower compared with 2006. During 2007, FICC     operated in an environment generally characterized by strong     customer-driven activity and favorable market opportunities.     However, during 2007, the mortgage market experienced     significant deterioration and, in the second half of the year,     the broader credit markets were characterized by wider spreads     and reduced levels of liquidity.         Net revenues in Equities of $11.30 billion for 2007     increased 33% compared with 2006, reflecting significantly     higher net revenues in both our customer franchise businesses     and principal strategies. The customer franchise businesses     benefited from significantly higher commission volumes. During     2007, Equities operated in an environment characterized by     strong customer-driven activity, generally higher equity prices     and higher levels of volatility, particularly during the second     half of the year.         Principal Investments recorded net revenues of     $3.76 billion for 2007, reflecting gains and overrides from     corporate and real estate principal investments. Results in     Principal Investments included a $495 million gain related     to our investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC and a     $129 million loss related to our investment in the     convertible preferred stock of SMFG.        72    Table of Contents       Operating expenses of $18.00 billion for 2007 increased 20%     compared with 2006, primarily due to increased compensation and     benefits expenses, resulting from higher discretionary     compensation and growth in employment levels. Non-compensation     expenses increased due to the impact of higher levels of     business activity and continued geographic expansion. The     majority of this increase was in brokerage, clearing, exchange     and distribution fees, which primarily reflected higher     transaction volumes in Equities. Other expenses and professional     fees also increased, reflecting increased business activity.     Pre-tax earnings of $13.23 billion in 2007 increased 25%     compared with 2006.     2006 versus 2005. Net revenues in Trading and     Principal Investments of $25.56 billion for 2006 increased     52% compared with 2005.         Net revenues in FICC of $14.26 billion increased 60%     compared with 2005, primarily due to significantly higher net     revenues in credit products (which includes distressed     investing) and commodities. In addition, net revenues were     higher in interest rate products, currencies and mortgages.     During 2006, the business operated in an environment     characterized by strong customer-driven activity and favorable     market opportunities. In addition, corporate credit spreads     tightened, the yield curve flattened and volatility levels were     generally low in interest rate and currency markets.         Net revenues in Equities of $8.48 billion increased 50%     compared with 2005, primarily reflecting significantly higher     net revenues in derivatives, across all regions, as well as     higher net revenues in shares. The increase also reflected the     contribution from our insurance business, which was acquired in     2006. In addition, principal strategies performed well, although     net revenues were lower than a particularly strong 2005. During     2006, Equities operated in a favorable environment characterized     by strong customer-driven activity, generally higher equity     prices and favorable market opportunities, although volatility     levels were generally low.         Principal Investments recorded net revenues of     $2.82 billion for 2006, reflecting a $937 million gain     related to our investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC, a     $527 million gain related to our investment in the     convertible preferred stock of SMFG and $1.35 billion in     gains and overrides from other principal investments.         Operating expenses of $14.96 billion for 2006 increased 41%     compared with 2005, due to increased compensation and benefits     expenses, primarily resulting from higher levels of     discretionary compensation due to higher net revenues and     increased levels of employment, as well as higher     non-compensation expenses. Excluding non-compensation expenses     related to consolidated entities held for investment purposes,     the increase in non-compensation expenses was primarily due to     higher brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees, in     Equities and FICC, and increased other expenses, primarily due     to costs related to our insurance business, which was acquired     in 2006, and higher levels of business activity. In addition,     professional fees were higher, due to increased legal and     consulting fees. Pre-tax earnings of $10.60 billion in 2006     increased 70% compared with 2005.     Asset     Management and Securities Services         Our Asset Management and Securities Services segment is divided     into two components:                     Asset Management. Asset Management provides     investment advisory and financial planning services and offers     investment products (primarily through separately managed     accounts and commingled vehicles, such as mutual funds and     private investment funds) across all major asset classes to a     diverse group of institutions and individuals worldwide and     primarily generates revenues in the form of management and     incentive fees.                Securities Services. Securities Services provides     prime brokerage services, financing services and securities     lending services to institutional clients, including hedge     funds, mutual funds, pension funds and foundations, and to     high-net-worth     individuals worldwide, and generates revenues primarily in the     form of interest rate spreads or fees.          73    Table of Contents         Assets under management typically generate fees as a percentage     of asset value, which is affected by investment performance and     by inflows or redemptions. The fees that we charge vary by asset     class, as do our related expenses. In certain circumstances, we     are also entitled to receive incentive fees based on a     percentage of a funds return or when the return on assets     under management exceeds specified benchmark returns or other     performance targets. Incentive fees are recognized when the     performance period ends and they are no longer subject to     adjustment. We have numerous incentive fee arrangements, many of     which have annual performance periods that end on     December 31. For that reason, incentive fees have been     seasonally weighted to our first quarter.         The following table sets forth the operating results of our     Asset Management and Securities Services segment:     Asset Management     and Securities Services Operating Results (in     millions)                                                                Year Ended November                 2007           2006           2005                   Management and other fees            $       4,303               $       3,332               $       2,629              Incentive fees                187                   962                   327                                                                    Total Asset Management                4,490                   4,294                   2,956              Securities Services                2,716                   2,180                   1,793                                                                    Total net revenues                7,206                   6,474                   4,749              Operating expenses                5,363                   4,036                   3,070                                                                    Pre-tax earnings            $       1,843               $       2,438               $       1,679                                                                           Assets under management include our mutual funds, alternative     investment funds and separately managed accounts for     institutional and individual investors. Substantially all assets     under management are valued as of calendar month end. Assets     under management do not include assets in brokerage accounts     that generate commissions,     mark-ups and     spreads based on transactional activity, or our own investments     in funds that we manage.

(2)   Net of the transfer of     $8 billion of money market assets under management to     interest-bearing deposits at GS Bank USA, a wholly owned     subsidiary of Goldman Sachs. These deposits are not included in     assets under management.           (3)   Includes $3 billion of net     asset inflows in connection with the acquisition of our variable     annuity and life insurance business.              2007 versus 2006. Net revenues in Asset Management     and Securities Services of $7.21 billion for 2007 increased     11% compared with 2006.         Asset Management net revenues of $4.49 billion for 2007     increased 5% compared with 2006, reflecting a 29% increase in     management and other fees, partially offset by significantly     lower incentive fees. Incentive fees were $187 million for     2007 compared with $962 million for 2006. During 2007,     assets under management increased $192 billion, or 28%, to     $868 billion, reflecting non-money market net inflows of     $73 billion     (1),     primarily in fixed income and equity assets, money market net     inflows of $88 billion, and net market appreciation of     $31 billion, reflecting appreciation in fixed income and     equity assets, partially offset by depreciation in alternative     investment assets.         Securities Services net revenues of $2.72 billion for 2007     increased 25% compared with 2006, as our prime brokerage     business continued to generate strong results, primarily     reflecting significantly higher customer balances in securities     lending and margin lending.         Operating expenses of $5.36 billion for 2007 increased 33%     compared with 2006, primarily due to increased compensation and     benefits expenses resulting from higher discretionary     compensation and growth in employment levels, and higher     distribution fees (included in brokerage, clearing, exchange and     distribution fees). Pre-tax earnings of $1.84 billion in     2007 decreased 24% compared with 2006.      (1) Includes     $7 billion in net asset inflows in connection with our     acquisition of Macquarie  IMM Investment Management.        75    Table of Contents   2006 versus 2005.  Net revenues in Asset     Management and Securities Services of $6.47 billion for     2006 increased 36% compared with 2005.         Asset Management net revenues of $4.29 billion increased     45% compared with 2005, reflecting significantly higher     management and other fees, principally due to strong growth in     assets under management, and significantly higher incentive     fees. During the year, assets under management increased     $144 billion or 27% to $676 billion, reflecting     non-money market net inflows of $77 billion, spread across     all asset classes, money market net inflows of $17 billion     (1),     and market appreciation of $50 billion, primarily in equity     and fixed income assets.         Securities Services net revenues of $2.18 billion increased     22% compared with 2005, as our prime brokerage business     continued to generate strong results, primarily reflecting     significantly higher global customer balances in securities     lending and margin lending.         Operating expenses of $4.04 billion for 2006 increased 31%     compared with 2005, primarily due to increased compensation and     benefits expenses, resulting from higher levels of discretionary     compensation due to higher net revenues, and increased levels of     employment. Non-compensation expenses also increased, primarily     due to higher distribution fees. In addition, market development     costs were higher, reflecting increased levels of business     activity. Pre-tax earnings of $2.44 billion in 2006     increased 45% compared with 2005.      Geographic     Data          For a summary of the net revenues and pre-tax earnings of     Goldman Sachs by geographic region, see Note 16 to the     consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8     of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K.      (1) Includes     the transfer of $8 billion of money market assets under     management to interest-bearing deposits at GS Bank USA. These     deposits are not included in assets under management.        76    Table of Contents      Off-Balance-Sheet     Arrangements          We have various types of off-balance-sheet arrangements that we     enter into in the ordinary course of business. Our involvement     in these arrangements can take many different forms, including     purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in     mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization vehicles;     holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and     general partnerships, and preferred and common stock in other     nonconsolidated vehicles; entering into interest rate, foreign     currency, equity, commodity and credit derivatives, including     total return swaps; entering into operating leases; and     providing guarantees, indemnifications, loan commitments,     letters of credit and representations and warranties.         We enter into these arrangements for a variety of business     purposes, including the securitization of commercial and     residential mortgages, home equity and auto loans, government     and corporate bonds, and other types of financial assets. Other     reasons for entering into these arrangements include     underwriting client securitization transactions; providing     secondary market liquidity; making investments in performing and     nonperforming debt, equity, real estate and other assets;     providing investors with credit-linked and asset-repackaged     notes; and receiving or providing letters of credit to satisfy     margin requirements and to facilitate the clearance and     settlement process.         We engage in transactions with variable interest entities (VIEs)     and qualifying special-purpose entities (QSPEs). Such vehicles     are critical to the functioning of several significant investor     markets, including the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed     securities markets, since they offer investors access to     specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization     process. Our financial interests in, and derivative transactions     with, such nonconsolidated entities are accounted for at fair     value, in the same manner as our other financial instruments,     except in cases where we apply the equity method of accounting.         While we are routinely involved with VIEs and QSPEs in     connection with our securitization activities, we did not have     off-balance-sheet commitments to purchase or finance     collateralized debt obligations held by structured investment     vehicles as of November 2007.         The following table sets forth where a discussion of these and     other off-balance-sheet arrangements may be found in     Part II, Items 7 and 8 of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K:                    Type of Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangement       Disclosure in Annual Report on Form 10-K                    Retained interests or contingent interests in assets transferred     by us to nonconsolidated entities           See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II,     Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Other obligations, including contingent obligations, arising out     of variable interests we have in nonconsolidated entities           See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.                       Derivative contracts           See  Critical Accounting Policies above     and       Risk Management below and Notes 3 and 5 to     the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the     Annual Report on Form 10-K.                         In addition, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial     statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for a discussion of our consolidation policies.        77    Table of Contents      Equity     Capital          The level and composition of our equity capital are principally     determined by our consolidated regulatory capital requirements     but may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines,     subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment,     conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential     future losses due to extreme and adverse changes in our business     and market environments. As of November 2007, our total     shareholders equity was $42.80 billion (consisting of     common shareholders equity of $39.70 billion and     preferred stock of $3.10 billion) compared with total     shareholders equity of $35.79 billion as of November     2006 (consisting of common shareholders equity of     $32.69 billion and preferred stock of $3.10 billion).     In addition to total shareholders equity, we consider the     $5.00 billion of junior subordinated debt issued to trusts     (see discussion below) to be part of our equity capital, as it     qualifies as capital for regulatory and certain rating agency     purposes.     Consolidated     Regulatory Capital Requirements         Goldman Sachs is regulated by the Securities and Exchange     Commission (SEC) as a CSE and, as such, is subject to group-wide     supervision and examination by the SEC and to minimum capital     adequacy standards on a consolidated basis. Minimum capital     adequacy standards are principally driven by the amount of our     market risk, credit risk and operational risk as calculated by     methodologies approved by the SEC. Eligible sources of     regulatory capital include common equity and certain types of     preferred stock, debt and hybrid capital instruments, including     our junior subordinated debt issued to trusts. The recognition     of preferred stock, debt and hybrid capital instruments as     regulatory capital is subject to limitations. Goldman Sachs was     in compliance with the CSE capital adequacy standards as of     November 2007 and November 2006.     Rating Agency     Guidelines         The credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the     obligations of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., which directly     issues or guarantees substantially all of Goldman Sachs     senior unsecured obligations. The level and composition of our     equity capital are among the many factors considered in     determining our credit ratings. Each agency has its own     definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating     capital adequacy, and assessments are generally based on a     combination of factors rather than a single calculation. See      Liquidity and Funding Risk  Credit     Ratings below for further information regarding our credit     ratings.     Subsidiary     Capital Requirements         Many of our principal subsidiaries are subject to separate     regulation and capital requirements in the United States and/or     elsewhere. Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Goldman Sachs     Execution & Clearing, L.P. are registered U.S.     broker-dealers and futures commissions merchants, and are     subject to regulatory capital requirements, including those     imposed by the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,     the Chicago Board of Trade, The Financial Industry Regulatory     Authority (FINRA) and the National Futures Association. Goldman     Sachs International, our regulated U.K. broker-dealer, is     subject to minimum capital requirements imposed by the     U.K.s Financial Services Authority. Goldman Sachs     Japan Co., Ltd., our regulated Japanese broker-dealer,     is subject to minimum capital requirements imposed by     Japans Financial Services Agency. Several other     subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs are regulated by securities,     investment advisory, banking, insurance, and other regulators     and authorities around the world. As of November 2007 and     November 2006, these subsidiaries were in compliance with their     local capital requirements.        78    Table of Contents       As discussed above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to     regulatory capital requirements in jurisdictions throughout the     world. Subsidiaries not subject to separate regulation may hold     capital to satisfy local tax guidelines, rating agency     requirements (for entities with assigned credit ratings) or     internal policies, including policies concerning the minimum     amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based on its     underlying level of risk. See  Liquidity and     Funding Risk  Conservative Liability Structure     below for a discussion of our potential inability to access     funds from our subsidiaries.         Equity investments in subsidiaries are generally funded with     parent company equity capital. As of November 2007, Group     Inc.s equity investment in subsidiaries was     $40.00 billion compared with its total shareholders     equity of $42.80 billion.         Our capital invested in     non-U.S.     subsidiaries is generally exposed to foreign exchange risk,     substantially all of which is managed through a combination of     derivative contracts and     non-U.S.     denominated debt. In addition, we generally manage the     non-trading exposure to foreign exchange risk that arises from     transactions denominated in currencies other than the     transacting entitys functional currency.         See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for further information regarding our regulated subsidiaries.     Equity Capital     Management         Our objective is to maintain a sufficient level and optimal     composition of equity capital. We manage our capital through     repurchases of our common stock and issuances of preferred     stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and other     subordinated debt. We manage our capital requirements     principally by setting limits on balance sheet assets and/or     limits on risk, in each case at both the consolidated and     business unit levels. We attribute capital usage to each of our     business units based upon the CSE regulatory capital framework     and manage the levels of usage based upon the balance sheet and     risk limits established.     Share Repurchase Program. We use our share     repurchase program to help maintain the appropriate level of     common equity and to substantially offset increases in share     count over time resulting from employee share-based     compensation. The repurchase program is effected primarily     through regular open-market purchases, the amounts and timing of     which are determined primarily by our current and projected     capital positions (i.e., comparisons of our desired level of     capital to our actual level of capital) but which may also be     influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price     and trading volumes of our common stock.         The following table sets forth the level of share repurchases     for the years ended November 2007 and November 2006:                                               As of November                  2007             2006                      (in millions, except per share amounts)                   Number of shares repurchased                41.22                   50.23              Total cost            $       8,956               $       7,817              Average cost per share            $       217.29               $       155.64                     The repurchase program was increased by 60.0 million shares     on December 17, 2007. Taking into account this increased     authorization, the total remaining authorization under the     repurchase program was 65.4 million shares as of     January 18, 2008.

As of November 2007, Goldman Sachs     had 124,000 shares of perpetual non-cumulative preferred     stock issued and outstanding in four series as set forth in the     following table:     Preferred Stock     by Series                                                                       Shares            Shares                    Earliest        Redemption Value          Series       Issued           Authorized           Dividend Rate       Redemption Date       (in millions)                   A                30,000                   50,000               3 month LIBOR + 0.75%, with     floor of 3.75% per annum           April 25, 2010           $       750              B                32,000                   50,000               6.20% per annum           October 31, 2010               800              C                8,000                   25,000               3 month LIBOR + 0.75%, with     floor of 4% per annum           October 31, 2010               200              D                54,000                   60,000               3 month LIBOR + 0.67%, with     floor of 4% per annum           May 24, 2011               1,350                                                                                               124,000                   185,000                               $       3,100                                                                                           Each share of preferred stock issued and outstanding has a par     value of $0.01, has a liquidation preference of $25,000, is     represented by 1,000 depositary shares and is redeemable at our     option at a redemption price equal to $25,000 plus declared and     unpaid dividends. Dividends on each series of preferred stock,     if declared, are payable quarterly in arrears. Our ability to     declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise     acquire, our common stock is subject to certain restrictions in     the event that we fail to pay or set aside full dividends on our     preferred stock for the latest completed dividend period. All     series of preferred stock are pari passu and have a preference     over our common stock upon liquidation.     Junior Subordinated Debt Issued to Trusts in Connection with     Normal Automatic Preferred Enhanced Capital     Securities. In the second quarter of 2007, we issued     $1.75 billion of fixed rate junior subordinated debt to     Goldman Sachs Capital II and $500 million of floating rate     junior subordinated debt to Goldman Sachs Capital III, Delaware     statutory trusts that, in turn, issued $2.25 billion of     guaranteed perpetual Automatic Preferred Enhanced Capital     Securities (APEX) to third parties and a de minimis amount of     common securities to Goldman Sachs. The junior subordinated debt     is included in Unsecured long-term borrowings in the     consolidated statements of financial condition. In connection     with the APEX issuance, we entered into stock purchase contracts     with Goldman Sachs Capital II and III under which we will be     obligated to sell and these entities will be obligated to     purchase $2.25 billion of perpetual non-cumulative     preferred stock that we will issue in the future. Goldman Sachs     Capital II and III are required to remarket the junior     subordinated debt in order to fund their purchase of the     preferred stock, but in the event that a remarketing is     unsuccessful, they will relinquish the subordinated debt to us     in exchange for the preferred stock. Because of certain     characteristics of the junior subordinated debt (and the     associated APEX), including its long-term nature, the future     issuance of perpetual non-cumulative preferred stock under the     stock purchase contracts, our ability to defer payments due on     the debt and the subordinated nature of the debt in our capital     structure, it qualifies as regulatory capital for CSE purposes     and is included as part of our equity capital.     Junior Subordinated Debt Issued to a Trust in Connection with     Trust Preferred Securities. We issued     $2.84 billion of junior subordinated debentures in the     first quarter of 2004 to Goldman Sachs Capital I, a Delaware     statutory trust that, in turn, issued $2.75 billion of     guaranteed preferred beneficial interests to third parties and     $85 million of common beneficial interests to Goldman     Sachs. The junior subordinated debentures are included in     Unsecured long-term borrowings in the consolidated     statements of financial condition. Because of certain     characteristics of the junior subordinated debt (and the     associated trust preferred securities), including its long-term     nature, our ability to defer coupon interest for up to ten     consecutive semiannual periods and the subordinated nature of     the debt in our capital structure, it qualifies as regulatory     capital for CSE purposes and is included as part of our equity     capital.        80    Table of Contents   Subordinated Debt. In addition to junior     subordinated debt issued to trusts, we had other outstanding     subordinated debt of $11.23 billion as of November 2007.     Although not part of our shareholders equity, subordinated     debt may be used to meet a portion of our consolidated capital     requirements as a CSE.

We do not deduct     identifiable intangible assets associated with power contracts     from total assets in order to be consistent with the calculation     of tangible equity capital and the adjusted leverage ratio (see     footnote 2 below).

We do not deduct identifiable     intangible assets associated with power contracts from total     shareholders equity because, unlike other intangible     assets, less than 50% of these assets are supported by common     shareholders equity. We consider junior subordinated debt     issued to trusts to be a component of our tangible equity     capital base due to certain characteristics of the debt,     including its long-term nature, our ability to defer payments     due on the debt and the subordinated nature of the debt in our     capital structure.              The following table sets forth the     reconciliation of total shareholders equity to tangible     equity capital:                                                                   As of November                          2007             2006                              (in millions)                   Total shareholders equity            $       42,800               $       35,786              Add:            Junior subordinated debt issued to trusts               5,000                   2,750              Deduct:            Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, excluding power     contracts               (5,072       )               (5,019       )                                                        Tangible equity capital            $       42,728               $       33,517                                                           (3)   Leverage ratio equals total assets     divided by total shareholders equity.           (4)   Adjusted leverage ratio equals     adjusted assets divided by tangible equity capital. We believe     that the adjusted leverage ratio is a more meaningful measure of     our capital adequacy than the leverage ratio because it excludes     certain low-risk collateralized assets that are generally     supported with little or no capital and reflects the tangible     equity capital deployed in our businesses.           (5)   Debt to equity ratio equals     unsecured long-term borrowings divided by total     shareholders equity.           (6)   Tangible common shareholders     equity equals total shareholders equity less preferred     stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, excluding     power contracts. We do not deduct identifiable intangible assets     associated with power contracts from total shareholders     equity because, unlike other intangible assets, less than 50% of     these assets are supported by common shareholders equity.

Obligations that are redeemable prior to maturity at the     option of the holder are reflected at the dates such options     become exercisable.                (3)        Includes $15.93 billion accounted for at fair value under     SFAS No. 155 or SFAS No. 159 as of November 2007,     primarily consisting of hybrid financial instruments.                (4)        These obligations are reported within Other secured     financings in the consolidated statements of financial     condition and include $18.53 billion accounted for at fair     value under SFAS No. 159 as of November 2007.                (5)        Primarily includes amounts related to the acquisition of Litton     Loan Servicing LP (Litton) and construction-related obligations.              As of November 2007, our unsecured long-term borrowings were     $164.17 billion, with maturities extending to 2043, and     consisted principally of senior borrowings. See Note 5 to     the consolidated financial statements in Part II,     Item 8 of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for further information regarding our unsecured long-term     borrowings.         As of November 2007, our future minimum rental payments, net of     minimum sublease rentals, under noncancelable leases were     $3.89 billion. These lease commitments, principally for     office space, expire on various dates through 2069. Certain     agreements are subject to periodic escalation provisions for     increases in real estate taxes and other charges. See     Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for further information regarding our leases.         Our occupancy expenses include costs associated with office     space held in excess of our current requirements. This excess     space, the cost of which is charged to earnings as incurred, is     being held for potential growth or to replace currently occupied     space that we may exit in the future. We regularly evaluate our     current and future space capacity in relation to current and     projected staffing levels. In 2007, we incurred exit costs of     $128 million (included in occupancy and     depreciation and amortization expenses in the     consolidated statements of earnings). We may incur additional     exit costs in 2008 and thereafter to the extent we     (i) reduce our space capacity or (ii) commit to, or     occupy, new properties in the locations in which we operate and,     consequently, dispose of existing space that had been held for     potential growth. These exit costs may be material to our     results of operations in a given period.        83    Table of Contents       As of November 2007 and November 2006, we had     construction-related obligations of $769 million and     $1.63 billion, respectively, including outstanding     commitments of $642 million and $500 million as of     November 2007 and November 2006, respectively, related to our     new world headquarters in New York City, which is expected to     cost between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion. We are     partially financing this construction project with tax-exempt     Liberty Bonds. We borrowed approximately $1.40 billion and     approximately $250 million in 2005 and 2007, respectively,     through the issuance of Liberty Bonds.         In addition, we entered into an agreement in 2007 to acquire     Litton, the mortgage servicing unit of     Credit-Based     Asset Servicing and Securitization LLC (C-BASS). The transaction     closed in December 2007 at a purchase price of     $428 million, plus repayment of $916 million of     outstanding Litton debt obligations.         The following table sets forth our commitments as of November     2007:     Commitments (in     millions)                                                                                        Commitment Amount by Fiscal Period of Expiration                             2009 -            2011 -            2013 -                               2008             2010             2012             Thereafter             Total                    Commitments to extend credit                                                                                           Commercial lending:                                                                                           Investment-grade            $       4,456               $       3,108               $       3,248               $       907               $       11,719              Non-investment-grade                2,956                   2,969                   6,845                   29,160                   41,930              William Street program                2,571                   4,046                   16,929                   942                   24,488              Warehouse financing                3,386                   1,224                                                         4,610                                                                                                    Total commitments to extend credit                13,369                   11,347                   27,022                   31,009                   82,747              Forward starting resale and securities borrowing agreements                24,269                   3,867                                                         28,136              Forward starting repurchase and securities lending agreements                15,392                                                                            15,392              Commitments under letters of credit issued by banks to     counterparties                8,281                   271                   183                   12                   8,747              Investment commitments                6,180                   7,827                   1,594                   2,157                   17,758              Underwriting commitments                88                                                                            88                                                                                                    Total            $       67,579               $       23,312               $       28,799               $       33,178               $       152,868                                                                                                           Our commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to     counterparties that have fixed termination dates and are     contingent on the satisfaction of all conditions to borrowing     set forth in the contract. In connection with our lending     activities, we had outstanding commitments to extend credit of     $82.75 billion as of November 2007 compared with     $100.48 billion as of November 2006. Since these     commitments may expire unused or be reduced or cancelled at the     counterpartys request, the total commitment amount does     not necessarily reflect the actual future cash flow     requirements. Our commercial lending commitments are generally     extended in connection with contingent acquisition financing and     other types of corporate lending as well as commercial real     estate financing. We may seek to reduce our credit risk on these     commitments by syndicating all or substantial portions of     commitments to other investors. In addition, commitments that     are extended for contingent acquisition financing are often     intended to be short-term in nature, as borrowers often seek to     replace them with other funding sources.        84    Table of Contents       Substantially all of the commitments provided under the William     Street credit extension program are to investment-grade     corporate borrowers. Commitments under the program are extended     by William Street Commitment Corporation (Commitment Corp.), a     consolidated wholly owned subsidiary of Group Inc. whose assets     and liabilities are legally separated from other assets and     liabilities of Goldman Sachs, William Street Credit Corporation,     GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. or other     consolidated wholly owned subsidiaries of Group Inc. The     commitments extended by Commitment Corp. are supported, in part,     by funding raised by William Street Funding Corporation (Funding     Corp.), another consolidated wholly owned subsidiary of Group     Inc. whose assets and liabilities are also legally separated     from other assets and liabilities of Goldman Sachs. With respect     to most of the William Street commitments, SMFG provides us with     credit loss protection that is generally limited to 95% of the     first loss we realize on approved loan commitments, up to a     maximum of $1.00 billion. In addition, subject to the     satisfaction of certain conditions, upon our request, SMFG will     provide protection for 70% of the second loss on such     commitments, up to a maximum of $1.13 billion. We also use     other financial instruments to mitigate credit risks related to     certain William Street commitments not covered by SMFG.         Our commitments to extend credit also include financing for the     warehousing of financial assets to be securitized. These     financings are expected to be repaid from the proceeds of the     related securitizations for which we may or may not act as     underwriter. These arrangements are secured by the warehoused     assets, primarily consisting of corporate bank loans and     commercial mortgages as of November 2007 and residential     mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, corporate bank loans     and commercial mortgages as of November 2006.         See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for further information regarding our commitments, contingencies     and guarantees.      Risk     Management          Management believes that effective risk management is of primary     importance to the success of Goldman Sachs. Accordingly, we have     a comprehensive risk management process to monitor, evaluate and     manage the principal risks we assume in conducting our     activities. These risks include market, credit, liquidity,     operational, legal and reputational exposures.      Risk Management     Structure          We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a     variety of separate but complementary financial, credit,     operational, compliance and legal reporting systems. In     addition, a number of committees are responsible for monitoring     risk exposures and for general oversight of our risk management     process, as described further below. These committees (including     their subcommittees), meet regularly and consist of senior     members of both our revenue-producing units and departments that     are independent of our revenue-producing units.         Segregation of duties and management oversight are fundamental     elements of our risk management process. In addition to the     committees described below, functions that are independent of     the     revenue-producing     units, such as Compliance, Finance, Legal, Management Controls     (Internal Audit) and Operations, perform risk management     functions, which include monitoring, analyzing and evaluating     risk.     Management Committee.  All risk control     functions ultimately report to our Management Committee. Through     both direct and delegated authority, the Management Committee     approves all of our operating activities and trading risk     parameters.     Risk Committees.  The Firmwide Risk Committee     reviews the activities of existing trading businesses, approves     new businesses and products, approves firmwide market risk     limits, reviews business unit market risk limits, approves     market risk limits for selected sovereign markets and        85    Table of Contents       business units, approves sovereign credit risk limits and credit     risk limits by ratings group, and reviews scenario analyses     based on abnormal or catastrophic market movements.         The Divisional Risk Committee sets market risk limits for our     trading activities subject to overall firmwide risk limits,     based on a number of measures, including VaR, stress tests and     scenario analyses. Several other committees oversee various     risk, valuation, operational, credit and business practice     issues related to our asset management business.         Business unit risk limits are established by the various risk     committees and may be further allocated by the business unit     managers to individual trading desks. Trading desk managers have     the first line of responsibility for managing risk within     prescribed limits. These managers have in-depth knowledge of the     primary sources of risk in their respective markets and the     instruments available to hedge their exposures.         Market risk limits are monitored by the Finance Division and are     reviewed regularly by the appropriate risk committee. Limit     violations are reported to the appropriate risk committee and     business unit managers and addressed, as necessary. Credit risk     limits are also monitored by the Finance Division and reviewed     by the appropriate risk committee.     Business Practices Committee.  The Business     Practices Committee assists senior management in its oversight     of compliance and operational risks and related reputational     concerns, seeks to ensure the consistency of our policies,     practices and procedures with our Business Principles, and makes     recommendations on ways to mitigate potential risks.     Firmwide Capital Committee.  The Firmwide     Capital Committee reviews and approves transactions involving     commitments of our capital. Such capital commitments include,     but are not limited to, extensions of credit, alternative     liquidity commitments, certain bond underwritings and certain     distressed debt and principal finance activities. The Firmwide     Capital Committee is also responsible for establishing business     and reputational standards for capital commitments and seeking     to ensure that they are maintained on a global basis.     Commitments Committee.  The Commitments     Committee reviews and approves underwriting and distribution     activities, primarily with respect to offerings of equity and     equity-related securities, and sets and maintains policies and     procedures designed to ensure that legal, reputational,     regulatory and business standards are maintained in conjunction     with these activities. In addition to reviewing specific     transactions, the Commitments Committee periodically conducts     strategic reviews of industry sectors and products and     establishes policies in connection with transaction practices.     Credit Policy Committee.  The Credit Policy     Committee establishes and reviews broad credit policies and     parameters that are implemented by the Credit Department.     Finance Committee.  The Finance Committee     establishes and oversees our liquidity policies, sets certain     inventory position limits and has oversight responsibility for     liquidity risk, the size and composition of our balance sheet     and capital base, and our credit ratings. The Finance Committee     regularly reviews our funding position and capitalization and     makes adjustments in light of current events, risks and     exposures.     New Products Committee.  The New Products     Committee, under the oversight of the Firmwide Risk Committee,     is responsible for reviewing and approving new products and     businesses globally.     Operational Risk Committee.  The Operational     Risk Committee provides oversight of the ongoing development and     implementation of our operational risk policies, framework and     methodologies, and monitors the effectiveness of operational     risk management.     Structured Products Committee.  The Structured     Products Committee reviews and approves structured product     transactions entered into with our clients that raise legal,     regulatory, tax or accounting issues or present reputational     risk to Goldman Sachs.        86    Table of Contents      Market     Risk          The potential for changes in the market value of our trading and     investing positions is referred to as market risk. Such     positions result from market-making, proprietary trading,     underwriting, specialist and investing activities. Substantially     all of our inventory positions are marked-to-market on a daily     basis and changes are recorded in net revenues.         Categories of market risk include exposures to interest rates,     equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. A     description of each market risk category is set forth below:                         Interest rate risks primarily result from exposures to changes     in the level, slope and curvature of the yield curve, the     volatility of interest rates, mortgage prepayment speeds and     credit spreads.                    Equity price risks result from exposures to changes in prices     and volatilities of individual equities, equity baskets and     equity indices.                    Currency rate risks result from exposures to changes in spot     prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates.                    Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot     prices, forward prices and volatilities of commodities, such as     electricity, natural gas, crude oil, petroleum products, and     precious and base metals.           We seek to manage these risks by diversifying exposures,     controlling position sizes and establishing economic hedges in     related securities or derivatives. For example, we may hedge a     portfolio of common stocks by taking an offsetting position in a     related equity-index futures contract. The ability to manage an     exposure may, however, be limited by adverse changes in the     liquidity of the security or the related hedge instrument and in     the correlation of price movements between the security and     related hedge instrument.         In addition to applying business judgment, senior management     uses a number of quantitative tools to manage our exposure to     market risk for Financial instruments owned, at fair     value and Financial instruments sold, but not yet     purchased, at fair value in the consolidated statements of     financial condition. These tools include:                         risk limits based on a summary measure of market risk exposure     referred to as VaR;                    scenario analyses, stress tests and other analytical tools that     measure the potential effects on our trading net revenues of     various market events, including, but not limited to, a large     widening of credit spreads, a substantial decline in equity     markets and significant moves in selected emerging markets; and                    inventory position limits for selected business units.          87    Table of Contents   VaR         VaR is the potential loss in value of trading positions due to     adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a     specified confidence level.         For the VaR numbers reported below, a     one-day time     horizon and a 95% confidence level were used. This means that     there is a 1 in 20 chance that daily trading net revenues will     fall below the expected daily trading net revenues by an amount     at least as large as the reported VaR. Thus, shortfalls from     expected trading net revenues on a single trading day greater     than the reported VaR would be anticipated to occur, on average,     about once a month. Shortfalls on a single day can exceed     reported VaR by significant amounts. Shortfalls can also     accumulate over a longer time horizon such as a number of     consecutive trading days.         The modeling of the risk characteristics of our trading     positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations.     While management believes that these assumptions and     approximations are reasonable, there is no standard methodology     for estimating VaR, and different assumptions and/or     approximations could produce materially different VaR estimates.         We use historical data to estimate our VaR and, to better     reflect current asset volatilities, we generally weight     historical data to give greater importance to more recent     observations. Given its reliance on historical data, VaR is most     effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there     are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market     conditions. An inherent limitation of VaR is that the     distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not     produce accurate predictions of future market risk. Different     VaR methodologies and distributional assumptions could produce a     materially different VaR. Moreover, VaR calculated for a     one-day time     horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that     cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within one day.         The following tables set forth the daily VaR:     Average Daily VaR     (1) (in     millions)                                                                Year Ended November          Risk Categories         2007             2006             2005                    Interest rates            $       85               $       49               $       37              Equity prices                100                   72                   34              Currency rates                23                   21                   17              Commodity prices                26                   30                   26              Diversification effect     (2)                (96       )               (71       )               (44       )                                                                Total            $       138               $       101               $       70                                                                                       (1)        Certain portfolios and individual positions are not included in     VaR, where VaR is not the most appropriate measure of risk     (e.g., due to transfer restrictions and/or illiquidity).

This effect arises because the     four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated.              Our average daily VaR increased to $138 million in 2007     from $101 million in 2006. The increase was primarily due     to higher levels of exposure and volatility in interest rates     and equity prices.         Our average daily VaR increased to $101 million in 2006     from $70 million in 2005. We increased our level of     exposure across all risk categories, particularly equity prices     and interest rates.        88    Table of Contents   Daily VaR (in     millions)                                                                                        Year Ended                  As of November           November 2007          Risk Categories         2007             2006             High             Low                    Interest rates            $       105               $       51               $       152               $       42              Equity prices                82                   84                   167                   59              Currency rates                35                   15                   41                   12              Commodity prices                33                   21                   51                   17              Diversification effect     (1)                (121       )               (52       )                                                                                                                Total            $       134               $       119               $       181               $       104                                                                                                       (1)        Equals the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs     for the four risk categories. This effect arises because the     four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated.              Our daily VaR increased to $134 million as of November 2007     from $119 million as of November 2006. The increase     primarily reflected higher levels of exposure to interest rates,     currency rates and commodity prices, as well as increased levels     of volatility in interest rates, partially offset by the benefit     of increased diversification effects among different risk     categories.         The following chart presents our daily VaR during 2007:     Daily VaR ($ in     millions)                  89    Table of Contents   Trading Net     Revenues Distribution         The following chart sets forth the frequency distribution of our     daily trading net revenues for substantially all inventory     positions included in VaR for the year ended November 2007:     Daily Trading Net     Revenues ($ in     millions)                      As part of our overall risk control process, daily trading net     revenues are compared with VaR calculated as of the end of the     prior business day. Trading losses incurred on a single day     exceeded our 95%     one-day VaR     on ten occasions during 2007.     Other Market     Risk Measures         Certain portfolios and individual positions are not included in     VaR, where VaR is not the most appropriate measure of risk     (e.g., due to transfer restrictions and/or illiquidity). The     market risk related to our investments in the ordinary shares of     ICBC and the convertible preferred stock of SMFG is measured by     estimating the potential reduction in net revenues associated     with a 10% decline in the ICBC ordinary share price and a 10%     decline in the SMFG common stock price, respectively. The market     risk related to the remaining positions is measured by     estimating the potential reduction in net revenues associated     with a 10% decline in asset values.         The sensitivity analyses for equity and debt positions in our     trading portfolio and equity, debt (primarily mezzanine     instruments) and real estate positions in our non-trading     portfolio are measured by the impact of a decline in the asset     values (including the impact of leverage in the underlying     investments for real estate positions in our non-trading     portfolio) of such positions. The fair value of the underlying     positions may be impacted by factors such as transactions in     similar instruments, completed or pending third-party     transactions in the underlying investment or comparable     entities, subsequent rounds of financing, recapitalizations and     other transactions across the capital structure, offerings in     the equity or debt capital markets, and changes in financial     ratios or cash flows.         The sensitivity analysis of our investment in the ordinary     shares of ICBC excludes interests held by investment funds     managed by Goldman Sachs.         The sensitivity analysis of our investment in the convertible     preferred stock of SMFG, net of the economic hedge on a     substantial portion of the common stock underlying our     investment, is        90    Table of Contents       measured by the impact of a decline in the SMFG common stock     price. This sensitivity should not be extrapolated to a     significant decline in the SMFG common stock price, as the     relationship between the fair value of our investment and the     SMFG common stock price would be nonlinear due to downside     protection on the conversion stock price.         The following table sets forth market risk for positions not     included in VaR. These measures do not reflect diversification     benefits across asset categories and, given the differing     likelihood of the potential declines in asset categories, these     measures have not been aggregated:                                                              10% Sensitivity                           Amount as of November           Asset Categories         10% Sensitivity     Measure         2007             2006                              (in millions)               Trading Risk (1)                                                   Equity            Underlying asset value           $       1,325               $       377              Debt            Underlying asset value               1,020                   725                                                        Non-trading Risk                                                   ICBC            ICBC ordinary share price               250                   191              SMFG            SMFG common stock price               41                   140              Other Equity            Underlying asset value               1,013                   390              Debt            Underlying asset value               500                   199              Real Estate     (2)            Underlying asset value               1,108                   341                          (1)        In addition to the positions in these portfolios, which are     accounted for at fair value, we make investments accounted for     under the equity method and we also make direct investments in     real estate, both of which are included in Other     assets in the consolidated statements of financial     condition. Direct investments in real estate are accounted for     at cost less accumulated depreciation. See Note 10 to the     consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8     of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for information on Other assets.         (2)        Relates to interests in our real estate investment funds.              The increase in our 10% sensitivity measures during 2007 in our     trading and non-trading portfolios (excluding ICBC and SMFG) was     primarily due to new investments.         In addition, as of November 2007 and November 2006, in our bank     and insurance subsidiaries we held approximately     $10.58 billion and $9.95 billion of securities,     respectively, primarily consisting of mortgage-backed, federal     agency and investment-grade corporate bonds.      Credit     Risk          Credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a     counterparty or an issuer of securities or other instruments we     hold fails to perform under its contractual obligations to us,     or upon a deterioration in the credit quality of third parties     whose securities or other instruments, including OTC     derivatives, we hold. Our exposure to credit risk principally     arises through our trading, investing and financing activities.     To reduce our credit exposures, we seek to enter into netting     agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset     receivables and payables with such counterparties. In addition,     we attempt to further reduce credit risk with certain     counterparties by (i) entering into agreements that enable     us to obtain collateral from a counterparty on an upfront or     contingent basis, (ii) seeking     third-party     guarantees of the counterpartys obligations, and/or     (iii) transferring our credit risk to third parties using     credit derivatives and/or other structures and techniques.         To measure and manage our credit exposures, we use a variety of     tools, including credit limits referenced to both current     exposure and potential exposure. Potential exposure is generally     based on projected worst-case market movements over the life of     a transaction. In addition, as part of our market risk     management process, for positions measured by changes in credit     spreads, we use VaR        91    Table of Contents       and other sensitivity measures. To supplement our primary credit     exposure measures, we also use scenario analyses, such as credit     spread widening scenarios, stress tests and other quantitative     tools.         Our global credit management systems monitor credit exposure to     individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to     counterparties and their affiliates. These systems also provide     management, including the Firmwide Risk and Credit Policy     Committees, with information regarding credit risk by product,     industry sector, country and region.         While our activities expose us to many different industries and     counterparties, we routinely execute a high volume of     transactions with counterparties in the financial services     industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks,     investment funds and other institutional clients, resulting in     significant credit concentration with respect to this industry.     In the ordinary course of business, we may also be subject to a     concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty,     borrower or issuer.         As of November 2007 and November 2006, we held     $45.75 billion (4% of total assets) and $46.20 billion     (6% of total assets), respectively, of U.S. government and     federal agency obligations (including securities guaranteed by     the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home     Loan Mortgage Corporation) included in Financial     instruments owned, at fair value and Cash and     securities segregated for regulatory and other purposes in     the consolidated statements of financial condition. As of     November 2007 and November 2006, we held $31.65 billion (3%     of total assets) and $23.64 billion (3% of total assets),     respectively, of other sovereign obligations, principally     consisting of securities issued by the governments of Japan and     the United Kingdom. In addition, as of November 2007 and     November 2006, $144.92 billion and $104.76 billion of     our financial instruments purchased under agreements to resell     and securities borrowed, respectively, were collateralized by     U.S. government and federal agency obligations. As of November     2007 and 2006, $41.26 billion and $38.22 billion of     our financial instruments purchased under agreements to resell     and securities borrowed, respectively, were collateralized by     other sovereign obligations. As of November 2007 and November     2006, we did not have credit exposure to any other counterparty     that exceeded 2% of our total assets. However, over the past     several years, the amount and duration of our credit exposures     have been increasing, due to, among other factors, the growth of     our lending and OTC derivative activities and market evolution     toward longer dated transactions. A further discussion of our     derivative activities follows below.      Derivatives          Derivative contracts are instruments, such as futures, forwards,     swaps or option contracts, that derive their value from     underlying assets, indices, reference rates or a combination of     these factors. Derivative instruments may be privately     negotiated contracts, which are often referred to as OTC     derivatives, or they may be listed and traded on an exchange.         Substantially all of our derivative transactions are entered     into to facilitate client transactions, to take proprietary     positions or as a means of risk management. In addition to     derivative transactions entered into for trading purposes, we     enter into derivative contracts to manage currency exposure on     our net investment in     non-U.S.     operations and to manage the interest rate and currency exposure     on our long-term borrowings and certain short-term borrowings.         Derivatives are used in many of our businesses, and we believe     that the associated market risk can only be understood relative     to all of the underlying assets or risks being hedged, or as     part of a broader trading strategy. Accordingly, the market risk     of derivative positions is managed together with our     nonderivative positions.         The fair value of our derivative contracts is reflected net of     cash paid or received pursuant to credit support agreements and     is reported on a     net-by-counterparty     basis in our consolidated statements of financial condition when     management believes a legal right of setoff exists under an     enforceable netting agreement. For an OTC derivative, our credit     exposure is directly with our counterparty and continues until     the maturity or termination of such contract.        92    Table of Contents       The following tables set forth the fair values of our OTC     derivative assets and liabilities by product and by remaining     contractual maturity:     OTC     Derivatives (in     millions)                                                                                                    As of November 2007         Assets        0 -

We enter into certain OTC option transactions that provide us or     our counterparties with the right to extend the maturity of the     underlying contract. The fair value of these option contracts is     not material to the aggregate fair value of our OTC derivative     portfolio. In the tables above, for option contracts that     require settlement by delivery of an underlying derivative     instrument, the remaining contractual maturity is generally     classified based upon the maturity date of the underlying     derivative instrument. In those instances where the underlying     instrument does not have a maturity date or either counterparty     has the right to settle in cash, the remaining contractual     maturity is generally based upon the option expiration date.        93    Table of Contents       The following table sets forth the distribution, by credit     rating, of substantially all of our exposure with respect to OTC     derivatives as of November 2007, after taking into consideration     the effect of netting agreements.

(2)        Includes credit derivatives.          94    Table of Contents         Derivative transactions may also involve legal risks including     the risk that they are not authorized or appropriate for a     counterparty, that documentation has not been properly executed     or that executed agreements may not be enforceable against the     counterparty. We attempt to minimize these risks by obtaining     advice of counsel on the enforceability of agreements as well as     on the authority of a counterparty to effect the derivative     transaction. In addition, certain derivative transactions (e.g.,     credit derivative contracts) involve the risk that we may have     difficulty obtaining, or be unable to obtain, the underlying     security or obligation in order to satisfy any physical     settlement requirement.      Liquidity and     Funding Risk          Liquidity is of critical importance to companies in the     financial services sector. Most failures of financial     institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient     liquidity resulting from adverse circumstances. Accordingly,     Goldman Sachs has in place a comprehensive set of liquidity and     funding policies that are intended to maintain significant     flexibility to address both Goldman Sachs-specific and broader     industry or market liquidity events. Our principal objective is     to be able to fund Goldman Sachs and to enable our core     businesses to continue to generate revenues, even under adverse     circumstances.         Management has implemented a number of policies according to the     following liquidity risk management framework:                         Excess Liquidity  We maintain substantial excess     liquidity to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows in a     stressed environment including financing obligations.                    Asset-Liability Management  We seek to maintain     funding sources that are sufficiently long-term in order to     withstand a prolonged or severe liquidity-stressed environment     without having to rely on asset sales.                    Conservative Liability Structure  We access funding     across a diverse range of markets, products and counterparties,     emphasize less credit-sensitive sources of funding and     conservatively manage the distribution of funding across our     entity structure.                    Crisis Planning  We base our liquidity and funding     management on stress-scenario planning and maintain a crisis     plan detailing our response to a liquidity-threatening event.       Excess     Liquidity         Our most important liquidity policy is to pre-fund what we     estimate will be our likely cash needs during a liquidity crisis     and hold such excess liquidity in the form of unencumbered,     highly liquid securities that may be sold or pledged to provide     same-day     liquidity. This Global Core Excess liquidity is     intended to allow us to meet immediate obligations without     needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding     from credit-sensitive markets. We believe that this pool of     excess liquidity provides us with a resilient source of funds     and gives us significant flexibility in managing through a     difficult funding environment. Our Global Core Excess reflects     the following principles:                         The first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most     critical to a companys survival.                    Focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral     outflows, not just disruptions to financing flows. Goldman     Sachs businesses are diverse, and its cash needs are     driven by many factors, including market movements, collateral     requirements and client commitments, all of which can change     dramatically in a difficult funding environment.                    During a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding, including     unsecured debt and some types of secured financing agreements,     may be unavailable and the terms or availability of other types     of secured financing may change.                    As a result of our policy to pre-fund liquidity that we estimate     may be needed in a crisis, we hold more unencumbered securities     and have larger unsecured debt balances than our businesses     would otherwise require. We believe that our liquidity is     stronger with greater          95    Table of Contents                  balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities, even though     it increases our unsecured liabilities.           The size of our Global Core Excess is based on an internal     liquidity model together with a qualitative assessment of the     condition of the financial markets and of Goldman Sachs. Our     liquidity model identifies and estimates cash and collateral     outflows over a short-term horizon in a liquidity crisis,     including, but not limited to:                         upcoming maturities of unsecured debt and letters of credit;                    potential buybacks of a portion of our outstanding negotiable     unsecured debt;                    adverse changes in the terms or availability of secured funding;                    derivatives and other margin and collateral outflows, including     those due to market moves;                    potential cash outflows associated with our prime brokerage     business;                    additional collateral that could be called in the event of a     two-notch downgrade in our credit ratings;                    draws on our unfunded commitments not supported by William     Street Funding Corporation     (1);     and                    upcoming cash outflows, such as tax and other large payments.              The following table sets forth the average loan value (the     estimated amount of cash that would be advanced by     counterparties against these securities) of our Global Core     Excess:                                                Year Ended November                   2007             2006                      (in millions)                   U.S. dollar-denominated            $       48,635               $       40,862          Non-U.S.     dollar-denominated                11,928                   10,202                                                    Total Global Core Excess            $       60,563               $       51,064                                                           The U.S. dollar-denominated excess is comprised of only     unencumbered U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities     and highly liquid U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, all of     which are Federal Reserve repo-eligible, as well as overnight     cash deposits. Our     non-U.S.     dollar-denominated excess is comprised of only unencumbered     French, German, United Kingdom and Japanese government bonds and     euro, British pound and Japanese yen overnight cash deposits. We     strictly limit our Global Core Excess to this narrowly defined     list of securities and cash because we believe they are highly     liquid, even in a difficult funding environment. We do not     believe other potential sources of excess liquidity, such as     lower-quality unencumbered securities or committed credit     facilities, are as reliable in a liquidity crisis.         The majority of our Global Core Excess is structured such that     it is available to meet the liquidity requirements of our parent     company, Group Inc., and all of its subsidiaries. The remainder     is held in our principal     non-U.S.     operating entities, primarily to better match the currency and     timing requirements for those entities potential liquidity     obligations.         In addition to our Global Core Excess, we have a significant     amount of other unencumbered securities as a result of our     business activities. These assets, which are located in the     United States, Europe and Asia, include other government bonds,     high-grade money market securities, corporate bonds and     marginable equities. We do not include these securities in our     Global Core Excess.      (1) The     Global Core Excess excludes liquid assets of $6.17 billion     held separately by William Street Funding Corporation. See       Contractual Obligations and Commitments     above for a further discussion of the William Street credit     extension program.        96    Table of Contents       We maintain Global Core Excess and other unencumbered assets in     an amount that, if pledged or sold, would provide the funds     necessary to replace at least 110% of our unsecured obligations     that are scheduled to mature (or where holders have the option     to redeem) within the next 12 months. We assume     conservative loan values that are based on stress-scenario     borrowing capacity and we regularly review these assumptions     asset class by asset class. The estimated aggregate loan value     of our Global Core Excess and our other unencumbered assets     averaged $156.74 billion and $134.38 billion for the     fiscal years ended 2007 and 2006, respectively.     Asset-Liability     Management         We seek to maintain a highly liquid balance sheet and     substantially all of our inventory is     marked-to-market     daily. We utilize aged inventory limits for certain financial     instruments as a disincentive to our businesses to hold     inventory over longer periods of time. We believe that these     limits provide a complementary mechanism for ensuring     appropriate balance sheet liquidity in addition to our standard     position limits. Although our balance sheet fluctuates due to     seasonal activity, market conventions and periodic market     opportunities in certain of our businesses, our total assets and     adjusted assets at financial statement dates are not materially     different from those occurring within our reporting periods.         We seek to manage the maturity profile of our funding base such     that we should be able to liquidate our assets prior to our     liabilities coming due, even in times of prolonged or severe     liquidity stress. We do not rely on immediate sales of assets     (other than our Global Core Excess) to maintain liquidity in a     distressed environment, although we recognize orderly asset     sales may be prudent and necessary in a persistent liquidity     crisis.         In order to avoid reliance on asset sales, our goal is to ensure     that we have sufficient total capital (unsecured long-term     borrowings plus total shareholders equity) to fund our     balance sheet for at least one year. The amount of our total     capital is based on an internal liquidity model, which     incorporates, among other things, the following long-term     financing requirements:                         the portion of financial instruments owned that we believe could     not be funded on a secured basis in periods of market stress,     assuming conservative loan values;                    goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, property, leasehold     improvements and equipment, and other illiquid assets;                    derivative and other margin and collateral requirements;                    anticipated draws on our unfunded loan commitments; and                    capital or other forms of financing in our regulated     subsidiaries that is in excess of their     long-term     financing requirements. See  Conservative     Liability Structure below for a further discussion of how     we fund our subsidiaries.          97    Table of Contents       Certain financial instruments may be more difficult to fund on a     secured basis during times of market stress. Accordingly, we     generally hold higher levels of total capital for these assets     than more liquid types of financial instruments. The table below     sets forth our aggregate holdings in these categories of     financial instruments:                                                As of November                   2007             2006                      (in millions)                   Mortgage and other asset-backed loans and securities     (1)            $       46,436               $       41,017              Bank loans     (2)                49,154                   28,196              High-yield securities                12,807                   9,403              Emerging market debt securities                3,343                   2,291              Private equity and real estate fund investments     (3)                16,244                   5,968              Emerging market equity securities                8,014                   3,046              ICBC ordinary shares     (4)                6,807                   5,194              SMFG convertible preferred stock                4,060                   4,505              Other restricted public equity securities                3,455                   1,730              Other investments in funds     (5)                3,437                   260                        (1)   Excludes $7.64 billion of     mortgage whole loans that were transferred to securitization     vehicles where such transfers were accounted for as secured     financings rather than sales under SFAS No. 140. We     distributed to investors the securities that were issued by the     securitization vehicles and therefore do not bear economic     exposure to the underlying mortgage whole loans.           (2)   Includes funded commitments and     inventory held in connection with our origination and secondary     trading activities.           (3)   Includes interests in our merchant     banking funds. Such amounts exclude assets related to     consolidated investment funds of $8.13 billion and     $6.03 billion as of November 2007 and November 2006,     respectively, for which Goldman Sachs does not bear economic     exposure.           (4)   Includes interests of     $4.30 billion and $3.28 billion as of November 2007     and November 2006, respectively, held by investment funds     managed by Goldman Sachs.           (5)   Includes interests in other     investment funds that we manage.               A large portion of these assets are funded through secured     funding markets or nonrecourse financing. We focus on     demonstrating a consistent ability to fund these assets on a     secured basis for extended periods of time to reduce refinancing     risk and to help ensure that they have an established amount of     loan value in order that they can be funded in periods of market     stress.         See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for further information regarding the financial instruments we     hold.        98    Table of Contents   Conservative     Liability Structure         We seek to structure our liabilities conservatively to reduce     refinancing risk and the risk that we may redeem or repurchase     certain of our borrowings prior to their contractual maturity.     Our conservative liability structure reflects the following     policies:                         We fund a substantial portion of our inventory on a secured     basis. We believe secured financing provides Goldman Sachs with     a more stable source of liquidity than unsecured financing, as     it is less sensitive to changes in our credit due to the     underlying collateral.                    Our liquidity depends to an important degree on the stability of     our short-term unsecured financing base. Accordingly, we prefer     the use of promissory notes (in which Goldman Sachs does not     make a market) over commercial paper, which we may repurchase     prior to maturity through the ordinary course of business as a     market maker. As of November 2007 and November 2006, our     unsecured short-term borrowings, including the current portion     of unsecured long-term borrowings, were $71.56 billion and     $47.90 billion, respectively. See Note 4 to the     consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8     of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for further information regarding our unsecured short-term     borrowings.                    We recognize that secured funding transactions have greater     refinancing risk when the underlying collateral is more     difficult to fund. Consequently, we seek longer maturities for     secured funding transactions collateralized by these assets. In     some cases, we use extendible maturity features to obtain a     rolling minimum term to the funding.                    We issue substantially all of our unsecured debt without     provisions that would, based solely upon an adverse change in     our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or     stock price, trigger a requirement for an early payment,     collateral support, change in terms, acceleration of maturity or     the creation of an additional financial obligation.           We seek to maintain broad and diversified funding sources     globally for both secured and unsecured funding. We make     extensive use of the repurchase agreement and securities lending     markets, as well as other secured funding markets. In addition,     we issue debt through syndicated U.S. registered offerings, U.S.     registered and 144A medium-term note programs, offshore     medium-term note offerings and other bond offerings, U.S. and     non-U.S.     commercial paper and promissory note issuances, and other     methods. We also arrange for letters of credit to be issued on     our behalf.         We benefit from distributing our debt issuances through our own     sales force to a large, diverse global creditor base and we     believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical     to our liquidity. Our creditors include banks, governments,     securities lenders, pension funds, insurance companies and     mutual funds. We access funding in a variety of markets in the     Americas, Europe and Asia. We have imposed various internal     guidelines on investor concentration, including the amount of     our commercial paper that can be owned and letters of credit     that can be issued by any single investor or group of investors.        99    Table of Contents       To mitigate refinancing risk, we have created internal     guidelines on the principal amount of debt maturing on any one     day or during any week or year. The following table sets forth     our quarterly unsecured long-term borrowings maturity profile     through 2013:     Unsecured     Long-Term Borrowings Maturity Profile ($     in millions)                     The weighted average maturity of our unsecured long-term     borrowings as of November 2007 was approximately seven years. We     swap a substantial portion of our long-term borrowings into U.S.     dollar obligations with short-term floating interest rates in     order to minimize our exposure to interest rates and foreign     exchange movements.         For a discussion of factors that could impair our ability to     access the capital markets, see  Certain Risk     Factors That May Affect Our Business above as well as     Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the     Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     Subsidiary Funding Policies. Substantially all of     our unsecured funding is raised by our parent company, Group     Inc. The parent company then lends the necessary funds to its     subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their asset     financing and capital requirements. In addition, the parent     company provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary     capital to meet their regulatory requirements. The benefits of     this approach to subsidiary funding include enhanced control and     greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our     subsidiaries.         Our intercompany funding policies are predicated on an     assumption that, unless legally provided for, funds or     securities are not freely available from a subsidiary to its     parent company or other subsidiaries. In particular, many of our     subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory     bodies to block or limit the flow of funds from those     subsidiaries to Group Inc. Regulatory action of that kind could     impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on     obligations, including debt obligations. As such, we assume that     capital or other financing provided to our regulated     subsidiaries is not available to our parent company or other     subsidiaries. In addition, we assume that the Global Core Excess     held in our principal     non-U.S.     operating entities will not be available to our parent company     or other subsidiaries and therefore is available only to meet     the potential liquidity requirements of those entities.        100    Table of Contents       We also manage our liquidity risk by requiring senior and     subordinated intercompany loans to have maturities equal to or     shorter than the maturities of the aggregate borrowings of the     parent company. This policy ensures that the subsidiaries     obligations to the parent company will generally mature in     advance of the parent companys third-party borrowings. In     addition, many of our subsidiaries and affiliates maintain     unencumbered assets to cover their intercompany borrowings     (other than subordinated debt) in order to mitigate parent     company liquidity risk.         Group Inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and     subordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to its     regulated subsidiaries; for example, as of November 2007,     Group Inc. had $24.49 billion of such equity and     subordinated indebtedness invested in Goldman, Sachs &     Co., its principal U.S. registered     broker-dealer;     $27.51 billion invested in Goldman Sachs International, a     regulated U.K.     broker-dealer;     $2.40 billion invested in Goldman Sachs     Execution & Clearing, L.P., a U.S. registered     broker-dealer; and $3.15 billion invested in Goldman Sachs     Japan Co., Ltd., a regulated Japanese     broker-dealer.     Group Inc. also had $44.99 billion of unsubordinated loans     to these entities as of November 2007, as well as     significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its     other regulated subsidiaries.     Crisis     Planning         In order to be prepared for a liquidity event, or a period of     market stress, we base our liquidity risk management framework     and our resulting funding and liquidity policies on conservative     stress-scenario     assumptions. Our planning incorporates several market-based and     operational stress scenarios. We also periodically conduct     liquidity crisis drills to test our lines of communication and     backup funding procedures.         In addition, we maintain a liquidity crisis plan that specifies     an approach for analyzing and responding to a     liquidity-threatening event. The plan provides the framework to     estimate the likely impact of a liquidity event on Goldman Sachs     based on some of the risks identified above and outlines which     and to what extent liquidity maintenance activities should be     implemented based on the severity of the event. It also lists     the crisis management team and internal and external parties to     be contacted to ensure effective distribution of information.     Credit     Ratings         We rely upon the short-term and long-term debt capital markets     to fund a significant portion of our day-to-day operations. The     cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our     credit ratings. Credit ratings are important when we are     competing in certain markets and when we seek to engage in     longer term transactions, including OTC derivatives. We believe     our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit rating     agencies assessment of our liquidity, market, credit and     operational risk management practices, the level and variability     of our earnings, our capital base, our franchise, reputation and     management, our corporate governance and the external operating     environment. See  Certain Risk Factors That May     Affect Our Business above for a discussion of the risks     associated with a reduction in our credit ratings.         The following table sets forth our unsecured credit ratings as     of November 2007:                                               Short-Term Debt       Long-Term Debt       Subordinated Debt       Preferred Stock               Dominion Bond Rating Service Limited            R-1 (middle)           AA (low)           A (high)           A          Fitch, Inc.             F1+           AA           A+           A+          Moodys Investors Service            P-1           Aa3           A1           A2          Standard & Poors            A-1+           AA           A+           A          Rating and Investment Information, Inc.             a-1+           AA           Not Applicable           Not Applicable             101    Table of Contents       As of November 2007, collateral or termination payments pursuant     to bilateral agreements with certain counterparties of     approximately $728 million would have been required in the     event of a     one-notch     reduction in our long-term credit ratings. In evaluating our     liquidity requirements, we consider additional collateral or     termination payments that would be required in the event of a     two-notch     downgrade in our long-term credit ratings, as well as collateral     that has not been called by counterparties, but is available to     them.     Cash     Flows         As a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex     and interrelated and bear little relation to our net earnings     and net assets and, consequently, we believe that traditional     cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our     liquidity position than the excess liquidity and     asset-liability     management policies described above. Cash flow analysis may,     however, be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and     strategic initiatives in our business.     Year Ended November 2007. Our cash and cash     equivalents increased by $5.59 billion to     $11.88 billion at the end of 2007. We raised     $73.79 billion in net cash from financing and investing     activities, primarily through the issuance of unsecured     borrowings, partially offset by common stock repurchases. We     used net cash of $68.20 billion in our operating     activities, primarily to capitalize on trading and investing     opportunities for our clients and ourselves.     Year Ended November 2006. Our cash and cash     equivalents decreased by $3.97 billion to     $6.29 billion at the end of 2006. We raised     $64.09 billion in net cash from financing activities,     primarily in long-term borrowings as well as through secured     financings, partially offset by common stock repurchases. We     used net cash of $68.06 billion in our operating and     investing activities, primarily to capitalize on trading and     investing opportunities for our clients and ourselves.      Operational     Risk          Operational risk relates to the risk of loss arising from     shortcomings or failures in internal processes, people or     systems, or from external events. Operational risk can arise     from many factors ranging from routine processing errors to     potentially costly incidents related to, for example, major     systems failures. Operational risk may also cause reputational     harm. Thus, efforts to identify, manage and mitigate operational     risk must be equally sensitive to the risk of reputational     damage as well as the risk of financial loss.         We manage operational risk through the application of     long-standing, but continuously evolving, firmwide control     standards which are supported by the training, supervision and     development of our people; the active participation and     commitment of senior management in a continuous process of     identifying and mitigating key operational risks across Goldman     Sachs; and a framework of strong and independent control     departments that monitor operational risk on a daily basis.     Together, these elements form a strong firmwide control culture     that serves as the foundation of our efforts to minimize     operational risk exposure.         The Operational Risk Department, an independent risk management     function, is responsible for developing and implementing a     standardized framework to identify, measure, monitor, and report     operational risks to support active risk management across     Goldman Sachs. This framework, which evolves with the changing     needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance, incorporates     analysis of internal and external operational risk events,     business environment and internal control factors, and scenario     analysis. The framework also provides regular reporting of our     operational risk exposures to our Board, risk committees and     senior management. For a further discussion of operational risk     see  Risk Factors in Part I,     Item 1A of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K.        102    Table of Contents      Recent Accounting     Developments      FIN No. 48. In June 2006, the FASB issued     FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income     Taxes  an Interpretation of FASB Statement     No. 109. FIN No. 48 requires that we     determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be     sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related     appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits     of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets     this recognition threshold, the position is measured to     determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the     financial statements. We will adopt the provisions of     FIN No. 48 in the first quarter of 2008. Adoption of     FIN No. 48 will not have a material effect on our     financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.     SFAS No. 157. In September 2006, the FASB     issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value     Measurements. SFAS No. 157 clarifies that fair     value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be     received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an     orderly transaction between market participants. Under     SFAS No. 157, fair value measurements are not adjusted     for transaction costs.         SFAS No. 157 nullifies the guidance included in     Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue     No. 02-3,     Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts     Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy     Trading and Risk Management Activities, that prohibited     the recognition of a day one gain or loss on derivative     contracts (and hybrid financial instruments measured at fair     value under SFAS No. 155) where we were unable to     verify all of the significant model inputs to observable market     data and/or verify the model to market transactions. However,     SFAS No. 157 requires that a fair value measurement     reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing     an asset or liability based on the best information available.     Assumptions include the risks inherent in a particular valuation     technique (such as a pricing model) and/or the risks inherent in     the inputs to the model.         In addition, SFAS No. 157 prohibits the recognition of     block discounts for large holdings of unrestricted     financial instruments where quoted prices are readily and     regularly available for an identical asset or liability in an     active market.         The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are to be applied     prospectively, except changes in fair value measurements that     result from the initial application of SFAS No. 157 to     existing derivative financial instruments measured under EITF     Issue     No. 02-3,     existing hybrid financial instruments measured at fair value and     block discounts, all of which are to be recorded as an     adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of     adoption.         We adopted SFAS No. 157 as of the beginning of 2007.     The transition adjustment to beginning retained earnings was a     gain of $51 million, net of tax. For the first quarter of     2007, the effect of the nullification of EITF Issue     No. 02-3     and the removal of liquidity discounts for actively traded     positions was not material. In addition, under     SFAS No. 157, gains on principal investments are     recorded in the absence of substantial third-party transactions     if market evidence is sufficient. In the first quarter of 2007,     we recorded approximately $500 million of such gains as a     result of adopting SFAS No. 157.     SFAS No. 158. In September 2006, the FASB     issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting     for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an     amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and     132-R. SFAS No. 158 requires an entity to     recognize in its statement of financial condition the funded     status of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans,     measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan     assets and the benefit obligation. SFAS No. 158 also     requires an entity to recognize changes in the funded status of     a defined benefit pension and postretirement plan within     accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, to the     extent such changes are not recognized in earnings as components     of periodic net benefit cost. SFAS No. 158 is     effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after     December 15, 2006. We adopted SFAS No. 158 as of     the end of 2007. The adjustment to accumulated other     comprehensive loss for the initial application of     SFAS No. 158 was $194 million, net of tax.        103    Table of Contents   SFAS No. 159. In February 2007, the FASB     issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for     Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which gives     entities the option to measure eligible financial assets,     financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value (i.e.,     the fair value option), on an     instrument-by-instrument     basis, that are otherwise not accounted for at fair value under     other accounting standards. The election to use the fair value     option is available at specified election dates, such as when an     entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability     or upon entering into a firm commitment. Subsequent changes in     fair value must be recorded in earnings. Additionally,     SFAS No. 159 allows for a one-time election for     existing positions upon adoption, with the transition adjustment     recorded to beginning retained earnings.         We adopted SFAS No. 159 as of the beginning of 2007     and elected to apply the fair value option to the following     financial assets and liabilities existing at the time of     adoption:                         certain unsecured short-term borrowings, consisting of all     promissory notes and commercial paper;                    certain other secured financings, primarily transfers accounted     for as financings rather than sales under SFAS No. 140     and debt raised through our William Street program;                    certain unsecured long-term borrowings, including prepaid     physical commodity transactions;                    resale and repurchase agreements;                    securities borrowed and loaned within Trading and Principal     Investments, consisting of our matched book and certain firm     financing activities;                    securities held by GS Bank USA, which were previously accounted     for as available-for-sale; and                    receivables from customers and counterparties arising from     transfers accounted for as secured loans rather than purchases     under SFAS No. 140.           The transition adjustment to beginning retained earnings related     to the adoption of SFAS No. 159 was a loss of     $45 million, net of tax, substantially all of which related     to applying the fair value option to prepaid physical commodity     transactions.         Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 159, we have     elected to apply the fair value option (i) to new positions     within the above categories, (ii) to corporate loans,     corporate loan commitments and certificates of deposit issued by     GS Bank USA and (iii) generally to investments where we     would otherwise apply the equity method of accounting. In     certain cases, we may continue to apply the equity method of     accounting to those investments which are strategic in nature or     closely related to our principal business activities, where we     have a significant degree of involvement in the cash flows or     operations of the investee, and/or where cost-benefit     considerations are less significant.         The primary reasons for electing the fair value option are     mitigating volatility in earnings from using different     measurement attributes, simplification and cost-benefit     considerations.     SOP No. 07-1     and FSP     FIN No. 46-R-7. In     June 2007, the American Institute of Certified Public     Accountants (AICPA) issued Statement of Position (SOP)     No. 07-1,     Clarification of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting     Guide Audits of Investment Companies and Accounting     by Parent Companies and Equity Method Investors for Investments     in Investment Companies.     SOP No. 07-1     clarifies when an entity may apply the provisions of the Audit     and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies (the Guide). In     May 2007, the FASB issued FSP     FIN No. 46-R-7,     Application of     FIN 46-R     to Investment Companies, which amends     FIN No. 46-R     to make permanent the temporary deferral of the application of     FIN No. 46-R     to entities within the scope of the revised Guide under     SOP No. 07-1.     FSP     FIN No. 46-R-7     is effective upon adoption of     SOP No. 07-1.     In November 2007, the FASB issued Proposed FSP     SOP No. 07-1-a,     The Effective Date of AICPA Statement of Position     07-1,     which proposes to indefinitely defer the effective date for     SOP No. 07-01     and, consequently,     FSP FIN No. 46-R-7.        104    Table of Contents   EITF Issue     No. 06-11. In     June 2007, the EITF reached consensus on Issue     No. 06-11,     Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on     Share-Based Payment Awards. EITF Issue     No. 06-11     requires that the tax benefit related to dividend equivalents     paid on restricted stock units, which are expected to vest, be     recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital. We     currently account for this tax benefit as a reduction to income     tax expense. EITF Issue     No. 06-11     is to be applied prospectively for tax benefits on dividends     declared in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007,     and we expect to adopt the provisions of EITF Issue     No. 06-11     beginning in the first quarter of 2009. We are currently     evaluating the impact of adopting EITF Issue     No. 06-11     on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.      Item 7A.

The firms internal control over     financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision     of the firms principal executive and principal financial     officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the     reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the     firms financial statements for external reporting purposes     in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.         As of the end of the firms 2007 fiscal year, management     conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the firms     internal control over financial reporting based on the framework     established in Internal Control  Integrated     Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring     Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this     assessment, management has determined that the firms     internal control over financial reporting as of     November 30, 2007 was effective.         Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies     and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that,     in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions     and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that     transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of     financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted     accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are     being made only in accordance with authorizations of management     and the directors of the firm; and provide reasonable assurance     regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized     acquisition, use or disposition of the firms assets that     could have a material effect on our financial statements.         The firms internal control over financial reporting as of     November 30, 2007 has been audited by     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public     accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on     page 108, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the     effectiveness of the firms internal control over financial     reporting as of November 30, 2007.        107    Table of Contents      Report of     Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm          To the Board of Directors and the Shareholders of       The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.:         In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in     the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,     the financial position of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and its     subsidiaries (the Company) at November 30, 2007 and     November 24, 2006, and the results of its operations and     its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period     ended November 30, 2007 in conformity with accounting     principles generally accepted in the United States of America.     In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule     listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all     material respects, the information set forth therein when read     in conjunction with the related consolidated financial     statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all     material respects, effective internal control over financial     reporting as of November 30, 2007, based on criteria     established in Internal Control  Integrated     Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring     Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The     Companys management is responsible for these financial     statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining     effective internal control over financial reporting and for its     assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over     financial reporting, included in Managements Report on     Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing on     page 107. Our responsibility is to express opinions on     these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule,     and on the Companys internal control over financial     reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our     audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company     Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards     require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable     assurance about whether the financial statements are free of     material misstatement and whether effective internal control     over financial reporting was maintained in all material     respects. Our audits of the financial statements included     examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and     disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the     accounting principles used and significant estimates made by     management, and evaluating the overall financial statement     presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial     reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal     control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a     material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design     and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the     assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other     procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We     believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our     opinions.         As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial     statements, the Company has adopted SFAS No. 157,     Fair Value Measurements and SFAS No. 159,     The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial     Liabilities.         A companys internal control over financial reporting is a     process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the     reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of     financial statements for external purposes in accordance with     generally accepted accounting principles. A companys     internal control over financial reporting includes those     policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance     of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly     reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the     company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that     transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of     financial statements in accordance with generally accepted     accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the     company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of     management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide     reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of     unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the     companys assets that could have a material effect on the     financial statements.         Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over     financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.     Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future     periods are subject to the risk that controls may become     inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree     of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.     /s/  PricewaterhouseCoopers     LLP         New York, New York       January 24, 2008        108    Table of Contents   THE GOLDMAN

In addition, the firm engages in     market-making and specialist activities on equities and options     exchanges and clears client transactions on major stock, options     and futures exchanges worldwide. In connection with the     firms merchant banking and other investing activities, the     firm makes principal investments directly and through funds that     the firm raises and manages.                Asset Management and Securities Services. The firm     provides investment advisory and financial planning services and     offers investment products (primarily through separately managed     accounts and commingled vehicles, such as mutual funds and     private investment funds) across all major asset classes to a     diverse group of institutions and individuals worldwide and     provides prime brokerage services, financing services and     securities lending services to institutional clients, including     hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds and foundations, and to     high-net-worth     individuals worldwide.             Note 2.     Significant     Accounting Policies       Basis of     Presentation         These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of     Group Inc. and all other entities in which the firm has a     controlling financial interest. All material intercompany     transactions and balances have been eliminated.         The firm determines whether it has a controlling financial     interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is     a voting interest entity, a variable interest entity (VIE) or a     qualifying     special-purpose     entity (QSPE) under generally accepted accounting principles.                     Voting Interest Entities. Voting interest entities     are entities in which (i) the total equity investment at     risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its     activities independently and (ii) the equity holders have     the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual     returns and the right to make decisions about the entitys     activities. Voting interest entities are consolidated in     accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51,     Consolidated Financial Statements, as amended. ARB     No. 51 states that the usual condition for a     controlling financial interest in an entity is ownership of a     majority voting interest. Accordingly, the firm consolidates     voting interest entities in which it has a majority voting     interest.                Variable Interest Entities. VIEs are entities that     lack one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest     entity. A controlling financial interest in a VIE is present     when an enterprise has a variable interest, or a combination of     variable interests, that will absorb a majority of the          114    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                    VIEs expected losses, receive a majority of the VIEs     expected residual returns, or both. The enterprise with a     controlling financial interest, known as the primary     beneficiary, consolidates the VIE. In accordance with Financial     Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN)     No. 46-R,     Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, the     firm consolidates VIEs for which it is the primary beneficiary.     The firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a     VIE by first performing a qualitative analysis of the VIE that     includes a review of, among other factors, its capital     structure, contractual terms, which interests create or absorb     variability, related party relationships and the design of the     VIE. Where qualitative analysis is not conclusive, the firm     performs a quantitative analysis. For purposes of allocating a     VIEs expected losses and expected residual returns to its     variable interest holders, the firm utilizes the top     down method. Under that method, the firm calculates its     share of the VIEs expected losses and expected residual     returns using the specific cash flows that would be allocated to     it, based on contractual arrangements     and/or the     firms position in the capital structure of the VIE, under     various probability-weighted scenarios.                       QSPEs. QSPEs are passive entities that are commonly     used in mortgage and other securitization transactions.     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140,     Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets     and Extinguishments of Liabilities, sets forth the     criteria an entity must satisfy to be a QSPE. These criteria     include the types of assets a QSPE may hold, limits on asset     sales, the use of derivatives and financial guarantees, and the     level of discretion a servicer may exercise in attempting to     collect receivables. These criteria may require management to     make judgments about complex matters, including whether a     derivative is considered passive and the degree of discretion a     servicer may exercise. In accordance with SFAS No. 140     and     FIN No. 46-R,     the firm does not consolidate QSPEs.                Equity-Method Investments. When the firm does not     have a controlling financial interest in an entity but exerts     significant influence over the entitys operating and     financial policies (generally defined as owning a voting     interest of 20% to 50%) and has an investment in common stock or     in-substance     common stock, the firm accounts for its investment in accordance     with the equity method of accounting prescribed by Accounting     Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 18, The Equity     Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. For     investments acquired subsequent to the adoption of     SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for     Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, the firm     generally has elected to apply the fair value option in     accounting for such investments. See  Recent     Accounting Developments for a discussion of the     firms adoption of SFAS No. 159.                Other. If the firm does not consolidate an entity or     apply the equity method of accounting, the firm accounts for its     investment at fair value. The firm also has formed numerous     nonconsolidated investment funds with third-party investors that     are typically organized as limited partnerships. The firm acts     as general partner for these funds and generally does not hold a     majority of the economic interests in these funds. The firm has     generally provided the third-party investors with rights to     terminate the funds or to remove the firm as the general     partner. These fund investments are included in Financial     instruments owned, at fair value in the consolidated     statements of financial condition.           Unless otherwise stated herein, all references to November 2007,     November 2006 and November 2005 refer to the firms fiscal     years ended, or the dates, as the context requires,     November 30, 2007, November 24, 2006 and     November 25, 2005, respectively. Certain reclassifications     have been made to previously reported amounts to conform to the     current presentation.        115    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     Use of     Estimates         These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in     accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that     require management to make certain estimates and assumptions.     The most important of these estimates and assumptions relate to     fair value measurements, the accounting for goodwill and     identifiable intangible assets and the provision for potential     losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings     and tax audits. Although these and other estimates and     assumptions are based on the best available information, actual     results could be materially different from these estimates.     Revenue     Recognition     Investment Banking. Underwriting revenues and fees     from mergers and acquisitions and other financial advisory     assignments are recognized in the consolidated statements of     earnings when the services related to the underlying transaction     are completed under the terms of the engagement. Expenses     associated with such transactions are deferred until the related     revenue is recognized or the engagement is otherwise concluded.     Underwriting revenues are presented net of related expenses.     Expenses associated with financial advisory transactions are     recorded as     non-compensation     expenses, net of client reimbursements.     Financial Instruments. Total financial     instruments owned, at fair value and Financial     instruments sold, but not yet purchased, at fair value are     reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition     on a trade-date basis. Related unrealized gains or losses are     generally recognized in Trading and principal     investments in the consolidated statements of earnings.     The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that     would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a     liability in an orderly transaction between market participants     at the measurement date (the exit price). Instruments that the     firm owns (long positions) are marked to bid prices, and     instruments that the firm has sold, but not yet purchased (short     positions), are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements     are not adjusted for transaction costs.         The firm adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value     Measurements, as of the beginning of 2007.     SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that     prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure     fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to     unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets     or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest     priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The     three levels of the fair value hierarchy under     SFAS No. 157 are described below:     Basis of Fair Value     Measurement                      Level 1            Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible     at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or     liabilities;            Level 2            Quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial     instruments for which all significant inputs are observable,     either directly or indirectly;            Level 3            Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both     significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.           A financial instruments level within the fair value     hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is     significant to the fair value measurement. See      Recent Accounting Developments for a     discussion of the impact of adopting SFAS No. 157.        116    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         In determining fair value, the firm separates its     Financial instruments owned, at fair value and its     Financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased, at fair     value into two categories: cash instruments and derivative     contracts.                     Cash Instruments. The firms cash instruments     are generally classified within level 1 or level 2 of     the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted     market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative     pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.     The types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in     active markets include most U.S. government and agency     securities, many other sovereign government obligations, active     listed equities and most money market securities. Such     instruments are generally classified within level 1 of the     fair value hierarchy. The firm does not adjust the quoted price     for such instruments, even in situations where the firm holds a     large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted     price.           The types of instruments valued based on quoted prices in     markets that are not active, broker or dealer quotations, or     alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price     transparency include most investment-grade and high-yield     corporate bonds, most mortgage products, certain corporate bank     and bridge loans, less liquid listed equities, state, municipal     and provincial obligations, most physical commodities and     certain loan commitments. Such instruments are generally     classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.         Certain cash instruments are classified within level 3 of     the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and     therefore have little or no price transparency. Such instruments     include private equity and real estate fund investments, certain     corporate bank and bridge loans, less liquid mortgage whole     loans, distressed debt instruments and certain loan commitments.     The transaction price is initially used as the best estimate of     fair value. Accordingly, when a pricing model is used to value     such an instrument, the model is adjusted so that the model     value at inception equals the transaction price. This valuation     is adjusted only when changes to inputs and assumptions are     corroborated by evidence such as transactions in similar     instruments, completed or pending     third-party     transactions in the underlying investment or comparable     entities, subsequent rounds of financing, recapitalizations and     other transactions across the capital structure, offerings in     the equity or debt capital markets, and changes in financial     ratios or cash flows.         For positions that are not traded in active markets or are     subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to     reflect illiquidity     and/or     non-transferability, and such adjustments are generally based on     available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence,     managements best estimate is used.                     Derivative Contracts. Derivative contracts can be     exchange-traded or over-the-counter (OTC). Exchange-traded     derivatives typically fall within level 1 or level 2     of the fair value hierarchy depending on whether they are deemed     to be actively traded or not. The firm generally values     exchange-traded derivatives within portfolios using models which     calibrate to market clearing levels and eliminate timing     differences between the closing price of the exchange-traded     derivatives and their underlying cash instruments. In such     cases,     exchange-traded     derivatives are classified within level 2 of the fair value     hierarchy.           OTC derivatives are valued using market transactions and other     market evidence whenever possible, including market-based inputs     to models, model calibration to market clearing transactions,     broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with     reasonable levels of price transparency. Where models are used,     the selection of a particular model to value an OTC derivative     depends upon the contractual terms of, and specific risks     inherent in, the instrument as well as the availability of     pricing information in the market. The firm generally        117    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         uses similar models to value similar instruments. Valuation     models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms,     market prices, yield curves, credit curves, measures of     volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs.     For OTC derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as     generic forwards, swaps and options, model inputs can generally     be verified and model selection does not involve significant     management judgment. Such instruments are typically classified     within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.         Certain OTC derivatives trade in less liquid markets with     limited pricing information, and the determination of fair value     for these derivatives is inherently more difficult. Such     instruments are classified within level 3 of the fair value     hierarchy. Where the firm does not have corroborating market     evidence to support significant model inputs and cannot verify     the model to market transactions, transaction price is initially     used as the best estimate of fair value. Accordingly, when a     pricing model is used to value such an instrument, the model is     adjusted so that the model value at inception equals the     transaction price. The valuations of these less liquid OTC     derivatives are typically based on level 1     and/or     level 2 inputs that can be observed in the market, as well     as unobservable level 3 inputs. Subsequent to initial     recognition, the firm updates the level 1 and level 2     inputs to reflect observable market changes, with resulting     gains and losses reflected within level 3. Level 3     inputs are only changed when corroborated by evidence such as     similar market transactions, third-party pricing services     and/or     broker or dealer quotations, or other empirical market data. In     circumstances where the firm cannot verify the model value to     market transactions, it is possible that a different valuation     model could produce a materially different estimate of fair     value.         When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors     such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads and credit considerations.     Such adjustments are generally based on available market     evidence. In the absence of such evidence, managements     best estimate is used.     Collateralized Agreements and     Financings. Collateralized agreements consist of resale     agreements and securities borrowed. Collateralized financings     consist of repurchase agreements, securities loaned and other     secured financings. Interest on collateralized agreements and     collateralized financings is recognized in Interest     income or Interest expense, respectively, over     the life of the transaction.                     Resale and Repurchase Agreements. Financial     instruments purchased under agreements to resell and financial     instruments sold under agreements to repurchase, principally     U.S. government, federal agency and investment-grade     sovereign obligations, represent collateralized financing     transactions. The firm receives financial instruments purchased     under agreements to resell, makes delivery of financial     instruments sold under agreements to repurchase, monitors the     market value of these financial instruments on a daily basis and     delivers or obtains additional collateral as appropriate. Resale     and repurchase agreements are carried in the consolidated     statements of financial condition at fair value as allowed by     SFAS No. 159. Prior to the adoption of     SFAS No. 159, these transactions were recorded at     contractual amounts plus accrued interest. Resale and repurchase     agreements are generally valued based on inputs with reasonable     levels of price transparency and are classified within     level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Resale and repurchase     agreements are presented on a     net-by-counterparty     basis when the requirements of FIN No. 41,     Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Repurchase and     Reverse Repurchase Agreements, or FIN No. 39,     Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts,     are satisfied.                Securities Borrowed and Loaned. Securities borrowed     and loaned are generally collateralized by cash, securities or     letters of credit. The firm receives securities borrowed, makes     delivery of securities loaned, monitors the market value of     securities borrowed and          118    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                    loaned, and delivers or obtains additional collateral as     appropriate. Securities borrowed and loaned within Securities     Services, relating to both customer activities and, to a lesser     extent, certain firm financing activities, are recorded based on     the amount of cash collateral advanced or received plus accrued     interest. As these arrangements are generally transacted     on-demand, they exhibit little, if any, sensitivity to changes     in interest rates. Securities borrowed and loaned within Trading     and Principal Investments, which are related to the firms     matched book and certain firm financing activities, are recorded     at fair value as allowed by SFAS No. 159. Prior to the     adoption of SFAS No. 159, these transactions were     recorded based on the amount of cash collateral advanced or     received plus accrued interest. These securities borrowed and     loaned transactions are generally valued based on inputs with     reasonable levels of price transparency and are classified     within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.                       Other Secured Financings. In addition to repurchase     agreements and securities loaned, the firm funds assets through     the use of other secured financing arrangements and pledges     financial instruments and other assets as collateral in these     transactions. SFAS No. 159 has been adopted for those     financings for which the use of fair value would eliminate     non-economic     volatility in earnings from using different measurement     attributes (i.e., assets recorded at fair value with related     nonrecourse financings recorded based on the amount of cash     received plus accrued interest), primarily transfers accounted     for as financings rather than sales under SFAS No. 140     and debt raised through the firms William Street program.     These other secured financing transactions are generally valued     based on inputs with reasonable levels of price transparency and     are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.     Other secured financings that are not recorded at fair value are     recorded based on the amount of cash received plus accrued     interest. See Note 3 for further information regarding     other secured financings.       Hybrid Financial Instruments. Hybrid financial     instruments are instruments that contain bifurcatable embedded     derivatives under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for     Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and do not     require settlement by physical delivery of non-financial assets     (e.g., physical commodities). If the firm elects to bifurcate     the embedded derivative, it is accounted for at fair value and     the host contract is accounted for at amortized cost, adjusted     for the effective portion of any fair value hedge accounting     relationships. If the firm does not elect to bifurcate, the     entire hybrid financial instrument is accounted for at fair     value under SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain     Hybrid Financial      Instruments  an amendment of FASB Statements     No. 133 and 140. The primary reasons for electing the     fair value option for hybrid financial instruments are     mitigating volatility in earnings from using different     measurement attributes, simplification and cost-benefit     considerations. See Notes 3 and 4 for additional     information about hybrid financial instruments.     Transfers of Financial Assets. In general, transfers     of financial assets are accounted for as sales under     SFAS No. 140 when the firm has relinquished control     over the transferred assets. For transfers accounted for as     sales, any related gains or losses are recognized in net     revenues. Transfers that are not accounted for as sales are     accounted for as collateralized financings, with the related     interest expense recognized in net revenues over the life of the     transaction.     Power Generation. Power generation revenues     associated with the firms consolidated power generation     facilities are included in Trading and principal     investments in the consolidated statements of earnings     when power is delivered. These revenues were $421 million,     $553 million and $496 million for the years ended     November 2007, November 2006 and November 2005, respectively.     Direct employee costs associated with the firms     consolidated power generation facilities of $97 million,     $78 million and $70 million for the years ended     November 2007, November 2006 and November 2005,     respectively, are included in Compensation and     benefits. The other direct costs associated with        119    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         these power generation facilities and related contractual assets     are included in Cost of power generation.     Commissions. Commission revenues from executing and     clearing client transactions on stock, options and futures     markets worldwide are recognized in Trading and principal     investments in the consolidated statements of earnings on     a trade-date basis.     Insurance Activities. Revenues from variable annuity     and life insurance contracts, and from providing reinsurance of     such contracts, generally consist of fees assessed on contract     holder account balances for mortality charges, policy     administration and surrender charges. These fees are recognized     within Trading and principal investments in the     consolidated statements of earnings in the period that services     are provided.         Interest credited to variable annuity and life insurance account     balances and changes in reserves are recognized in Other     expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.         Premiums earned for providing property catastrophe reinsurance     are recognized within Trading and principal     investments in the consolidated statements of earnings     over the coverage period, net of premiums ceded for the cost of     reinsurance. Expenses for liabilities related to property     catastrophe reinsurance claims, including estimates of claims     that have been incurred but not reported, are recognized within     Other expenses in the consolidated statements of     earnings.     Merchant Banking Overrides. The firm is entitled to     receive merchant banking overrides (i.e., an increased share of     a funds income and gains) when the return on the     funds investments exceeds certain threshold returns.     Overrides are based on investment performance over the life of     each merchant banking fund, and future investment     underperformance may require amounts of override previously     distributed to the firm to be returned to the funds.     Accordingly, overrides are recognized in the consolidated     statements of earnings only when all material contingencies have     been resolved. Overrides are included in Trading and     principal investments in the consolidated statements of     earnings.     Asset Management. Management fees are recognized     over the period that the related service is provided based upon     average net asset values. In certain circumstances, the firm is     also entitled to receive incentive fees based on a percentage of     a funds return or when the return on assets under     management exceeds specified benchmark returns or other     performance targets. Incentive fees are generally based on     investment performance over a     12-month     period and are subject to adjustment prior to the end of the     measurement period. Accordingly, incentive fees are recognized     in the consolidated statements of earnings when the measurement     period ends. Asset management fees and incentive fees are     included in Asset management and securities services     in the consolidated statements of earnings.     Share-Based     Compensation         In the first quarter of 2006, the firm adopted     SFAS No. 123-R,     Share-Based Payment, which is a revision to     SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based     Compensation.     SFAS No. 123-R     focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an     entity obtains employee services in exchange for share-based     payments. Under     SFAS No. 123-R,     the cost of employee services received in exchange for a     share-based award is generally measured based on the grant-date     fair value of the award. Under     SFAS No. 123-R,     share-based awards that do not require future service (i.e.,     vested awards, including awards granted to retirement-eligible     employees) are expensed immediately. Share-based employee awards     that require future service are amortized over the relevant     service period. The firm adopted     SFAS No. 123-R     under the modified prospective adoption method. Under that     method of adoption, the provisions of     SFAS No. 123-R     are generally applied only to share-based awards granted     subsequent        120    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         to adoption. Share-based awards held by employees that were     retirement-eligible on the date of adoption of     SFAS No. 123-R     must continue to be amortized over the stated service period of     the award (and accelerated if the employee actually retires).     SFAS No. 123-R     requires expected forfeitures to be included in determining     share-based employee compensation expense.         The firm pays cash dividend equivalents on outstanding     restricted stock units. Dividend equivalents paid on restricted     stock units accounted for under SFAS No. 123 and     SFAS No. 123-R     are charged to retained earnings.     SFAS No. 123-R     requires dividend equivalents paid on restricted stock units     expected to be forfeited to be included in compensation expense.     Prior to the adoption of     SFAS No. 123-R,     dividend equivalents paid on restricted stock units that were     later forfeited by employees were reclassified to compensation     expense from retained earnings. The tax benefit related to     dividend equivalents paid on restricted stock units is accounted     for as a reduction of income tax expense (see      Recent Accounting Developments for a     discussion of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue     No. 06-11,     Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on     Share-Based Payment Awards).         In certain cases, primarily related to the death of an employee     or conflicted employment (as outlined in the applicable award     agreements), the firm may cash settle share-based compensation     awards. For awards accounted for as equity instruments,     Additional paid-in capital is adjusted to the extent     of the difference between the current value of the award and the     grant-date value of the award.     Goodwill         Goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair     value of identifiable net assets at acquisition date. In     accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other     Intangible Assets, goodwill is tested at least annually     for impairment. An impairment loss is triggered if the estimated     fair value of an operating segment, which is a component one     level below the firms three business segments, is less     than its estimated net book value. Such loss is calculated as     the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and     its carrying value.     Identifiable     Intangible Assets         Identifiable intangible assets, which consist primarily of     customer lists, specialist rights and the value of business     acquired (VOBA) and deferred acquisition costs (DAC) in the     firms insurance subsidiaries, are amortized over their     estimated useful lives in accordance with     SFAS No. 142. Identifiable intangible assets are     tested for potential impairment whenever events or changes in     circumstances suggest that an assets or asset groups     carrying value may not be fully recoverable in accordance with     SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or     Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. An impairment loss,     calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value     and the carrying value of an asset or asset group, is recognized     if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to     the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying     value.     Property,     Leasehold Improvements and Equipment         Property, leasehold improvements and equipment, net of     accumulated depreciation and amortization, are included in     Other assets in the consolidated statements of     financial condition.         Substantially all property and equipment are depreciated on a     straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset. Leasehold     improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the     useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease,     whichever is shorter. Certain costs of software developed or     obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a     straight-line basis over the useful life of the software.        121    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         Property, leasehold improvements and equipment are tested for     potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances     suggest that an assets or asset groups carrying     value may not be fully recoverable in accordance with     SFAS No. 144. An impairment loss, calculated as the     difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying     value of an asset or asset group, is recognized if the sum of     the expected undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or     asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value.         The firms operating leases include space held in excess of     current requirements. Rent expense relating to space held for     growth is included in Occupancy in the consolidated     statements of earnings. In accordance with     SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated     with Exit or Disposal Activities, the firm records a     liability, based on the fair value of the remaining lease     rentals reduced by any potential or existing sublease rentals,     for leases where the firm has ceased using the space and     management has concluded that the firm will not derive any     future economic benefits. Costs to terminate a lease before the     end of its term are recognized and measured at fair value upon     termination.     Foreign     Currency Translation         Assets and liabilities denominated in     non-U.S. currencies     are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the date of     the consolidated statement of financial condition, and revenues     and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange for the     year. Gains or losses on translation of the financial statements     of a     non-U.S. operation,     when the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar,     are included, net of hedges and taxes, in the consolidated     statements of comprehensive income. The firm seeks to reduce its     net investment exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange     rates through the use of foreign currency forward contracts and     foreign currency-denominated debt. For foreign currency forward     contracts, hedge effectiveness is assessed based on changes in     forward exchange rates; accordingly, forward points are     reflected as a component of the currency translation adjustment     in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. For     foreign     currency-denominated     debt, hedge effectiveness is assessed based on changes in spot     rates. Foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses on     transactions in nonfunctional currencies are included in the     consolidated statements of earnings.     Income     Taxes         Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary     differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of the     firms assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are     established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that     more likely than not will be realized. The firms tax     assets and liabilities are presented as a component of     Other assets and Other liabilities and accrued     expenses, respectively, in the consolidated statements of     financial condition. Tax provisions are computed in accordance     with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income     Taxes. Contingent liabilities related to income taxes are     recorded when the criteria for loss recognition under     SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies,     as amended, have been met (see  Recent     Accounting Developments below for a discussion of the     impact of FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty     in Income Taxes  an Interpretation of FASB     Statement No. 109, on SFAS No. 109).     Earnings Per     Common Share (EPS)         Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net earnings applicable to     common shareholders by the weighted average number of common     shares outstanding. Common shares outstanding includes common     stock and restricted stock units for which no future service is     required as a condition to the delivery of the underlying common     stock. Diluted EPS includes the determinants of basic EPS and,     in addition, reflects the dilutive effect of the common stock     deliverable pursuant to stock options and to        122    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         restricted stock units for which future service is required as a     condition to the delivery of the underlying common stock.     Cash and Cash     Equivalents         The firm defines cash equivalents as highly liquid overnight     deposits held in the ordinary course of business.     Recent     Accounting Developments     FIN No. 48. In June 2006, the FASB issued     FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income     Taxes  an Interpretation of FASB Statement     No. 109. FIN No. 48 requires that the firm     determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be     sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related     appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits     of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets     this recognition threshold, the position is measured to     determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the     financial statements. The firm will adopt the provisions of     FIN No. 48 in the first quarter of 2008. Adoption of     FIN No. 48 will not have a material effect on the     firms financial condition, results of operations or cash     flows.     SFAS No. 157. In September 2006, the FASB     issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value     Measurements. SFAS No. 157 clarifies that fair     value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be     received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an     orderly transaction between market participants. Under     SFAS No. 157, fair value measurements are not adjusted     for transaction costs.         SFAS No. 157 nullifies the guidance included in EITF     Issue     No. 02-3,     Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts     Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy     Trading and Risk Management Activities, that prohibited     the recognition of a day one gain or loss on derivative     contracts (and hybrid financial instruments measured at fair     value under SFAS No. 155) where the firm was unable to     verify all of the significant model inputs to observable market     data and/or     verify the model to market transactions. However,     SFAS No. 157 requires that a fair value measurement     reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing     an asset or liability based on the best information available.     Assumptions include the risks inherent in a particular valuation     technique (such as a pricing model)     and/or the     risks inherent in the inputs to the model.         In addition, SFAS No. 157 prohibits the recognition of     block discounts for large holdings of unrestricted     financial instruments where quoted prices are readily and     regularly available for an identical asset or liability in an     active market.         The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are to be applied     prospectively, except changes in fair value measurements that     result from the initial application of SFAS No. 157 to     existing derivative financial instruments measured under EITF     Issue     No. 02-3,     existing hybrid financial instruments measured at fair value and     block discounts, all of which are to be recorded as an     adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of     adoption.         The firm adopted SFAS No. 157 as of the beginning of     2007. The transition adjustment to beginning retained earnings     was a gain of $51 million, net of tax. For the first     quarter of 2007, the effect of the nullification of EITF Issue     No. 02-3     and the removal of liquidity discounts for actively traded     positions was not material. In addition, under     SFAS No. 157, gains on principal investments are     recorded in the absence of substantial third-party transactions     if market evidence is sufficient. In the first quarter of 2007,     the firm recorded approximately $500 million of such gains     as a result of adopting SFAS No. 157.        123    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     SFAS No. 158. In September 2006, the FASB     issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting     for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an     amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and     132-R. SFAS No. 158 requires an entity to     recognize in its statement of financial condition the funded     status of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans,     measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan     assets and the benefit obligation. SFAS No. 158 also     requires an entity to recognize changes in the funded status of     a defined benefit pension and postretirement plan within     accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, to the     extent such changes are not recognized in earnings as components     of periodic net benefit cost. SFAS No. 158 is     effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after     December 15, 2006. The firm adopted SFAS No. 158     as of the end of 2007. The adjustment to accumulated other     comprehensive loss for the initial application of     SFAS No. 158 was $194 million, net of tax.     SFAS No. 159. In February 2007, the FASB     issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for     Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which gives     entities the option to measure eligible financial assets,     financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value (i.e.,     the fair value option), on an     instrument-by-instrument     basis, that are otherwise not accounted for at fair value under     other accounting standards. The election to use the fair value     option is available at specified election dates, such as when an     entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability     or upon entering into a firm commitment. Subsequent changes in     fair value must be recorded in earnings. Additionally,     SFAS No. 159 allows for a one-time election for     existing positions upon adoption, with the transition adjustment     recorded to beginning retained earnings.         The firm adopted SFAS No. 159 as of the beginning of     2007 and elected to apply the fair value option to the following     financial assets and liabilities existing at the time of     adoption:                         certain unsecured short-term borrowings, consisting of all     promissory notes and commercial paper;                    certain other secured financings, primarily transfers accounted     for as financings rather than sales under SFAS No. 140     and debt raised through the firms William Street program;                    certain unsecured long-term borrowings, including prepaid     physical commodity transactions;                    resale and repurchase agreements;                    securities borrowed and loaned within Trading and Principal     Investments, consisting of the firms matched book and     certain firm financing activities;                    securities held by Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank USA), which     were previously accounted for as available-for-sale; and                    receivables from customers and counterparties arising from     transfers accounted for as secured loans rather than purchases     under SFAS No. 140.           The transition adjustment to beginning retained earnings related     to the adoption of SFAS No. 159 was a loss of     $45 million, net of tax, substantially all of which related     to applying the fair value option to prepaid physical commodity     transactions.         Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 159, the firm     has elected to apply the fair value option (i) to new     positions within the above categories, (ii) to corporate     loans, corporate loan commitments and certificates of deposit     issued by GS Bank USA and (iii) generally to investments     where the firm would otherwise apply the equity method of     accounting. In certain cases, the firm may continue to apply the     equity method of accounting to those investments which are     strategic in nature or closely related to the firms     principal business activities, where the firm has a significant     degree of involvement in the cash flows or operations of the     investee,     and/or where     cost-benefit considerations are less significant.        124    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         The primary reasons for electing the fair value option are     mitigating volatility in earnings from using different     measurement attributes, simplification and cost-benefit     considerations.     SOP No. 07-1     and FSP     FIN No. 46-R-7. In     June 2007, the American Institute of Certified Public     Accountants (AICPA) issued Statement of Position (SOP)     No. 07-1,     Clarification of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting     Guide Audits of Investment Companies and Accounting     by Parent Companies and Equity Method Investors for Investments     in Investment Companies.     SOP No. 07-1     clarifies when an entity may apply the provisions of the Audit     and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies (the Guide). In     May 2007, the FASB issued FSP     FIN No. 46-R-7,     Application of     FIN 46-R     to Investment Companies, which amends     FIN No. 46-R     to make permanent the temporary deferral of the application of     FIN No. 46-R     to entities within the scope of the revised Guide under     SOP No. 07-1.     FSP     FIN No. 46-R-7     is effective upon adoption of     SOP No. 07-1.     In November 2007, the FASB issued Proposed FSP     SOP No. 07-1-a,     The Effective Date of AICPA Statement of Position     07-1,     which proposes to indefinitely defer the effective date for     SOP No. 07-01     and, consequently, FSP     FIN No. 46-R-7.     EITF Issue     No. 06-11. In     June 2007, the EITF reached consensus on Issue     No. 06-11,     Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on     Share-Based Payment Awards. EITF Issue     No. 06-11     requires that the tax benefit related to dividend equivalents     paid on restricted stock units, which are expected to vest, be     recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital. The firm     currently accounts for this tax benefit as a reduction to income     tax expense. EITF Issue     No. 06-11     is to be applied prospectively for tax benefits on dividends     declared in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007,     and the firm expects to adopt the provisions of EITF Issue     No. 06-11     beginning in the first quarter of 2009. The firm is currently     evaluating the impact of adopting EITF Issue     No. 06-11     on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.        125    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)        Note 3.

As required by SFAS No. 157, assets and     liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest     level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.         Total financial assets at fair value classified within     level 3 were $69.15 billion or 6% of Total     assets on the consolidated statement of financial     condition as of November 2007. This includes $14.44 billion     of financial assets at fair value classified within level 3     for which the firm does not bear        126    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         economic exposure.

The table reflects     gains and losses for the full year for all financial assets and     liabilities categorized as level 3 as of November 2007. The     table does not include gains or losses that were reported in     level 3 in prior periods for financial assets and     liabilities that were transferred out of level 3 prior to     November 2007. As reflected in the table below, the net     unrealized gain on level 3 financial assets and liabilities     was $1.31 billion for the year ended November 2007. This     net unrealized gain should be considered in the context of the     factors discussed below.     Cash     Instruments         The net unrealized loss on level 3 cash instruments was     $2.59 billion for the year ended November 2007 (which     included $2.29 billion of unrealized losses on assets and     $294 million of unrealized losses on liabilities),     primarily consisting of unrealized losses on subprime     residential mortgage loans and securities as well as     non-investment-grade loan commitments, partially offset by     unrealized gains on principal investments. Level 3 cash     instruments are frequently hedged with instruments classified in     level 1 and level 2, and accordingly, gains or losses     that have been reported in level 3 are frequently offset by     gains or losses attributable to instruments classified in     level 1 or level 2 or by gains or losses on derivative     contracts classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.     Derivative     Contracts         The net unrealized gain on level 3 derivative contracts was     $4.54 billion for the year ended November 2007.     Level 3 gains and losses on derivative contracts should be     considered in the context of the following factors:                         A derivative contract with level 1 and/or level 2     inputs is classified as a level 3 financial instrument in     its entirety if it has at least one significant level 3     input.                    If there is one significant level 3 input, the entire gain     or loss from adjusting only observable inputs (i.e.,     level 1 and level 2) is still classified as     level 3.                    Gains or losses that have been reported in level 3     resulting from changes in level 1 or level 2 inputs     are frequently offset by gains or losses attributable to     instruments classified in level 1 or level 2 or by     cash instruments reported in level 3 of the fair value     hierarchy.           The unrealized gains referenced above principally resulted from     changes in level 2 inputs, as opposed to changes in     level 3 inputs.        129    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                                                                                               Level 3 Financial Assets and     Liabilities                  Year Ended November 2007                 Cash            Cash            Derivative            Unsecured            Unsecured                              Instruments -            Instruments -            Contracts -            Short-Term            Long-Term            Total                   Assets             Liabilities             Net             Borrowings             Borrowings             Gains                      (in millions)                   Balance, beginning of year            $       29,905               $       (223       )           $       580               $       (3,253       )           $       (135       )               N/A              Realized gains/(losses)                2,232        (1)               (9       ) (2)               1,713        (2)               167        (2)               (7       ) (2)           $       4,096              Unrealized gains/(losses) relating to instruments still held at     the reporting date                (2,292       ) (1)               (294       ) (2)               4,543        (2)(3)               (666       ) (2)               22        (2)           $       1,313              Purchases, issuances and settlements                22,561                   (30       )               (1,365       )               (1,559       )               (567       )               N/A              Transfers in and/or out of level 3                1,045                   2                   (3,415       )               1,040                   (80       )               N/A                                                                                                                    Balance, end of period            $       53,451               $       (554       )           $       2,056               $       (4,271       )           $       (767       )               N/A                                                                                                                              (1)   The aggregate amounts include     approximately $(1.77) billion and $1.71 billion     reported in Trading and principal investments and     Interest income, respectively, in the consolidated     statements of earnings.

During 2007, the firm recognized     gains of $216 million attributable to the observable impact     of the markets widening of the firms own credit     spread on liabilities for which the fair value option was     elected. The firm calculates the impact of its own credit spread     on liabilities carried at fair value by discounting future cash     flows at a rate which incorporates the firms observable     credit spreads. As of November 2007, the difference between the     fair value and the aggregate contractual principal amount of     both long-term receivables and long-term debt instruments     (principal and non-principal protected) for which the fair value     option was elected was not material.         The following table sets forth the gains and (losses) included     in earnings for the year ended November 2007 related to     financial assets and liabilities for which the firm has elected     to apply the fair value option under SFAS No. 155 and     SFAS No. 159. The table does not reflect the impact to     the firms earnings of adopting SFAS No. 159     because a significant amount of these gains and losses would     have also been recognized under previously issued generally     accepted accounting principles. In addition, instruments for     which the firm has elected the fair value option are     economically hedged with instruments accounted for at fair value     under other generally accepted accounting principles that are     not reflected in the table below.

Changes in the fair value of the secured     financings are equally offset by changes in the fair value of     the related mortgage whole loans, which are included within the     firms Financial instruments owned, at fair     value in the consolidated statement of financial condition.                (2)        Consists of investments where the firm would otherwise have     applied the equity method of accounting as well as securities     held in GS Bank USA (previously accounted for as     available-for-sale).                (3)        Consists of resale and repurchase agreements and securities     borrowed and loaned within Trading and Principal Investments and     certificates of deposit issued by GS Bank USA.                (4)        Reported within Trading and principal investments     within the consolidated statements of earnings. The amounts     exclude contractual interest, which is included in     Interest Income and Interest Expense,     for all instruments other than hybrid financial instruments.          131    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     Credit     Concentrations         Credit concentrations may arise from trading, investing,     underwriting and securities borrowing activities and may be     impacted by changes in economic, industry or political factors.     The firm seeks to mitigate credit risk by actively monitoring     exposures and obtaining collateral as deemed appropriate. While     the firms activities expose it to many different     industries and counterparties, the firm routinely executes a     high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial     services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial     banks, investment funds and other institutional clients,     resulting in significant credit concentration with respect to     this industry. In the ordinary course of business, the firm may     also be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a     particular counterparty, borrower or issuer.         As of November 2007 and November 2006, the firm held     $45.75 billion (4% of total assets) and $46.20 billion     (6% of total assets), respectively, of U.S. government and     federal agency obligations (including securities guaranteed by     the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home     Loan Mortgage Corporation) included in Financial     instruments owned, at fair value and Cash and     securities segregated for regulatory and other purposes in     the consolidated statements of financial condition. As of     November 2007 and November 2006, the firm held     $31.65 billion (3% of total assets) and $23.64 billion     (3% of total assets), respectively, of other sovereign     obligations, principally consisting of securities issued by the     governments of Japan and the United Kingdom. In addition, as of     November 2007 and November 2006, $144.92 billion and     $104.76 billion of the firms financial instruments     purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed,     respectively, were collateralized by U.S. government and federal     agency obligations. As of November 2007 and 2006,     $41.26 billion and $38.22 billion of the firms     financial instruments purchased under agreements to resell and     securities borrowed, respectively, were collateralized by other     sovereign obligations. As of November 2007 and November 2006,     the firm did not have credit exposure to any other counterparty     that exceeded 2% of the firms total assets.     Derivative     Activities         Derivative contracts are instruments, such as futures, forwards,     swaps or option contracts, that derive their value from     underlying assets, indices, reference rates or a combination of     these factors. Derivative instruments may be privately     negotiated contracts, which are often referred to as OTC     derivatives, or they may be listed and traded on an exchange.     Derivatives may involve future commitments to purchase or sell     financial instruments or commodities, or to exchange currency or     interest payment streams. The amounts exchanged are based on the     specific terms of the contract with reference to specified     rates, securities, commodities, currencies or indices.         Certain cash instruments, such as mortgage-backed securities,     interest-only and principal-only obligations, and indexed debt     instruments, are not considered derivatives even though their     values or contractually required cash flows are derived from the     price of some other security or index. However, certain     commodity-related contracts are included in the firms     derivatives disclosure, as these contracts may be settled in     cash or the assets to be delivered under the contract are     readily convertible into cash.         The firm enters into derivative transactions to facilitate     client transactions, to take proprietary positions and as a     means of risk management. Risk exposures are managed through     diversification, by controlling position sizes and by entering     into offsetting positions. For example, the firm may manage the     risk related to a portfolio of common stock by entering into an     offsetting position in a related equity-index futures contract.        132    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         The firm applies hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133     to certain derivative contracts. The firm uses these derivatives     to manage certain interest rate and currency exposures,     including the firms net investment in     non-U.S.     operations. The firm designates certain interest rate swap     contracts as fair value hedges. These interest rate swap     contracts hedge changes in the relevant benchmark interest rate     (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)), effectively     converting a substantial portion of the firms unsecured     long-term and certain unsecured short-term borrowings into     floating rate obligations. See Note 2 for information     regarding the firms accounting policy for foreign currency     forward contracts used to hedge its net investment in     non-U.S.     operations.         The firm applies a long-haul method to substantially all of its     hedge accounting relationships to perform an ongoing assessment     of the effectiveness of these relationships in achieving     offsetting changes in fair value or offsetting cash flows     attributable to the risk being hedged. The firm utilizes a     dollar-offset method, which compares the change in the fair     value of the hedging instrument to the change in the fair value     of the hedged item, excluding the effect of the passage of time,     to prospectively and retrospectively assess hedge effectiveness.     The firms prospective dollar-offset assessment utilizes     scenario analyses to test hedge effectiveness via simulations of     numerous parallel and slope shifts of the relevant yield curve.     Parallel shifts change the interest rate of all maturities by     identical amounts. Slope shifts change the curvature of the     yield curve. For both the prospective assessment, in response to     each of the simulated yield curve shifts, and the retrospective     assessment, a hedging relationship is deemed to be effective if     the fair value of the hedging instrument and the hedged item     change inversely within a range of 80% to 125%.         For fair value hedges, gains or losses on derivative     transactions are recognized in Interest expense in     the consolidated statements of earnings. The change in fair     value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged     is reported as an adjustment to its carrying value and is     subsequently amortized into interest expense over its remaining     life. Gains or losses related to hedge ineffectiveness for all     hedges are generally included in Interest expense.     These gains or losses and the component of gains or losses on     derivative transactions excluded from the assessment of hedge     effectiveness (e.g., the effect of the passage of time on fair     value hedges of the firms borrowings) were not material to     the firms results of operations for the years ended     November 2007, November 2006 and November 2005.     Gains and losses on derivatives used for trading purposes are     included in Trading and principal investments in the     consolidated statements of earnings.         The fair value of the firms derivative contracts is     reflected net of cash paid or received pursuant to credit     support agreements and is reported on a     net-by-counterparty     basis in the firms consolidated statements of financial     condition when management believes a legal right of setoff     exists under an enforceable netting agreement. The fair value of     derivative financial instruments, computed in accordance with     the firms netting policy, is set forth below:                                                                       As of November                 2007           2006                  Assets             Liabilities             Assets             Liabilities                      (in millions)                   Forward settlement contracts            $       17,447               $       20,799               $       11,751               $       14,335              Swap agreements                54,428                   39,271                   28,012                   22,471              Option contracts                33,739                   39,308                   27,780                   28,690                                                                                    Total            $       105,614               $       99,378               $       67,543               $       65,496                                                                                        The fair value of derivatives accounted for as qualifying hedges     under SFAS No. 133 consisted of $5.12 billion and     $2.66 billion in assets as of November 2007 and November     2006, respectively, and $354 million and $551 million     in liabilities as of November 2007 and November 2006,     respectively.        133    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         The firm also has embedded derivatives that have been bifurcated     from related borrowings under SFAS No. 133. Such     derivatives, which are classified in unsecured short-term and     unsecured long-term borrowings, had a carrying value of     $463 million and $1.13 billion (excluding the debt     host contract) as of November 2007 and November 2006,     respectively. See Notes 4 and 5 for further information     regarding the firms unsecured borrowings.     Securitization     Activities         The firm securitizes commercial and residential mortgages, home     equity and auto loans, government and corporate bonds and other     types of financial assets. The firm acts as underwriter of the     beneficial interests that are sold to investors. The firm     derecognizes financial assets transferred in securitizations     provided it has relinquished control over such assets.     Transferred assets are accounted for at fair value prior to     securitization. Net revenues related to these underwriting     activities are recognized in connection with the sales of the     underlying beneficial interests to investors.         The firm may retain interests in securitized financial assets,     primarily in the form of senior or subordinated securities,     including residual interests. Retained interests are accounted     for at fair value and are included in Total financial     instruments owned, at fair value in the consolidated     statements of financial condition.         During the year ended November 2007, the firm securitized     $81.40 billion of financial assets ($24.95 billion of     residential mortgages, $19.50 billion of commercial     mortgages and $36.95 billion of other financial assets,     primarily in connection with collateralized debt and loan     obligations (CDOs and CLOs)). During the year ended November     2006, the firm securitized $103.92 billion of financial     assets ($67.73 billion of residential mortgages,     $12.78 billion of commercial mortgages and     $23.41 billion of other financial assets, primarily in     connection with CDOs and CLOs). Cash flows received on retained     interests were approximately $705 million and     $801 million for the years ended November 2007 and November     2006, respectively.         As of November 2007 and November 2006, the firm held     $4.57 billion and $7.08 billion of retained interests,     respectively, from these securitization activities, including     $2.72 billion and $5.18 billion, respectively, held in     QSPEs.        134    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         The following table sets forth the weighted average key economic     assumptions used in measuring the fair value of the firms     retained interests and the sensitivity of this fair value to     immediate adverse changes of 10% and 20% in those assumptions:                                                                                               As of November 2007           As of November 2006                 Type of Retained Interests           Type of Retained Interests                 Mortgage-            CDOs and            Corporate            Mortgage-            CDOs and            Corporate                   Backed             CLOs     (3)             Debt             Backed             CLOs     (3)             Debt     (4)                      ($ in millions)                   Fair value of retained interests            $       3,378               $       1,188               $                      $       4,013               $       1,973               $       1,097              Weighted average life (years)                6.6                   2.7                                      6.0                   7.0                   2.2              Constant prepayment rate                15.1       %               11.9       %               N/A                   21.2       %               24.5       %               N/A              Impact of 10% adverse change            $       (50       )           $       (43       )           $                      $       (121       )           $       (2       )           $                     Impact of 20% adverse change                (91       )               (98       )                                  (221       )               (6       )                             Anticipated credit     losses (1)                4.3       %               N/A                   N/A                   2.0       %               N/A                   N/A              Impact of 10% adverse     change (2)            $       (45       )           $                      $                      $       (81       )           $                      $                     Impact of 20% adverse     change (2)                (72       )                                                     (155       )                                                Discount rate                8.4       %               23.1       %               N/A                   9.4       %               6.9       %               3.9       %          Impact of 10% adverse change            $       (89       )           $       (46       )           $                      $       (136       )           $       (38       )           $       (9       )          Impact of 20% adverse change                (170       )               (92       )                                  (266       )               (74       )               (17       )                             (1)        Anticipated credit losses are computed only on positions for     which expected credit loss is a key assumption in the     determination of fair value or positions for which expected     credit loss is not reflected within the discount rate.                (2)        The impacts of adverse change take into account credit mitigants     incorporated in the retained interests, including     over-collateralization and subordination provisions.                (3)        Includes $905 million and $1.26 billion as of November     2007 and November 2006, respectively, of retained interests     related to transfers of securitized assets that were accounted     for as secured financings rather than sales under     SFAS No. 140.                (4)        Includes retained interests in bonds and other types of     financial assets that are not subject to prepayment risk.           The preceding table does not give effect to the offsetting     benefit of other financial instruments that are held to mitigate     risks inherent in these retained interests. Changes in fair     value based on an adverse variation in assumptions generally     cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in     assumptions to the change in fair value is not usually linear.     In addition, the impact of a change in a particular assumption     is calculated independently of changes in any other assumption.     In practice, simultaneous changes in assumptions might magnify     or counteract the sensitivities disclosed above.         In addition to the retained interests described above, the firm     also held interests in residential mortgage QSPEs purchased in     connection with secondary market-making activities. These     purchased interests approximated $6 billion and     $8 billion as of November 2007 and November 2006,     respectively.        135    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         As of November 2007 and November 2006, the firm held mortgage     servicing rights with a fair value of $93 million and     $62 million, respectively, substantially all of which were     retained in connection with residential mortgage     securitizations. These servicing assets represent the     firms right to receive a future stream of cash flows     associated with the firms obligation to service     residential mortgages. The fair value of mortgage servicing     rights will fluctuate in response to changes in certain economic     variables, such as interest rates, loan prepayment assumptions     and default rates. The firm determines the fair value of     mortgage servicing rights by using valuation models that     incorporate these variables in quantifying anticipated cash     flows related to servicing activities.     Variable     Interest Entities (VIEs)         The firm, in the ordinary course of business, retains interests     in VIEs in connection with its securitization activities. The     firm also purchases and sells variable interests in VIEs, which     primarily issue mortgage-backed and other asset-backed     securities, CDOs and CLOs, in connection with its market-making     activities and makes investments in and loans to VIEs that hold     performing and nonperforming debt, equity, real estate,     power-related and other assets. In addition, the firm utilizes     VIEs to provide investors with principal-protected notes,     credit-linked notes and asset-repackaged notes designed to meet     their objectives.         VIEs generally purchase assets by issuing debt and equity     instruments. In certain instances, the firm provides guarantees     to VIEs or holders of variable interests in VIEs. In such cases,     the maximum exposure to loss included in the tables set forth     below is the notional amount of such guarantees. Such amounts do     not represent anticipated losses in connection with these     guarantees.         The firms variable interests in VIEs include senior and     subordinated debt; loan commitments; limited and general     partnership interests; preferred and common stock; interest     rate, foreign currency, equity, commodity and credit     derivatives; guarantees; and residual interests in     mortgage-backed and asset-backed securitization vehicles, CDOs     and CLOs. The firms exposure to the obligations of VIEs is     generally limited to its interests in these entities.         The following tables set forth total assets in nonconsolidated     VIEs in which the firm holds significant variable interests and     the firms maximum exposure to loss associated with these     variable interests. The firm has aggregated nonconsolidated VIEs     based on principal business activity, as reflected in the first     column. The nature of the firms variable interests can     take different forms, as described in the columns under maximum     exposure to loss.        136    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         These tables do not give effect to the benefit of any offsetting     financial instruments that are held to mitigate risks related to     the firms interests in nonconsolidated VIEs.

(2)        Such amounts do not represent the anticipated losses in     connection with these transactions.       Collateralized     Transactions         The firm receives financial instruments as collateral, primarily     in connection with resale agreements, securities borrowed,     derivative transactions and customer margin loans. Such     financial instruments may include obligations of the U.S.     government, federal agencies, sovereigns and corporations, as     well as equities and convertibles.         In many cases, the firm is permitted to deliver or repledge     these financial instruments in connection with entering into     repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements and other     secured financings, collateralizing derivative transactions and     meeting firm or customer settlement requirements. As of November     2007 and November 2006, the fair value of financial instruments     received as collateral by the firm that it was permitted to     deliver or repledge was $891.05 billion and     $746.08 billion, respectively, of which the firm delivered     or repledged $785.62 billion and $639.87 billion,     respectively.         The firm also pledges assets that it owns to counterparties who     may or may not have the right to deliver or repledge them.     Financial instruments owned and pledged to counterparties that     have the right to deliver or repledge are reported as     Financial instruments owned and pledged as collateral, at     fair value in the consolidated statements of financial     condition and were $46.14 billion and $36.00 billion     as of November 2007 and November 2006, respectively. Financial     instruments owned and pledged in connection with repurchase     agreements, securities lending agreements and other secured     financings to counterparties that did not have the right to sell     or repledge are included in Financial instruments owned,     at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial     condition and were $156.92 billion and $134.31 billion     as of November 2007 and November 2006, respectively. Other     assets (primarily real estate and cash) owned and pledged in     connection with other secured financings to counterparties that     did not have the right to sell or repledge were     $5.86 billion and $5.34 billion as of November 2007     and November 2006, respectively.        138    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         In addition to repurchase agreements and securities lending     agreements, the firm obtains secured funding through the use of     other arrangements. Other secured financings include     arrangements that are nonrecourse, that is, only the subsidiary     that executed the arrangement or a subsidiary guaranteeing the     arrangement is obligated to repay the financing. Other secured     financings consist of liabilities related to the firms     William Street program, consolidated variable interest entities,     collateralized central bank financings, transfers of financial     assets that are accounted for as financings rather than sales     under SFAS No. 140 (primarily pledged bank loans and     mortgage whole loans) and other structured financing     arrangements.         Other secured financings are set forth in the table below:                                               As of November                  2007             2006                      (in millions)                   Other secured financings     (short-term) (1)(2)            $       32,410               $       24,290              Other secured financings (long-term):                                           2008                                   5,535              2009                2,903                   877              2010                2,301                   1,894              2011                2,427                   5,105              2012                4,973                   1,928              2013-thereafter                20,696                   10,795                                                    Total other secured financings     (long-term) (3)(4)                33,300                   26,134                                                    Total other secured     financings (5)            $       65,710               $       50,424                                                                       (1)        As of November 2007, consists of U.S. dollar-denominated     financings of $18.47 billion with a weighted average     interest rate of 5.32% and     non-U.S.     dollar-denominated financings of $13.94 billion with a     weighted average interest rate of 0.91%, after giving effect to     hedging activities.

The weighted average interest rates as of     November 2007 and November 2006 excluded financial instruments     accounted for at fair value under SFAS No. 155 or     SFAS No. 159.                (2)        Includes other secured financings maturing within one year of     the financial statement date and other secured financings that     are redeemable within one year of the financial statement date     at the option of the holder.                (3)        As of November 2007, consists of U.S. dollar-denominated     financings of $22.13 billion with a weighted average     interest rate of 5.73% and     non-U.S.     dollar-denominated financings of $11.17 billion with a     weighted average interest rate of 4.28%, after giving effect to     hedging activities.

(4)        Secured long-term financings that are repayable prior to     maturity at the option of the firm are reflected at their     contractual maturity dates. Secured long-term financings that     are redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the holder are     reflected at the dates such options become exercisable.                (5)        As of November 2007, $61.34 billion of these financings     were collateralized by financial instruments and     $4.37 billion by other assets (primarily real estate and     cash). As of November 2006, $47.22 billion of these financings     were collateralized by financial instruments and     $3.20 billion by other assets. Other secured financings     include $25.37 billion and $19.79 billion of     nonrecourse obligations as of November 2007 and November 2006,     respectively.          139    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)        Note 4.  Unsecured     Short-Term Borrowings          The firm obtains unsecured short-term borrowings primarily     through the issuance of promissory notes, commercial paper and     hybrid financial instruments. As of November 2007 and November     2006, these borrowings were $71.56 billion and     $47.90 billion, respectively. Such amounts include the     portion of unsecured long-term borrowings maturing within one     year of the financial statement date and unsecured long-term     borrowings that are redeemable within one year of the financial     statement date at the option of the holder. The firm accounts     for promissory notes, commercial paper and certain hybrid     financial instruments at fair value under SFAS No. 155     or SFAS No. 159. Short-term borrowings that are not     recorded at fair value are recorded based on the amount of cash     received plus accrued interest, and such amounts approximate     fair value due to the short-term nature of the obligations.

Unsecured long-term borrowings by maturity date are set forth     below:                                                                                               As of November                 2007 (1)(2)           2006 (1)(2)                 U.S.            Non-U.S.                        U.S.            Non-U.S.                               Dollar             Dollar             Total             Dollar             Dollar             Total                      (in millions)                   2008            $                      $                      $                      $       14,848               $       3,038               $       17,886              2009                20,204                   2,978                   23,182                   12,398                   2,978                   15,376              2010                7,989                   5,714                   13,703                   5,034                   4,945                   9,979              2011                5,848                   4,839                   10,687                   5,675                   4,389                   10,064              2012                14,913                   3,695                   18,608                   4,500                   2,098                   6,598              2013-thereafter                53,635                   44,359                   97,994                   37,606                   25,333                   62,939                                                                                                                    Total            $       102,589               $       61,585               $       164,174               $       80,061               $       42,781               $       122,842                                                                                                                                (1)        Unsecured long-term borrowings maturing within one year of the     financial statement date and certain unsecured     long-term     borrowings that are redeemable within one year of the financial     statement date at the option of the holder are included as     unsecured short-term borrowings in the consolidated statements     of financial condition.         (2)        Unsecured long-term borrowings that are repayable prior to     maturity at the option of the firm are reflected at their     contractual maturity dates. Unsecured long-term borrowings that     are redeemable prior to maturity at the option of     the holder are reflected at the dates such options become     exercisable.           The firm enters into derivative contracts, such as interest rate     futures contracts, interest rate swap agreements, currency swap     agreements, commodity contracts and equity-linked and indexed     contracts, to effectively convert a substantial portion of its     unsecured long-term borrowings into U.S. dollar-based     floating rate obligations. Accordingly, the carrying value of     unsecured long-term borrowings approximated fair value as of     November 2007 and November 2006.        141    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         The effective weighted average interest rates for unsecured     long-term borrowings are set forth below:                                                                       As of November                 2007           2006                  Amount             Rate             Amount             Rate                                  ($ in millions)                               Fixed rate obligations            $       3,787                   5.28       %           $       1,997                   6.13       %          Floating rate     obligations (1)(2)                160,387                   5.68                   120,845                   5.75                                                                                    Total            $       164,174                   5.67               $       122,842                   5.75                                                                                                (1)        Includes fixed rate obligations that have been converted into     floating rate obligations through derivative contracts.         (2)        The weighted average interest rates as of November 2007 and     November 2006 excluded financial instruments accounted for at     fair value under SFAS No. 155 or     SFAS No. 159.       Subordinated     Borrowings         Unsecured long-term borrowings include subordinated borrowings     with outstanding principal amounts of $16.32 billion and     $7.51 billion as of November 2007 and November 2006,     respectively, as set forth below.     Subordinated Notes.  As of November 2007, the     firm had $11.23 billion of subordinated notes outstanding     with maturities ranging from fiscal 2009 to 2037. The effective     weighted average interest rate on these subordinated notes was     5.75%, after giving effect to derivative contracts used to     convert fixed rate obligations into floating rate obligations.     As of November 2006, the firm had $4.67 billion of     subordinated notes outstanding with maturities ranging from 2007     to 2036 and with an effective weighted average interest rate of     6.24%. These notes are junior in right of payment to all of the     firms senior indebtedness.     Junior Subordinated Debt Issued to a Trust in Connection with     Trust Preferred Securities. The firm issued     $2.84 billion of junior subordinated debentures in its     first quarter of 2004 to Goldman Sachs Capital I (the Trust), a     Delaware statutory trust that, in turn, issued     $2.75 billion of guaranteed preferred beneficial interests     to third parties and $85 million of common beneficial     interests to the firm and invested the proceeds from the sale in     junior subordinated debentures issued by the firm. The Trust is     a wholly owned finance subsidiary of the firm for regulatory and     legal purposes but is not consolidated for accounting purposes.         The firm pays interest semiannually on these debentures at an     annual rate of 6.345% and the debentures mature on     February 15, 2034. The coupon rate and the payment dates     applicable to the beneficial interests are the same as the     interest rate and payment dates applicable to the debentures.     The firm has the right, from time to time, to defer payment of     interest on the debentures, and, therefore, cause payment on the     Trusts preferred beneficial interests to be deferred, in     each case up to ten consecutive semiannual periods. During any     such extension period, the firm will not be permitted to, among     other things, pay dividends on or make certain repurchases of     its common stock. The Trust is not permitted to pay any     distributions on the common beneficial interests held by the     firm unless all dividends payable on the preferred beneficial     interests have been paid in full. These debentures are junior in     right of payment to all of the firms senior indebtedness     and all of the firms subordinated borrowings, other than     the junior subordinated debt issued in connection with the     Normal Automatic Preferred Enhanced Capital Securities (see     discussion below).        142    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     Junior Subordinated Debt Issued to Trusts in Connection with     Fixed-to-Floating and Floating Rate Normal Automatic Preferred     Enhanced Capital Securities.  In the second     quarter of 2007, the firm issued a total of $2.25 billion     of remarketable junior subordinated notes to Goldman Sachs     Capital II and Goldman Sachs Capital III (the Trusts), Delaware     statutory trusts that, in turn, issued $2.25 billion of     guaranteed perpetual Automatic Preferred Enhanced Capital     Securities (APEX) to third parties and a de minimis amount of     common securities to the firm. The firm also entered into     contracts with the Trusts to sell $2.25 billion of     perpetual non-cumulative preferred stock to be issued by the     firm (the stock purchase contracts). The Trusts are wholly owned     finance subsidiaries of the firm for regulatory and legal     purposes but are not consolidated for accounting purposes.         The firm pays interest semiannually on $1.75 billion of     junior subordinated notes issued to Goldman Sachs Capital II at     a fixed annual rate of 5.59% and the notes mature on     June 1, 2043. The firm pays interest quarterly on     $500 million of junior subordinated notes issued to Goldman     Sachs Capital III at a rate per annum equal to three-month LIBOR     plus .57% and the notes mature on September 1, 2043. In     addition, the firm makes contract payments at a rate of .20% per     annum on the stock purchase contracts held by the Trusts. The     firm has the right to defer payments on the junior subordinated     notes and the stock purchase contracts, subject to limitations,     and therefore cause payment on the APEX to be deferred. During     any such extension period, the firm will not be permitted to,     among other things, pay dividends on or make certain repurchases     of its common or preferred stock. The junior subordinated notes     are junior in right of payment to all of the firms senior     indebtedness and all of the firms other subordinated     borrowings.         In connection with the APEX issuance, the firm covenanted in     favor of certain of its debtholders, who are initially the     holders of the firms 6.345% Junior Subordinated Debentures     due February 15, 2034, that, subject to certain     exceptions, the firm would not redeem or purchase (i) the     firms junior subordinated debt issued to the APEX trusts     prior to the applicable stock purchase date or (ii) APEX or     shares of the firms Series E or Series F     Preferred Stock prior to the date that is ten years after the     applicable stock purchase date, unless the applicable redemption     or purchase price does not exceed a maximum amount determined by     reference to the aggregate amount of net cash proceeds that the     firm has received from the sale of qualifying equity securities     during the 180 day period preceding the redemption or     purchase.         The firm has accounted for the stock purchase contracts as     equity instruments under EITF Issue     No. 00-19,     Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed     to, and Potentially Settled in, a Companys Own     Stock, and, accordingly, recorded the cost of the stock     purchase contracts as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.     See Note 7 for information on the preferred stock that the     firm will issue in connection with the stock purchase contracts.        143    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)        Note 6.  Commitments,     Contingencies and Guarantees      Commitments     Forward Starting Collateralized Agreements and     Financings.  The firm had forward starting resale     agreements and securities borrowing agreements of     $28.14 billion and $18.29 billion as of November 2007     and November 2006, respectively. The firm had forward starting     repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements of     $15.39 billion and $17.15 billion as of     November 2007 and November 2006, respectively.     Commitments to Extend Credit.  In connection     with its lending activities, the firm had outstanding     commitments to extend credit of $82.75 billion and     $100.48 billion as of November 2007 and November 2006,     respectively. The firms commitments to extend credit are     agreements to lend to counterparties that have fixed termination     dates and are contingent on the satisfaction of all conditions     to borrowing set forth in the contract. Since these commitments     may expire unused or be reduced or cancelled at the     counterpartys request, the total commitment amount does     not necessarily reflect the actual future cash flow     requirements. The firm accounts for these commitments at fair     value. To the extent that the firm recognizes losses on these     commitments, such losses are recorded within the firms     Trading and Principal Investments segment net of any related     underwriting fees.         The following table summarizes the firms commitments to     extend credit as of November 2007 and November 2006:                                               Year Ended November                  2007             2006                      (in millions)                   Commercial lending commitments                                           Investment-grade            $       11,719               $       7,604              Non-investment-grade                41,930                   57,017              William Street program                24,488                   18,831              Warehouse financing                4,610                   17,026                                                    Total commitments to extend credit            $       82,747               $       100,478                                                                    Commercial lending commitments.  The firm     extends commercial lending commitments primarily in connection     with contingent acquisition financing and other types of     corporate lending as well as commercial real estate financing.     The total commitment amount does not necessarily reflect the     actual future cash flow requirements, as the firm often     syndicates all or substantial portions of these commitments, the     commitments may expire unused, or the commitments may be     cancelled or reduced at the request of the counterparty. In     addition, commitments that are extended for contingent     acquisition financing are often intended to be short-term in     nature, as borrowers often seek to replace them with other     funding sources. Included within the non-investment-grade amount     as of November 2007 was $26.09 billion of exposure to     leveraged lending capital market transactions,     $3.50 billion related to commercial real estate     transactions and $12.34 billion arising from other unfunded     credit facilities. Included within the non-investment-grade     amount as of November 2006 was $39.68 billion of exposure     to leveraged lending capital market transactions,     $12.11 billion related to commercial real estate     transactions and $5.23 billion arising from other unfunded     credit facilities.          144    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                       William Street program.  Substantially all of     the commitments provided under the William Street credit     extension program are to investment-grade corporate borrowers.     Commitments under the program are extended by William Street     Commitment Corporation (Commitment Corp.), a consolidated wholly     owned subsidiary of Group Inc. whose assets and liabilities are     legally separated from other assets and liabilities of the firm,     William Street Credit Corporation, GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs     Credit Partners L.P. or other consolidated wholly owned     subsidiaries of Group Inc. The commitments extended by     Commitment Corp. are supported, in part, by funding raised by     William Street Funding Corporation (Funding Corp.), another     consolidated wholly owned subsidiary of Group Inc. whose assets     and liabilities are also legally separated from other assets and     liabilities of the firm. The assets of Commitment Corp. and of     Funding Corp. will not be available to their respective     shareholders until the claims of their respective creditors have     been paid. In addition, no affiliate of either Commitment Corp.     or Funding Corp., except in limited cases as expressly agreed in     writing, is responsible for any obligation of either entity.     With respect to most of the William Street commitments, Sumitomo     Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG) provides the firm with     credit loss protection that is generally limited to 95% of the     first loss the firm realizes on approved loan commitments, up to     a maximum of $1.00 billion. In addition, subject to the     satisfaction of certain conditions, upon the firms     request, SMFG will provide protection for 70% of the second loss     on such commitments, up to a maximum of $1.13 billion. The     firm also uses other financial instruments to mitigate credit     risks related to certain William Street commitments not covered     by SMFG.                Warehouse financing.  The firm provides     financing for the warehousing of financial assets to be     securitized. These financings are expected to be repaid from the     proceeds of the related securitizations for which the firm may     or may not act as underwriter. These arrangements are secured by     the warehoused assets, primarily consisting of corporate bank     loans and commercial mortgages as of November 2007 and     residential mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, corporate     bank loans and commercial mortgages as of November 2006. In     connection with its warehouse financing activities, the firm had     loans of $44 million collateralized by subprime mortgages     as of November 2007.       Letters of Credit.  The firm provides letters     of credit issued by various banks to counterparties in lieu of     securities or cash to satisfy various collateral and margin     deposit requirements. Letters of credit outstanding were     $8.75 billion and $5.73 billion as of November 2007     and November 2006, respectively.     Investment Commitments.  In connection with its     merchant banking and other investing activities, the firm     invests in private equity, real estate and other assets directly     and through funds that it raises and manages. In connection with     these activities, the firm had commitments to invest up to     $17.76 billion and $8.24 billion as of November 2007     and November 2006, respectively, including $12.32 billion     and $4.41 billion, respectively, of commitments to invest     in funds managed by the firm.     Construction-Related Commitments.  As of     November 2007 and November 2006, the firm had     construction-related commitments of $769 million and     $1.63 billion, respectively, including outstanding     commitments of $642 million and $500 million as of     November 2007 and November 2006, respectively, related to the     firms new world headquarters in New York City, which is     expected to cost between $2.3 billion and     $2.5 billion. The firm is partially financing this     construction project with  tax-exempt Liberty Bonds. The firm     borrowed approximately $1.40 billion and approximately     $250 million in 2005 and 2007, respectively, through the     issuance of Liberty Bonds.     Underwriting Commitments.  As of November 2007     and November 2006, the firm had commitments to purchase     $88 million and $2.62 billion, respectively, of     securities in connection with its underwriting activities.        145    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     Other.  The firm had other purchase commitments     of $420 million and $393 million as of November 2007     and November 2006, respectively.         In addition, the firm entered into an agreement in 2007 to     acquire Litton Loan Servicing LP (Litton), the mortgage     servicing unit of Credit-Based Asset Servicing and     Securitization LLC     (C-BASS).     The transaction closed in December 2007 at a purchase price of     $428 million, plus the repayment of $916 million of     outstanding Litton debt obligations.     Leases.  The firm has contractual obligations     under long-term noncancelable lease agreements, principally for     office space, expiring on various dates through 2069. Certain     agreements are subject to periodic escalation provisions for     increases in real estate taxes and other charges. Future minimum     rental payments, net of minimum sublease rentals are set forth     below:                                       (in millions)                   Minimum rental payments                           2008            $       450              2009                478              2010                372              2011                313              2012                255              2013-thereafter                2,022                                    Total            $       3,890                                    Rent charged to operating expense is set forth below:           Net rent expense                           2005            $       359              2006                404              2007                412              Contingencies         The firm is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and     arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in connection     with the conduct of its businesses. Management believes, based     on currently available information, that the results of such     proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse     effect on the firms financial condition, but may be     material to the firms operating results for any particular     period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such     period. Given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome     of the firms litigation and regulatory matters,     particularly in cases or proceedings in which substantial or     indeterminate damages or fines are sought, the firm cannot     estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases or proceedings     where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may be     incurred.         In connection with its insurance business, the firm is     contingently liable to provide guaranteed minimum death and     income benefits to certain contract holders and has established     a reserve related to $10.84 billion and $8.04 billion     of contract holder account balances as of November 2007 and     November 2006, respectively, for such benefits. The weighted     average attained age of these contract holders was 67 years     and 70 years as of November 2007 and November 2006,     respectively. The net amount at risk, representing guaranteed     minimum death and income benefits in excess of contract holder     account balances, was $1.04 billion and $1.27 billion     as of November 2007 and November 2006, respectively. See     Note 10 for more information on the firms insurance     liabilities.        146    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     Guarantees         The firm enters into various derivative contracts that meet the     definition of a guarantee under FIN No. 45,     Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements     for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of     Others. Such derivative contracts include credit default     and total return swaps, written equity and commodity put     options, written currency contracts and interest rate caps,     floors and swaptions. FIN No. 45 does not require     disclosures about derivative contracts if such contracts may be     cash settled and the firm has no basis to conclude it is     probable that the counterparties held, at inception, the     underlying instruments related to the derivative contracts. The     firm has concluded that these conditions have been met for     certain large, internationally active commercial and investment     bank end users and certain other users. Accordingly, the firm     has not included such contracts in the tables below.         The firm, in its capacity as an agency lender, indemnifies most     of its securities lending customers against losses incurred in     the event that borrowers do not return securities and the     collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the     securities borrowed.         In the ordinary course of business, the firm provides other     financial guarantees of the obligations of third parties (e.g.,     performance bonds, standby letters of credit and other     guarantees to enable clients to complete transactions and     merchant banking fund-related guarantees). These guarantees     represent obligations to make payments to beneficiaries if the     guaranteed party fails to fulfill its obligation under a     contractual arrangement with that beneficiary.        147    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         The following tables set forth certain information about the     firms derivative contracts that meet the definition of a     guarantee and certain other guarantees as of November 2007 and     November 2006:                                                                                  As of November 2007                 Maximum Payout/Notional Amount by Period of Expiration     (1)                             2009-            2011-            2013-                               2008             2010             2012             Thereafter             Total                      (in millions)                   Derivatives     (2)            $       580,769               $       492,563               $       457,511               $       514,498               $       2,045,341              Securities lending     indemnifications (3)                26,673                                                                            26,673              Performance bonds     (4)                2,046                                                                            2,046              Other financial guarantees     (5)                381                   121                   258                   46                   806                                                                                          As of November 2006                 Maximum Payout/Notional Amount by Period of Expiration     (1)                             2008-            2010-            2012-                               2007             2009             2011             Thereafter             Total                      (in millions)                   Derivatives     (2)            $       379,256               $       428,258               $       460,088               $       399,449               $       1,667,051              Securities lending     indemnifications (3)                19,023                                                                            19,023              Performance bonds                                                                                                          Other financial guarantees     (5)                592                   99                   76                   86                   853                       (1)   Such amounts do not represent the     anticipated losses in connection with these contracts.           (2)   The aggregate carrying value of     these derivatives as of November 2007 was a liability of     $33.10 billion. The aggregate carrying value of these     derivatives as of November 2006 was an asset of     $1.12 billion, consisting of contracts with an asset value     of $11.06 billion and contracts with a liability value of     $9.94 billion. The carrying value excludes the effect of a     legal right of setoff that may exist under an enforceable     netting agreement. These derivative contracts are risk managed     together with derivative contracts that are not considered     guarantees under FIN No. 45, and therefore, these     amounts do not reflect the firms overall risk related to     its derivative activities.           (3)   Collateral held by the lenders in     connection with securities lending indemnifications was     $27.49 billion and $19.70 billion as of November 2007     and November 2006, respectively.           (4)   Excludes collateral of     $2.05 billion related to these obligations.           (5)   The carrying value of these     guarantees was a liability of $43 million and     $15 million as of November 2007 and     November 2006, respectively.               The firm has established trusts, including Goldman Sachs     Capital I, II and III, and other entities for the     limited purpose of issuing securities to third parties, lending     the proceeds to the firm and entering into contractual     arrangements with the firm and third parties related to this     purpose. (See Note 5 for information regarding the     transactions involving Goldman Sachs Capital I, II and     III.) The firm effectively provides for the full and     unconditional guarantee of the securities issued by these     entities, which are not consolidated for accounting purposes.     Timely payment by the firm of amounts due to these entities     under the borrowing, preferred stock and related contractual     arrangements will be sufficient to cover payments due on the     securities issued by these entities. Management believes that it     is unlikely that any circumstances will occur, such as     nonperformance on the part of paying agents or other service     providers, that would make it necessary for the firm to make     payments related to these entities other than those required     under the terms of the borrowing, preferred stock and related     contractual arrangements and in connection with certain expenses     incurred by these entities.        148    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         In the ordinary course of business, the firm indemnifies and     guarantees certain service providers, such as clearing and     custody agents, trustees and administrators, against specified     potential losses in connection with their acting as an agent of,     or providing services to, the firm or its affiliates. The firm     also indemnifies some clients against potential losses incurred     in the event specified third-party service providers, including     sub-custodians and third-party brokers, improperly execute     transactions. In addition, the firm is a member of payment,     clearing and settlement networks as well as securities exchanges     around the world that may require the firm to meet the     obligations of such networks and exchanges in the event of     member defaults. In connection with its prime brokerage and     clearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear and settle on     behalf of its clients the transactions entered into by them with     other brokerage firms. The firms obligations in respect of     such transactions are secured by the assets in the clients     account as well as any proceeds received from the transactions     cleared and settled by the firm on behalf of the client. In     connection with joint venture investments, the firm may issue     loan guarantees under which it may be liable in the event of     fraud, misappropriation, environmental liabilities and certain     other matters involving the borrower. The firm is unable to     develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these guarantees     and indemnifications. However, management believes that it is     unlikely the firm will have to make any material payments under     these arrangements, and no liabilities related to these     guarantees and indemnifications have been recognized in the     consolidated statements of financial condition as of November     2007 and November 2006.         The firm provides representations and warranties to     counterparties in connection with a variety of commercial     transactions and occasionally indemnifies them against potential     losses caused by the breach of those representations and     warranties. The firm may also provide indemnifications     protecting against changes in or adverse application of certain     U.S. tax laws in connection with ordinary-course     transactions such as securities issuances, borrowings or     derivatives. In addition, the firm may provide indemnifications     to some counterparties to protect them in the event additional     taxes are owed or payments are withheld, due either to a change     in or an adverse application of certain     non-U.S. tax     laws. These indemnifications generally are standard contractual     terms and are entered into in the ordinary course of business.     Generally, there are no stated or notional amounts included in     these indemnifications, and the contingencies triggering the     obligation to indemnify are not expected to occur. The firm is     unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these     guarantees and indemnifications. However, management believes     that it is unlikely the firm will have to make any material     payments under these arrangements, and no liabilities related to     these arrangements have been recognized in the consolidated     statements of financial condition as of November 2007 and     November 2006.        149    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)        Note 7.  Shareholders     Equity          Dividends declared per common share were $1.40 in 2007, $1.30 in     2006, and $1.00 in 2005. On December 17, 2007, the Board of     Directors of Group Inc. (the Board) declared a dividend of     $0.35 per common share to be paid on February 28,     2008, to common shareholders of record on January 29, 2008.         During 2007 and 2006, the firm repurchased 41.2 million and     50.2 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of     $8.96 billion and $7.82 billion, respectively. The     average price paid per share for repurchased shares was $217.29     and $155.64 for the years ended November 2007 and     November 2006, respectively. In addition, to satisfy     minimum statutory employee tax withholding requirements related     to the delivery of common stock underlying restricted stock     units, the firm cancelled 4.7 million and 3.0 million     of restricted stock units with a total value of     $929 million and $375 million in 2007 and 2006,     respectively.         The firms share repurchase program is intended to help     maintain the appropriate level of common equity and to     substantially offset increases in share count over time     resulting from employee share-based compensation. The repurchase     program is effected primarily through regular  open-market     purchases, the amounts and timing of which are determined     primarily by the firms current and projected capital     positions (i.e., comparisons of the firms desired level of     capital to its actual level of capital) but which may also be     influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price     and trading volumes of the firms common stock.         As of November 2007, the firm had 124,000 shares of     perpetual non-cumulative preferred stock issued and outstanding     in four series as set forth in the following table:                                                          Shares        Shares                Earliest        Redemption Value       Series         Issued         Authorized         Dividend Rate         Redemption Date         (in millions)                A            30,000           50,000           3 month LIBOR + 0.75%,      with floor of 3.75% per annum           April 25, 2010           $       750              B            32,000           50,000           6.20% per annum           October 31, 2010               800              C            8,000           25,000           3 month LIBOR + 0.75%,      with floor of 4% per annum           October 31, 2010               200              D            54,000           60,000           3 month LIBOR + 0.67%,      with floor of 4% per annum           May 24, 2011               1,350                                                                           124,000           185,000                           $       3,100                                                                       Each share of preferred stock issued and outstanding has a par     value of $0.01, has a liquidation preference of $25,000, is     represented by 1,000 depositary shares and is redeemable at the     firms option at a redemption price equal to $25,000 plus     declared and unpaid dividends. Dividends on each series of     preferred stock, if declared, are payable quarterly in arrears.     The firms ability to declare or pay dividends on, or     purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, its common stock is     subject to certain restrictions in the event that the firm fails     to pay or set aside full dividends on the preferred stock for     the latest completed dividend period. All series of preferred     stock are pari passu and have a preference over the firms     common stock upon liquidation.        150    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         In the second quarter of 2007, the Board authorized     17,500.1 shares of perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred     Stock, Series E and 5,000.1 shares of perpetual     Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series F in connection with     the APEX issuance (see Note 5 for further information on     the APEX issuance). Under the stock purchase contracts, the firm     will issue on the relevant stock purchase dates (on or before     June 1, 2013 and September 1, 2013 for Series E     and Series F preferred stock, respectively) one share of     Series E and Series F preferred stock to Goldman Sachs     Capital II and III, respectively, for each $100,000     principal amount of subordinated notes held by these trusts.     When issued, each share of Series E and Series F     preferred stock will have a par value of $0.01 and a liquidation     preference of $100,000 per share. Dividends on Series E     preferred stock, if declared, will be payable semiannually at a     fixed annual rate of 5.79% if the stock is issued prior to     June 1, 2012 and quarterly thereafter, at a rate per annum     equal to the greater of (i) three-month LIBOR plus .77% and     (ii) 4%. Dividends on Series F preferred stock, if     declared, will be payable quarterly at a rate per annum equal to     three-month LIBOR plus .77% if the stock is issued prior to     September 1, 2012 and quarterly thereafter, at a rate per     annum equal to the greater of (i) three-month LIBOR plus     .77% and (ii) 4%. The preferred stock may be redeemed at     the option of the firm on the stock purchase dates or any day     thereafter, subject to the approval of the Securities and     Exchange Commission (SEC) and certain covenant restrictions     governing the firms ability to redeem or purchase the     preferred stock without issuing common stock or other     instruments with equity-like characteristics.         Dividends declared per preferred share were $1,563.51,     $1,550.00, $1,563.51 and $1,543.06 for Series A,     Series B, Series C and Series D preferred stock,     respectively, in 2007.

DAC results     from commissions paid by the firm to the primary insurer (ceding     company) on life and annuity reinsurance agreements as     compensation to place the business with the firm and to cover     the ceding companys acquisition expenses. VOBA and DAC are     amortized over the estimated life of the underlying contracts     based on estimated gross profits, and amortization is adjusted     based on actual experience. The weighted average remaining     amortization period for VOBA and DAC is seven years as of     November 2007.           (3)   The reduction in power contracts     from November 2006 is due to the sale of the majority of the     firms ownership interests in 14 power generation     facilities during 2007.

Separate account     assets are included in Cash and securities segregated for     regulatory and other purposes in the consolidated     statements of financial condition.         Liabilities for future benefits and unpaid claims include     liabilities arising from reinsurance provided by the firm to     other insurers. The firm had a receivable for $1.30 billion     and $1.33 billion as of November 2007 and November 2006,     respectively, related to such reinsurance contracts, which is     reported in Receivables from customers and     counterparties in the consolidated statements of financial     condition. In addition, the firm has ceded risks to reinsurers     related to certain of its liabilities for future benefits and     unpaid claims and had a receivable of $785 million and     $786 million as of November 2007 and November 2006,     respectively, related to such reinsurance contracts, which is     reported in Receivables from customers and     counterparties in the consolidated statements of financial     condition. Contracts to cede risks to reinsurers do not relieve     the firm from its obligations to contract holders.         Reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits     represent a liability for the expected value of guaranteed     benefits in excess of projected annuity account balances. These     reserves are computed in accordance with AICPA     SOP 03-1     and are based on total payments expected to be made less total     fees expected to be assessed over the life of the contract.            (2)   Includes $5.95 billion and     $619 million related to consolidated investment funds as of     November 2007 and November 2006, respectively.              155    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)        Note 11.  Employee     Benefit Plans          The firm sponsors various pension plans and certain other     postretirement benefit plans, primarily healthcare and life     insurance. The firm also provides certain benefits to former or     inactive employees prior to retirement.     Defined     Benefit Pension Plans and Postretirement Plans         Employees of certain     non-U.S. subsidiaries     participate in various defined benefit pension plans. These     plans generally provide benefits based on years of credited     service and a percentage of the employees eligible     compensation. The firm maintains a defined benefit pension plan     for substantially all U.K. employees. The firm expects to close     the U.K. pension plan to new participants during the first half     of 2008, but will continue to accrue benefits for existing     participants.         The firm also maintains a defined benefit pension plan for     substantially all U.S. employees hired prior to     November 1, 2003. As of November 2004, this plan has been     closed to new participants and no further benefits will be     accrued to existing participants. In addition, the firm has     unfunded postretirement benefit plans that provide medical and     life insurance for eligible retirees and their dependents     covered under these programs.         On November 30, 2007, the firm adopted     SFAS No. 158 which requires an entity to recognize in     its statement of financial condition the funded status of its     defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, measured as     the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the     benefit obligation. Upon adoption, SFAS No. 158     requires an entity to recognize previously unrecognized     actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs, and transition     obligations and assets within Accumulated other     comprehensive income/(loss) in the consolidated statements     of changes in shareholders equity. Additional minimum     pension liabilities are derecognized upon adoption of the new     standard.         As a result of adopting SFAS No. 158, the firm     recorded increases of $59 million and $253 million to     Other assets and Other liabilities and accrued     expenses, respectively, and a $194 million loss, net     of taxes, within Accumulated other comprehensive     income/(loss).         The accumulated other comprehensive loss at November 30,     2007 includes actuarial losses, prior service costs, and     transition assets of $269 million, $37 million, and     $(9) million, pre-tax, respectively, of which     $8 million, $13 million and $(2) million,     pre-tax, respectively, will be amortized from accumulated other     comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost in 2008.        156    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES

The firms approach in determining the long-term rate of     return for plan assets is based upon historical financial market     relationships that have existed over time with the presumption     that this trend will generally remain constant in the future.         For measurement purposes, an annual growth rate in the per     capita cost of covered healthcare benefits of 10.02% was assumed     for the year ending November 2008. The rate was assumed to     decrease ratably to 5.00% for the year ending November 2015 and     remain at that level thereafter.         The assumed cost of healthcare has an effect on the amounts     reported for the firms postretirement plans. A 1% change     in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would have the     following effects:                                                                      1% Increase           1% Decrease                  2007             2006             2007             2006                                  (in millions)                               Service plus interest costs            $       12               $       9               $       (9       )           $       (7       )          Obligation                94                   79                   (72       )               (62       )            159    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         The following table sets forth the composition of plan assets     for the U.S. and     non-U.S. defined     benefit pension plans by asset category:                                                                       As of November                 2007           2006                 U.S.            Non-U.S.            U.S.            Non-U.S.                   Pension             Pension             Pension             Pension                    Equity securities                63       %               45       %               64       %               61       %          Debt securities                23                   8                   22                   8              Other                14                   47                   14                   31                                                                                    Total                100       %               100       %               100       %               100       %                                                                                    The investment approach of the firms U.S. and major     non-U.S. defined     benefit pension plans involves employing a sufficient level of     flexibility to capture investment opportunities as they occur,     while maintaining reasonable parameters to ensure that prudence     and care are exercised in the execution of the investment     programs. The plans employ a total return on investment     approach, whereby a mix, which is broadly similar to the actual     asset allocation as of November 2007, of equity securities, debt     securities and other assets, is targeted to maximize the     long-term return on assets for a given level of risk. Investment     risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis by the     firms Retirement Committee through periodic portfolio     reviews, meetings with investment managers and annual liability     measurements.         The firm expects to contribute a minimum of $133 million to     its pension plans and $9 million to its postretirement     plans in 2008.

The firms contribution to these plans     was $258 million, $230 million and $305 million     for the years ended November 2007, November 2006 and     November 2005, respectively.        160    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)        Note 12.  Employee     Incentive Plans      Stock     Incentive Plan         The firm sponsors a stock incentive plan, The Goldman Sachs     Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (the Amended SIP),     which provides for grants of incentive stock options,     nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, dividend     equivalent rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units,     awards with performance conditions and other share-based awards.     In the second quarter of 2003, the Amended SIP was approved by     the firms shareholders, effective for grants after     April 1, 2003.         The total number of shares of common stock that may be issued     under the Amended SIP through 2008 may not exceed     250 million shares and, in each year thereafter, may not     exceed 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock,     determined as of the last day of the immediately preceding year,     increased by the number of shares available for awards in     previous years but not covered by awards granted in such years.     As of November 2007 and November 2006, 160.6 million and     180.0 million shares, respectively, were available for     grant under the Amended SIP.     Other     Compensation Arrangements         The firm has deferred compensation plans for eligible employees.     In general, under the plans, participants are able to defer     payment of a portion of their cash year-end compensation. During     the deferral period, participants are able to nominally invest     their deferrals in certain alternatives available under the     plans. Generally, under current tax law, participants are not     subject to income tax on amounts deferred or on any notional     investment earnings until the returns are distributed, and the     firm is not entitled to a corresponding tax deduction until the     amounts are distributed. The firm has recognized compensation     expense for the amounts deferred under these plans. As of     November 2007 and November 2006, $281 million and     $245 million, respectively, related to these plans was     included in Other liabilities and accrued expenses     in the consolidated statements of financial condition.         The firm has a discount stock program through which eligible     senior executives may acquire restricted stock units at an     effective 25% discount. The 25% discount is effected by an     additional grant of restricted stock units equal to one-third of     the number of restricted stock units purchased by qualifying     participants. The purchased restricted stock units are 100%     vested when granted, but the shares underlying them are not able     to be sold or transferred (other than to satisfy tax     obligations) before the third anniversary of the grant date. The     shares underlying the restricted stock units that are granted in     order to effect the 25% discount will generally vest in equal     installments on the second and third anniversaries following the     grant date and will not be transferable before the third     anniversary of the grant date. Compensation expense related to     these restricted stock units is recognized over the vesting     period. The total value of restricted stock units granted in     2007 and 2006 in order to effect the 25% discount was     $66 million and $72 million, respectively.        161    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     Restricted     Stock Units         The firm issued restricted stock units to employees under the     Amended SIP, primarily in connection with year-end compensation     and acquisitions. Restricted stock units are valued based on the     closing price of the underlying shares at the date of grant.     Year-end restricted stock units generally vest as outlined in     the applicable restricted stock unit agreements and deliver     shortly after the third anniversary of the grant date. All     employee restricted stock unit agreements provide that vesting     is accelerated in certain circumstances, such as upon     retirement, death and extended absence. Of the total restricted     stock units outstanding as of November 2007 and November 2006,     (i) 22.0 million units and 26.4 million units,     respectively, required future service as a condition to the     delivery of the underlying shares of common stock and     (ii) 51.6 million units and 38.9 million units,     respectively, did not require future service. In all cases,     delivery of the underlying shares of common stock is conditioned     on the grantees satisfying certain vesting and other     requirements outlined in the award agreements. When delivering     the underlying shares to employees, the firm generally issues     new shares of common stock. The activity related to these     restricted stock units is set forth below:                                                                                               Weighted Average Grant-Date                  Restricted Stock            Fair Value of Restricted                  Units Outstanding           Stock Units Outstanding                 Future            No Future            Future            No Future                  Service            Service            Service            Service                   Required             Required             Required             Required                    Outstanding, November 2006     (1)                26,380,372                   38,918,141               $       138.83               $       138.22              Granted     (2)(3)(4)                7,968,028                   13,870,644                   224.40                   223.97              Forfeited                (816,924       )               (282,019       )               145.30                   135.46              Delivered     (5)                                   (12,447,338       )                                  103.49              Vested     (4)                (11,506,129       )               11,506,129                   116.95                   116.95                                                                                    Outstanding, November 2007                22,025,347                   51,565,557               $       180.98               $       164.94                                                                                              (1)   Includes restricted stock units     granted to employees during the year ended November 2007 as part     of compensation for 2006.

Year-end stock options for 2007 and 2006 become exercisable in     January 2011 and January 2010, respectively, and expire on     November 24, 2017 and November 25, 2016, respectively.     Shares received on exercise prior to January 2013 for year-end     2007 options and January 2011 for year-end 2006 options can not     be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of until January 2013     and January 2011, respectively. All employee stock option     agreements provide that vesting is accelerated in certain     circumstances, such as upon retirement, death and extended     absence. In general, all stock options expire on the tenth     anniversary of the grant date, although they may be subject to     earlier termination or cancellation under certain circumstances     in accordance with the terms of the Amended SIP and the     applicable stock option agreement.

The value of the common     stock underlying the options granted in 2007, 2006 and 2005     reflects a liquidity discount of 24.0%, 17.5% and 17.5%,     respectively, as a result of these transfer restrictions. The     liquidity discount was based on the firms pre-determined     written liquidity discount policies. The 7.5 years expected     life of the options reflects the estimated impact of these sales     restrictions on the life of the awards.         The following table sets forth share-based compensation and the     related tax benefit:                                                           Year Ended November                  2007             2006             2005                      (in millions)                   Share-based compensation            $       4,549               $       3,669               $       1,758              Excess tax benefit related to options exercised                469                   542                   268              Excess tax benefit related to share-based     compensation (1)                908                   653                   272                        (1)   Represents the tax benefit,     recognized in additional paid-in capital, on stock options     exercised and the delivery of common stock underlying restricted     stock units.               As of November 2007, there was $2.75 billion of total     unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based     compensation arrangements. This cost is expected to be     recognized over a weighted average period of 2.15 years.        164    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)        Note 13.  Transactions     with Affiliated Funds          The firm has formed numerous nonconsolidated investment funds     with third-party investors. The firm generally acts as the     investment manager for these funds and, as such, is entitled to     receive management fees and, in certain cases, advisory fees,     incentive fees or overrides from these funds. These fees     amounted to $3.62 billion, $3.37 billion and     $2.08 billion for the years ended November 2007,     November 2006 and November 2005, respectively. As of November     2007 and November 2006, the fees receivable from these funds     were $596 million and $362 million, respectively.     Additionally, the firm may invest alongside the third-party     investors in certain funds. The aggregate carrying value of the     firms interests in these funds was $12.90 billion and     $3.94 billion as of November 2007 and November 2006,     respectively. In the ordinary course of business, the firm may     also engage in other activities with these funds, including,     among others, securities lending, trade execution, trading,     custody and acquisition and bridge financing. See Note 6     for the firms commitments related to these funds.      Note 14.

These temporary differences result in     taxable or deductible amounts in future years and are measured     using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such     differences are expected to reverse.        165    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         Significant components of the firms deferred tax assets     and liabilities are set forth below:                                               As of November                  2007             2006                      (in millions)                   Deferred tax assets                                           Compensation and benefits            $       3,869               $       2,763              Other, net                997                   1,104                                                               4,866                   3,867              Valuation     allowance (1)                (112       )               (81       )                                                Total deferred tax assets                4,754                   3,786                                                    Deferred tax liabilities                                           Depreciation and amortization                1,208                   1,040              Unrealized gains                1,279                   367                                                    Total deferred tax liabilities            $       2,487               $       1,407                                                              (1)   Relates primarily to the ability to     utilize losses in various tax jurisdictions.               The firm permanently reinvests eligible earnings of certain     foreign subsidiaries and, accordingly, does not accrue any     U.S. income taxes that would arise if such earnings were     repatriated. As of November 2007, this policy resulted in an     unrecognized net deferred tax liability of $350 million     attributable to reinvested earnings of $4.97 billion.         During 2007, the valuation allowance was increased by     $31 million, primarily due to an increase in deferred tax     assets relating to net operating losses considered more likely     than not to expire unused. Net operating loss carryforwards were     $2.12 billion and $1.78 billion as of November 2007     and November 2006, respectively.         The firm had federal net operating loss carryforwards, primarily     resulting from acquisitions, of $139 million and     $203 million as of November 2007 and November 2006,     respectively. The firm recorded a related net deferred income     tax asset of $44 million and $69 million as of     November 2007 and November 2006, respectively. These     carryforwards are subject to annual limitations on utilization     and will begin to expire in 2011.         The firm had state and local net operating loss carryforwards,     primarily resulting from acquisitions, of $1.62 billion and     $1.52 billion as of November 2007 and November 2006,     respectively. The firm recorded a related net deferred income     tax asset of $21 million and $31 million as of     November 2007 and November 2006, respectively. These     carryforwards are subject to annual limitations on utilization     and will begin to expire in 2012.         The firm had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of     $306 million and $50 million as of November 2007 and     November 2006, respectively. The firm recorded a related net     deferred income tax asset of $84 million and     $13 million as of November 2007 and November 2006,     respectively. These carryforwards are subject to limitation on     utilization and can be carried forward indefinitely.        166    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         The firm is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal     Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing authorities in     jurisdictions where the firm has significant business     operations, such as the United Kingdom, Japan, Korea and various     states, such as New York. During fiscal 2007, the IRS     substantially concluded its examination of fiscal years 2003 and     2004 and the firm does not expect that potential additional     assessments from this examination will be material to its     results of operations. The firm expects the IRS examination of     the firms 2005 and 2006 fiscal years will begin during     2008. Tax reserves have been established, which the firm     believes are adequate in relation to the potential for     additional assessments. The resolution of tax matters is not     expected to have a material effect on the firms financial     condition but may be material to the firms operating     results for a particular period, depending, in part, upon the     operating results for that period and the firms effective     tax rate for that period.         A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax     rate to the firms effective income tax rate is set forth     below:                                                           Year Ended November                  2007             2006             2005                    U.S. federal statutory income tax rate                35.0       %               35.0       %               35.0       %          Increase related to state and local taxes, net of U.S. income     tax effects                1.8                   1.6                   1.6              Tax credits                (0.5       )               (0.6       )               (1.6       )          Foreign operations                (1.6       )               (1.3       )               (1.2       )          Tax-exempt income, including dividends                (0.4       )               (0.4       )               (0.6       )          Other                (0.2       )               0.2        (1)               (1.2       )                                                                Effective income tax rate                34.1       %               34.5       %               32.0       %                                                                          (1)   Primarily includes the effect of     audit settlements.               Tax benefits of approximately $908 million in November     2007, $653 million in November 2006 and $272 million     in November 2005, related to the delivery of common stock     underlying restricted stock units and the exercise of options,     were credited directly to Additional paid-in capital     in the consolidated statements of financial condition and     changes in shareholders equity.        167    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)        Note 15.  Regulation          The firm is regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange     Commission as a Consolidated Supervised Entity (CSE). As such,     it is subject to group-wide supervision and examination by the     SEC and to minimum capital standards on a consolidated basis. As     of November 2007 and November 2006, the firm was in     compliance with the CSE capital standards.         The firms principal U.S. regulated subsidiaries     include Goldman, Sachs & Co. (GS&Co.) and Goldman     Sachs Execution & Clearing, L.P. (GSEC). GS&Co.     and GSEC are registered U.S.     broker-dealers     and futures commission merchants subject to     Rule 15c3-1     of the SEC and Rule 1.17 of the Commodity Futures Trading     Commission, which specify uniform minimum net capital     requirements, as defined, for their registrants, and also     require that a significant part of the registrants assets     be kept in relatively liquid form. GS&Co. and GSEC have     elected to compute their minimum capital requirements in     accordance with the Alternative Net Capital     Requirement as permitted by     Rule 15c3-1.     As of November 2007 and November 2006, GS&Co. and GSEC had     net capital in excess of their minimum capital requirements. In     addition to its alternative minimum net capital requirements,     GS&Co. is also required to hold tentative net capital in     excess of $1 billion and net capital in excess of     $500 million in accordance with the market and credit risk     standards of Appendix E of     Rule 15c3-1.     GS&Co. is also required to notify the SEC in the event that     its tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. As of     November 2007 and November 2006, GS&Co. had tentative net     capital and net capital in excess of both the minimum and the     notification requirements.         GS Bank USA, a wholly owned industrial bank, is regulated by the     Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the State of Utah     Department of Financial Institutions and is subject to minimum     capital requirements. As of November 2007, GS Bank USA was in     compliance with all regulatory capital requirements.     Substantially all of the firms bank deposits as of     November 2007 consisted of U.S. dollar-denominated savings     accounts at GS Bank USA. Savings accounts at GS Bank USA have no     stated maturity and can be withdrawn upon short notice. The     weighted average interest rates for savings deposits were 4.71%     and 5.17% as of November 2007 and November 2006, respectively.     The carrying value of savings deposits approximated fair value     as of November 2007 and November 2006.         The firm has U.S. insurance subsidiaries that are subject     to state insurance regulation and oversight in the states in     which they are domiciled and in the other states in which they     are licensed. In addition, certain of the firms insurance     subsidiaries are regulated by the Bermuda Registrar of     Companies. The firms insurance subsidiaries were in     compliance with all regulatory capital requirements as of     November 2007 and November 2006.         The firms principal     non-U.S. regulated     subsidiaries include Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and     Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL). GSI, the firms     regulated U.K. broker-dealer, is subject to the capital     requirements of the U.K.s Financial Services Authority.     GSJCL, the firms regulated Japanese broker-dealer, is     subject to the capital requirements of Japans Financial     Services Agency. As of November 2007 and November 2006, GSI and     GSJCL were in compliance with their local capital adequacy     requirements. Certain other     non-U.S. subsidiaries     of the firm are also subject to capital adequacy requirements     promulgated by authorities of the countries in which they     operate. As of November 2007 and November 2006, these     subsidiaries were in compliance with their local capital     adequacy requirements.         The regulatory requirements referred to above restrict Group     Inc.s ability to withdraw capital from its regulated     subsidiaries. As of November 2007, approximately     $18.10 billion of net assets of regulated subsidiaries were     restricted as to the payment of dividends to Group Inc.        168    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)        Note 16.  Business     Segments          In reporting to management, the firms operating results     are categorized into the following three business segments:     Investment Banking, Trading and Principal Investments, and Asset     Management and Securities Services.     Basis of     Presentation         In reporting segments, certain of the firms business lines     have been aggregated where they have similar economic     characteristics and are similar in each of the following areas:     (i) the nature of the services they provide,     (ii) their methods of distribution, (iii) the types of     clients they serve and (iv) the regulatory environments in     which they operate.         The cost drivers of the firm taken as a whole      compensation, headcount and levels of business     activity  are broadly similar in each of the     firms business segments. Compensation and benefits     expenses within the firms segments reflect, among other     factors, the overall performance of the firm as well as the     performance of individual business units. Consequently, pre-tax     margins in one segment of the firms business may be     significantly affected by the performance of the firms     other business segments.         The firm allocates revenues and expenses among the three     business segments. Due to the integrated nature of these     segments, estimates and judgments have been made in allocating     certain revenue and expense items. Transactions between segments     are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates.     Total operating expenses include corporate items that have not     been allocated to individual business segments. The allocation     process is based on the manner in which management views the     business of the firm.         The segment information presented in the table below is prepared     according to the following methodologies:                         Revenues and expenses directly associated with each segment are     included in determining pre-tax earnings.                    Net revenues in the firms segments include allocations of     interest income and interest expense to specific securities,     commodities and other positions in relation to the cash     generated by, or funding requirements of, such underlying     positions. Net interest is included within segment net revenues     as it is consistent with the way in which management assesses     segment performance.                    Overhead expenses not directly allocable to specific segments     are allocated ratably based on direct segment expenses.          169    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     Segment     Operating Results         Management believes that the following information provides a     reasonable representation of each segments contribution to     consolidated pre-tax earnings and total assets:                                                                         As of or for the Year Ended November                          2007             2006             2005                              (in millions)               Investment            Net revenues           $       7,555               $       5,629               $       3,671          Banking            Operating expenses               4,985                   4,062                   3,258                                                                                   Pre-tax earnings           $       2,570               $       1,567               $       413                                                                                   Segment assets           $       5,526               $       4,967               $       4,869                                                                        Trading and Principal            Net revenues           $       31,226               $       25,562               $       16,818          Investments            Operating expenses               17,998                   14,962                   10,600                                                                                   Pre-tax earnings           $       13,228               $       10,600               $       6,218                                                                                   Segment assets           $       744,647               $       566,499               $       505,536                                                                        Asset Management and            Net revenues           $       7,206               $       6,474               $       4,749          Securities Services            Operating expenses               5,363                   4,036                   3,070                                                                                   Pre-tax earnings           $       1,843               $       2,438               $       1,679                                                                                   Segment assets           $       369,623               $       266,735               $       196,399                                                                        Total            Net     revenues (1)           $       45,987               $       37,665               $       25,238                     Operating     expenses (2)               28,383                   23,105                   16,965                                                                                   Pre-tax     earnings (3)           $       17,604               $       14,560               $       8,273                                                                                   Total assets           $       1,119,796               $       838,201               $       706,804                                                                                      (1)   Net revenues include net interest     as set forth in the table below:                                                                 Year Ended November                  2007             2006             2005                      (in millions)                   Investment Banking            $                      $       16               $       72              Trading and Principal Investments                1,512                   1,535                   1,366              Asset Management and Securities Services                2,475                   1,947                   1,659                                                                    Total net interest            $       3,987               $       3,498               $       3,097                                                                           (2)   Operating expenses include net     provisions for a number of litigation and regulatory proceedings     of $37 million, $45 million and $37 million for     the years ended November 2007, November 2006 and November 2005,     respectively, that have not been allocated to the firms     segments.

Since a significant     portion of the firms activities require cross-border     coordination in order to facilitate the needs of the firms     clients, the methodology for allocating the firms     profitability to geographic regions is dependent on the judgment     of management.         Geographic results are generally allocated as follows:                         Investment Banking: location of the client and investment     banking team.                    Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities, and Equities: location     of the trading desk.                    Principal Investments: location of the investment.                    Asset Management: location of the sales team.                    Securities Services: location of the primary market for the     underlying security.           The following table sets forth the total net revenues and     pre-tax earnings of the firm and its consolidated subsidiaries     by geographic region allocated on the methodology described     above, as well as the percentage of total net revenues and total     pre-tax earnings for each geographic region:                                                                                               Year Ended November                  2007             2006             2005                      ($ in millions)                   Net revenues                                                                                                           Americas (1)            $       23,412                   51       %           $       20,361                   54       %           $       14,639                   58       %          EMEA (2)                13,538                   29                   9,354                   25                   6,063                   24              Asia                9,037                   20                   7,950                   21                   4,536                   18                                                                                                                    Total net revenues            $       45,987                   100       %           $       37,665                   100       %           $       25,238                   100       %                                                                                                                Pre-tax earnings                                                                                                           Americas (1)            $       7,673                   43       %           $       7,515                   52       %           $       4,977                   60       %          EMEA (2)                5,458                   31                   3,075                   21                   1,457                   17              Asia                4,510                   26                   4,015                   27                   1,876                   23              Corporate (3)                (37       )                                  (45       )                                  (37       )                                                                                                                                   Total pre-tax earnings            $       17,604                   100       %           $       14,560                   100       %           $       8,273                   100       %                                                                                                                          (1)   Substantially all relates to U.S.     results.

(PARENT COMPANY ONLY)  NOTES TO CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS           Note 1.     Significant     Accounting Policies       Basis of     Presentation          The condensed nonconsolidated financial statements of The     Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the parent company), a Delaware     corporation, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated     financial statements of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and     subsidiaries (the firm) and notes thereto (the consolidated     financial statements), which are included in Part II,     Item 8 of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     These condensed nonconsolidated financial statements reflect the     results of operations, financial condition and cash flows for     the parent company only. Investments in subsidiaries are     accounted for using the equity method of accounting prescribed     by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 18,     The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common     Stock. For investments, other than investments in     subsidiaries, acquired subsequent to the firms adoption of     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 159,     The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial     Liabilities, at the beginning of 2007, the parent company     generally has elected to apply the fair value option in     accounting for such investments. See Notes 2 and 3 to the     consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8     of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for information regarding the firms accounting under     SFAS No. 159.         Unless otherwise stated herein, all references to November 2007,     November 2006 and November 2005 refer to the parent     companys fiscal years ended, or the dates, as the context     requires, November 30, 2007, November 24, 2006 and     November 25, 2005, respectively. Certain reclassifications     have been made to previously reported amounts to conform to the     current presentation.         The parent companys significant accounting policies are     identical to those used by the firm, to the extent applicable to     the parent companys activities. For further information     regarding the firms significant accounting policies, refer     to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     Use of     Estimates         These condensed nonconsolidated financial statements have been     prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting     principles that require management to make certain estimates and     assumptions. The most important of these estimates and     assumptions relate to fair value measurements, the accounting     for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets and the     provision for potential losses that may arise from litigation     and regulatory proceedings and tax audits. Although these and     other estimates and assumptions are based on the best available     information, actual results could be materially different from     these estimates.     Financing of     Subsidiaries         Substantially all of the firms unsecured funding is raised     by the parent company. The parent company then lends the     necessary funds to its subsidiaries, some of which are     regulated, to meet their asset financing and capital     requirements. In addition, the parent company provides its     regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their     regulatory requirements. Such funding is included in Loans     to subsidiaries and Subordinated loans to     subsidiaries in the condensed nonconsolidated statements     of financial condition. Intercompany exposure is managed by     requiring senior and subordinated intercompany loans to have     maturities equal to or shorter than the maturities of the        F-5    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC.     (PARENT COMPANY ONLY)      NOTES TO CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS (Continued)           aggregate borrowings of the parent company. This policy ensures     that the subsidiaries obligations to the parent company     will generally mature in advance of the parent companys     third-party borrowings. In addition, many of the subsidiaries     pledge collateral at loan value to cover their intercompany     borrowings (other than subordinated debt) in order to mitigate     parent company liquidity risk. Equity investments in     subsidiaries are generally funded with equity capital and     included in Investments in subsidiaries in the     condensed nonconsolidated statements of financial condition.         The parent company enters into derivative contracts with     subsidiaries to hedge its net investment in     non-U.S. operations     and to manage the interest rate and currency exposure on its     unsecured     long-term     borrowings and certain unsecured short-term borrowings. To     manage exposure on its borrowings, the parent company uses     derivatives to effectively convert a substantial portion of its     unsecured long-term borrowings into U.S. dollar-based     floating rate obligations. The parent company applies fair value     hedge accounting to derivative contracts that hedge the     benchmark interest rate (i.e., London Interbank Offered Rate     (LIBOR)) on its fixed rate unsecured long-term borrowings.     Derivative balances with subsidiaries, included in     Financial instruments owned, at fair value and     Financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased, at fair     value in the condensed nonconsolidated statements of     financial condition, were $15.10 billion and     $620 million, and $6.16 billion and $347 million,     as of November 2007 and November 2006, respectively.         Interest income is largely generated from loans made to     subsidiaries.         The parent company also allocates substantially all rental and     other costs relating to properties occupied by certain     subsidiaries. The parent company additionally allocates the cost     of share-based compensation programs to subsidiaries relating to     costs associated with employees of those subsidiaries.           Note 2.     Unsecured     Short-Term Borrowings           The parent company obtains third-party unsecured short-term     borrowings primarily through the issuance of promissory notes,     commercial paper and hybrid financial instruments. As of     November 2007 and November 2006, these borrowings were     $46.58 billion and $32.63 billion, respectively. Such     amounts include the portion of third-party unsecured long-term     borrowings maturing within one year of the financial statement     date and third-party unsecured long-term borrowings that are     redeemable within one year of the financial statement date at     the option of the holder. The parent company accounts for     promissory notes, commercial paper and certain hybrid financial     instruments at fair value under SFAS No. 155,     Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial     Instruments  an amendment of FASB statements     No. 133 and 140, or SFAS No. 159. See     Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for information regarding the firms accounting under     SFAS No. 155 and SFAS No. 159. Third-party     short-term     borrowings that are not recorded at fair value are recorded     based on the amount of cash received plus accrued interest, and     such amounts approximate fair value due to the short-term nature     of the obligations.

The weighted     average interest rates as of November 2007 and November 2006     excluded financial instruments accounted for at fair value under     SFAS No. 155 or SFAS No. 159.           In addition, the parent company may obtain unsecured short-term     borrowings from certain subsidiaries. As of November 2007 and     November 2006, such amounts were $5.14 billion and     $1.54 billion, respectively, and included in     Unsecured short-term borrowings  With     subsidiaries in the condensed nonconsolidated statements     of financial condition.     Note 3.  Unsecured     Long-Term Borrowings         The parent companys third-party unsecured long-term     borrowings extend through 2043 and consist principally of senior     borrowings. As of November 2007 and November 2006, these     borrowings were $157.00 billion and $119.04 billion,     respectively. The parent company accounts for certain of these     unsecured long-term borrowings at fair value under     SFAS No. 155 or SFAS No. 159 and applies     fair value hedge accounting to certain of these unsecured     long-term borrowings under SFAS No. 133,     Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging     Activities. See Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated     financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual     Report on     Form 10-K     for information regarding the firms accounting under     SFAS No. 133, SFAS No. 155 and     SFAS No. 159.

As of both November 2007 and     November 2006, interest rates on     non-U.S.     dollar fixed rate obligations ranged from 0.67% to 8.88%.

(2)         Unsecured long-term borrowings that     are repayable prior to maturity at the option of the parent     company are reflected at their contractual maturity dates.
