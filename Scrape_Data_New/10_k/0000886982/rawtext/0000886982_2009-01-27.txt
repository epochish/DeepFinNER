Business        Introduction          Goldman Sachs is a bank holding company and a leading global     investment banking, securities and investment management firm     that provides a wide range of services worldwide to a     substantial and diversified client base that includes     corporations, financial institutions, governments and     high-net-worth     individuals. Goldman Sachs is the successor to a commercial     paper business founded in 1869 by Marcus Goldman. On     May 7, 1999, we converted from a partnership to a     corporation and completed an initial public offering of our     common stock. On September 21, 2008, The Goldman Sachs     Group, Inc. (Group Inc.) became a bank holding company regulated     by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal     Reserve Board) under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of     1956 (BHC Act). Our depository institution subsidiary, Goldman     Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank USA), became a New York State-chartered     bank on November 28, 2008.         Our activities are divided into three segments:     (i) Investment Banking, (ii) Trading and Principal     Investments and (iii) Asset Management and Securities     Services.         All references to 2008, 2007 and 2006 refer to our fiscal years     ended, or the dates, as the context requires,     November 28, 2008, November 30, 2007 and     November 24, 2006, respectively. When we use the terms     Goldman Sachs, the firm, we,     us and our, we mean The Goldman Sachs     Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated     subsidiaries. References herein to our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     are to our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2008.         On December 15, 2008, our Board of Directors approved     a change in our fiscal year-end from the last Friday of November     to the last Friday of December. The change is effective for our     2009 fiscal year. Our 2009 fiscal year began     December 27, 2008 and will end     December 25, 2009, resulting in a     one-month     transition period that began November 29, 2008 and     ended December 26, 2008. Information on this     one-month     transition period will be included in our Quarterly Report on     Form 10-Q     for the three months ended March 27, 2009.         Financial information concerning our business segments and     geographic regions for each of 2008, 2007 and 2006 is set forth     in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial     Condition and Results of Operations, the consolidated     financial statements and the notes thereto, and the supplemental     financial information, which are in Part II, Items 7,     7A and 8 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K.

We make available free of     charge, on or through the investor relations section of our web     site, annual reports on     Form 10-K,     quarterly reports on     Form 10-Q     and current reports on     Form 8-K     and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to     Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the U.S. Securities Exchange     Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), as well as proxy statements, as soon     as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such     material with, or furnish it to, the U.S. Securities and     Exchange Commission. Also posted on our web site, and available     in print upon request of any shareholder to our Investor     Relations Department, are our certificate of incorporation and     by-laws, charters for our Audit Committee, Compensation     Committee, and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee,     our Policy Regarding Director Independence Determinations, our     Policy on Reporting of Concerns Regarding Accounting and Other     Matters, our Corporate Governance Guidelines and our Code of     Business Conduct and Ethics governing our directors, officers     and employees. Within the time period required by the SEC and     the New York Stock Exchange, we will post on our web site any     amendment to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and any     waiver applicable to any executive officer, director or senior     financial officer (as defined in the Code). In addition, our web     site includes information concerning purchases and sales of our     equity securities by our executive officers and directors, as     well as disclosure relating to certain     non-GAAP     financial measures (as defined in the SECs     Regulation G) that we may make public orally,     telephonically, by webcast, by broadcast or by similar means     from time to time.         Our Investor Relations Department can be contacted at The     Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., 85 Broad Street, 17th Floor, New     York, New York 10004, Attn: Investor Relations, telephone:     212-902-0300, e-mail: gs-investor-relations@gs.com.        1    Table of Contents      Cautionary     Statement Pursuant to the U.S. Private Securities     Litigation Reform Act of 1995          We have included or incorporated by reference in our Annual     Report on     Form 10-K,     and from time to time our management may make, statements that     may constitute forward-looking statements within the     meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private     Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking     statements are not historical facts but instead represent only     our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their     nature, are inherently uncertain and outside our control. These     statements include statements other than historical information     or statements of current condition and may relate to our future     plans and objectives and results, among other things, and may     also include our belief regarding the effect of various legal     proceedings, as set forth under Legal Proceedings in     Part I, Item 3 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K,     as well as statements about the objectives and effectiveness of     our risk management and liquidity policies, statements about     trends in or growth opportunities for our businesses, statements     about our future status, activities or reporting under     U.S. banking regulation, and statements about our     investment banking transaction backlog, in Part II,     Item 7 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     By identifying these statements for you in this manner, we are     alerting you to the possibility that our actual results and     financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the     anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these     forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause     our actual results and financial condition to differ from those     indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among     others, those discussed below and under Risk Factors     in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K.         In the case of statements about our investment banking     transaction backlog, such statements are subject to the risk     that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that     they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues,     if any, that we actually earn from these transactions may     differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected.     Important factors that could result in a modification of the     terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed     include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or     continued weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of     hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or     an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the     securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions,     a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain     adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a     party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required     regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors     that could adversely affect our investment banking transactions,     see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our     Annual Report on     Form 10-K.        2    Table of Contents      Segment Operating     Results (in     millions)                                                                               Year Ended November                     2008       2007       2006           Investment            Net revenues           $       5,185               $       7,555               $       5,629          Banking            Operating expenses               3,143                   4,985                   4,062                                                                                   Pre-tax earnings           $       2,042               $       2,570               $       1,567                                                                        Trading and Principal            Net revenues           $       9,063               $       31,226               $       25,562          Investments            Operating expenses               11,808                   17,998                   14,962                                                                               Pre-tax     earnings/(loss)           $       (2,745       )           $       13,228               $       10,600                                                                        Asset Management and            Net revenues           $       7,974               $       7,206               $       6,474          Securities Services            Operating expenses               4,939                   5,363                   4,036                                                                                   Pre-tax earnings           $       3,035               $       1,843               $       2,438                                                                        Total            Net revenues           $       22,222               $       45,987               $       37,665                     Operating     expenses (1)               19,886                   28,383                   23,105                                                                               Pre-tax     earnings           $       2,336               $       17,604               $       14,560                                                                                      (1)   Operating expenses include net     provisions for a number of litigation and regulatory proceedings     of $(4) million, $37 million and $45 million for the     years ended November 2008, November 2007 and     November 2006, respectively, that have not been allocated     to our segments.              3    Table of Contents      Where We Conduct     Business          As of November 28, 2008, we operated offices in over     30 countries and 43% of our 30,067 employees were based outside     the Americas (which includes the countries in North and South     America). In 2008, we derived 30% of our net revenues outside of     the Americas. See geographic information in Note 18 to the     consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8     of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K.         Our clients are located worldwide, and we are an active     participant in financial markets around the world. We have     developed and continue to build strong investment banking     relationships in new and developing markets. We also continue to     expand our presence throughout these markets to invest     strategically when opportunities arise and to work more closely     with our private wealth and asset management clients in these     regions. Our global reach is illustrated by the following:                         we are a member of and an active participant in most of the     worlds major stock, options and futures exchanges and     marketplaces;                    we are a primary dealer in many of the largest government bond     markets around the world;                    we have interbank dealer status in currency markets around the     world;                    we are a member of or have relationships with major commodities     exchanges worldwide; and                    we have commercial banking or deposit-taking institutions     organized or operating in the United States, the United Kingdom,     Ireland, Brazil, Switzerland, Germany, France, Russia and South     Korea.           Our businesses are supported by our Global Investment Research     division, which, as of November 2008, provided research     coverage of over 3,250 companies worldwide and over 45 national     economies, and maintained a presence in locations around the     world.         We continue to expand our geographic reach. For example, in     recent years we have opened offices in Mumbai, Moscow, Sao     Paulo, Dubai, Qatar, Riyadh and Tel Aviv, become licensed as a     broker-dealer     in Russia, India and China, opened banks in Brazil, Ireland and     Russia and entered into the asset management business in South     Korea and India.        4    Table of Contents      Business     Segments          The primary products and activities of our business segments are     set forth in the following chart:                       Business     Segment/Component           Primary Products and     Activities      Investment Banking:                   Financial Advisory                   Mergers and acquisitions advisory services                         Financial restructuring advisory services                         Underwriting                   Equity and debt underwriting                               Trading and Principal Investments:                   Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities                   Commodities and commodity derivatives,     including power generation and related activities                         Credit products, including trading and     investing in credit derivatives, investment-grade corporate     securities, high-yield securities, bank and secured loans,     municipal securities, emerging market and distressed debt,     public and private equity securities and real estate                         Currencies and currency derivatives                         Interest rate products, including interest     rate derivatives, global government securities and money market     instruments, including matched book positions                         Mortgage-related securities and loan products     and other asset-backed instruments                         Equities                   Equity securities and derivatives                         Securities, futures and options clearing     services                         Market-making and specialist activities in     equity securities and options                         Insurance activities                         Principal Investments                   Principal investments in connection with     merchant banking activities                         Investment in the ordinary shares of     Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited                               Asset Management and Securities Services:                   Asset Management                   Investment advisory services, financial     planning and investment products (primarily through separately     managed accounts and commingled vehicles) across all major asset     classes, including money markets, fixed income, equities and     alternative investments (including hedge funds, private equity,     real estate, currencies, commodities and asset allocation     strategies), for institutional and individual investors     (including     high-net-worth     clients, as well as retail clients through third-party channels)                         Management of merchant banking funds                         Securities Services                   Prime brokerage                         Financing services                         Securities lending                                     5    Table of Contents   Investment     Banking         Investment Banking represented 23% of 2008 net revenues. We     provide a broad range of investment banking services to a     diverse group of corporations, financial institutions,     investment funds, governments and individuals and seek to     develop and maintain     long-term     relationships with these clients as their lead investment bank.         Our current structure, which is organized by regional, industry     and product groups, seeks to combine client-focused investment     bankers with execution and industry expertise. We continually     assess and adapt our organization to meet the demands of our     clients in each geographic region. Through our commitment to     teamwork, we believe that we provide services in an integrated     fashion for the benefit of our clients.         Our goal is to make available to our clients the entire     resources of the firm in a seamless fashion, with investment     banking serving as front of the house. To accomplish     this objective, we focus on coordination among our equity and     debt underwriting activities and our corporate risk and     liability management activities. This coordination is intended     to assist our investment banking clients in managing their asset     and liability exposures and their capital.         Our Investment Banking segment is divided into two components:     Financial Advisory and Underwriting.     Financial     Advisory         Financial Advisory includes advisory assignments with respect to     mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense     activities, restructurings and     spin-offs.     Our mergers and acquisitions capabilities are evidenced by our     significant share of assignments in large, complex transactions     for which we provide multiple services, including     one-stop     acquisition financing and cross-border structuring expertise, as     well as services in other areas of the firm, such as interest     rate and currency hedging. In particular, a significant number     of the loan commitments and bank and bridge loan facilities that     we enter into arise in connection with our advisory assignments.     Underwriting         Underwriting includes public offerings and private placements of     a wide range of securities and other financial instruments,     including common and preferred stock, convertible and     exchangeable securities,     investment-grade     debt,     high-yield     debt, sovereign and emerging market debt, municipal debt, bank     loans,     asset-backed     securities and real estate-related securities, such as     mortgage-related     securities and the securities of real estate investment trusts.     Equity Underwriting.  Equity underwriting has     been a     long-term     core strength of Goldman Sachs. As with mergers and     acquisitions, we have been particularly successful in winning     mandates for large, complex transactions. We believe our     leadership in worldwide initial public offerings and worldwide     public common stock offerings reflects our expertise in complex     transactions, prior experience and distribution capabilities.     Debt Underwriting.  We engage in the     underwriting and origination of various types of debt     instruments, including     investment-grade     debt securities,     high-yield     debt securities, bank and bridge loans and emerging market debt     securities, which may be issued by, among others, corporate,     sovereign and agency issuers. In addition, we underwrite and     originate structured securities, which include     mortgage-related     securities and other     asset-backed     securities and collateralized debt obligations.        6    Table of Contents   Trading and     Principal Investments         Trading and Principal Investments represented 41% of 2008 net     revenues. Trading and Principal Investments facilitates client     transactions with a diverse group of corporations, financial     institutions, investment funds, governments and individuals and     takes proprietary positions through market making in, trading of     and investing in fixed income and equity products, currencies,     commodities and derivatives on these products. In addition, we     engage in     market-making     and specialist activities on equities and options exchanges, and     we clear client transactions on major stock, options and futures     exchanges worldwide. In connection with our merchant banking and     other investing activities, we make principal investments     directly and through funds that we raise and manage.         To meet the needs of our clients, Trading and Principal     Investments is diversified across a wide range of products. We     believe our willingness and ability to take risk to facilitate     client transactions distinguishes us from many of our     competitors and substantially enhances our client relationships.         Our Trading and Principal Investments segment is divided into     three components: Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities;     Equities; and Principal Investments.     Fixed Income,     Currency and Commodities and Equities         Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and Equities are     large and diversified operations through which we engage in a     variety of client-driven and proprietary trading and investing     activities.         In our client-driven businesses, FICC and Equities strive to     deliver     high-quality     service by offering broad     market-making     and market knowledge to our clients on a global basis. In     addition, we use our expertise to take positions in markets, by     committing capital and taking risk, to facilitate client     transactions and to provide liquidity. Our willingness to make     markets, commit capital and take risk in a broad range of fixed     income, currency, commodity and equity products and their     derivatives is crucial to our client relationships and to     support our underwriting business by providing secondary market     liquidity.         We generate trading net revenues from our client-driven     businesses in three ways:                         First, in large, highly liquid markets, we undertake a high     volume of transactions for modest spreads and fees.                    Second, by capitalizing on our strong relationships and capital     position, we undertake transactions in less liquid markets where     spreads and fees are generally larger.                    Finally, we structure and execute transactions that address     complex client needs.           Our FICC and Equities businesses operate in close coordination     to provide clients with services and cross-market knowledge and     expertise.         In our proprietary activities in both FICC and Equities, we     assume a variety of risks and devote resources to identify,     analyze and benefit from these exposures. We capitalize on our     analytical models to analyze information and make informed     trading judgments, and we seek to benefit from perceived     disparities in the value of assets in the trading markets and     from macroeconomic and issuer-specific trends.        7    Table of Contents   FICC         We make markets in and trade interest rate and credit products,     mortgage-related     securities and loan products and other     asset-backed     instruments, currencies and commodities, structure and enter     into a wide variety of derivative transactions, and engage in     proprietary trading and investing. FICC has five principal     businesses: commodities; credit products; currencies; interest     rate products, including money market instruments; and     mortgage-related     securities and loan products and other     asset-backed     instruments.     Commodities.  We enter into trades with our     clients in, make markets in, and trade for our own account a     wide variety of commodities, commodity derivatives and interests     in commodity-related assets, including oil and oil products,     metals, natural gas and electricity, and forest products. As     part of our commodities business, we acquire and dispose of     interests in, and engage in the development and operation of,     electric power generation facilities and related activities.     Credit Products.  We offer to and trade for our     clients a broad array of credit and     credit-linked     products all over the world, including credit derivatives,     investment-grade     corporate securities,     high-yield     securities, bank and secured loans (origination and trading),     municipal securities, and emerging market and distressed debt.     For example, we enter, as principal, into complex structured     transactions designed to meet client needs.         In addition, we provide credit through bridge and other loan     facilities to a broad range of clients. Commitments that are     extended for contingent acquisition financing are often intended     to be     short-term     in nature, as borrowers often seek to replace them with other     funding sources. As part of our ongoing credit origination     activities, we may seek to reduce our credit risk on commitments     by syndicating all or substantial portions of commitments to     other investors or, upon funding, by securitizing the positions     through investment vehicles sold to other investors.     Underwriting fees from syndications of these commitments are     recorded in debt underwriting in our Investment Banking segment.     However, to the extent that we recognize losses on these     commitments, such losses are recorded within our Trading and     Principal Investments segment, net of any related underwriting     fees. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of     Financial Condition and Results of Operations      Contractual Obligations and Commitments in Part II,     Item 7 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for additional information on our commitments.         Our credit products business includes making significant     long-term     and     short-term     investments for our own account (sometimes investing together     with our merchant banking funds) in a broad array of asset     classes (including distressed debt) globally. We     opportunistically invest in debt and equity securities and     secured loans, and in private equity, real estate and other     assets.     Currencies.  We act as a dealer in foreign     exchange and trade for our clients and ourselves in most     currencies on exchanges and in cash and derivative markets     globally.     Interest Rate Products.  We trade and make     markets in a variety of interest rate products, including     interest rate swaps, options and other derivatives, and     government bonds, as well as money market instruments, such as     commercial paper, treasury bills, repurchase agreements and     other highly liquid securities and instruments. This business     includes our matched book, which consists of     short-term     collateralized financing transactions.     Mortgage Business.  We make markets in and     trade for our clients and ourselves commercial and residential     mortgage-related     securities and loan products (including agency prime and     non-agency prime,     Alt-A and     subprime mortgages) and other     asset-backed     and derivative instruments. We acquire positions in these     products for proprietary trading purposes as well as for     securitization or syndication. We also originate and service     commercial and residential mortgages.        8    Table of Contents   Equities         We make markets in and trade equities and     equity-related     products, structure and enter into equity derivative     transactions, and engage in proprietary trading. We generate     commissions from executing and clearing client transactions on     major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide through our     Equities client franchise and clearing activities.         Equities includes two principal businesses: our client franchise     business and principal strategies. We also engage in specialist     and insurance activities.     Client Franchise Business.  Our client     franchise business includes primarily client-driven activities     in the shares, equity derivatives and convertible securities     markets. These activities also include clearing client     transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges     worldwide, as well as our options specialist and     market-making     businesses. Our client franchise business increasingly involves     providing our clients with access to electronic     low-touch     equity trading platforms, and electronic trades account for the     majority of our client trading activity in this business.     However, a majority of our net revenues in this business     continues to be derived from our traditional     high-touch     handling of more complex trades. We expect both types of trading     activities to remain important components of our client     franchise business.         We trade equity securities and     equity-related     products, including convertible securities, options, futures and     over-the-counter     (OTC) derivative instruments, on a global basis as an agent, as     a market maker or otherwise as a principal. As a principal, we     facilitate client transactions, often by committing capital and     taking risk, to provide liquidity to clients with large blocks     of stocks or options. For example, we are active in the     execution of large block trades. We also execute transactions as     agent and offer clients direct electronic access to trading     markets.         In the options and futures markets, we structure, distribute and     execute derivatives on market indices, industry groups,     financial measures and individual company stocks to facilitate     client transactions and our proprietary activities. We develop     strategies and render advice with respect to portfolio hedging     and restructuring and asset allocation transactions. We also     create specially tailored instruments to enable sophisticated     investors to undertake hedging strategies and to establish or     liquidate investment positions. We are one of the leading     participants in the trading and development of equity derivative     instruments. In options, we are a specialist     and/or     market maker on the International Securities Exchange, the     Chicago Board Options Exchange, NYSE Arca, the Boston Options     Exchange, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, NYSE Alternext US and     the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.     Principal Strategies.  Our principal strategies     business is a multi-strategy investment business that invests     and trades our capital across global markets. Investment     strategies include fundamental equities and relative value     trading (which involves trading strategies designed to take     advantage of perceived discrepancies in the relative value of     financial instruments, including equity,     equity-related     and debt instruments), event-driven investments (which focus on     event-oriented special situations such as corporate     restructurings, bankruptcies, recapitalizations, mergers and     acquisitions, and legal and regulatory events), convertible bond     trading, various types of volatility trading and principal     finance.         At the start of our first fiscal quarter of 2008, we reassigned     approximately     one-half of     the traders and other personnel and transferred approximately     one-half of     the firms assets comprising our principal strategies     business to our asset management business in an effort to     strengthen and diversify our asset management offerings. These     assets are invested in an alternative investment fund managed by     our asset management business.        9    Table of Contents   Specialist Activities.  Our specialist     activities business consists of our stock and     exchange-traded     funds (ETF) specialist and     market-making     businesses. We engage in specialist and     market-making     activities on equities exchanges. In the United States, we are     one of the leading designated market makers for stocks traded on     the NYSE. For ETFs, we are registered market makers on NYSE Arca.     Insurance Activities.  Through our insurance     subsidiaries, we engage in a range of insurance and reinsurance     businesses, including buying, originating     and/or     reinsuring variable annuity and life insurance contracts,     reinsuring property catastrophe and residential homeowner risks     and providing power interruption coverage to power generating     facilities.     Principal     Investments         Principal Investments primarily represents net revenues from     three primary sources: returns on corporate and real estate     investments; overrides on corporate and real estate investments     made by merchant banking funds that we manage; and our     investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and Commercial     Bank of China Limited (ICBC).     Returns on Corporate and Real Estate     Investments.  As of November 2008, the     aggregate carrying value of our principal investments held     directly or through our merchant banking funds, excluding our     investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC, was     $15.13 billion, comprised of corporate principal     investments with an aggregate carrying value of     $12.16 billion and real estate investments with an     aggregate carrying value of $2.97 billion. In addition, as     of November 2008, we had outstanding unfunded equity     capital commitments of up to $13.47 billion, comprised of     corporate principal investment commitments of     $10.39 billion and real estate investment commitments of     $3.08 billion.     Overrides.  Consists of the increased share of     the income and gains derived from our merchant banking funds     when the return on a funds investments over the life of     the fund exceeds certain threshold returns (typically referred     to as an override). Overrides are recognized in net revenues     when all material contingencies have been resolved.     ICBC.  Our investment in the ordinary shares of     ICBC was acquired on April 28, 2006. The ordinary     shares acquired from ICBC are subject to transfer restrictions     that, among other things, prohibit any sale, disposition or     other transfer until April 28, 2009. From     April 28, 2009 to October 20, 2009, we may     transfer up to 50% of the aggregate ordinary shares of ICBC that     we owned as of October 20, 2006. We may transfer the     remaining shares after October 20, 2009. As of     November 2008, the fair value of our investment in the     ordinary shares of ICBC was $5.50 billion. A portion of our     interest is held by investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs.     For further information regarding our investment in the ordinary     shares of ICBC, see Managements Discussion and     Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of     Operations  Critical Accounting Policies      Fair Value  Cash Instruments in Part II,     Item 7 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K.        10    Table of Contents   Asset Management     and Securities Services         Asset Management and Securities Services represented 36% of 2008     net revenues. Our asset management business provides investment     advisory and financial planning services and offers investment     products (primarily through separately managed accounts and     commingled vehicles) across all major asset classes to a diverse     group of institutions and individuals worldwide and primarily     generates revenues in the form of management and incentive fees.     Securities Services provides prime brokerage services, financing     services and securities lending services to institutional     clients, including hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds and     foundations, and to     high-net-worth     individuals worldwide, and generates revenues primarily in the     form of interest rate spreads or fees.         Our Asset Management and Securities Services segment is divided     into two components: Asset Management and Securities Services.     Asset     Management         We offer a broad array of investment strategies, advice and     planning. We provide asset management services and offer     investment products (primarily through separately managed     accounts and commingled vehicles, such as mutual funds and     private investment funds) across all major asset classes: money     markets, fixed income, equities and alternative investments     (including hedge funds, private equity, real estate, currencies,     commodities and asset allocation strategies). Through our     subsidiary, The Ayco Company, L.P., we also provide fee-based     financial counseling and financial education in the United     States.         Assets under management (AUM) typically generate fees as a     percentage of asset value, which is affected by investment     performance and by inflows and redemptions. The fees that we     charge vary by asset class, as do our related expenses. In     certain circumstances, we are also entitled to receive incentive     fees based on a percentage of a funds return or when the     return on assets under management exceeds specified benchmark     returns or other performance targets. Incentive fees are     recognized when the performance period ends and they are no     longer subject to adjustment. We have numerous incentive fee     arrangements, many of which have annual performance periods that     end on December 31. For that reason, incentive fees have     been seasonally weighted to our first quarter.         AUM includes our mutual funds, alternative investment funds and     separately managed accounts for institutional and individual     investors. Alternative investments include our merchant banking     funds, which generate revenues as described below under      Management     of Merchant Banking Funds. AUM includes assets in     clients brokerage accounts to the extent that they     generate fees based on the assets in the accounts rather than     commissions on transactional activity in the accounts.         AUM does not include assets in brokerage accounts that generate     commissions,     mark-ups and     spreads based on transactional activity, or our own investments     in funds that we manage. Net revenues from these assets are     included in our Trading and Principal Investments segment. AUM     also does not include     non-fee-paying     assets, including interest-bearing deposits held through our     bank depository institution subsidiaries.        11    Table of Contents       The amount of AUM is set forth in the graph below.

Our clients are institutions and     individuals, including both     high-net-worth     and retail investors. We access institutional and     high-net-worth     clients through both direct and     third-party     channels and retail clients primarily through     third-party     channels. Our institutional clients include pension funds,     governmental organizations, corporations, insurance companies,     banks, foundations and endowments. In     third-party     distribution channels, we distribute our mutual funds,     alternative investment funds and separately managed accounts     through brokerage firms, banks, insurance companies and other     financial intermediaries.

Goldman     Sachs sponsors numerous corporate and real estate private     investment funds. As of November 2008, the amount of AUM in     these funds (including both funded amounts and unfunded     commitments on which we earn fees) was $93 billion.         Our strategy with respect to these funds generally is to invest     opportunistically to build a portfolio of investments that is     diversified by industry, product type, geographic region, and     transaction structure and type. Our corporate investment funds     pursue, on a global basis,     long-term     investments in equity and debt securities in privately     negotiated transactions, leveraged buyouts, acquisitions and     investments in funds managed by external parties. Our real     estate investment funds invest in real estate operating     companies, debt and equity interests in real estate assets, and     other real estate-related investments. In addition, our merchant     banking funds include funds that invest in infrastructure and     infrastructure-related assets and companies on a global basis.         Merchant banking activities generate three primary revenue     streams. First, we receive a management fee that is generally a     percentage of a funds committed capital, invested capital,     total gross acquisition cost or asset value. These annual     management fees are included in our Asset Management net     revenues. Second, Goldman Sachs, as a substantial investor in     some of these funds, is allocated its proportionate share of the     funds unrealized appreciation or depreciation arising from     changes in fair value as well as gains and losses upon     realization. Third, after a fund has achieved a minimum return     for fund investors, we receive an increased share of the     funds income and gains that is a percentage of the income     and gains from the funds investments. The second and third     of these revenue streams are included in Principal Investments     within our Trading and Principal Investments segment.        13    Table of Contents   Securities     Services         Securities Services provides prime brokerage services, financing     services and securities lending services to institutional     clients, including hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds and     foundations, and to     high-net-worth     individuals worldwide.     Prime brokerage services.  We offer prime     brokerage services to our clients, allowing them the flexibility     to trade with most brokers while maintaining a single source for     financing and consolidated portfolio reports. Our prime     brokerage business provides clearing and custody in 53 markets     globally and provides consolidated multi-currency accounting and     reporting, fund administration and other ancillary services.     Financing services.  A central element of our     prime brokerage business involves providing financing to our     clients for their securities trading activities through margin     and securities loans that are collateralized by securities, cash     or other acceptable collateral.     Securities lending services.  Securities     lending services principally involve the borrowing and lending     of securities to cover clients and Goldman Sachs     short sales and otherwise to make deliveries into the market. In     addition, we are an active participant in the     broker-to-broker     securities lending business and the     third-party     agency lending business. Net revenues in securities lending     services are, as a general matter, weighted toward our second     and third quarters each year due to seasonally higher activity     levels in Europe.      Global Investment     Research          Global Investment Research provides fundamental research on     companies, industries, economies, currencies and commodities and     macro strategy research on a worldwide basis.         Global Investment Research employs a team approach that as of     November 2008 provided research coverage of over 3,250     companies worldwide and over 45 national economies. This is     accomplished by the following departments:                         The Equity Research Departments provide fundamental analysis,     earnings forecasts and investment opinions for equity securities;                    The Credit Research Department provides fundamental analysis,     forecasts and investment opinions as to     investment-grade     and     high-yield     corporate bonds and credit derivatives; and                    The Global ECS Department (formed in December 2008 through     a consolidation of the Economic, Commodities and Strategy     Research Departments) formulates macroeconomic forecasts for     economic activity, foreign exchange and interest rates, provides     research on the commodity markets, and provides equity market     forecasts, opinions on both asset and industry sector     allocation, equity trading strategies, credit trading strategies     and options research.           Further information regarding research at Goldman Sachs is     provided below under  Regulation      Regulations Applicable in and Outside the United States     and Legal Proceedings  Research Independence     Matters in Part I, Item 3 of our Annual Report     on     Form 10-K.        14    Table of Contents      Business     Continuity and Information Security          Business continuity and information security are high priorities     for Goldman Sachs. Our Business Continuity Program has been     developed to provide reasonable assurance of business continuity     in the event of disruptions at the firms critical     facilities and to comply with the regulatory requirements of the     Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Because we are     a bank holding company, our Business Continuity Program will be     subject to review by the Federal Reserve Board. The key elements     of the program are crisis management, people recovery     facilities, business recovery, systems and data recovery, and     process improvement. In the area of information security, we     have developed and implemented a framework of principles,     policies and technology to protect the information assets of the     firm and our clients. Safeguards are applied to maintain the     confidentiality, integrity and availability of information     resources.      Employees          Management believes that a major strength and principal reason     for the success of Goldman Sachs is the quality and dedication     of our people and the shared sense of being part of a team. We     strive to maintain a work environment that fosters     professionalism, excellence, diversity, cooperation among our     employees worldwide and high standards of business ethics.         Instilling the Goldman Sachs culture in all employees is a     continuous process, in which training plays an important part.     All employees are offered the opportunity to participate in     education and periodic seminars that we sponsor at various     locations throughout the world. Another important part of     instilling the Goldman Sachs culture is our employee review     process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors, co-workers and     employees they supervise in a     360-degree     review process that is integral to our team approach.         As of November 2008, we had 30,067 employees, excluding     4,671 employees of certain consolidated entities that are held     for investment purposes only. Consolidated entities held for     investment purposes are entities that are held strictly for     capital appreciation, have a defined exit strategy and are     engaged in activities that are not closely related to our     principal businesses.      Competition          The financial services industry  and all of our     businesses  are intensely competitive, and we expect     them to remain so. Our competitors are other entities that     provide investment banking, securities and investment management     services, as well as those entities that make investments in     securities, commodities, derivatives, real estate, loans and     other financial assets. These entities include brokers and     dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, insurance     companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds,     private equity funds and merchant banks. We compete with some of     our competitors globally and with others on a regional, product     or niche basis. Our competition is based on a number of factors,     including transaction execution, our products and services,     innovation, reputation and price.         We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining     qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete     effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to     attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing     employees.        15    Table of Contents       Over time, there has been substantial consolidation and     convergence among companies in the financial services industry.     This trend accelerated over the course of the past year as the     credit crisis caused numerous mergers and asset acquisitions     among industry participants. Many commercial banks and other     broad-based     financial services firms have had the ability for some time to     offer a wide range of products, from loans, deposit-taking and     insurance to brokerage, asset management and investment banking     services, which may enhance their competitive position. They     also have had the ability to support investment banking and     securities products with commercial banking, insurance and other     financial services revenues in an effort to gain market share,     which has resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking     and trading businesses and could result in pricing pressure in     other of our businesses.         Moreover, we have faced, and expect to continue to face,     pressure to retain market share by committing capital to     businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may     not be commensurate with their risks. In particular, corporate     clients seek such commitments (such as agreements to participate     in their commercial paper backstop or other loan facilities)     from financial services firms in connection with investment     banking and other assignments.         We provide these commitments primarily through GS Bank USA and     its subsidiaries, including our William Street entities and     Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. With respect to most of the     William Street commitments, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group,     Inc. (SMFG) provides us with credit loss protection that is     generally limited to 95% of the first loss we realize on     approved loan commitments, up to a maximum of     $1.00 billion. In addition, subject to the satisfaction of     certain conditions, upon our request, SMFG will provide     protection for 70% of additional losses on such commitments, up     to a maximum of $1.13 billion, of which $375 million     of protection has been provided as of November 2008. We     also use other financial instruments to mitigate credit risks     related to certain William Street commitments not covered by     SMFG. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of     Financial Condition and Results of Operations      Contractual Obligations and Commitments in Part II,     Item 7 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for more information regarding the William Street entities and     for a description of the credit loss protection provided by     SMFG. An increasing number of our commitments in connection with     investment banking and other assignments do not meet the     criteria established for the William Street entities and do not     benefit from the SMFG loss protection. These commitments are     issued through GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries or our other     subsidiaries.         The trend toward consolidation and convergence has significantly     increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our     competitors. This trend has also hastened the globalization of     the securities and other financial services markets. As a     result, we have had to commit capital to support our     international operations and to execute large global     transactions. To take advantage of some of our most significant     challenges and opportunities, we will have to compete     successfully with financial institutions that are larger and     better capitalized and that may have a stronger local presence     and longer operating history outside the United States.         We have experienced intense price competition in some of our     businesses in recent years. There has been considerable pressure     in the pricing of block trades. Also, equity and debt     underwriting discounts, as well as trading spreads, have been     under pressure for a number of years and the ability to execute     trades electronically, through the internet and through     alternative trading systems, has increased the pressure on     trading commissions. It appears that this trend toward     electronic and other     low-touch, low-commission     trading will continue. We believe that we will continue to     experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the     future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by     reducing prices.        16    Table of Contents      Regulation          Goldman Sachs, as a participant in the banking, securities,     commodity futures and options and insurance industries, is     subject to extensive regulation in the United States and the     other countries in which we operate. See Risk     Factors  Our businesses and those of our clients are     subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around the     world in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for a further discussion of the effect that regulation may have     on our businesses. As a matter of public policy, regulatory     bodies around the world are charged with safeguarding the     integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with     protecting the interests of clients participating in those     markets, including depositors in U.S. depository     institutions such as GS Bank USA. They are not, however,     generally charged with protecting the interests of Goldman     Sachs shareholders or creditors.         On September 21, 2008, Group Inc. became a bank     holding company under the BHC Act. As of that date, the Federal     Reserve Board became the primary U.S. regulator of Group     Inc., as a consolidated entity. Prior to     September 21, 2008, Group Inc. was subject to     regulation by the SEC as a Consolidated Supervised Entity (CSE)     and was subject to     group-wide     supervision and examination by the SEC and to minimum capital     standards on a consolidated basis. On     September 26, 2008, the SEC announced that it was     ending the CSE program. Our principal     U.S. broker-dealer,     Goldman, Sachs & Co. (GS&Co.) remains subject to     regulation by the SEC.     Banking     Regulation     Supervision     and Regulation         As a bank holding company under the BHC Act, Group Inc. is now     subject to supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve     Board. Under the system of functional regulation     established under the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve Board     supervises Group Inc., including all of its nonbank     subsidiaries, as an umbrella regulator of the     consolidated organization and generally defers to the primary     U.S. regulators of Group Inc.s U.S. depository     institution subsidiary, as applicable, and to the other     U.S. regulators of Group Inc.s     U.S. non-depository     institution subsidiaries that regulate certain activities of     those subsidiaries. Such functionally regulated     non-depository     institution subsidiaries include     broker-dealers     registered with the SEC, insurance companies regulated by state     insurance authorities, investment advisors registered with the     SEC with respect to their investment advisory activities and     entities regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading     Commission (CFTC) with respect to certain futures-related     activities.     Activities         The BHC Act generally restricts us from engaging in business     activities other than the business of banking and certain     closely related activities. However, the BHC Act also grants a     new bank holding company, such as Group Inc., two years from the     date the entity becomes a bank holding company to comply with     the restrictions on its activities imposed by the BHC Act with     respect to any activities that it was engaged in when it became     a bank holding company. We expect that this     grandfather right will allow us to continue to     conduct our business substantially as we have in the past until     at least September 22, 2010. In addition, under the     BHC Act, we can apply to the Federal Reserve Board for up to     three     one-year     extensions.         Under the     U.S. Gramm-Leach-Bliley     Act of 1999 (GLB Act), an eligible bank holding company may     elect to become a financial holding company.     Financial holding companies may engage in a broader range of     financial and related activities than are permissible for bank     holding companies as long as they continue to meet the     eligibility requirements for financial holding companies. These     activities include underwriting, dealing and making markets in     securities, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking     investments in nonfinancial companies. In addition, the GLB Act     also allows a company that was not a bank holding company and     becomes a financial holding company after     November 12, 1999 to continue to engage in certain     commodities activities that are otherwise        17    Table of Contents       impermissible for bank holding companies if the company was     engaged in any of these activities in the United States as of     September 30, 1997 and if the assets held pursuant to     these activities do not equal 5% or more of the consolidated     assets of the bank holding company.         We intend to apply to elect to become a financial holding     company under the GLB Act as soon as practicable. Our ability to     achieve and maintain financial holding company status is     dependent on a number of factors, including our     U.S. depository institution subsidiaries continuing to     qualify as well capitalized as described under      Prompt     Corrective Action below. We do not believe that any     activities that are material to our current or currently     proposed business would be impermissible activities for us as a     financial holding company.         As a bank holding company, Group Inc. is required to obtain     prior Federal Reserve Board approval before directly or     indirectly acquiring more than 5% of any class of voting shares     of any unaffiliated depository institution. In addition, as a     bank holding company, we may generally engage in banking and     other financial activities abroad, including investing in and     owning     non-U.S. banks,     if those activities and investments do not exceed certain limits     and, in some cases, if we have obtained the prior approval of     the Federal Reserve Board.     Capital     Requirements         We are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered     by the U.S. federal banking agencies. Our bank depository     institution subsidiaries, including GS Bank USA, are subject to     similar capital guidelines. Under the Federal Reserve     Boards capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory     framework for prompt corrective action (PCA) that is applicable     to GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs and its bank depository     institution subsidiaries must meet specific capital guidelines     that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and     certain     off-balance-sheet     items as calculated under regulatory reporting practices.     Goldman Sachs and its bank depository institution     subsidiaries capital amounts, as well as GS Bank     USAs PCA classification, are also subject to qualitative     judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings     and other factors. We anticipate reporting capital ratios as     follows:                         Before we became a bank holding company, we were subject to     capital guidelines by the SEC as a CSE that were generally     consistent with those set out in the Revised Framework for the     International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital     Standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision     (Basel II). We currently compute and report our firmwide capital     ratios in accordance with the Basel II requirements as     applicable to us when we were regulated as a CSE for the purpose     of assessing the adequacy of our capital. We expect to continue     to report to investors for a period of time our Basel II capital     ratios as applicable to us when we were regulated as a CSE.                    The regulatory capital guidelines currently applicable to bank     holding companies are based on the Capital Accord of the Basel     Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel I), with Basel II to be     phased in over time. We are currently working with the Federal     Reserve Board to put in place the appropriate reporting and     compliance mechanisms and methodologies to allow reporting of     the Basel I capital ratios as of the end of March 2009.                    In addition, we are currently working to implement the Basel II     framework as applicable to us as a bank holding company (as     opposed to as a CSE). U.S. banking regulators have     incorporated the Basel II framework into the existing     risk-based     capital requirements by requiring that internationally active     banking organizations, such as Group Inc., transition to Basel     II over the next several years.           Under the Basel II framework as it applied to us when we were     regulated as a CSE, we evaluate our Tier 1 Capital and     Total Allowable Capital as a percentage of     Risk-Weighted     Assets (RWAs). RWAs are calculated based on the level of market     risk, credit risk and operational risk associated with our     business activities, using methodologies generally consistent     with those set out in Basel II. Our        18    Table of Contents       Tier 1 Capital consists of common shareholders     equity, qualifying preferred stock (including the cumulative     preferred stock issued by Group Inc. to the U.S. Department     of the Treasurys (U.S. Treasury) TARP Capital     Purchase Program and our junior subordinated debt issued to     trusts, less deductions for goodwill, disallowed intangible     assets and other items. Our Total Allowable Capital consists of     our Tier 1 Capital and our qualifying subordinated debt,     less certain deductions. Additional information on the     calculation of our Tier 1 Capital, Total Allowable Capital     and RWAs under the Basel II framework as it applied to us     as a CSE is set forth in Managements Discussion and     Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of     Operations  Equity Capital  Consolidated     Capital Requirements, and in Note 17 to the     consolidated financial statements, which are in Part II,     Items 7 and 8 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     As of November 2008, our Total Capital Ratio (Total     Allowable Capital as a percentage of RWAs) was 18.9% and our     Tier 1 Ratio (Tier 1 Capital as a percentage of RWAs)     was 15.6%, in each case calculated under the Basel II framework     as it applied to us when we were regulated as a CSE.         As noted above, we are currently working to implement the Basel     II framework as applicable to us as a bank holding company (as     opposed to as a CSE). During a parallel period, we anticipate     that Group Inc.s capital calculations computed under both     the Basel I rules and the Basel II rules will be reported to the     Federal Reserve Board for examination and compliance for at     least four consecutive quarterly periods. Once the parallel     period and subsequent three-year transition period are     successfully completed, Group Inc. will utilize the Basel II     framework as its means of capital adequacy assessment,     measurement and reporting and will discontinue use of Basel I.     Internationally, the Basel II framework was implemented in     several countries during the second half of 2007 and in 2008,     while others will begin implementation in 2009. The Basel II     rules therefore also apply to certain of our operations in     non-U.S. jurisdictions.         The Federal Reserve Board also has established minimum leverage     ratio guidelines. We were not subject to these guidelines before     becoming a bank holding company and, accordingly, we are     currently working with the Federal Reserve Board to finalize our     methodology for calculating this ratio. The Tier 1 leverage     ratio is defined as Tier 1 capital (as applicable to us as     a bank holding company) divided by adjusted average total assets     (which includes adjustments for disallowed goodwill and certain     intangible assets). The minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio is 3%     for bank holding companies that have received the highest     supervisory rating under Federal Reserve Board guidelines or     that have implemented the Federal Reserve Boards     risk-based     capital measure for market risk. Other bank holding companies     must have a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. Bank     holding companies may be expected to maintain ratios well above     the minimum levels, depending upon their particular condition,     risk profile and growth plans. As of November 2008, our     estimated Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.1%. This ratio     represents a preliminary estimate and may be revised in     subsequent filings as we continue to work with the Federal     Reserve Board to finalize the methodology for the calculation.         GS&Co. will continue to calculate its regulatory capital     requirements in accordance with the market and credit risk     standards of Appendix E of     Rule 15c3-1     under the Exchange Act, which are consistent with Basel II.     Payment of     Dividends         Federal and state law imposes limitations on the payment of     dividends by our bank depository institution subsidiaries. The     amount of dividends that may be paid by a state-chartered bank     that is a member of the Federal Reserve System, such as GS Bank     USA or our national bank trust company subsidiary, is limited to     the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent     earnings test and an undivided profits test.     Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if     the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar     year is in excess of the current years net income combined     with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless     the bank obtains the approval of its chartering authority. Under     the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess     of a banks undivided profits. New York law     imposes similar limitations on New York State-        19    Table of Contents       chartered banks. As a result of these restrictions, GS Bank USA     was not able to declare dividends to Group Inc. without     regulatory approval as of November 2008.         In addition to the dividend restrictions described above, the     banking regulators have authority to prohibit or to limit the     payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise     if, in the banking regulators opinion, payment of a     dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light     of the financial condition of the banking organization.         It is also the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that a bank     holding company generally only pay dividends on common stock out     of net income available to common shareholders over the past     year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention     appears consistent with the bank holding companys capital     needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. In the     current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve     Board has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully     review their dividend policy and has discouraged dividend     pay-out ratios that are at the 100% level unless both asset     quality and capital are very strong. A bank holding company also     should not maintain a dividend level that places undue pressure     on the capital of bank depository institution subsidiaries, or     that may undermine the bank holding companys ability to     serve as a source of strength for such bank depository     institution subsidiaries. See      U.S. Treasurys     TARP Capital Purchase Program below for a discussion of     additional restrictions on Group Inc.s ability to pay     dividends. In addition, certain of Group Inc.s nonbank     subsidiaries are subject to separate regulatory limitations on     dividends and distributions, including our     broker-dealer     and our insurance subsidiaries as described below.     Source of     Strength         Under Federal Reserve Board policy, Group Inc. is expected to     act as a source of strength to GS Bank USA and to commit capital     and financial resources to support this subsidiary. The required     support may be needed at times when, absent that Federal Reserve     Board policy, we may not find ourselves able to provide it.     Capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary     banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to     certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the     event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy, any     commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank     regulator to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be     assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of     payment.         However, because the BHC Act provides for functional regulation     of bank holding company activities by various regulators, the     BHC Act prohibits the Federal Reserve Board from requiring     payment by a holding company or subsidiary to a depository     institution if the functional regulator of the payor objects to     such payment. In such a case, the Federal Reserve Board could     instead require the divestiture of the depository institution     and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture.     Cross-guarantee     Provisions         Each insured depository institution controlled (as     defined in the BHC Act) by the same bank holding company can be     held liable to the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance     Corporation (FDIC) for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected     to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of any other     insured depository institution controlled by that holding     company and for any assistance provided by the FDIC to any of     those banks that is in danger of default. Such a     cross-guarantee claim against a depository     institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims     of the holding company and its affiliates against that     depository institution. At this time, we control only one     insured depository institution for this purpose, namely GS Bank     USA. However, if, in the future, we were to control other     insured depository institutions, such cross-guarantee would     apply to all such insured depository institutions.        20    Table of Contents   U.S. Treasurys     TARP Capital Purchase Program         On October 28, 2008, Group Inc. issued preferred stock     and a warrant to purchase its common stock to the     U.S. Treasury as a participant in the TARP Capital Purchase     Program. Prior to October 28, 2011, unless we have     redeemed all of this preferred stock or the U.S. Treasury     has transferred all of this preferred stock to a third party,     the consent of the U.S. Treasury will be required for us     to, among other things, increase our common stock dividend above     the current quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share or     repurchase our common stock or outstanding preferred stock     except in limited circumstances. In addition, until the     U.S. Treasury ceases to own any Group Inc. securities sold     under the TARP Capital Purchase Program, the compensation     arrangements for our senior executive officers must comply in     all respects with the U.S. Emergency Economic Stabilization     Act of 2008 and the rules and regulations thereunder. See     Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial     Condition and Results of Operations  Equity     Capital  Equity Capital Management in     Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for a further discussion of our participation in the     U.S. Treasurys TARP Capital Purchase Program.     FDIC Temporary     Liquidity Guarantee Program         Group Inc. and GS Bank USA have chosen to participate in the     FDICs Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), which     applies to, among others, all U.S. depository institutions     insured by the FDIC and all U.S. bank holding companies,     unless they have opted out of the TLGP or the FDIC has     terminated their participation. Under the TLGP, the FDIC     guarantees certain senior unsecured debt of Group Inc. and GS     Bank USA, as well as noninterest-bearing transaction account     deposits at GS Bank USA, and in return for these guarantees the     FDIC is paid a fee based on the amount of the deposit or the     amount and maturity of the debt. Under the debt guarantee     component of the TLGP, the FDIC will pay the unpaid principal     and interest on an FDIC-guaranteed debt instrument upon the     uncured failure of the participating entity to make a timely     payment of principal or interest in accordance with the terms of     the instrument. Under the transaction account guarantee     component of the TLGP, all noninterest-bearing transaction     accounts maintained at GS Bank USA are insured in full by the     FDIC until December 31, 2009, regardless of the     standard maximum deposit insurance amount. See     Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial     Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and     Funding Risk  Conservative Liability Structure     in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for a further discussion of our participation in the TLGP.     GS Bank     USA         Our U.S. depository institution subsidiary, GS Bank USA, a New     York State-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve     System and the FDIC, is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board     and the New York State Banking Department and is subject to     minimum capital requirements that (subject to certain     exceptions) are similar to those applicable to bank holding     companies. GS Bank USA was formed in November 2008 through     the merger of our existing Utah industrial bank (named GS Bank     USA) into our New York limited purpose trust company, with the     surviving company taking the name GS Bank USA. Concurrently with     this merger, we contributed subsidiaries with an aggregate of     $117.16 billion of assets into GS Bank USA (which brought     total assets in GS Bank USA to $145.06 billion as of     November 2008). As a result, a number of our businesses are now     conducted partially or entirely through GS Bank USA, including:     bank loan trading and origination; interest rate, credit,     currency and other derivatives; leveraged finance; commercial     and residential mortgage origination, trading and servicing;     structured finance; and agency lending, custody and hedge fund     administration services. The businesses conducted through GS     Bank USA are now subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve     Board, the New York State Banking Department and the FDIC.        21    Table of Contents   Deposit     Insurance         GS Bank USA accepts deposits, and those deposits have the     benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limits. The     FDICs Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on     insured depository institutions, which depend on the risk     category of an institution and the amount of insured deposits     that it holds. The FDIC may increase or decrease the assessment     rate schedule on a     semi-annual     basis. We are also participants in the TLGP as discussed above     under      FDIC     Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.     Prompt     Corrective Action         The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement     Act of 1991 (FDICIA), among other things, requires the federal     banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in     respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified     capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital categories     for FDIC-insured banks: well capitalized, adequately     capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized     and critically undercapitalized. A depository institution is     deemed to be well capitalized, the highest category,     if it has a total capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1     capital ratio of 6% or greater and a Tier 1 leverage ratio     of 5% or greater and is not subject to any order or written     directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain     a specific capital level for any capital measure. In connection     with the November 2008 asset transfer described below, GS Bank     USA agreed with the Federal Reserve Board to minimum capital     ratios in excess of these well capitalized levels.     Accordingly, for a period of time, GS Bank USA is expected to     maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8%, a total     capital ratio of at least 11% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio     of at least 6%. We contributed subsidiaries with an aggregate of     $117.16 billion in assets into GS Bank USA in November 2008     (which brought total assets in GS Bank USA to     $145.06 billion as of November 2008). As a result, we are     currently working with the Federal Reserve Board to finalize our     methodology for the Basel I calculations. As of November     2008, under Basel I, GS Bank USAs estimated     Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.9% and estimated total capital     ratio was 11.6%. In addition, GS Bank USAs estimated     Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.1%. An institution may be     downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is     lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is     determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it     receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to     certain matters.         FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on     operations, management and capital distributions, as the capital     category of an institution declines. Failure to meet the capital     guidelines could also subject a depository institution to     capital raising requirements. Ultimately, critically     undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of     a receiver or conservator.         The prompt corrective action regulations apply only to     depository institutions and not to bank holding companies such     as Group Inc. However, the Federal Reserve Board is authorized     to take appropriate action at the holding company level, based     upon the undercapitalized status of the holding companys     depository institution subsidiaries. In certain instances     relating to an undercapitalized depository institution     subsidiary, the bank holding company would be required to     guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized     subsidiarys capital restoration plan and might be liable     for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments     on that guarantee. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy     of the parent holding company, the guarantee would take priority     over the parents general unsecured creditors.     Insolvency of     an Insured Depository Institution         If the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of an     insured depository institution such as GS Bank USA, upon its     insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has the power:                         to transfer any of the depository institutions assets and     liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the     depository institutions creditors;          22    Table of Contents                         to enforce the terms of the depository institutions     contracts pursuant to their terms; or                    to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the     depository institution is a party, the performance of which is     determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or     repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the     orderly administration of the depository institution.           In addition, under federal law, the claims of holders of deposit     liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses     against an insured depository institution would be afforded a     priority over other general unsecured claims against such an     institution, including claims of debt holders of the     institution, in the liquidation or other resolution     of such an institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or     not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of GS     Bank USA, the debt holders would be treated differently from,     and could receive, if anything, substantially less than, the     depositors of the depository institution.     Transactions     with Affiliates         Transactions between GS Bank USA and Group Inc. and its     subsidiaries and affiliates are regulated by the Federal Reserve     Board. These regulations limit the types and amounts of     transactions (including loans to and credit extensions from GS     Bank USA) that may take place and generally require those     transactions to be on an arms-length basis. These regulations     generally do not apply to transactions between GS Bank USA and     its subsidiaries. In November 2008, Group Inc. transferred     assets and operations to GS Bank USA as described above under      GS     Bank USA. In connection with this transfer, Group Inc.     entered into a guarantee agreement with GS Bank USA whereby     Group Inc. agreed to (i) purchase from GS Bank USA certain     transferred assets (other than derivatives and mortgage     servicing rights) or reimburse GS Bank USA for certain losses     relating to those assets; (ii) reimburse GS Bank USA for     credit-related     losses from assets transferred to GS Bank USA; and     (iii) protect GS Bank USA or reimburse it for certain     losses arising from derivatives and mortgage servicing rights     transferred to GS Bank USA. Group Inc. also agreed to pledge to     GS Bank USA collateral with an aggregate value at any time not     less than 5% of the face amount of committed but unfunded credit     lines plus the original transfer value of the assets transferred     to GS Bank USA, which amounted to a required collateral value of     approximately $7.1 billion as of November 2008.     Trust Companies         Group Inc.s two limited purpose trust company subsidiaries     operate under state or federal law. They are not permitted to     and do not accept deposits (other than as incidental to their     trust activities) or make loans and, as a result, are not     insured by the FDIC. The Goldman Sachs Trust Company, N.A.,     a national banking association that is limited to fiduciary     activities, is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the     Currency and is a member bank of the Federal Reserve System. The     Goldman Sachs Trust Company of Delaware, a Delaware limited     purpose trust company, is regulated by the Office of the     Delaware State Bank Commissioner.     U.S. Securities     and Commodities Regulation         Goldman Sachs     broker-dealer     subsidiaries are subject to regulations that cover all aspects     of the securities business, including sales methods, trade     practices, use and safekeeping of clients funds and     securities, capital structure, recordkeeping, the financing of     clients purchases, and the conduct of directors, officers     and employees.         In the United States, the SEC is the federal agency responsible     for the administration of the federal securities laws.     GS&Co. is registered as a     broker-dealer     and as an investment adviser with the SEC and as a     broker-dealer     in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Self-regulatory     organizations, such as FINRA and the NYSE, adopt rules that     apply to, and examine,     broker-dealers     such as GS&Co. In addition, state securities and other     regulators also have regulatory or oversight        23    Table of Contents       authority over GS&Co. Similarly, our businesses are also     subject to regulation by various     non-U.S. governmental     and regulatory bodies and self-regulatory authorities in     virtually all countries where we have offices. Goldman Sachs     Execution & Clearing, L.P. (GSEC) and two of its     subsidiaries are registered     U.S. broker-dealers     and are regulated by the SEC, the NYSE and FINRA. Goldman Sachs     Financial Markets, L.P. is registered with the SEC as an OTC     derivatives dealer and conducts certain OTC derivatives     businesses.         The commodity futures and commodity options industry in the     United States is subject to regulation under the     U.S. Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The CFTC is the federal     agency charged with the administration of the CEA. Several of     Goldman Sachs subsidiaries, including GS&Co. and     GSEC, are registered with the CFTC and act as futures commission     merchants, commodity pool operators or commodity trading     advisors and are subject to the CEA. The rules and regulations     of various self-regulatory organizations, such as the Chicago     Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, other     futures exchanges and the National Futures Association, also     govern the commodity futures and commodity options businesses of     these entities.         GS&Co. and GSEC are subject to     Rule 15c3-1     of the SEC and Rule 1.17 of the CFTC, which specify uniform     minimum net capital requirements and also effectively require     that a significant part of the registrants assets be kept     in relatively liquid form. GS&Co. and GSEC have elected to     compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with     the Alternative Net Capital Requirement as permitted     by     Rule 15c3-1.     As of November 2008, GS&Co. had regulatory net     capital, as defined by     Rule 15c3-1,     of $10.92 billion, which exceeded the amounts required by     $8.87 billion. As of November 2008, GSEC had     regulatory net capital, as defined by     Rule 15c3-1,     of $1.38 billion, which exceeded the amounts required by     $1.29 billion. In addition to its alternative minimum net     capital requirements, GS&Co. is also required to hold     tentative net capital in excess of $1 billion and net     capital in excess of $500 million in accordance with the     market and credit risk standards of Appendix E of     Rule 15c3-1.     GS&Co. is also required to notify the SEC in the event that     its tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. As of     November 2008, GS&Co. had tentative net capital and     net capital in excess of both the minimum and the notification     requirements. These net capital requirements may have the effect     of prohibiting these entities from distributing or withdrawing     capital and may require prior notice to the SEC for certain     withdrawals of capital. See Note 17 to the consolidated     financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual     Report on     Form 10-K.         Our specialist businesses are subject to extensive regulation by     a number of securities exchanges. As a Designated Market Maker     on the NYSE and as a specialist on other exchanges, we are     required to maintain orderly markets in the securities to which     we are assigned. Under the NYSEs new Designated Market     Maker rules, this may require us to supply liquidity to these     markets in certain circumstances.         J. Aron & Company is authorized by the     U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to sell     wholesale physical power at     market-based     rates. As a FERC-authorized power marketer, J. Aron &     Company is subject to regulation under the U.S. Federal     Power Act and FERC regulations and to the oversight of FERC. As     a result of our investing activities, GS&Co. is also an     exempt holding company under the U.S. Public     Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and applicable FERC rules.         In addition, as a result of our power-related activities, we are     subject to extensive and evolving energy, environmental and     other governmental laws and regulations, as discussed under     Risk Factors  Our power generation interests     and related activities subject us to extensive regulation, as     well as environmental and other risks associated with power     generation activities in Part I, Item 1A of our     Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     Other Regulation     in the United States         Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to state     insurance regulation and oversight in the states in which they     are domiciled and in the other states in which they are     licensed, and we are subject to oversight as an insurance     holding company in states where our insurance subsidiaries are        24    Table of Contents       domiciled. State insurance regulations limit the ability of our     insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to Group Inc. in certain     circumstances, and could require regulatory approval for any     change in control of Group Inc., which may include     control of 10% or more of our voting stock. In addition, a     number of our other businesses, including our lending and     mortgage businesses, require us to obtain licenses, adhere to     applicable regulations and be subject to the oversight of     various regulators in the states in which we conduct these     businesses.         The U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), as amended by the USA     PATRIOT Act of 2001 (PATRIOT Act), contains anti-money     laundering and financial transparency laws and mandated the     implementation of various regulations applicable to all     financial institutions, including standards for verifying client     identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor     client transactions and report suspicious activities. Through     these and other provisions, the BSA and the PATRIOT Act seek to     promote the identification of parties that may be involved in     terrorism, money laundering or other suspicious activities.     Anti-money laundering laws outside the United States contain     some similar provisions. The obligation of financial     institutions, including Goldman Sachs, to identify their     clients, to monitor for and report suspicious transactions, to     respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities     and law enforcement agencies, and to share information with     other financial institutions, has required the implementation     and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls     that have increased, and may continue to increase, our costs,     and any failure with respect to our programs in this area could     subject us to substantial liability and regulatory fines.     Regulation Outside     the United States         Goldman Sachs provides investment services in and from the     United Kingdom under the regulation of the Financial Services     Authority (FSA). Goldman Sachs International (GSI), our     regulated U.K.     broker-dealer,     is subject to the capital requirements imposed by the FSA. As of     November 2008, GSI was in compliance with the FSA capital     requirements. Other subsidiaries, including Goldman Sachs     International Bank, are also regulated by the FSA.         Goldman Sachs Bank (Europe) PLC (GS Bank Europe), our regulated     Irish bank, is subject to minimum capital requirements imposed     by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. As of     November 2008, this bank was in compliance with all     regulatory capital requirements. Group Inc. has issued a general     guarantee of the obligations of this bank.         Various other Goldman Sachs entities are regulated by the     banking, insurance and securities regulatory authorities of the     European countries in which they operate, including, among     others, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and     the Bundesbank in Germany, Banque de France and the     Autorité des Marchés Financiers in France, Banca     dItalia and the Commissione Nazionale per le Società     e la Borsa (CONSOB) in Italy, the Federal Financial Markets     Service in Russia and the Swiss Federal Banking Commission.     Certain Goldman Sachs entities are also regulated by the     European securities, derivatives and commodities exchanges of     which they are members.         The investment services that are subject to oversight by the FSA     and other regulators within the European Union (EU) are     regulated in accordance with national laws, many of which     implement EU directives requiring, among other things,     compliance with certain capital adequacy standards, customer     protection requirements and market conduct and trade reporting     rules. These standards, requirements and rules are similarly     implemented, under the same directives, throughout the EU.         Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), our regulated Japanese     broker-dealer,     is subject to the capital requirements imposed by Japans     Financial Services Agency. As of November 2008, GSJCL was     in compliance with its capital adequacy requirements. GSJCL is     also regulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Osaka Securities     Exchange, the Tokyo Financial Exchange, the Japan Securities     Dealers Association, the Tokyo Commodity Exchange and the     Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in Japan.        25    Table of Contents       Also in Asia, the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong     Kong, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the China Securities     Regulatory Commission, the Korean Financial Supervisory Service,     the Reserve Bank of India and the Securities and Exchange Board     of India, among others, regulate various of our subsidiaries and     also have capital standards and other requirements comparable to     the rules of the SEC.         Various Goldman Sachs entities are regulated by the banking and     regulatory authorities in other     non-U.S. countries     in which Goldman Sachs operates, including, among others, Brazil     and Dubai. In addition, certain of our insurance subsidiaries     are regulated by Lloyds (which is, in turn, regulated by     the FSA) and by the Bermuda Monetary Authority.     Regulations     Applicable in and Outside the United States         The U.S. and     non-U.S. government     agencies, regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations,     as well as state securities commissions and other state     regulators in the United States, are empowered to conduct     administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the     issuance of cease and desist orders, or the suspension or     expulsion of a     broker-dealer     or its directors, officers or employees. From time to time, our     subsidiaries have been subject to investigations and     proceedings, and sanctions have been imposed for infractions of     various regulations relating to our activities, none of which     has had a material adverse effect on us or our businesses.         The research areas of investment banks have been and remain the     subject of regulatory scrutiny. The SEC and FINRA have rules     governing research analysts, including rules imposing     restrictions on the interaction between equity research analysts     and investment banking personnel at member securities firms.     Various     non-U.S. jurisdictions     have imposed both substantive and disclosure-based requirements     with respect to research and may impose additional regulations.     In 2003, GS&Co. agreed to a global settlement with certain     federal and state securities regulators and self-regulatory     organizations to resolve investigations into equity research     analysts alleged conflicts of interest. The global     settlement includes certain restrictions and undertakings that     have imposed additional costs and limitations on the conduct of     our businesses, including restrictions on the interaction     between research and investment banking areas.         In connection with the research settlement, we have also     subscribed to a voluntary initiative imposing restrictions on     the allocation of shares in initial public offerings to     executives and directors of public companies. The FSA in the     United Kingdom has imposed requirements on the conduct of the     allocation process in equity and fixed income securities     offerings (including initial public offerings and secondary     distributions). The SEC, the FSA, FINRA and other U.S. or     non-U.S. regulators     may in the future adopt additional and more stringent rules with     respect to offering procedures and the management of conflicts     of interest, and we cannot fully predict the effect that any new     requirements will have on our business.         Our investment management businesses are subject to significant     regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world relating     to, among other things, the safeguarding of client assets and     our management of client funds.         As discussed above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to     regulatory capital requirements in jurisdictions throughout the     world. Subsidiaries not subject to separate regulation may hold     capital to satisfy local tax guidelines, rating agency     requirements or internal policies, including policies concerning     the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based     upon its underlying risk.         Certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with     regulations enacted by U.S. federal and state governments,     the European Union or other jurisdictions     and/or     enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges     relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees     or others, and any failure to comply with these regulations     could expose us to liability     and/or     reputational damage.        26    Table of Contents      Item 1A.  Risk     Factors          We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in     our businesses, including market, liquidity, credit,     operational, legal and regulatory risks. The following are some     of the more important factors that could affect our businesses.     Our businesses     have been and may continue to be adversely affected by     conditions in the global financial markets and economic     conditions generally.         Our businesses, by their nature, do not produce predictable     earnings, and all of our businesses are materially affected by     conditions in the global financial markets and economic     conditions generally. In the past twelve months, these     conditions have changed suddenly and negatively.         Since mid-2007, and particularly during the second half of 2008,     the financial services industry and the securities markets     generally were materially and adversely affected by significant     declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a     serious lack of liquidity. This was initially triggered by     declines in the values of subprime mortgages, but spread to all     mortgage and real estate asset classes, to leveraged bank loans     and to nearly all asset classes, including equities. The global     markets have been characterized by substantially increased     volatility and     short-selling     and an overall loss of investor confidence, initially in     financial institutions, but more recently in companies in a     number of other industries and in the broader markets. The     decline in asset values has caused increases in margin calls for     investors, requirements that derivatives counterparties post     additional collateral and redemptions by mutual and hedge fund     investors, all of which have increased the downward pressure on     asset values and outflows of client funds across the financial     services industry. In addition, the increased redemptions and     unavailability of credit have required hedge funds and others to     rapidly reduce leverage, which has increased volatility and     further contributed to the decline in asset values.         Market conditions have also led to the failure or merger of a     number of prominent financial institutions. Financial     institution failures or near-failures have resulted in further     losses as a consequence of defaults on securities issued by them     and defaults under bilateral derivatives and other contracts     entered into with such entities as counterparties. Furthermore,     declining asset values, defaults on mortgages and consumer     loans, and the lack of market and investor confidence, as well     as other factors, have all combined to increase credit default     swap spreads, to cause rating agencies to lower credit ratings,     and to otherwise increase the cost and decrease the availability     of liquidity, despite very significant declines in central bank     borrowing rates and other government actions. Banks and other     lenders have suffered significant losses and have become     reluctant to lend, even on a secured basis, due to the increased     risk of default and the impact of declining asset values on the     value of collateral. The markets for securitized debt offerings     backed by mortgages, loans, credit card receivables and other     assets have for the most part been closed.         In 2008, governments, regulators and central banks in the United     States and worldwide have taken numerous steps to increase     liquidity and to restore investor confidence, but asset values     have continued to decline and access to liquidity continues to     be very limited.         We have long proprietary positions in a number of     our businesses. These positions are accounted for at fair value,     and the declines in the values of assets have had a direct and     large negative impact on our earnings in fiscal 2008. Revenues     from our asset management and merchant banking businesses were     also negatively impacted by declines in the values of assets     managed for our clients.         The ongoing liquidity crisis and the loss of confidence in     financial institutions has increased our cost of funding and     limited our access to some of our traditional sources of     liquidity, including both secured and unsecured borrowings.     While the numerous steps taken by governments, regulators and     central banks have helped reduce these funding costs somewhat     and increase our access to traditional and new sources of     liquidity, increases in funding costs and limitations on our     access to liquidity have        27    Table of Contents       negatively impacted our earnings and our ability to engage in     certain activities. In particular, in the latter half of 2008,     we were unable to raise significant amounts of     long-term     unsecured debt in the public markets, other than as a result of     the issuance of securities guaranteed by the FDIC under the     TLGP. We are able to have outstanding approximately     $35 billion of debt under the TLGP that is issued prior to     June 30, 2009. It is unclear when we will regain     access to the public     long-term     unsecured debt markets on customary terms or whether any similar     program will be available after the TLGPs scheduled     June 2009 expiration. However, we continue to have access     to     short-term     funding and to a number of sources of secured funding, both in     the private markets and through various government and central     bank sponsored initiatives. In December 2008, Moodys     Investors Service downgraded our     long-term     debt credit rating and Standard & Poors     downgraded both our     long-term     and     short-term     debt credit ratings, in each case with an outlook of     negative.         We have been able to fund our operations during fiscal 2008. Our     global core excess (our cash and cash equivalent positions     maintained to ensure     short-term     liquidity) and our capital ratios are at levels significantly     higher than in the past. Nevertheless, our credit spreads have     widened and the average maturity of our new funding has     decreased. Recently, we have relied to a significant extent for     our     long-term     unsecured funding on emergency funding programs implemented by     governments and central banks. It is unclear whether or for how     long these facilities will be extended and what impact     termination of these facilities could have on our ability to     access funding. See Managements Discussion and     Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of     Operations  Liquidity and Funding Risk in     Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K.         Furthermore, the increased riskiness of assets due to increases     in the volatility of asset prices, coupled with market concerns     about the levels of financial institution leverage ratios, as     well as fewer attractive business opportunities, have caused us     to significantly decrease the size of our balance sheet and to     increase the size of our global core excess. Both of these steps     may have a negative effect on our profitability, until reversed.         Concerns about financial institution profitability and solvency     as a result of general market conditions, particularly in the     credit markets, together with the forced merger or failure of a     number of major commercial and investment banks, have at times     caused a number of our clients to reduce the level of business     that they do with us, either because of concerns about the     safety of their assets held by us or simply arising from a     desire to diversify their risk or for other reasons. Some     clients have withdrawn some of the funds held at our firm or     transferred them from deposits with GS Bank USA to other types     of assets (in many cases leaving those assets in their brokerage     accounts held with us). Some counterparties have at times     refused to enter into certain derivatives and other     long-term     transactions with us or have requested additional collateral.     These instances were more prevalent during periods when the lack     of confidence in financial institutions was most widespread and     have become significantly less frequent in recent months in the     wake of government and central bank actions, greater     understanding of client account protections and higher limits of     FDIC insurance. In addition, we have acquired some new clients     as a result of the difficulties experienced by other financial     institutions.         During the fourth quarter of 2008, we raised $20.75 billion     in equity, comprised of a $5.75 billion public common stock     offering, a $5 billion preferred stock and warrant issuance     to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and certain affiliates and a     $10 billion preferred stock and warrant issuance under the     U.S. Treasurys TARP Capital Purchase Program. While this     additional capital provides further funding to our business and     we believe has improved investor perceptions with regard to our     financial position, it has increased our equity and the number     of actual and diluted outstanding shares of our common stock as     well as our preferred dividend requirements, which will reduce     our earnings per share and the return on our equity unless our     earnings increase sufficiently.         In addition, as of the end of 2008, the United States, Europe     and Japan are all in a recession. Business activity across a     wide range of industries and regions is greatly reduced and     local governments and many companies are in serious difficulty     due to the lack of consumer spending and        28    Table of Contents       the lack of liquidity in the credit markets. Unemployment has     increased significantly. While lower interest rates, increased     volatility and substantial increases in trading volumes have     positively impacted earnings in a number of our trading     businesses, declines in asset values, the lack of liquidity,     general uncertainty about economic and market activities and a     lack of consumer, investor and CEO confidence have negatively     impacted many of our other businesses, particularly our     investment banking, merchant banking, asset management, credit     products, mortgage, leveraged lending and equity principal     strategies businesses. In particular, our investment banking     business has been affected during the last twelve months by the     decrease in equity and debt underwritings and the decline in     both announced and completed mergers and acquisitions.         Our financial performance is highly dependent on the environment     in which our businesses operate. A favorable business     environment is generally characterized by, among other factors,     high global gross domestic product growth, transparent, liquid     and efficient capital markets, low inflation, high business and     investor confidence, stable geopolitical conditions, and strong     business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market     conditions can be caused by: declines in economic growth,     business activity or investor or business confidence;     limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of     credit and capital; increases in inflation, interest rates,     exchange rate volatility, default rates or the price of basic     commodities; outbreaks of hostilities or other geopolitical     instability; corporate, political or other scandals that reduce     investor confidence in capital markets; natural disasters or     pandemics; or a combination of these or other factors.         Overall, during fiscal 2008, the business environment has been     extremely adverse for many of our businesses and there can be no     assurance that these conditions will improve in the near term.     Until they do, we expect our results of operations to be     adversely affected.     Our businesses     have been and may continue to be adversely affected by declining     asset values.         Many of our businesses, such as our merchant banking businesses,     our mortgages, leveraged loan and credit products businesses in     our FICC segment, and our equity principal strategies business,     have net long positions in debt securities, loans,     derivatives, mortgages, equities (including private equity) and     most other asset classes. In addition, many of our     market-making     and other businesses in which we act as a principal to     facilitate our clients activities, including our     specialist businesses, commit large amounts of capital to     maintain trading positions in interest rate and credit products,     as well as currencies, commodities and equities. Because nearly     all of these investing and trading positions are     marked-to-market     on a daily basis, declines in asset values directly and     immediately impact our earnings, unless we have effectively     hedged our exposures to such declines. In certain     circumstances (particularly in the case of leveraged loans and     private equities or other securities that are not freely     tradable or lack established and liquid trading markets), it may     not be possible or economic to hedge such exposures and to the     extent that we do so the hedge may be ineffective or may greatly     reduce our ability to profit from increases in the values of the     assets. Sudden declines and significant volatility in the prices     of assets may substantially curtail or eliminate the trading     markets for certain assets, which may make it very difficult to     sell, hedge or value such assets. The inability to sell or     effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in     such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may increase     our     risk-weighted     assets which requires us to maintain additional capital and     increases our funding costs.         In our specialist businesses, we are obligated by stock exchange     rules to maintain an orderly market, including by purchasing     shares in a declining market. In markets where asset values are     declining and in volatile markets, this results in trading     losses and an increased need for liquidity.         We receive     asset-based     management fees based on the value of our clients     portfolios or investment in funds managed by us and, in some     cases, we also receive incentive fees based on increases in the     value of such investments. Declines in asset values reduce the     value of our clients portfolios or fund assets, which in     turn reduce the fees we earn for managing such assets.        29    Table of Contents       We post collateral to support our obligations and receive     collateral to support the obligations of our clients and     counterparties in connection with our trading businesses. When     the value of the assets posted as collateral declines, the party     posting the collateral may need to provide additional collateral     or, if possible, reduce its trading position. A classic example     of such a situation is a margin call in connection     with a brokerage account. Therefore, declines in the value of     asset classes used as collateral mean that either the cost of     funding trading positions is increased or the size of trading     positions is decreased. If we are the party providing collateral     this can increase our costs and reduce our profitability and if     we are the party receiving collateral this can also reduce our     profitability by reducing the level of business done with our     clients and counterparties. In addition, volatile or less liquid     markets increase the difficulty of valuing assets which can lead     to costly and time-consuming disputes over asset values and the     level of required collateral, as well as increased credit risk     to the recipient of the collateral due to delays in receiving     adequate collateral.     Our businesses     have been and may continue to be adversely affected by     disruptions in the credit markets, including reduced access to     credit and higher costs of obtaining credit.         Widening credit spreads, as well as significant declines in the     availability of credit, have adversely affected our ability to     borrow on a secured and unsecured basis and may continue to do     so. We fund ourselves on an unsecured basis by issuing     commercial paper, promissory notes and     long-term     debt, or by obtaining bank loans or lines of credit. We seek to     finance many of our assets, including our less liquid assets, on     a secured basis, including by entering into repurchase     agreements. Disruptions in the credit markets make it harder and     more expensive to obtain funding for our businesses. If our     available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our     operations at a higher cost, these conditions may require us to     curtail our business activities and increase our cost of     funding, both of which could reduce our profitability,     particularly in our businesses that involve investing, lending     and taking principal positions, including market making.         Our clients engaging in mergers and acquisitions often rely on     access to the secured and unsecured credit markets to finance     their transactions. The lack of available credit and the     increased cost of credit can adversely affect the size, volume     and timing of our clients merger and acquisition     transactions  particularly large     transactions  and adversely affect our financial     advisory and underwriting businesses.         In addition, we may incur significant unrealized gains or losses     due solely to changes in our credit spreads or those of third     parties, as these changes may affect the fair value of our     derivative instruments and the debt securities that we hold or     issue.     Our businesses     have been and may continue to be affected by changes in the     levels of market volatility.         Certain of our trading businesses depend on market volatility to     provide trading and arbitrage opportunities, and decreases in     volatility may reduce these opportunities and adversely affect     the results of these businesses. On the other hand, increased     volatility, while it can increase trading volumes and spreads,     also increases risk as measured by VaR and may expose us to     increased risks in connection with our     market-making     and proprietary businesses or cause us to reduce the size of     these businesses in order to avoid increasing our VaR. Limiting     the size of our     market-making     positions and investing businesses can adversely affect our     profitability, even though spreads are widening and we may earn     more on each trade. In periods when volatility is increasing,     but asset values are declining significantly (as has been the     case recently), it may not be possible to sell assets at all or     it may only be possible to do so at steep discounts. In such     circumstances we may be forced to either take on additional risk     or to incur losses in order to decrease our VaR. In addition,     increases in volatility increase the level of our risk weighted     assets and increase our capital requirements which increases our     funding costs.        30    Table of Contents   Our businesses     have been adversely affected and may continue to be adversely     affected by market uncertainty or lack of confidence among     investors and CEOs due to general declines in economic activity     and other unfavorable economic, geopolitical or market     conditions.         Our investment banking business has been and may continue to be     adversely affected by market conditions. Poor economic     conditions and other adverse geopolitical conditions can     adversely affect and have adversely affected investor and CEO     confidence, resulting in significant     industry-wide     declines in the size and number of underwritings and of     financial advisory transactions, which could continue to have an     adverse effect on our revenues and our profit margins. In     particular, because a significant portion of our investment     banking revenues are derived from our participation in large     transactions, a decline in the number of large transactions     would adversely affect our investment banking business.         In certain circumstances, market uncertainty or general declines     in market or economic activity may affect our trading businesses     by decreasing levels of overall activity or by decreasing     volatility, but at other times market uncertainty and even     declining economic activity may result in higher trading volumes     or higher spreads or both.         Market uncertainty, volatility and adverse economic conditions,     as well as declines in asset values, may cause our clients to     transfer their assets out of our funds or other products or     their brokerage accounts and result in reduced net revenues,     principally in our asset management business. To the extent that     clients do not withdraw their funds, they may invest them in     products that generate less fee income.     Our investing     businesses may be affected by the poor investment performance of     our investment products.         Poor investment returns in our asset management business, due to     either general market conditions or underperformance (against     the performance of benchmarks or of our competitors) by funds or     accounts that we manage or investment products that we design or     sell, affects our ability to retain existing assets and to     attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients.     This could affect the asset management and incentive fees that     we earn on assets under management or the commissions that we     earn for selling other investment products, such as structured     notes or derivatives.         We have in the past provided financial support to certain of our     investment products in difficult market circumstances and, at     our discretion, we may decide to do so in the future for     reputational or business reasons, including through equity     investments or cash infusions.     We may incur     losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and     strategies.         We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk     and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but     complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and     legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review     processes and other mechanisms. Our trading risk management     process seeks to balance our ability to profit from trading     positions with our exposure to potential losses. While we employ     a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk     mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that     accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and     financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes.     Thus, we may, in the course of our activities, incur losses.     Recent market conditions have involved unprecedented     dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using     historical data to manage risk.         The models that we use to assess and control our risk exposures     reflect assumptions about the degrees of correlation or lack     thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market     indicators. In times of market stress or other unforeseen     circumstances, such as occurred during 2008, previously     uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely     previously correlated indicators may move in different     directions. These types of market movements have at times     limited the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and have     caused us to incur significant losses, and they        31    Table of Contents       may do so in the future. These changes in correlation can be     exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or     trading models with assumptions or algorithms that are similar     to ours. In these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce     our risk positions due to the activity of other market     participants or widespread market dislocations, including     circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or     no market exists for certain assets. To the extent that we make     investments directly through various of our businesses in     securities, including private equity, that do not have an     established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to     restrictions on sale or hedging, we may not be able to reduce     our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with such     positions. In addition, we invest our own capital in our     merchant banking, alternative investment and infrastructure     funds, and limitations on our ability to withdraw some or all of     our investments in these funds, whether for legal, reputational     or other reasons, may make it more difficult for us to control     the risk exposures relating to these investments.         For a further discussion of our risk management policies and     procedures, see Managements Discussion and Analysis     of Financial Condition and Results of Operations      Risk Management in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual     Report on     Form 10-K.     Our liquidity,     profitability and businesses may be adversely affected by an     inability to access the debt capital markets or to sell assets     or by a reduction in our credit ratings or by an increase in our     credit spreads.         Liquidity is essential to our businesses. Our liquidity may be     impaired by an inability to access secured     and/or     unsecured debt markets, an inability to access funds from our     subsidiaries, an inability to sell assets or redeem our     investments, or unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral. This     situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable     to control, such as a general market disruption or an     operational problem that affects third parties or us, or even by     the perception among market participants that we, or other     market participants, are experiencing greater liquidity risk.         The financial instruments that we hold and the contracts to     which we are a party are increasingly complex, as we employ     structured products to benefit our clients and ourselves, and     these complex structured products often do not have readily     available markets to access in times of liquidity stress. Our     investing activities may lead to situations where the holdings     from these activities represent a significant portion of     specific markets, which could restrict liquidity for our     positions. Further, our ability to sell assets may be impaired     if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets     at the same time, as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other     market crisis. In addition, financial institutions with which we     interact may exercise set-off rights or the right to require     additional collateral, including in difficult market conditions,     which could further impair our access to liquidity.         Our credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction     in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and     competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, limit our     access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under     certain bilateral provisions in some of our trading and     collateralized financing contracts. Under these provisions,     counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with     Goldman Sachs or require us to post additional collateral.     Termination of our trading and collateralized financing     contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our     liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or     to make significant cash payments or securities movements.         Our cost of obtaining     long-term     unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads (the     amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury     securities (or other benchmark securities) of the same maturity     that we need to pay to our debt investors). Increases in our     credit spreads can significantly increase our cost of this     funding. Changes in credit spreads are continuous,     market-driven,     and subject at times to unpredictable and highly volatile     movements. Credit spreads are influenced by market perceptions     of our creditworthiness. In addition, our credit spreads may be     influenced by movements in the costs to purchasers of credit     default swaps referenced to our        32    Table of Contents   long-term     debt. The market for credit default swaps is relatively new,     although very large, and it has proven to be extremely volatile     and currently lacks a high degree of structure or transparency.     Group Inc. is     a holding company and is dependent for liquidity on payments     from its subsidiaries, which are subject to     restrictions.         Group Inc. is a holding company and, therefore, depends on     dividends, distributions and other payments from its     subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to fund all payments     on its obligations, including debt obligations. Many of our     subsidiaries, including our     broker-dealer,     bank and insurance subsidiaries, are subject to laws that     restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to     block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to     Group Inc. Restrictions or regulatory action of that kind could     impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on     its obligations, including debt obligations, or dividend     payments. In addition, Group Inc.s right to participate in     a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or     reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the     subsidiarys creditors.         Furthermore, Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations     of GS&Co., GS Bank USA and GS Bank Europe, subject to     certain exceptions, and has pledged significant assets to GS     Bank USA to support obligations to GS Bank USA. These guarantees     may require Group Inc. to provide substantial funds or assets to     its subsidiaries or their creditors and counterparties at a time     when Group Inc. is in need of liquidity to fund its own     obligations. See Business  Regulation in     Part I, Item 1 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     Our     businesses, profitability and liquidity may be adversely     affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults     by, third parties who owe us money, securities or other assets     or whose securities or obligations we hold.         The amount and duration of our credit exposures have been     increasing over the past several years, as have the breadth and     size of the entities to which we have credit exposures. We are     exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money,     securities or other assets will not perform their obligations.     These parties may default on their obligations to us due to     bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other     reasons. A failure of a significant market participant, or even     concerns about a default by such an institution, could lead to     significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other     institutions, which in turn could adversely affect us.         We are also subject to the risk that our rights against third     parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. In     addition, deterioration in the credit quality of third parties     whose securities or obligations we hold could result in losses     and/or     adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use     those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes. A     significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our     counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results.     While in many cases we are permitted to require additional     collateral from counterparties that experience financial     difficulty, disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we     are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets. The     termination of contracts and the foreclosure on collateral may     subject us to claims for the improper exercise of our rights.     Default rates, downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to     the valuation of collateral increase significantly in times of     market stress and illiquidity.         As part of our clearing business, we finance our client     positions, and we could be held responsible for the defaults or     misconduct of our clients. Although we regularly review credit     exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific     industries, countries and regions that we believe may present     credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or     circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.        33    Table of Contents   Concentration     of risk increases the potential for significant     losses.         Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant     losses in our     market-making,     proprietary trading, investing, block trading, merchant banking,     underwriting and lending businesses. This risk may increase to     the extent we expand our proprietary trading and investing     businesses or commit capital to facilitate client-driven     business. The number and size of such transactions may affect     our results of operations in a given period. Moreover, because     of concentration of risk, we may suffer losses even when     economic and market conditions are generally favorable for our     competitors. Disruptions in the credit markets can make it     difficult to hedge these credit exposures effectively or     economically. In addition, we extend large commitments as part     of our credit origination activities. Our inability to reduce     our credit risk by selling, syndicating or securitizing these     positions, including during periods of market stress, could     negatively affect our results of operations due to a decrease in     the fair value of the positions, including due to the insolvency     or bankruptcy of the borrower, as well as the loss of revenues     associated with selling such securities or loans.         In the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to a     concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty,     borrower or issuer, and a failure or downgrade of, or default     by, such entity could negatively impact our businesses, perhaps     materially, and the systems by which we set limits and monitor     the level of our credit exposure to individual entities,     industries and countries may not function as we have     anticipated. While our activities expose us to many different     industries and counterparties, we routinely execute a high     volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial     services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial     banks, and investment funds. This has resulted in significant     credit concentration with respect to this industry.     The financial     services industry is highly competitive.         The financial services industry  and all of our     businesses  are intensely competitive, and we expect     them to remain so. We compete on the basis of a number of     factors, including transaction execution, our products and     services, innovation, reputation, creditworthiness and price.     Over time, there has been substantial consolidation and     convergence among companies in the financial services industry.     This trend accelerated over the course of the past year as a     result of numerous mergers and asset acquisitions among industry     participants. This trend has also hastened the globalization of     the securities and other financial services markets. As a     result, we have had to commit capital to support our     international operations and to execute large global     transactions. To the extent we expand into new business areas     and new geographic regions, we will face competitors with more     experience and more established relationships with clients,     regulators and industry participants in the relevant market,     which could adversely affect our ability to expand.         Pricing and other competitive pressures in our investment     banking business, as well as our other businesses, have     continued to increase, particularly in situations where some of     our competitors may seek to increase market share by reducing     prices. For example, in connection with investment banking and     other assignments, we have experienced pressure to extend and     price credit at levels that may not always fully compensate us     for the risks we take.     We face     enhanced risks as new business initiatives lead us to transact     with a broader array of clients and counterparties and expose us     to new asset classes and new markets.         A number of our recent and planned business initiatives and     expansions of existing businesses may bring us into contact,     directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are     not within our traditional client and counterparty base and     expose us to new asset classes and new markets. These business     activities expose us to new and enhanced risks, including risks     associated with dealing with governmental entities, reputational     concerns arising from dealing with less sophisticated     counterparties and investors, greater regulatory scrutiny of     these activities, increased     credit-related,     sovereign and operational risks, risks arising from accidents or     acts of terrorism, and reputational concerns with the manner in     which these assets are being operated or held.        34    Table of Contents   Derivative     transactions may expose us to unexpected risk and potential     losses.         We are party to a large number of derivative transactions,     including credit derivatives. Many of these derivative     instruments are individually negotiated and     non-standardized,     which can make exiting, transferring or settling the position     difficult. Many credit derivatives require that we deliver to     the counterparty the underlying security, loan or other     obligation in order to receive payment. In a number of cases, we     do not hold the underlying security, loan or other obligation     and may not be able to obtain, the underlying security, loan or     other obligation. This could cause us to forfeit the payments     due to us under these contracts or result in settlement delays     with the attendant credit and operational risk as well as     increased costs to the firm.         Derivative contracts and other transactions entered into with     third parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties on     a timely basis. While the transaction remains unconfirmed, we     are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the     event of a default may find it more difficult to enforce the     contract. In addition, as new and more complex derivative     products are created, covering a wider array of underlying     credit and other instruments, disputes about the terms of the     underlying contracts could arise, which could impair our ability     to effectively manage our risk exposures from these products and     subject us to increased costs. Any regulatory effort to create     an exchange or trading platform for credit derivatives and other     OTC derivative contracts, or a market shift toward standardized     derivatives, could reduce the risk associated with such     transactions, but under certain circumstances could also limit     our ability to develop derivatives that best suit the needs of     our clients and ourselves and adversely affect our profitability.     A failure in     our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third     parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses,     result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our     reputation and cause losses.         Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process     and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of     transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous     and diverse markets in many currencies. These transactions, as     well as the information technology services we provide to     clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as     well as legal and regulatory standards. As our client base and     our geographical reach expands, developing and maintaining our     operational systems and infrastructure becomes increasingly     challenging. Our financial, accounting, data processing or other     operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or     become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or     partially beyond our control, such as a spike in transaction     volume, adversely affecting our ability to process these     transactions or provide these services. In addition, we also     face the risk of operational failure, termination or capacity     constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing     houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate     our securities transactions, and as our interconnectivity with     our clients grows, we increasingly face the risk of operational     failure with respect to our clients systems. In recent     years, there has been significant consolidation among clearing     agents, exchanges and clearing houses, which has increased our     exposure to operational failure, termination or capacity     constraints of the particular financial intermediaries that we     use and could affect our ability to find adequate and     cost-effective     alternatives in the event of any such failure, termination or     constraint. Industry consolidation, whether among market     participants or financial intermediaries, increases the risk of     operational failure as disparate complex systems need to be     integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Furthermore, the     interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with     central agents, exchanges and clearing houses increases the risk     that an operational failure at one institution may cause an     industry-wide     operational failure that could materially impact our ability to     conduct business. Any such failure, termination or constraint     could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions,     service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our     businesses or result in financial loss or liability to our     clients, impairment of our liquidity, disruption of our     businesses, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.        35    Table of Contents       Despite the resiliency plans and facilities we have in place,     our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a     disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses     and the communities in which we are located. This may include a     disruption involving electrical, communications, internet,     transportation or other services used by us or third parties     with which we conduct business. These disruptions may occur as a     result of events that affect only our buildings or the buildings     of such third parties, or as a result of events with a broader     impact globally, regionally or in the cities where those     buildings are located. Nearly all of our employees in our     primary locations, including the New York metropolitan area,     London, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Bangalore, work in close     proximity to one another, in one or more buildings.     Notwithstanding our efforts to maintain business continuity,     given that our headquarters and the largest concentration of our     employees are in the New York metropolitan area, depending on     the intensity and longevity of the event, a catastrophic event     impacting our New York metropolitan area offices could very     negatively affect our business. If a disruption occurs in one     location and our employees in that location are unable to occupy     our offices or communicate with or travel to other locations,     our ability to service and interact with our clients may suffer,     and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency     plans that depend on communication or travel.         Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and     transmission of confidential and other information in our     computer systems and networks. Although we take protective     measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant,     our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to     unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code     and other events that could have a security impact. If one or     more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our     or our clients or counterparties confidential and     other information processed and stored in, and transmitted     through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause     interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients, our     counterparties or third parties operations, which     could result in significant losses or reputational damage. We     may be required to expend significant additional resources to     modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate     vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to     litigation and financial losses that are either not insured     against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by     us.         We routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and     proprietary information by email and other electronic means. We     have discussed and worked with clients, vendors, service     providers, counterparties and other third parties to develop     secure transmission capabilities, but we do not have, and may be     unable to put in place, secure capabilities with all of our     clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other     third parties and we may not be able to ensure that these third     parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the     confidentiality of the information. An interception, misuse or     mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information     being sent to or received from a client, vendor, service     provider, counterparty or other third party could result in     legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm.     Conflicts of     interest are increasing and a failure to appropriately identify     and deal with conflicts of interest could adversely affect our     businesses.         As we have expanded the scope of our businesses and our client     base, we increasingly must address potential conflicts of     interest, including situations where our services to a     particular client or our own investments or other interests     conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of     another client, as well as situations where one or more of our     businesses have access to material     non-public     information that may not be shared with other businesses within     the firm and situations where we may be a creditor of an entity     with which we also have an advisory or other relationship.         Our regulators have the ability to scrutinize our activities for     potential conflicts of interest, including through detailed     examinations of specific transactions. Our status as a bank     holding company subjects us to heightened regulation and     increased regulatory scrutiny by the Federal Reserve Board with     respect to transactions between GS Bank USA and entities that     are or could be seen as affiliates of ours.        36    Table of Contents       We have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to     identify and address conflicts of interest, including those     designed to prevent the improper sharing of information among     our businesses. However, appropriately identifying and dealing     with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our     reputation, which is one of our most important assets, could be     damaged and the willingness of clients to enter into     transactions in which such a conflict might arise may be     affected if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify and deal     appropriately with conflicts of interest. In addition, potential     or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or     enforcement actions.     Our businesses     and those of our clients are subject to extensive and pervasive     regulation around the world.         As a participant in the financial services industry, we are     subject to extensive regulation in jurisdictions around the     world. We face the risk of significant intervention by     regulatory authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct     our businesses. Among other things, we could be fined,     prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities or     subject to limitations or conditions on our business activities.         In recent years, firms in the financial services industry have     been operating in a difficult regulatory environment. The     industry has experienced increased scrutiny from a variety of     regulators, both within and outside the United States. Penalties     and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased     substantially over the last several years, and certain     regulators have been more likely in recent years to commence     enforcement actions.         In addition, new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement     of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or     those of our clients may adversely affect our businesses. Recent     market disruptions have led to numerous proposals for changes in     the regulation of the financial services industry, including     significant additional regulation. Regulatory changes could lead     to business disruptions, could impact the value of assets that     we hold or the scope or profitability of our business     activities, could require us to change certain of our business     practices and could expose us to additional costs (including     compliance costs) and liabilities as well as reputational harm,     and, to the extent the regulations strictly control the     activities of financial services firms, make it more difficult     for us to distinguish ourselves from competitors. For a     discussion of the extensive regulation to which our businesses     are subject, see Business  Regulation in     Part I, Item 1 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K.         Our status as a bank holding company and the operation of our     lending and other businesses through GS Bank USA subject us to     additional regulation and limitations on our activities, as     described in Business  Regulation      Banking Regulation in Part I, Item 1 of our     Annual Report on     Form 10-K,     as well as some regulatory uncertainty as we apply banking     regulations and practices to many of our businesses. The     application of these regulations and practices may present us     and our regulators with new or novel issues.         Our firm is subject to regulatory capital requirements at a     number of levels, as described above under     Business  Regulation in Part I,     Item 1 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     As a bank holding company, we will be subject to capital     requirements based on Basel I as opposed to the requirements     based on Basel II that applied to us as a CSE. Complying with     these requirements may require us to liquidate assets or raise     capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs     or otherwise adversely affects our shareholders and creditors.     In addition, failure to meet minimum capital requirements can     initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary     actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct     material adverse effect on our financial condition.     Our agreements     with the U.S. Treasury and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. impose     restrictions and obligations on us that limit our ability to     increase dividends, repurchase our common stock or preferred     stock and access the equity capital markets.         In October 2008, we issued preferred stock and a warrant to     purchase our common stock to the U.S. Treasury as part of     its TARP Capital Purchase Program. Prior to     October 28, 2011, unless we have redeemed all of the     preferred stock or the U.S. Treasury has transferred all of     the preferred stock to a third party, the consent of the     U.S. Treasury will be required for us to, among other     things,        37    Table of Contents       increase our common stock dividend or repurchase our common     stock or other preferred stock (with certain exceptions,     including the repurchase of our common stock to offset share     dilution from     equity-based     employee compensation awards). We have also granted registration     rights and offering facilitation rights to the     U.S. Treasury and to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. pursuant to     which we have agreed to     lock-up     periods during which we would be unable to issue equity     securities.     Substantial     legal liability or significant regulatory action against us     could have material adverse financial effects or cause us     significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously     harm our business prospects.         We face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the     volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in     litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial     institutions remain high. See Legal Proceedings in     Part I, Item 3 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for a discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are     involved. Our experience has been that legal claims by customers     and clients increase in a market downturn. In addition,     employment-related claims typically increase in periods when we     have reduced the total number of employees.         There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving     fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services     industry in recent years, and we run the risk that employee     misconduct could occur. It is not always possible to deter or     prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to     prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all     cases.     The growth of     electronic trading and the introduction of new technology may     adversely affect our business and may increase     competition.         Technology is fundamental to our business and our industry. The     growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new     technologies is changing our businesses and presenting us with     new challenges. Securities, futures and options transactions are     increasingly occurring electronically, both on our own systems     and through other alternative trading systems, and it appears     that the trend toward alternative trading systems will continue     and probably accelerate. Some of these alternative trading     systems compete with our trading businesses, including our     specialist businesses, and we may experience continued     competitive pressures in these and other areas. In addition, the     increased use by our clients of     low-cost     electronic trading systems and direct electronic access to     trading markets could cause a reduction in commissions and     spreads. As our clients increasingly use our systems to trade     directly in the markets, we may incur liabilities as a result of     their use of our order routing and execution infrastructure. The     NYSEs adoption and continued refinement of its hybrid     market for trading securities may increase pressure on our     Equities business as clients execute more of their NYSE-related     trades electronically. We have invested significant resources     into the development of electronic trading systems and expect to     continue to do so, but there is no assurance that the revenues     generated by these systems will yield an adequate return on our     investment, particularly given the relatively lower commissions     arising from electronic trades.     Our businesses     may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain     qualified employees.         Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts     of highly skilled individuals; therefore, our continued ability     to compete effectively in our businesses, to manage our     businesses effectively and to expand into new businesses and     geographic areas depends on our ability to attract new employees     and to retain and motivate our existing employees. Competition     from within the financial services industry and from businesses     outside the financial services industry for qualified employees     has often been intense. This is particularly the case in     emerging markets, where we are often competing for qualified     employees with entities that have a significantly greater     presence or more extensive experience in the region.        38    Table of Contents       In fiscal 2008, we significantly reduced compensation levels. In     addition, the market price of our shares of our common stock     declined very significantly during the year. A substantial     portion of our annual bonus compensation paid to our senior     employees has in recent years been paid in the form of     equity-based     awards. In addition, we reduced the number of employees across     nearly all of our businesses during the latter portion of the     year. The combination of these events could adversely affect our     ability to hire and retain qualified employees.     Our power     generation interests and related activities subject us to     extensive regulation, as well as environmental and other risks     associated with power generation activities.         The power generation facilities that we own and those that we     operate, as well as our other power-related activities, are     subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local     energy, environmental and other governmental laws and     regulations, including environmental laws and regulations     relating to, among others, air quality, water quality, waste     management, natural resources, site remediation and health and     safety.         We may incur substantial costs (including being required to     cease or curtail operations of one or more of our power     generation facilities) in complying with current or future laws     and regulations relating to electric power generation and     wholesale sales and trading of electricity and natural gas,     including having to commit significant capital toward     environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control     equipment, payment of emission fees and carbon or other taxes,     and application for, and holding of, permits and licenses at our     power generation facilities. Our power generation facilities are     also subject to the risk of unforeseen or catastrophic events,     many of which are outside of our control, including breakdown or     failure of power generation equipment, transmission lines or     other equipment or processes or other mechanical malfunctions,     performance below expected levels of output or efficiency,     terrorist attacks, natural disasters or other hostile or     catastrophic events. In addition, these facilities could be     adversely affected by the failure of any of our third party     suppliers or service providers to perform their contractual     obligations, including the failure to obtain raw materials     necessary for operation at reasonable prices. Market conditions     or other factors could cause a failure to satisfy or obtain     waivers under agreements with third parties, including lenders     and utilities, which impose significant obligations on our     subsidiaries that own such facilities. In addition, we may not     have insurance against the risks that such facilities face or     the insurance that we have may be inadequate to cover our losses.         The occurrence of any of such events may prevent the affected     facilities from performing under applicable power sales     agreements, may impair their operations or financial results and     may result in litigation or other reputational harm.     In conducting     our businesses around the world, we are subject to political,     economic, legal, operational and other risks that are inherent     in operating in many countries.         In conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our     global operations, we are subject to risks of possible     nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital     controls, exchange controls and other restrictive governmental     actions, as well the outbreak of hostilities or acts of     terrorism. In many countries, the laws and regulations     applicable to the securities and financial services industries     and many of the transactions in which we are involved are     uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to     determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market.     Any determination by local regulators that we have not acted in     compliance with the application of local laws in a particular     market or our failure to develop effective working relationships     with local regulators could have a significant and negative     effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our     reputation generally. We are also subject to the enhanced risk     that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable     in all cases.         Our businesses and operations are increasingly expanding into     new regions throughout the world, including emerging markets,     and we expect this trend to continue. Various emerging market        39    Table of Contents       countries have experienced severe economic and financial     disruptions, including significant devaluations of their     currencies, defaults or threatened defaults on sovereign debt,     capital and currency exchange controls, and low or negative     growth rates in their economies, as well as military activity or     acts of terrorism. The possible effects of any of these     conditions include an adverse impact on our businesses and     increased volatility in financial markets generally.     We may incur     losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events,     including the emergence of a pandemic, terrorist attacks or     natural disasters.         The occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including     the emergence of a pandemic or other widespread health emergency     (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency),     terrorist attacks or natural disasters, could create economic     and financial disruptions, could lead to operational     difficulties (including travel limitations) that could impair     our ability to manage our businesses, and could expose our     insurance subsidiaries to significant losses.           Item 1B.     Unresolved     Staff Comments           There are no material unresolved written comments that were     received from the SEC staff 180 days or more before the end     of our fiscal year relating to our periodic or current reports     under the Exchange Act.           Item 2.     Properties           Our principal executive offices are located at 85 Broad     Street, New York, New York, and comprise approximately one     million rentable square feet of leased space, pursuant to a     lease agreement expiring in June 2011. We also occupy over     680,000 rentable square feet at One New York Plaza under lease     agreements expiring primarily in 2010 (with options to renew for     up to five additional years), and we lease space at various     other locations in the New York metropolitan area. In total, we     lease approximately 3.7 million rentable square feet in the     New York metropolitan area.         In August 2005, we leased from Battery Park City Authority     a parcel of land in lower Manhattan, pursuant to a ground lease.     We are currently constructing a 2.1 million gross square     foot office building on the site that will serve as our     headquarters. Under the lease, Battery Park City Authority holds     title to all improvements, including the office building,     subject to Goldman Sachs right of exclusive possession and     use until June 2069, the expiration date of the lease.         Under the terms of the ground lease, we made a lump-sum ground     rent payment in June 2007 of $161 million, which was     paid into escrow, to be released to the Battery Park City     Authority pending performance of specified state and city     obligations. We are required to make additional periodic     payments during the term of the lease. We are obligated under     the ground lease to construct the office building by 2011     (subject to extensions in the case of force majeure) in     accordance with certain     pre-approved     design standards. Construction began on the building in     November 2005, and we expect construction completion and     initial occupancy of the building during 2009. The building is     projected to cost between $2.1 billion and     $2.3 billion, including acquisition, development, fitout     and furnishings, financing and other related costs.         We are receiving significant benefits from the City and State of     New York based on our agreement to construct our headquarters in     lower Manhattan. These benefits are subject to recoupment or     recapture if we do not satisfy our obligations under these     agreements with the City and State of New York.         We have offices at 30 Hudson Street in Jersey City, New Jersey,     which we own and which include approximately 1.6 million     gross square feet of office space, and we own over 575,000     square feet of additional office space spread among four     locations in New York and New Jersey. We have additional offices     in the U.S. and elsewhere in the Americas, which together     comprise approximately 2.9 million rentable square feet of     leased space.        40    Table of Contents       In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, we have offices that     total approximately 2.2 million rentable square feet. Our     European headquarters is located in London at Peterborough     Court, pursuant to a lease expiring in 2026. In total, we lease     approximately 1.6 million rentable square feet in London     through various leases, relating to various properties.         In Asia, we have offices that total approximately     1.5 million rentable square feet. Our headquarters in this     region are in Tokyo, at the Roppongi Hills Mori Tower, and in     Hong Kong, at the Cheung Kong Center. In Tokyo, we currently     lease approximately 415,000 rentable square feet, the majority     of which will expire in 2018. In Hong Kong, we currently lease     approximately 295,000 rentable square feet under lease     agreements, the majority of which will expire in 2011.         Our occupancy expenses include costs associated with office     space held in excess of our current requirements. This excess     space, the cost of which is charged to earnings as incurred, is     being held for potential growth or to replace currently occupied     space that we may exit in the future. We regularly evaluate our     current and future space capacity in relation to current and     projected staffing levels. In 2008, we incurred exit costs of     $80 million related to our office space. We may incur exit     costs in the future to the extent we (i) reduce our space     capacity or (ii) commit to, or occupy, new properties in     the locations in which we operate and, consequently, dispose of     existing space that had been held for potential growth. These     exit costs may be material to our results of operations in a     given period.           Item 3.     Legal     Proceedings           We are involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and     arbitration proceedings (including those described below)     concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our     businesses. We believe, based on currently available     information, that the results of such proceedings, in the     aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our     financial condition, but might be material to our operating     results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the     operating results for such period. Given the range of litigation     and investigations presently under way, our litigation expenses     can be expected to remain high.     IPO Process     Matters         Group Inc. and GS&Co. are among the numerous financial     services companies that have been named as defendants in a     variety of lawsuits alleging improprieties in the process by     which those companies participated in the underwriting of public     offerings in recent years.         GS&Co. has, together with other underwriters in certain     offerings as well as the issuers and certain of their officers     and directors, been named as a defendant in a number of related     lawsuits filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern     District of New York alleging, among other things, that the     prospectuses for the offerings violated the federal securities     laws by failing to disclose the existence of alleged     arrangements tying allocations in certain offerings to higher     customer brokerage commission rates as well as purchase orders     in the aftermarket, and that the alleged arrangements resulted     in market manipulation. The federal district court denied a     motion to dismiss in all material respects relating to the     underwriter defendants and generally granted plaintiffs     motion for class certification in six focus cases.     The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed     the district courts order granting class certification,     denied plaintiffs applications for rehearing and rehearing     en banc, and remanded. On August 14, 2007, plaintiffs     amended their complaints in the six focus cases as     well as their master allegations for all such cases to reflect     new class related allegations. On September 27, 2007,     plaintiffs filed a new motion for class certification in the     district court, and on November 14, 2007, GS&Co.     and the other defendants moved to dismiss the amended     complaints. Following a mediation, a settlement in principle has     been reached, subject to negotiation of definitive documentation     and court approval.         GS&Co. is among numerous underwriting firms named as     defendants in a number of complaints filed commencing     October 3, 2007, in the U.S. District Court for     the Western District of Washington alleging violations of the     federal securities laws in connection with offerings of     securities for 16 issuers        41    Table of Contents       during 1999 and 2000. The complaints generally assert that the     underwriters, together with each issuers directors,     officers and principal shareholders, entered into purported     agreements to tie allocations in the offerings to increased     brokerage commissions and aftermarket purchase orders. The     complaints further allege that, based upon these and other     purported agreements, the underwriters violated the reporting     provisions of, and are subject to     short-swing     profit recovery under, Section 16 of the Exchange Act. On     October 29, 2007, the cases were reassigned to a     single district judge. On July 25, 2008, defendants     moved to dismiss the various complaints.         GS&Co. has been named as a defendant in an action commenced     on May 15, 2002 in New York Supreme Court, New York     County, by an official committee of unsecured creditors on     behalf of eToys, Inc., alleging that the firm intentionally     underpriced eToys, Inc.s initial public offering. The     action seeks, among other things, unspecified compensatory     damages resulting from the alleged lower amount of offering     proceeds. The court granted GS&Co.s motion to dismiss     as to five of the claims; plaintiff appealed from the dismissal     of the five claims, and GS&Co. appealed from the denial of     its motion as to the remaining claim. The New York Appellate     Division, First Department affirmed in part and reversed in part     the lower courts ruling on the firms motion to     dismiss, permitting all claims to proceed except the claim for     fraud, as to which the appellate court granted leave to replead,     and the New York Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed     in part, dismissing claims for breach of contract, professional     malpractice and unjust enrichment, but permitting claims for     breach of fiduciary duty and fraud to continue. On remand to the     lower court, GS&Co. moved to dismiss the surviving claims     or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, but the motion was     denied by a decision dated March 21, 2006. Plaintiff     has moved for leave to amend the complaint again, and     GS&Co. has cross-moved to dismiss.         Group Inc. and certain of its affiliates have, together with     various underwriters in certain offerings, received subpoenas     and requests for documents and information from various     governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations in     connection with investigations relating to the public offering     process. Goldman Sachs has cooperated with these investigations.     Iridium     Securities Litigation         GS&Co. has been named as a defendant in two purported class     action lawsuits commenced, beginning on May 26, 1999,     in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia     brought on behalf of purchasers of Class A common stock of     Iridium World Communications, Ltd. in a January 1999     underwritten secondary offering of 7,500,000 shares of     Class A common stock. All parties entered into settlement     agreements, with the underwriter defendants contributing     $8.25 million to a settlement fund. The settlement was     approved by the Court by order dated October 23, 2008     and has become final.     World Online     Litigation         Several lawsuits have been commenced in the Netherlands courts     based on alleged misstatements and omissions relating to the     initial public offering of World Online in March 2000.     Goldman Sachs and ABN AMRO Rothschild served as joint global     coordinators of the approximately 2.9 billion     offering. GSI underwrote 20,268,846 shares and GS&Co.     underwrote 6,756,282 shares for a total offering price of     approximately 1.16 billion.         On September 11, 2000, several Dutch World Online     shareholders as well as a Dutch entity purporting to represent     the interests of certain World Online shareholders commenced a     proceeding in Amsterdam District Court against ABN AMRO     Bank N.V., also acting under the name of ABN AMRO     Rothschild, alleging misrepresentations and omissions     relating to the initial public offering of World Online. The     lawsuit seeks, among other things, the return of the purchase     price of the shares purchased by the plaintiffs or unspecified     damages. The court held that the claims failed and dismissed the     complaint and the Amsterdam Court of Appeal affirmed dismissal     of the complaint.         In March 2001, a Dutch shareholders association initiated     legal proceedings for an unspecified amount of damages against     GSI in Amsterdam District Court in connection with the World     Online        42    Table of Contents       offering. The court rejected the claims against GSI, but found     World Online liable in an amount to be determined. The Dutch     shareholders association appealed from the dismissal of their     claims against GSI. By a decision dated May 3, 2007,     the Netherlands Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed     in part the decision of the district court dismissing the     complaint, holding that certain of the alleged disclosure     deficiencies were actionable. On July 24, 2007, the     shareholder association appealed from the Netherlands Court of     Appeals decision to the extent that it affirmed the decision of     the district court dismissing the complaint. On     November 2, 2007, GSI joined the other defendants in     appealing from the Court of Appeals decision to the extent that     it reversed the district courts dismissal.     Research     Independence Matters         GS&Co. is one of several investment firms that have been     named as defendants in substantively identical purported class     actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern     District of New York alleging violations of the federal     securities laws in connection with research coverage of certain     issuers and seeking compensatory damages. In one such action,     relating to coverage of RSL Communications, Inc. commenced on     July 15, 2003, GS&Co.s motion to dismiss     the complaint was denied. The district court granted the     plaintiffs motion for class certification and the     U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, by an order     dated January 26, 2007, vacated the district courts     class certification and remanded for reconsideration.         GS&Co. is also a defendant in several actions relating to     research coverage of Exodus Communications, Inc. that commenced     beginning in May 2003. The actions were consolidated,     Goldman, Sachs & Co.s motion to dismiss was     granted with leave to replead, and plaintiff filed a second     amended complaint. The defendants motion to dismiss the     second amended complaint was granted by order dated     December 4, 2007, and plaintiffs motion for     reconsideration was denied by order dated     June 3, 2008. Plaintiff appealed the dismissal, and     while the appeal was pending, the parties entered into a     settlement agreement on a     non-class     basis, disposing of the case.         A purported shareholder derivative action was filed in New York     Supreme Court, New York County on June 13, 2003     against Group Inc. and its board of directors, which, as amended     on March 3, 2004 and June 14, 2005, alleges     that the directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection     with the firms research as well as the firms IPO     allocations practices.         Group Inc., GS&Co. and Henry M. Paulson, Jr., the former     Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Group Inc., have been     named as defendants in a purported class action filed originally     on July 18, 2003 in the U.S. District Court for     the District of Nevada on behalf of purchasers of Group Inc.     stock from July 1, 1999 through May 7, 2002.     The complaint alleges that defendants breached their fiduciary     duties and violated the federal securities laws in connection     with the firms research activities. The complaint seeks,     among other things, unspecified compensatory damages     and/or     rescission. The action was transferred on consent to the     U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York,     and the district court granted the defendants motion to     dismiss with leave to amend. Plaintiffs filed a second amended     complaint, and defendants filed a motion to dismiss. In a     decision dated September 29, 2006, the federal     district court granted Mr. Paulsons motion to dismiss     with leave to replead but otherwise denied the motion.     Plaintiffs motion for class certification was granted by a     decision dated September 15, 2008, and on     September 26, 2008, the Goldman Sachs defendants filed     a petition in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second     Circuit seeking review of the certification ruling.         Group Inc. and its affiliates, together with other financial     services firms, have received requests for information from     various governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations     in connection with their review of research independence issues.     Goldman Sachs has cooperated with these requests. See     Business  Regulation  Regulations     Applicable in and Outside the United States in     Part I, Item 1 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for a discussion of our global research settlement.        43    Table of Contents   Enron Litigation     Matters         Goldman Sachs affiliates are defendants in certain actions     relating to Enron Corp., which filed for protection under the     U.S. bankruptcy laws on December 2, 2001.         GS&Co. and co-managing underwriters have been named as     defendants in certain purported securities class and individual     actions commenced beginning on December 14, 2001 in     the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas     and California Superior Court brought by purchasers of     $255,875,000, (including     over-allotments)     of Exchangeable Notes of Enron Corp. in August 1999. The     notes were mandatorily exchangeable in 2002 into shares of Enron     Oil & Gas Company held by Enron Corp. or their cash     equivalent. The complaints also name as defendants Group Inc. as     well as certain past and present officers and directors of Enron     Corp. and the companys outside accounting firm. The     complaints generally allege violations of the disclosure     requirements of the federal securities laws     and/or state     law, and seek compensatory damages. GS&Co. underwrote     $127,937,500 (including     over-allotments)     principal amount of the notes. Group Inc. and GS&Co. moved     to dismiss the class action complaint in the Texas federal court     and the motion was granted as to Group Inc. but denied as to     GS&Co. One of the plaintiffs has moved for class     certification. GS&Co. has moved for judgment on the     pleadings against all plaintiffs. On October 18, 2007,     the parties reached a settlement agreement in principle pursuant     to which GS&Co. has contributed $11.5 million to a     settlement fund, subject to definitive documentation and court     approval. Plaintiffs in various consolidated actions relating to     Enron entered into a settlement with Banc of America Securities     LLC on July 2, 2004 and with Citigroup, Inc. on     June 10, 2005, including with respect to claims     relating to the Exchangeable Notes offering, as to which     affiliates of those settling defendants were two of the three     underwriters (together with GS&Co.).         Several funds which allegedly sustained investment losses of     approximately $125 million in connection with secondary     market purchases of the Exchangeable Notes as well as Zero     Coupon Convertible Notes of Enron Corp. commenced an action in     the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New     York on January 16, 2002. As amended, the lawsuit     names as defendants the underwriters of the August 1999     offering and the companys outside accounting firm, and     alleges violations of the disclosure requirements of the federal     securities laws, fraud and misrepresentation. The Judicial Panel     on Multidistrict Litigation has transferred that action to the     Texas federal district court for purposes of coordinated or     consolidated pretrial proceedings with other matters relating to     Enron Corp. GS&Co. moved to dismiss the complaint and the     motion was granted in part and denied in part. The district     court granted the funds motion for leave to file a second     amended complaint on January 22, 2007.         GS&Co. is among numerous defendants in two substantively     identical actions filed by Enron Corp.s bankruptcy trustee     in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of     New York beginning in November 2003 seeking to recover as     fraudulent transfers     and/or     preferences payments made by Enron Corp. in repurchasing its     commercial paper shortly before its bankruptcy filing.     GS&Co., which had acted as a commercial paper dealer for     Enron Corp., resold to Enron Corp. approximately     $30 million of commercial paper as principal, and as an     agent facilitated Enron Corp.s repurchase of approximately     $340 million additional commercial paper from various     customers who have also been named as defendants. The bankruptcy     court denied GS&Co.s motion to dismiss as well as     similar motions by other defendants. On     August 1, 2005, various defendants including     GS&Co. petitioned to have the denial of their motion to     dismiss reviewed by the U.S. District Court for the     Southern District of New York. On March 10, 2008, the     district court denied GS&Co.s motion to remove the     standing reference at the present time. On     April 29, 2008, GS&Co. moved for summary     judgment. On January 6, 2009, GS&Co. entered into     a settlement with the trustee pursuant to which it will pay     $6.95 million in exchange for a release and a bar order     against any third party claims. The settlement was approved by     the bankruptcy court on January 21, 2009.        44    Table of Contents   Exodus Securities     Litigation         By an amended complaint dated July 11, 2002,     GS&Co. and the other lead underwriters for the     February 2001 offering of 13,000,000 shares of common     stock and $575,000,000 of     51/4%     convertible subordinated notes of Exodus Communications, Inc.     were added as defendants in a purported class action pending in     the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of     California. The complaint, which also names as defendants     certain officers and directors of Exodus Communications, Inc.,     alleged violations of the disclosure requirements of the federal     securities laws and seeks compensatory damages. The parties     entered into a settlement agreement, with the underwriter     defendants contributing $1 million toward a settlement     fund. The settlement was approved by the district court on     October 31, 2008 and has become final.     Montana Power     Litigation         GS&Co. and Group Inc. have been named as defendants in a     purported class action commenced originally on     October 1, 2001 in Montana District Court, Second     Judicial District on behalf of former shareholders of Montana     Power Company. The complaint generally alleges that Montana     Power Company violated Montana law by failing to procure     shareholder approval of certain corporate strategies and     transactions, that the companys board breached its     fiduciary duties in pursuing those strategies and transactions,     and that GS&Co. aided and abetted the boards breaches     and rendered negligent advice in its role as financial advisor     to the company. The complaint seeks, among other things,     compensatory damages. In addition to GS&Co. and Group Inc.,     the defendants include Montana Power Company, certain of its     officers and directors, an outside law firm for the Montana     Power Company, and certain companies that purchased assets from     Montana Power Company and its affiliates. The Montana state     court denied the Goldman Sachs defendants motions to     dismiss. Following the bankruptcies of certain defendants in the     action, defendants removed the action to federal court, the     U.S. District Court for the District of Montana, Butte     Division.         On October 26, 2004, a creditors committee of Touch     America Holdings, Inc. brought an action against GS&Co.,     Group Inc., and a former outside law firm for Montana Power     Company in Montana District Court, Second Judicial District. The     complaint asserts that Touch America Holdings, Inc. is the     successor to Montana Power Corporation and alleges substantially     the same claims as in the purported class action. Defendants     removed the action to federal court. Defendants moved to dismiss     the complaint, but the motion was denied by a decision dated     June 10, 2005.     Adelphia     Communications Fraudulent Conveyance Litigation         GS&Co. is among numerous entities named as defendants in     two adversary proceedings commenced in the U.S. Bankruptcy     Court for the Southern District of New York, one on     July 6, 2003 by a creditors committee, and the second     on or about July 31, 2003 by an equity committee of     Adelphia Communications, Inc. Those proceedings have now been     consolidated in a single amended complaint filed by the Adelphia     Recovery Trust on October 31, 2007. The complaint     seeks, among other things, to recover, as fraudulent     conveyances, payments made allegedly by Adelphia Communications,     Inc. and its affiliates to certain brokerage firms, including     approximately $62.9 million allegedly paid to GS&Co.,     in respect of margin calls made in the ordinary course of     business on accounts owned by members of the family that     formerly controlled Adelphia Communications, Inc. GS&Co.     moved to dismiss the claim related to such margin payments on     December 21, 2007.     Specialist     Matters         Spear, Leeds & Kellogg Specialists LLC (SLKS) and     certain affiliates have received requests for information from     various governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations     as part of an     industry-wide     investigation relating to activities of floor specialists in     recent years. Goldman Sachs has cooperated with the requests.        45    Table of Contents       On March 30, 2004, certain specialist firms on the     NYSE, including SLKS, without admitting or denying the     allegations, entered into a final global settlement with the SEC     and the NYSE covering certain activities during the years 1999     through 2003. The SLKS settlement involves, among other things,     (i) findings by the SEC and the NYSE that SLKS violated     certain federal securities laws and NYSE rules, and in some     cases failed to supervise certain individual specialists, in     connection with trades that allegedly disadvantaged customer     orders, (ii) a cease and desist order against SLKS,     (iii) a censure of SLKS, (iv) SLKS agreement to     pay an aggregate of $45.3 million in disgorgement and a     penalty to be used to compensate customers, (v) certain     undertakings with respect to SLKS systems and procedures,     and (v) SLKS retention of an independent consultant     to review and evaluate certain of SLKS compliance systems,     policies and procedures. Comparable findings were made and     sanctions imposed in the settlements with other specialist     firms. The settlement did not resolve the related private civil     actions against SLKS and other firms or regulatory     investigations involving individuals or conduct on other     exchanges.         SLKS, Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, L.P. and Group Inc. are     among numerous defendants named in purported class actions     brought beginning in October 2003 on behalf of investors in     the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New     York alleging violations of the federal securities laws and     state common law in connection with NYSE floor specialist     activities. The actions seek unspecified compensatory damages,     restitution and disgorgement on behalf of purchasers and sellers     of unspecified securities between October 17, 1998 and     October 15, 2003. Plaintiffs filed a consolidated     amended complaint on September 16, 2004. The     defendants motion to dismiss the amended complaint was     granted in part and denied in part by a decision dated     December 13, 2005. On June 28, 2007,     plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to certify a class.     Treasury     Matters         On September 4, 2003, the SEC announced that     GS&Co. had settled an administrative proceeding arising     from certain trading in U.S. Treasury bonds over an     approximately eight-minute period after GS&Co. received an     October 31, 2001 telephone call from a Washington,     D.C.-based political consultant concerning a forthcoming     Treasury refunding announcement. Without admitting or denying     the allegations, GS&Co. consented to the entry of an order     that, among other things, (i) censured GS&Co.;     (ii) directed GS&Co. to cease and desist from     committing or causing any violations of     Sections 15(c)(1)(A) and (C) and 15(f) of, and     Rule 15c1-2     under, the Exchange Act; (iii) ordered GS&Co. to pay     disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of     $1,742,642, and a civil monetary penalty of $5 million; and     (iv) directed GS&Co. to conduct a review of its     policies and procedures and adopt, implement and maintain     policies and procedures consistent with the order and that     review. GS&Co. also undertook to pay $2,562,740 in     disgorgement and interest relating to certain trading in     U.S. Treasury bond futures during the same eight-minute     period.         GS&Co. has been named as a defendant in a purported class     action filed on March 10, 2004 in the     U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois     on behalf of holders of short positions in     30-year     U.S. Treasury futures and options on the morning of     October 31, 2001. The complaint alleges that the firm     purchased     30-year     bonds and futures prior to the Treasurys refunding     announcement that morning based on     non-public     information about that announcement, and that such purchases     increased the costs of covering such short positions. The     complaint also names as defendants the Washington, D.C.-based     political consultant who allegedly was the source of the     information, a former GS&Co. economist who allegedly     received the information, and another company and one of its     employees who also allegedly received and traded on the     information prior to its public announcement. The complaint     alleges violations of the federal commodities and antitrust     laws, as well as Illinois statutory and common law, and seeks,     among other things, unspecified damages including treble damages     under the antitrust laws. The district court dismissed the     antitrust and Illinois state law claims but permitted the     federal commodities law claims to proceed. Plaintiffs     motion for class certification was denied by a decision dated     August 22, 2008. GS&Co. moved for summary     judgment, and by a decision dated July 30, 2008, the     district court granted the motion insofar as the remaining        46    Table of Contents       claim relates to the trading of treasury bonds, but denied the     motion without prejudice to the extent the claim relates to     trading of treasury futures.     Mutual     Fund Matters         GS&Co. and certain mutual fund affiliates have received     subpoenas and requests for information from various governmental     agencies and self-regulatory organizations including the SEC as     part of the     industry-wide     investigation relating to the practices of mutual funds and     their customers. GS&Co. and its affiliates have cooperated     with such requests.     Refco Securities     Litigation         GS&Co. and the other lead underwriters for the     August 2005 initial public offering of     26,500,000 shares of common stock of Refco Inc. are among     the defendants in various putative class actions filed in the     U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York     beginning in October 2005 by investors in Refco Inc. in     response to certain publicly reported events that culminated in     the October 17, 2005 filing by Refco Inc. and certain     affiliates for protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. The     actions, which have been consolidated, allege violations of the     disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws and seek     compensatory damages. In addition to the underwriters, the     consolidated complaint names as defendants Refco Inc. and     certain of its affiliates, certain officers and directors of     Refco Inc., Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (which held a majority     of Refco Inc.s equity through certain funds it manages),     Grant Thornton (Refco Inc.s outside auditor), and BAWAG     P.S.K. Bank fur Arbeit und Wirtschaft und Osterreichische     Postsparkasse Aktiengesellschaft (BAWAG). Lead plaintiffs     entered into a settlement with BAWAG, which was approved     following certain amendments on June 29, 2007.     GS&Co. underwrote 5,639,200 shares of common stock at     a price of $22 per share for a total offering price of     approximately $124 million.         A purported shareholder derivative action was filed in the     U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York     on November 2, 2005 on behalf of Group Inc. against     certain of its officers and directors. The complaint alleges     that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties     by failing to ensure that adequate due diligence was conducted     in connection with the Refco Inc. initial public offering. The     parties subsequently stipulated to the actions dismissal,     and the action was dismissed by the district court by order     dated January 7, 2009.         GS&Co. has, together with other underwriters of the Refco     Inc. initial public offering, received requests for information     from various governmental agencies and self-regulatory     organizations. GS&Co. is cooperating with those requests.     Short-Selling     Litigation         Group Inc., GS&Co. and Goldman Sachs Execution &     Clearing, L.P. are among the numerous financial services firms     that have been named as defendants in a purported class action     filed on April 12, 2006 in the U.S. District     Court for the Southern District of New York by customers who     engaged in     short-selling     transactions in equity securities since     April 12, 2000. The amended complaint generally     alleges that the customers were charged fees in connection with     the short sales but that the applicable securities were not     necessarily borrowed to effect delivery, resulting in failed     deliveries, and that the defendants conspired to set a minimum     threshold borrowing rate for securities designated as hard to     borrow. The complaint asserts a claim under the federal     antitrust laws, as well as claims under the New York Business     Law and common law, and seeks treble damages as well as     injunctive relief. Defendants motion to dismiss the     complaint was granted by a decision dated     December 20, 2007. On January 18, 2008,     plaintiffs appealed from this decision.     Fannie Mae     Litigation         GS&Co. was added as a defendant in an amended complaint     filed on August 14, 2006 in a purported class action     pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of     Columbia. The complaint        47    Table of Contents       asserts violations of the federal securities laws generally     arising from allegations concerning Fannie Maes accounting     practices in connection with certain Fannie Mae-sponsored REMIC     transactions that were allegedly arranged by GS&Co. The     other defendants include Fannie Mae, certain of its past and     present officers and directors, and accountants. By a decision     dated May 8, 2007, the district court granted     GS&Co.s motion to dismiss the claim against it. The     time for an appeal will not begin to run until disposition of     the claims against other defendants.         Beginning in September 2006, Group Inc.     and/or     GS&Co. were added named as defendants in four Fannie Mae     shareholder derivative actions in the U.S. District Court     for the District of Columbia. The complaints generally allege     that the Goldman Sachs defendants aided and abetted a breach of     fiduciary duty by Fannie Maes directors and officers in     connection with certain Fannie Mae-sponsored REMIC transactions     and one of the complaints also asserts a breach of contract     claim. The complaints also name as defendants certain former     officers and directors of Fannie Mae as well as an outside     accounting firm. The complaints seek, inter alia,     unspecified damages. The Goldman Sachs defendants were dismissed     without prejudice from the first filed of these actions, and the     remaining claims in that action were dismissed for failure to     make a demand on Fannie Maes board of directors. That     dismissal has been affirmed on appeal. The remaining three     actions have been stayed by the district court.     General American     Litigation         On February 13, 2007, the liquidators of General     American Mutual Holding Corporation filed a complaint in     Missouri Circuit Court against one of the companys former     officers to assert claims against Group Inc. and GS&Co. The     amended complaint asserted that the Goldman Sachs defendants     breached certain duties and violated Missouri law in the course     of acting as the companys financial advisor during     1998-1999 in     connection with the exploration of a potential demutualization     and initial public offering, and the ensuing sale of certain     company assets. The complaint sought compensatory and punitive     damages. The parties settled the action, with the Goldman Sachs     defendants paying $99.975 million. The settlement was     approved by order dated November 6, 2008.     Executive     Compensation Litigation         On March 16, 2007, Group Inc., its board of directors,     executive officers and members of its management committee were     named as defendants in a purported shareholder derivative action     in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New     York challenging the sufficiency of the firms     February 21, 2007 Proxy Statement and the compensation     of certain employees. The complaint generally alleges that the     Proxy Statement undervalues stock option awards disclosed     therein, that the recipients received excessive awards because     the proper methodology was not followed, and that the     firms senior management received excessive compensation,     constituting corporate waste. The complaint seeks, among other     things, an injunction against the 2007 Annual Meeting of     Shareholders, the voiding of any election of directors in the     absence of an injunction and an equitable accounting for the     allegedly excessive compensation. On July 20, 2007,     defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, the motion was     granted by an order dated December 18, 2008 and     plaintiff appealed on January 13, 2009.         On January 17, 2008, Group Inc., its board of     directors, executive officers and members of its management     committee were named as defendants in a related purported     shareholder derivative action brought by the same plaintiff in     the same court predicting that the firms 2008 Proxy     Statement will violate the federal securities laws by     undervaluing certain stock option awards and alleging that     senior management received excessive compensation for 2007. The     complaint seeks, among other things, an injunction against the     distribution of the 2008 Proxy Statement, the voiding of any     election        48    Table of Contents       of directors in the absence of an injunction and an equitable     accounting for the allegedly excessive compensation. On     January 25, 2008, the plaintiff moved for a     preliminary injunction to prevent the 2008 Proxy Statement from     using options valuations that the plaintiff alleges are     incorrect and to require the amendment of SEC Form 4s filed     by certain of the executive officers named in the complaint to     reflect the stock option valuations alleged by the plaintiff.     Plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction was denied     by order dated February 14, 2008, plaintiff appealed     and twice moved to expedite the appeal, with the motions being     denied by orders dated February 29, 2008 and     April 3, 2008.     Mortgage-Related     Matters         GS&Co. and certain of its affiliates, together with other     financial services firms, have received requests for information     from various governmental agencies and self-regulatory     organizations relating to subprime mortgages, and     securitizations, collateralized debt obligations and synthetic     products related to subprime mortgages. GS&Co. and its     affiliates are cooperating with the requests.         GS&Co., along with numerous other financial institutions,     is a defendant in an action brought by the City of Cleveland     alleging that the defendants activities in connection with     securitizations of subprime mortgages created a public     nuisance in Cleveland. The action is pending in the     U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, and     the complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified     compensatory damages. Defendants moved to dismiss on     November 24, 2008.         GS&Co., Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company and GS Mortgage     Securities Corp. are among the defendants in a purported class     action commenced on December 11, 2008 in the U.S. District     Court for the Southern District of New York brought on behalf of     purchasers of various mortgage pass-through certificates and     asset-backed certificates issued by various securitization     trusts in 2007 and underwritten by GS&Co. The other     defendants include the various issuer trusts that issued the     securities as well as certain officers and directors of certain     of the entity defendants. The complaint generally alleges that     the registration statement and prospectus supplements for the     certificates violated the federal securities laws. The complaint     asserts claims against the issuer trusts and GS&Co. under     Section 11 of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (Securities     Act), and a related controlling person claim against     the other defendants under Section 15 of the Securities     Act, and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and rescission     or recessionary damages.     Auction Products     Matters         On August 21, 2008, GS&Co. entered into a     settlement in principle with the Office of Attorney General of     the State of New York and the Illinois Securities Department (on     behalf of the North American Securities Administrators     Association) regarding auction rate securities. Under the     agreement, Goldman Sachs agreed, among other things, (i) to     offer to repurchase at par the outstanding auction rate     securities that its private wealth management clients purchased     through the firm prior to February 11, 2008, with the     exception of those auction rate securities where auctions are     clearing, (ii) to continue to work with issuers and other     interested parties, including regulatory and governmental     entities, to expeditiously provide liquidity solutions for     institutional investors, and (iii) to pay a     $22.5 million fine. The settlement, which is subject to     definitive documentation and approval by the various states,     does not resolve any potential regulatory action by the SEC.         On August 28, 2008, a putative shareholder derivative     action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the     Southern District of New York naming as defendants Group Inc.,     its board of directors, and certain senior officers. The     complaint alleges generally that the board breached its     fiduciary duties and committed mismanagement in connection with     its oversight of auction rate securities marketing and trading     operations, that certain individual defendants engaged in     insider selling by selling shares of Group Inc., and that the     firms public filings were false and misleading in     violation of the federal securities laws by failing to     accurately disclose the alleged practices involving auction rate     securities. The complaint seeks damages, injunctive and     declaratory relief, restitution, and an order requiring the firm     to adopt corporate reforms. Defendants moved to dismiss on     January 23, 2009.        49    Table of Contents       On September 4, 2008, Group Inc. was named as a     defendant, together with numerous other financial services     firms, in two complaints filed in the U.S. District Court     for the Southern District of New York alleging that the     defendants engaged in a conspiracy to manipulate the auction     securities market in violation of federal antitrust laws. The     actions were filed, respectively, on behalf of putative classes     of issuers of and investors in auction rate securities and seek,     among other things, treble damages. Defendants moved to dismiss     on January 15, 2009.     Private     Equity-Sponsored     Acquisitions Litigation         Group Inc. and GS Capital Partners are among     numerous private equity firms and investment banks named as     defendants in a federal antitrust action filed in the     U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts in     December 2007. As amended, the complaint generally alleges     that the defendants have colluded to limit competition in     bidding for private     equity-sponsored     acquisitions of public companies, thereby resulting in lower     prevailing bids and, by extension, less consideration for     shareholders of those companies in violation of Section 1     of the U.S. Sherman Antitrust Act and common law.     Defendants moved to dismiss on August 27, 2008. By an     order dated November 19, 2008, the district court     dismissed claims relating to certain transactions that were the     subject of releases as part of the settlement of shareholder     actions challenging such transactions, and by an order dated     December 15, 2008 otherwise denied the motion to     dismiss.     Washington Mutual     Securities Litigation         GS&Co. is among numerous underwriters named as defendants     in a putative securities class action amended complaint filed on     August 5, 2008 in the U.S. District Court for the     Western District of Washington. As to the underwriters,     plaintiffs allege that the offering documents in connection with     various securities offerings by Washington Mutual, Inc. failed     to describe accurately the companys exposure to     mortgage-related     activities in violation of the disclosure requirements of the     federal securities laws. The defendants include past and present     directors and officers of Washington Mutual, the companys     former outside auditors, and numerous underwriters. The     underwriter defendants moved to dismiss on     December 8, 2008. GS&Co. underwrote $788,500,000     principal amount of securities in the offerings at issue.         On September 25, 2008, the FDIC took over the primary     banking operations of Washington Mutual, Inc. and then sold     them. On September 27, 2008, Washington Mutual, Inc.     filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. bankruptcy     court in Delaware.     Britannia Bulk     Securities Litigation         GS&Co. is among the underwriters named as defendants in     numerous putative securities class actions filed beginning on     November 6, 2008 in the U.S. District Court for     the Southern District of New York arising from the     June 17, 2008 $125 million initial public     offering of common stock of Britannia Bulk Holdings, Inc. The     complaints name as defendants the company, certain of its     directors and officers, and the underwriters for the offering.     Plaintiffs allege that the offering materials violated the     disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws and seek     compensatory damages. Defendants have yet to respond.         GS&Co. underwrote 3.75 million shares of common stock     for a total offering price of $56.25 million. The principal     operating subsidiary of Britannia Bulk Holdings, Inc. is subject     to an insolvency proceeding in the U.K. courts.           Item 4.

As of January 16, 2009, there were 9,909 holders of     record of our common stock.

Our board of directors     will take into account such matters as general business     conditions, our financial results, capital requirements,     contractual, legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of     dividends by us to our shareholders or by our subsidiaries to     us, the effect on our debt ratings and such other factors as our     board of directors may deem relevant.

(2)   On March 21, 2000, we     announced that our board of directors had approved a repurchase     program, pursuant to which up to 15 million shares of our     common stock may be repurchased. This repurchase program was     increased by an aggregate of 280 million shares by     resolutions of our board of directors adopted on     June 18, 2001, March 18, 2002,     November 20, 2002, January 30, 2004,     January 25, 2005, September 16, 2005,     September 11, 2006 and December 17, 2007. We     use our share repurchase program to help maintain the     appropriate level of common equity and to substantially offset     increases in share count over time resulting from employee     share-based     compensation. Prior to October 28, 2011, unless we     have redeemed all the preferred stock issued to the     U.S. Treasury on October 28, 2008 or unless the     U.S. Treasury has transferred all the preferred stock to a     third party, the consent of the U.S. Treasury will be     required for us to repurchase our common stock in an aggregate     amount greater than the increase in the number of diluted shares     outstanding (as reported in our Quarterly Report on     Form 10-Q     for the three months ended     August 29, 2008) resulting from the grant,     vesting or exercise of     equity-based     compensation to employees and equitably adjusted for any stock     split, stock dividend, reverse stock split, reclassification or     similar transaction.           The repurchase program is effected     primarily through regular     open-market     purchases, the amounts and timing of which are determined     primarily by our current and projected capital positions     (i.e., comparisons of our desired level of capital to our     actual level of capital) but which may also be influenced by     general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading     volumes of our common stock, in each case subject to the limit     imposed under the U.S. Treasurys TARP Capital     Purchase Program. The total remaining authorization under the     repurchase program was 60,852,478 shares as of     January 16, 2009; the repurchase program has no set     expiration or termination date.                 Information relating to compensation plans under which our     equity securities are authorized for issuance is set forth in     Part III, Item 12 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K.

The firms     2009 fiscal year began December 27, 2008 and will end     December 25, 2009, resulting in a     one-month     transition period that began November 29, 2008 and     ended December 26, 2008.         When we use the terms Goldman Sachs, the     firm, we, us and our,     we mean Group Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated     subsidiaries. References herein to our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     are to our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2008.         In this discussion, we have included statements that may     constitute forward-looking statements within the     meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private     Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking     statements are not historical facts but instead represent only     our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their     nature, are inherently uncertain and outside our control. These     statements include statements other than historical information     or statements of current condition and may relate to our future     plans and objectives and results, among other things, and may     also include statements about the objectives and effectiveness     of our risk management and liquidity policies, statements about     trends in or growth opportunities for our businesses, statements     about our future status, activities or reporting under     U.S. banking regulation, and statements about our     investment banking transaction backlog. By identifying these     statements for you in this manner, we are alerting you to the     possibility that our actual results and financial condition may     differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and     financial condition indicated in these forward-looking     statements. Important factors that could cause our actual     results and financial condition to differ from those indicated     in these forward-looking statements include, among others, those     discussed below under      Certain     Risk Factors That May Affect Our Businesses as well as     Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our     Annual Report on     Form 10-K     and Cautionary Statement Pursuant to the U.S. Private     Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 in Part I,     Item 1 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K.        56    Table of Contents      Executive     Overview          Our diluted earnings per common share were $4.47 for 2008,     compared with $24.73 for 2007. Return on average tangible common     shareholders equity     (1) was      5.5% and return on average common shareholders equity was     4.9% for 2008. As of November 2008, book value per common     share was $98.68, an increase of 9.1% compared with the end of     2007, and our Tier 1 Ratio     (2) was      15.6%. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we raised     $20.75 billion in equity, comprised of a $5.75 billion     public common stock sale, a $5 billion preferred stock and     warrant issuance to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and certain     affiliates and a $10 billion preferred stock and warrant     issuance under the U.S. Department of the Treasurys     (U.S. Treasury) TARP Capital Purchase Program. Total assets     were $885 billion at the end of the year, a decrease of 21%     compared with the end of 2007. During the fourth quarter of     2008, the firm became a bank holding company regulated by the     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal     Reserve Board).         Our results for 2008 reflected a particularly difficult     operating environment, including significant asset price     declines, high levels of volatility and reduced levels of     liquidity, particularly in the fourth quarter. In addition,     credit markets experienced significant dislocation between     prices for cash instruments and the related derivative contracts     and between credit indices and underlying single names. Net     revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were significantly     lower compared with 2007, reflecting significant declines in     Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC), Principal     Investments and Equities. The decrease in FICC primarily     reflected losses in credit products, which included a loss of     approximately $3.1 billion (net of hedges) related to     non-investment-grade     credit origination activities and losses from investments,     including corporate debt and private and public equities.     Results in mortgages included net losses of approximately     $1.7 billion on residential mortgage loans and securities     and approximately $1.4 billion on commercial mortgage loans     and securities. Interest rate products, currencies and     commodities each produced particularly strong results and net     revenues were higher compared with 2007. During 2008, although     client-driven activity was generally solid, FICC operated in a     challenging environment characterized by     broad-based     declines in asset values, wider mortgage and corporate credit     spreads, reduced levels of liquidity and     broad-based     investor deleveraging, particularly in the second half of the     year. The decline in Principal Investments primarily reflected     net losses of $2.53 billion from corporate principal     investments and $949 million from real estate principal     investments, as well as a $446 million loss from our     investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and Commercial     Bank of China Limited (ICBC). In Equities, the decrease compared     with particularly strong net revenues in 2007 reflected losses     in principal strategies, partially offset by higher net revenues     in our client franchise businesses. Commissions were     particularly strong and were higher than 2007. During 2008,     Equities operated in an environment characterized by a     significant decline in global equity prices,     broad-based     investor deleveraging and very high levels of volatility,     particularly in the second half of the year.              (1)          Return on average tangible common     shareholders equity (ROTE) is computed by dividing net     earnings applicable to common shareholders by average monthly     tangible common shareholders equity. See      Results     of Operations  Financial Overview below for     further information regarding our calculation of ROTE.            (2)          Before we became a bank holding     company, we were subject to capital guidelines as a Consolidated     Supervised Entity (CSE) that were generally consistent with     those set out in the Revised Framework for the International     Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards issued     by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel II). We     currently compute and report our consolidated capital ratios in     accordance with the Basel II requirements, as applicable to us     when we were regulated as a CSE, for the purpose of assessing     the adequacy of our capital. Under the Basel II framework as it     applied to us when we were regulated as a CSE, our Tier 1     Ratio equals Tier 1 Capital divided by Total     Risk-Weighted     Assets (RWAs). We are currently working with the Federal Reserve     Board to put in place the appropriate reporting and compliance     mechanisms and methodologies to allow reporting of the     Basel I capital ratios as of the end of March 2009. See      Equity     Capital below for a further discussion of our Tier 1     Ratio.               57    Table of Contents       Net revenues in Investment Banking also declined significantly     compared with 2007, reflecting significantly lower net revenues     in both Financial Advisory and Underwriting. In Financial     Advisory, the decrease compared with particularly strong net     revenues in 2007 reflected a decline in     industry-wide     completed mergers and acquisitions. The decrease in Underwriting     primarily reflected significantly lower net revenues in debt     underwriting, primarily due to a decline in leveraged finance     and     mortgage-related     activity, reflecting difficult market conditions. Net revenues     in equity underwriting were slightly lower compared with 2007,     reflecting a decrease in     industry-wide     equity and     equity-related     offerings. Our investment banking transaction backlog at the end     of 2008 was significantly lower than it was at the end of 2007.     (3)         Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services     increased compared with 2007. Securities Services net revenues     were higher, reflecting the impact of changes in the composition     of securities lending customer balances, as well as higher total     average customer balances. Asset Management net revenues     increased slightly compared with 2007. During the year, assets     under management decreased $89 billion to     $779 billion, due to $123 billion of market     depreciation, primarily in equity assets, partially offset by     $34 billion of net inflows.         Given the difficult market conditions, and in particular, the     challenging liquidity and funding environment during 2008, we     focused on reducing concentrated risk positions, including our     exposure to leveraged loans and real estate-related loans. We     believe that the strength of our capital position will enable us     to take advantage of market opportunities as they arise in 2009.         Our business, by its nature, does not produce predictable     earnings. Our results in any given period can be materially     affected by conditions in global financial markets and economic     conditions generally. For a further discussion of the factors     that may affect our future operating results, see      Certain     Risk Factors That May Affect Our Businesses below as well     as Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our     Annual Report on     Form 10-K.      (3) Our      investment banking transaction backlog represents an estimate of     our future net revenues from investment banking transactions     where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely     than not.        58    Table of Contents      Business     Environment          Our financial performance is highly dependent on the environment     in which our businesses operate. During the first half of 2008,     global economic growth slowed as the U.S. entered a     recession. Despite the weakness in the U.S. and other major     economies, growth in most emerging markets remained solid, which     contributed to a dramatic increase in commodity prices as well     as increased inflation. However, during the second half of 2008,     the downturn in global economic growth became     broad-based,     which coincided with significant weakness and sharply reduced     liquidity across global financial markets. For a further     discussion of how market conditions affect our businesses, see      Certain     Risk Factors That May Affect Our Businesses below as well     as Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our     Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     A further discussion of the business environment in 2008 is set     forth below.     Global.  Growth in the global economy weakened     substantially over the course of 2008, particularly in the major     economies. Economic growth in emerging markets also generally     declined in 2008, but remained high relative to the major     economies. Fixed income and equity markets experienced high     levels of volatility,     broad-based     declines in asset prices and reduced levels of liquidity,     particularly during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. In     addition, mortgage and corporate credit spreads widened and     credit markets experienced significant dislocation between     prices for cash instruments and the related derivative contracts     and between credit indices and underlying single names. The     U.S. Federal Reserve lowered its federal funds target rate     over the course of our fiscal year, while central banks in the     Eurozone, United Kingdom, Japan and China also lowered interest     rates towards the end of the year. Oil prices exhibited     significant volatility during our fiscal year, rising to over     $140 per barrel in July before declining to under $60 per barrel     by the end of our fiscal year. In currency markets, the     U.S. dollar initially weakened against most major     currencies, particularly against the Euro, but subsequently     recovered as the pace of decline in global economic growth began     to accelerate in the second half of the year. Investment banking     activity was generally subdued during our fiscal year,     reflecting a significant decline in     industry-wide     announced and completed mergers and acquisitions and equity and     equity-related     offerings compared with 2007.     United States.  Real gross domestic product     growth in the U.S. economy slowed to an estimated 1.2% in     calendar year 2008, down from 2.0% in 2007. The economy entered     a recession near the beginning of our fiscal year, with the     downturn intensifying in our fourth quarter. Much of the     slowdown was attributable to weakness in credit markets brought     on by the contraction in the housing market and the associated     increase in mortgage delinquencies and defaults. Growth in     industrial production slowed from 2007 levels, reflecting     reduced growth in domestic demand and exports. Both business and     consumer confidence declined over the course of the year. Growth     in consumer expenditure was supported in the first half of the     year by the federal governments stimulus package but     declined thereafter, as the housing market continued to weaken     and the rate of unemployment rose significantly. The rate of     inflation increased during the first half of our fiscal year, as     energy and food prices increased significantly, but declined     sharply towards the end of the year. Measures of core inflation,     which remained elevated in the first half of the year, also     declined towards the end of the year as the labor market     continued to weaken and capacity utilization decreased. The     U.S. Federal Reserve reduced its federal funds target rate     by a total of 350 basis points to 1.00% during our fiscal year,     its lowest level since 2003. U.S. regulatory agencies have     also taken additional measures to address reduced levels of     liquidity in credit markets and the U.S. Treasury took     measures to strengthen the capital adequacy of financial     institutions. The yield on the     10-year     U.S. Treasury note declined by 104 basis points to 2.93%     during our fiscal year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the     S&P 500 Index and the NASDAQ Composite Index ended our     fiscal year lower by 34%, 39% and 42%, respectively.     Europe.  Real gross domestic product growth in     the Eurozone economies slowed to an estimated 0.8% in calendar     year 2008, down from 2.6% in 2007. Growth in industrial     production, fixed investment and consumer expenditure weakened     throughout the year. In addition, surveys of business and     consumer confidence declined. Although the labor market remained     solid in the first half of the        59    Table of Contents       year, the unemployment rate began to increase in the second half     of the year. The rate of inflation increased during the first     three quarters of the year. In response to inflationary     pressures, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates     in July, increasing its main refinancing operations rate by 25     basis points to 4.25%. However, during the fourth quarter of our     fiscal year, the ECB lowered its main refinancing operations     rate by a total of 100 basis points to 3.25%, as financial     markets and the outlook for growth weakened considerably and     inflationary pressures appeared to decline. In the United     Kingdom, real gross domestic product growth fell to an estimated     0.9% for calendar year 2008, down from 3.0% in 2007. The decline     in growth accelerated in the second half of the year as credit     market conditions deteriorated and the slowdown in the U.K.     housing market intensified. The rate of inflation increased     during the year, although inflationary pressures appeared to     moderate in our fourth quarter. The Bank of England lowered its     official bank rate over the course of our fiscal year by a total     of 275 basis points to 3.00%.     Long-term     government bond yields in both the Eurozone and the U.K. ended     our fiscal year lower. The Euro and British pound depreciated by     13% and 25%, respectively, against the U.S. dollar during     our fiscal year. Major European equity markets ended our fiscal     year significantly lower.     Asia.  In Japan, real gross domestic product     decreased by an estimated 0.2% in calendar year 2008 compared     with an increase of 2.4% in 2007. Measures of investment     activity in the housing sector and growth in consumption     declined during the year. Export growth remained solid in the     first half of the year but deteriorated notably towards year-end     as the environment outside of Japan worsened. The rate of     inflation increased from the near-zero levels seen in recent     years, but remained moderate. The Bank of Japan lowered its     target overnight call rate by 20 basis points in October,     bringing it to 0.30%, while the yield on     10-year     Japanese government bonds declined by 23 basis points during our     fiscal year. The yen appreciated by 14% against the     U.S. dollar. The Nikkei 225 ended our fiscal year down 46%.         In China, real gross domestic product growth declined to an     estimated 9.0% in calendar year 2008 from 13.0% in 2007. Export     growth and industrial production decelerated rapidly toward the     end of the year, while consumer spending softened but remained     solid. Rising food prices contributed to a higher rate of     inflation in the first half of the year but inflation fell     sharply in the second half of the year. The Peoples Bank     of China raised its     one-year     benchmark lending rate by 18 basis points to 7.47% at the     beginning of our fiscal year, but reduced the lending rate by     189 basis points during our fourth quarter and took additional     measures to increase liquidity in the financial system. The     Chinese government continued to allow the steady appreciation of     its currency against the U.S. dollar in the first half of     the year, after which the exchange rate remained broadly     unchanged. Real gross domestic product growth in India slowed to     an estimated 6.7% in calendar year 2008 from 9.0% in 2007. While     export growth remained solid for most of the year, growth in     consumer expenditure and fixed investment declined. The rate of     wholesale inflation increased sharply in the first half of the     year and then subsequently declined. The Indian rupee, along     with other currencies in the region, generally depreciated     against the U.S. dollar. Equity markets experienced     substantial declines across the region, with the Shanghai     Composite Index down 62%, and markets in Hong Kong, India and     South Korea also ending the year significantly lower.     Other Markets.  Real gross domestic product     growth in Brazil declined to an estimated 5.4% in calendar year     2008 from 5.7% in 2007. For most of the year, growth was     supported by strong capital inflows, high demand for commodity     exports, and strong domestic demand. Towards the end of the     year, however, the economic outlook deteriorated, as the     Brazilian currency depreciated against the U.S. dollar and     commodity prices fell. In Russia, real gross domestic product     growth declined to an estimated 6.2% in calendar year 2008 from     8.1% in 2007. Growth was supported by strong household     consumption and increased capital investment, particularly in     the first half of the year. However, in the fourth quarter, the     pace of growth declined sharply, as capital outflows intensified     and the Russian currency depreciated against the     U.S. dollar. Brazilian and Russian equity prices ended our     fiscal year significantly lower.        60    Table of Contents      Certain Risk     Factors That May Affect Our Businesses          We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in     our businesses, including market, liquidity, credit,     operational, legal and regulatory risks. For a discussion of how     management seeks to manage some of these risks, see      Risk     Management below. A summary of the more important factors     that could affect our businesses follows below. For a further     discussion of these and other important factors that could     affect our businesses, see Risk Factors in     Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     Market Conditions and Market Risk.  Our     financial performance is highly dependent on the environment in     which our businesses operate. Overall, during fiscal 2008, the     business environment has been extremely adverse for many of our     businesses and there can be no assurance that these conditions     will improve in the near term.         A favorable business environment is generally characterized by,     among other factors, high global gross domestic product growth,     transparent, liquid and efficient capital markets, low     inflation, high business and investor confidence, stable     geopolitical conditions and strong business earnings.     Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be     caused by: declines in economic growth, business activity or     investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability     or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in     inflation, interest rates, exchange rate volatility, default     rates or the price of basic commodities; outbreaks of     hostilities or other geopolitical instability; corporate,     political or other scandals that reduce investor confidence in     capital markets; natural disasters or pandemics; or a     combination of these or other factors. Our businesses and     profitability have been and may continue to become adversely     affected by market conditions in many ways, including the     following:                         Many of our businesses, such as our merchant banking businesses,     our mortgages, leveraged loan and credit products businesses in     our FICC segment, and our equity principal strategies business,     have net long positions in debt securities, loans,     derivatives, mortgages, equities (including private equity) and     most other asset classes. In addition, many of our     market-making     and other businesses in which we act as a principal to     facilitate our clients activities, including our     specialist businesses, commit large amounts of capital to     maintain trading positions in interest rate and credit products,     as well as currencies, commodities and equities. Because nearly     all of these investing and trading positions are     marked-to-market     on a daily basis, declines in asset values directly and     immediately impact our earnings, unless we have effectively     hedged our exposures to such declines. In certain     circumstances (particularly in the case of leveraged loans and     private equities or other securities that are not freely     tradable or lack established and liquid trading markets), it may     not be possible or economic to hedge such exposures and to the     extent that we do so the hedge may be ineffective or may greatly     reduce our ability to profit from increases in the values of the     assets. Sudden declines and significant volatility in the prices     of assets may substantially curtail or eliminate the trading     markets for certain assets, which may make it very difficult to     sell, hedge or value such assets. The inability to sell or     effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in     such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may increase     our     risk-weighted     assets which requires us to maintain additional capital and     increases our funding costs.                    Our cost of obtaining     long-term     unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads.     Credit spreads are influenced by market perceptions of our     creditworthiness. Widening credit spreads, as well as     significant declines in the availability of credit, have     adversely affected our ability to borrow on a secured and     unsecured basis and may continue to do so. We fund ourselves on     an unsecured basis by issuing commercial paper, promissory notes     and     long-term     debt, or by obtaining bank loans or lines of credit. We seek to     finance many of our assets, including our less liquid assets, on     a secured basis, including by entering into repurchase     agreements. Disruptions in the credit markets make it harder and     more expensive to obtain funding for our businesses. If our     available funding is limited or we are forced to fund          61    Table of Contents                  our operations at a higher cost, these conditions may require us     to curtail our business activities and increase our cost of     funding, both of which could reduce our profitability,     particularly in our businesses that involve investing, lending     and taking principal positions, including market making.                           Our investment banking business has been and may continue to be     adversely affected by market conditions. Poor economic     conditions and other adverse geopolitical conditions can     adversely affect and have adversely affected investor and CEO     confidence, resulting in significant     industry-wide     declines in the size and number of underwritings and of     financial advisory transactions, which could continue to have an     adverse effect on our revenues and our profit margins. In     addition, our clients engaging in mergers and acquisitions often     rely on access to the secured and unsecured credit markets to     finance their transactions. The lack of available credit and the     increased cost of credit can adversely affect the size, volume     and timing of our clients merger and acquisition     transactions  particularly large transactions.     Because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues     are derived from our participation in large transactions, a     decline in the number of large transactions would adversely     affect our investment banking business.                    Certain of our trading businesses depend on market volatility to     provide trading and arbitrage opportunities, and decreases in     volatility may reduce these opportunities and adversely affect     the results of these businesses. On the other hand, increased     volatility, while it can increase trading volumes and spreads,     also increases risk as measured by VaR and may expose us to     increased risks in connection with our     market-making     and proprietary businesses or cause us to reduce the size of     these businesses in order to avoid increasing our VaR. Limiting     the size of our     market-making     positions and investing businesses can adversely affect our     profitability.                    We receive     asset-based     management fees based on the value of our clients     portfolios or investment in funds managed by us and, in some     cases, we also receive incentive fees based on increases in the     value of such investments. Declines in asset values reduce the     value of our clients portfolios or fund assets, which in     turn reduce the fees we earn for managing such assets. Market     uncertainty, volatility and adverse economic conditions, as well     as declines in asset values, may cause our clients to transfer     their assets out of our funds or other products or their     brokerage accounts or affect our ability to attract new clients     or additional assets from existing clients and result in reduced     net revenues, principally in our asset management business. To     the extent that clients do not withdraw their funds, they may     invest them in products that generate less fee income.                    Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant     losses in our     market-making,     proprietary trading, investing, block trading, merchant banking,     underwriting and lending businesses. This risk may increase to     the extent we expand our proprietary trading and investing     businesses or commit capital to facilitate customer-driven     business.                    Concerns about financial institution profitability and solvency     as a result of general market conditions, particularly in the     credit markets, together with the forced merger or failure of a     number of major commercial and investment banks have at times     caused a number of our clients to reduce the level of business     that they do with us, either because of concerns about the     safety of their assets held by us or simply arising from a     desire to diversify their risk or for other reasons. Some     clients have withdrawn some of the funds held at our firm or     transferred them from deposits with GS Bank USA to other types     of assets (in many cases leaving those assets in their brokerage     accounts held with us). Some counterparties have at times     refused to enter into certain derivatives and other     long-term     transactions with us or have requested additional collateral.     These instances were more prevalent during periods when the lack     of confidence in financial institutions was most widespread and     have become significantly less frequent in recent months.          62    Table of Contents     Liquidity Risk.  Liquidity is essential to our     businesses. Our liquidity may be impaired by an inability to     access secured     and/or     unsecured debt markets, an inability to access funds from our     subsidiaries, an inability to sell assets or redeem our     investments, or unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral. This     situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable     to control, such as a general market disruption or an     operational problem that affects third parties or us, or even by     the perception among market participants that we, or other     market participants, are experiencing greater liquidity risk.     The ongoing liquidity crisis and the loss of confidence in     financial institutions has increased our cost of funding and     limited our access to some of our traditional sources of     liquidity, including both secured and unsecured borrowings. In     particular, in the latter half of 2008, we were unable to raise     significant amounts of     long-term     unsecured debt in the public markets, other than as a result of     the issuance of securities guaranteed by the Federal Deposit     Insurance Corporation (FDIC) under the FDICs Temporary     Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP). It is unclear when we will     regain access to the public long-term unsecured debt markets on     customary terms or whether any similar program will be available     after the TLGPs scheduled June 2009 expiration.         The financial instruments that we hold and the contracts to     which we are a party are increasingly complex, as we employ     structured products to benefit our clients and ourselves, and     these complex structured products often do not have readily     available markets to access in times of liquidity stress. Our     investing activities may lead to situations where the holdings     from these activities represent a significant portion of     specific markets, which could restrict liquidity for our     positions. Further, our ability to sell assets may be impaired     if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets     at the same time, as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other     market crisis. In addition, financial institutions with which we     interact may exercise set-off rights or the right to require     additional collateral, including in difficult market conditions,     which could further impair our access to liquidity.         Our credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction     in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and     competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, limit our     access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under     certain bilateral provisions in some of our trading and     collateralized financing contracts. Under these provisions,     counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with     Goldman Sachs or require us to post additional collateral.     Termination of our trading and collateralized financing     contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our     liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or     to make significant cash payments or securities movements. For a     discussion of downgrades to our ratings that occurred in     December 2008 and of the potential impact on Goldman Sachs     of a further reduction in our credit ratings, see      Liquidity     and Funding Risk  Credit Ratings below.         Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of Goldman,     Sachs & Co. (GS&Co.), Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS     Bank USA) and Goldman Sachs Bank (Europe) PLC (GS Bank Europe),     subject to certain exceptions, and has pledged significant     assets to GS Bank USA to support its obligations to GS Bank USA.     These guarantees may require Group Inc. to provide substantial     funds or assets to its subsidiaries or their creditors or     counterparties at a time when Group Inc. is in need of liquidity     to fund its own obligations.        63    Table of Contents   Credit Risk.  The amount and duration of     our credit exposures have been increasing over the past several     years, as have the breadth and size of the entities to which we     have credit exposures. We are exposed to the risk that third     parties that owe us money, securities or other assets will not     perform their obligations. These parties may default on their     obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity,     operational failure or other reasons. A failure of a significant     market participant, or even concerns about a default by such an     institution, could lead to significant liquidity problems,     losses or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could     adversely affect us. We are also subject to the risk that our     rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all     circumstances. In addition, deterioration in the credit quality     of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold could     result in losses     and/or     adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use     those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes. A     significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our     counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results.     While in many cases we are permitted to require additional     collateral for counterparties that experience financial     difficulty, disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we     are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets. Default     rates, downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to the     valuation of collateral increase significantly in times of     market stress and illiquidity.         As part of our clearing business, we finance our client     positions, and we could be held responsible for the defaults or     misconduct of our clients. Although we regularly review credit     exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific     industries, countries and regions that we believe may present     credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or     circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee,     particularly as new business initiatives lead us to transact     with a broader array of clients and counterparties and expose us     to new asset classes and new markets.         We have experienced, due to competitive factors, pressure to     extend and price credit at levels that may not always fully     compensate us for the risks we take. In particular, corporate     clients sometimes seek to require credit commitments from us in     connection with investment banking and other assignments.     Operational Risk.  Our businesses are highly     dependent on our ability to process and monitor, on a daily     basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are     highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets in many     currencies. These transactions, as well as the information     technology services we provide to clients, often must adhere to     client-specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory     standards. Despite the resiliency plans and facilities we have     in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely     impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our     businesses and the communities in which we are located. This may     include a disruption involving electrical, communications,     internet, transportation or other services used by us or third     parties with which we conduct business.         Industry consolidation, whether among market participants or     financial intermediaries, increases the risk of operational     failure as disparate complex systems need to be integrated,     often on an accelerated basis. Furthermore, the     interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with     central agents, exchanges and clearing houses increases the risk     that an operational failure at one institution may cause an     industry-wide     operational failure that could materially impact our ability to     conduct business.        64    Table of Contents   Legal and Regulatory Risk.  We are subject to     extensive and evolving regulation in jurisdictions around the     world. Several of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory     capital requirements and, as a bank holding company, we are     subject to minimum capital standards and a minimum Tier 1     leverage ratio on a consolidated basis. Firms in the financial     services industry have been operating in a difficult regulatory     environment. Recent market disruptions have led to numerous     proposals for significant additional regulation of the financial     services industry. These regulations could limit our business     activities, increase compliance costs and, to the extent the     regulations strictly control the activities of financial     services firms, make it more difficult for us to distinguish     ourselves from competitors. Substantial legal liability or a     significant regulatory action against us could have material     adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm     to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business     prospects. As a bank holding company, we will be subject to     capital requirements based on Basel I as opposed to the     requirements based on Basel II that applied to us as a CSE.     Complying with these requirements may require us to liquidate     assets or raise capital in a manner that adversely increases our     funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our shareholders     and creditors. In addition, failure to meet minimum capital     requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly     additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if     undertaken, could have a direct material adverse effect on our     financial condition. Our status as a bank holding company and     the operation of our lending and other businesses through GS     Bank USA subject us to additional regulation and limitations on     our activities, as described in Regulation      Banking Regulation in Part I, Item 1 of our     Annual Report on     Form 10-K,     as well as some regulatory uncertainty as we apply banking     regulations and practices to many of our businesses. The     application of these regulations and practices may present us     and our regulators with new or novel issues. We face significant     legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and     amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and     regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain     high. Our experience has been that legal claims by customers and     clients increase in a market downturn. In addition,     employment-related claims typically increase in periods when we     have reduced the total number of employees. For a discussion of     how we account for our legal and regulatory exposures, see      Use     of Estimates below.        65    Table of Contents      Critical     Accounting Policies       Fair     Value          The use of fair value to measure financial instruments, with     related unrealized gains or losses generally recognized in     Trading and principal investments in our     consolidated statements of earnings, is fundamental to our     financial statements and our risk management processes and is     our most critical accounting policy. The fair value of a     financial instrument is the amount that would be received to     sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly     transaction between market participants at the measurement date     (the exit price). Financial assets are marked to bid prices and     financial liabilities are marked to offer prices.         During the fourth quarter of 2008, both the Financial Accounting     Standards Board (FASB) and the staff of the SEC re-emphasized     the importance of sound fair value measurement in financial     reporting. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff     Position No. FAS 157-3,     Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the     Market for That Asset is Not Active. This statement     clarifies that determining fair value in an inactive or     dislocated market depends on facts and circumstances and     requires significant management judgment. This statement     specifies that it is acceptable to use inputs based on     management estimates or assumptions, or for management to make     adjustments to observable inputs to determine fair value when     markets are not active and relevant observable inputs are not     available. Our fair value measurement policies are consistent     with the guidance in     FSP No. FAS 157-3.         Substantially all trading assets and trading liabilities are     reflected in our consolidated statements of financial condition     at fair value, pursuant principally to:                         Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115,     Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity     Securities;                    specialized industry accounting for     broker-dealers     and investment companies;                    SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative     Instruments and Hedging Activities; or                    the fair value option under either SFAS No. 155,     Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial     Instruments  an amendment of FASB Statements     No. 133 and 140, or SFAS No. 159, The     Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial     Liabilities (i.e., the fair value option).           Upon becoming a bank holding company in September 2008, we     could no longer apply specialized     broker-dealer     industry accounting to those subsidiaries not regulated as     broker-dealers.     Therefore, within our     non-broker-dealer     subsidiaries, we designated as held for trading those     instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 115     (i.e., debt securities and marketable equity securities),     and elected the fair value option for other cash instruments     (specifically loans, loan commitments and certain private equity     and restricted public equity securities) which we historically     had carried at fair value. These fair value elections were in     addition to previous elections made for certain corporate loans,     loan commitments and certificates of deposit issued by GS Bank     USA. There was no impact on earnings from these initial     elections because all of these instruments were already recorded     at fair value in Trading assets, at fair value or     Trading liabilities, at fair value in the     consolidated statements of financial condition prior to Group     Inc. becoming a bank holding company.        66    Table of Contents       In determining fair value, we separate our Trading assets,     at fair value and Trading liabilities, at fair     value into two categories: cash instruments and derivative     contracts, as set forth in the following table:     Trading     Instruments by Category (in     millions)                                                                            As of November             2008       2007             Trading        Trading        Trading        Trading              Assets, at        Liabilities, at        Assets, at        Liabilities, at               Fair Value         Fair Value         Fair Value         Fair Value           Cash trading instruments            $       186,231               $       57,143               $       324,181               $       112,018              ICBC                5,496        (1)                                  6,807        (1)                             SMFG                1,135                   1,134        (4)               4,060                   3,627        (4)          Other principal investments                15,126        (2)                                  11,933        (2)                                                                                                   Principal investments                21,757                   1,134                   22,800                   3,627                                                                                    Cash instruments                207,988                   58,277                   346,981                   115,645          Exchange-traded                6,164                   8,347                   13,541                   12,280          Over-the-counter                124,173                   109,348                   92,073                   87,098                                                                                    Derivative contracts                130,337        (3)               117,695        (5)               105,614        (3)               99,378        (5)                                                                                Total            $       338,325               $       175,972               $       452,595               $       215,023                                                                                              (1)   Includes interests of     $3.48 billion and $4.30 billion as of     November 2008 and November 2007, respectively, held by     investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs.

Cash instruments include     cash trading instruments, public principal investments and     private principal investments.                     Cash Trading Instruments.  Our cash trading     instruments are generally valued using quoted market prices,     broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with     reasonable levels of price transparency. The types of     instruments valued based on quoted market prices in active     markets include most U.S. government and sovereign     obligations, active listed equities and certain money market     securities.           The types of instruments that trade in markets that are not     considered to be active, but are valued based on quoted market     prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing     sources with reasonable levels of price transparency include     most government agency securities,     investment-grade     corporate bonds, certain mortgage products, certain bank loans     and bridge loans, less liquid listed equities, state, municipal     and provincial obligations and certain money market securities     and loan commitments.         Certain cash trading instruments trade infrequently and     therefore have little or no price transparency. Such instruments     include private equity and real estate fund investments, certain     bank loans and bridge loans (including certain mezzanine     financing, leveraged loans arising from capital market     transactions and other corporate bank debt), less liquid     corporate debt securities and other debt obligations (including     less liquid     high-yield     corporate bonds, distressed debt instruments and collateralized     debt obligations (CDOs) backed by corporate obligations), less     liquid mortgage whole loans and securities (backed by either     commercial or residential real estate), and acquired portfolios     of distressed loans. The transaction price is initially used as     the best estimate of fair value. Accordingly, when a pricing     model is used to value such an instrument, the model is adjusted     so that the model value at inception equals the transaction     price. This valuation is adjusted only when changes to inputs     and assumptions are corroborated by evidence such as     transactions in similar instruments, completed or pending     third-party transactions in the underlying investment or     comparable entities, subsequent rounds of financing,     recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital     structure, offerings in the equity or debt capital markets, and     changes in financial ratios or cash flows.         For positions that are not traded in active markets or are     subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to     reflect illiquidity     and/or non-transferability.     Such adjustments are generally based on available market     evidence. In the absence of such evidence, managements     best estimate is used.                     Public Principal Investments.  Our public     principal investments held within the Principal Investments     component of our Trading and Principal Investments segment tend     to be large, concentrated holdings resulting from initial public     offerings or other corporate transactions, and are valued based     on quoted market prices. For positions that are not traded in     active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions,     valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity     and/or non-transferability.     Such adjustments are generally based on available market     evidence. In the absence of such evidence, managements     best estimate is used.           Our most significant public principal investment is our     investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC. Our investment in     ICBC is valued using the quoted market price adjusted for     transfer restrictions. The ordinary shares acquired from ICBC     are subject to transfer restrictions that, among other things,     prohibit any sale, disposition or other transfer until     April 28, 2009. From April 28, 2009 to     October 20, 2009, we may transfer up to 50% of the     aggregate ordinary shares of ICBC that we owned as of     October 20, 2006. We may transfer the remaining shares     after October 20, 2009. A portion of our interest is     held by investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs.        68    Table of Contents       We also have an investment in the convertible preferred stock of     SMFG. This investment is valued using a model that is     principally based on SMFGs common stock price. During our     second quarter of 2008, we converted     one-third of     our SMFG preferred stock investment into SMFG common stock, and     delivered the common stock to close out     one-third of     our hedge position. As of November 2008, we remained hedged     on the common stock underlying our remaining investment in SMFG.                     Private Principal Investments.  Our private     principal investments held within the Principal Investments     component of our Trading and Principal Investments segment     include investments in private equity, debt and real estate,     primarily held through investment funds. By their nature, these     investments have little or no price transparency. We value such     instruments initially at transaction price and adjust valuations     when evidence is available to support such adjustments. Such     evidence includes transactions in similar instruments, completed     or pending third-party transactions in the underlying investment     or comparable entities, subsequent rounds of financing,     recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital     structure, offerings in the equity or debt capital markets, and     changes in financial ratios or cash flows.       Derivative Contracts.  Derivative contracts can     be     exchange-traded     or     over-the-counter     (OTC). We generally value     exchange-traded     derivatives using models which calibrate to     market-clearing     levels and eliminate timing differences between the closing     price of the     exchange-traded     derivatives and their underlying instruments.         OTC derivatives are valued using market transactions and other     market evidence whenever possible, including     market-based     inputs to models, model calibration to     market-clearing     transactions, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative     pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.     Where models are used, the selection of a particular model to     value an OTC derivative depends upon the contractual terms of,     and specific risks inherent in, the instrument as well as the     availability of pricing information in the market. We generally     use similar models to value similar instruments. Valuation     models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms,     market prices, yield curves, credit curves, measures of     volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs.     For OTC derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as     generic forwards, swaps and options, model inputs can generally     be verified and model selection does not involve significant     management judgment.         Certain OTC derivatives trade in less liquid markets with     limited pricing information, and the determination of fair value     for these derivatives is inherently more difficult. Where we do     not have corroborating market evidence to support significant     model inputs and cannot verify the model to market transactions,     the transaction price is initially used as the best estimate of     fair value. Accordingly, when a pricing model is used to value     such an instrument, the model is adjusted so that the model     value at inception equals the transaction price. Subsequent to     initial recognition, we only update valuation inputs when     corroborated by evidence such as similar market transactions,     third-party     pricing services     and/or     broker or dealer quotations, or other empirical market data. In     circumstances where we cannot verify the model value to market     transactions, it is possible that a different valuation model     could produce a materially different estimate of fair value. See      Derivatives below for further     information on our OTC derivatives.         When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors     such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads and credit considerations.     Such adjustments are generally based on available market     evidence. In the absence of such evidence, managements     best estimate is used.     Controls Over Valuation of Financial     Instruments.  A control infrastructure,     independent of the trading and investing functions, is     fundamental to ensuring that our financial instruments are     appropriately valued at     market-clearing     levels (exit price) and that fair value measurements are     reliable and consistently determined.        69    Table of Contents       We employ an oversight structure that includes appropriate     segregation of duties. Senior management, independent of the     trading and investing functions, is responsible for the     oversight of control and valuation policies and for reporting     the results of these policies to our Audit Committee. We seek to     maintain the necessary resources to ensure that control     functions are performed appropriately. We employ procedures for     the approval of new transaction types and markets, price     verification, review of daily profit and loss, and review of     valuation models by personnel with appropriate technical     knowledge of relevant products and markets. These procedures are     performed by personnel independent of the trading and investing     functions. For financial instruments where prices or valuations     that require inputs are less observable, we employ, where     possible, procedures that include comparisons with similar     observable positions, analysis of actual to projected cash     flows, comparisons with subsequent sales, reviews of valuations     used for collateral management purposes and discussions with     senior business leaders. See      Market     Risk and      Credit     Risk below for a further discussion of how we manage the     risks inherent in our trading and principal investing businesses.     Fair Value Hierarchy      Level 3.  SFAS No. 157 establishes     a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation     techniques used to measure fair value. The objective of a fair     value measurement is to determine the price that would be     received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an     orderly transaction between market participants at the     measurement date (the exit price). The hierarchy gives the     highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets     for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements)     and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3     measurements). Assets and liabilities are classified in their     entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant     to the fair value measurement.         Instruments that trade infrequently and therefore have little or     no price transparency are classified within level 3 of the     fair value hierarchy. We determine which instruments are     classified within level 3 based on the results of our price     verification process. This process is performed by personnel     independent of our trading and investing functions who     corroborate valuations to external market data     (e.g., quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations,     third-party     pricing vendors, recent trading activity and comparative     analyses to similar instruments). When broker or dealer     quotations or third-party pricing vendors are used for valuation     or price verification, greater priority is given to executable     quotes. As part of our price verification process, valuations     based on quotes are corroborated by comparison both to other     quotes and to recent trading activity in the same or similar     instruments. The number of quotes obtained varies by instrument     and depends on the liquidity of the particular instrument. See     Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for further information regarding SFAS No. 157.         Recent market conditions, particularly in the fourth quarter of     2008 (characterized by dislocations between asset classes,     elevated levels of volatility, and reduced price transparency),     have increased the level of management judgment required to     value cash trading instruments classified within level 3 of     the fair value hierarchy. In particular, managements     judgment is required to determine the appropriate     risk-adjusted     discount rate for cash trading instruments with little or no     price transparency as a result of decreased volumes and lower     levels of trading activity. In such situations, our valuation is     adjusted to approximate rates which market participants would     likely consider appropriate for relevant credit and liquidity     risks.     Valuation Methodologies for Level 3     Assets.  Instruments classified within     level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are initially valued at     transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial     estimate of fair value. As time passes, transaction price     becomes less reliable as an estimate of fair value and     accordingly, we use other methodologies to determine fair value,     which vary based on the type of instrument, as described below.     Regardless of the methodology, valuation inputs and assumptions     are only changed when corroborated by substantive evidence.     Senior management in control functions, independent of the     trading and investing functions, reviews all significant     unrealized gains/losses, including the primary drivers of the     change in value. Valuations are further corroborated by values     realized upon        70    Table of Contents       sales of our level 3 assets. An overview of methodologies     used to value our level 3 assets subsequent to the     transaction date is as follows:                     Private equity and real estate fund     investments.  Investments are generally held at     cost for the first year. Recent     third-party     investments or pending transactions are considered to be the     best evidence for any change in fair value. In the absence of     such evidence, valuations are based on third-party independent     appraisals, transactions in similar instruments, discounted cash     flow techniques, valuation multiples and public comparables.     Such evidence includes pending reorganizations     (e.g., merger proposals, tender offers or debt     restructurings); and significant changes in financial metrics     (e.g., operating results as compared to previous     projections, industry multiples, credit ratings and balance     sheet ratios).                Bank loans and bridge loans and Corporate debt securities and     other debt obligations. Valuations are generally based on     discounted cash flow techniques, for which the key inputs are     the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, market     yields for such instruments and recovery assumptions. Inputs are     generally determined based on relative value analyses, which     incorporate comparisons both to credit default swaps that     reference the same underlying credit risk and to other debt     instruments for the same issuer for which observable prices or     broker quotes are available.                Loans and securities backed by commercial real estate.     Loans and securities backed by commercial real estate are     collateralized by specific assets and are generally tranched     into varying levels of subordination. Due to the nature of these     instruments, valuation techniques vary by instrument.     Methodologies include relative value analyses across different     tranches, comparisons to transactions in both the underlying     collateral and instruments with the same or substantially the     same underlying collateral, market indices (such as the CMBX     (1)), and      credit default swaps, as well as discounted cash flow techniques.                Loans and securities backed by residential real estate.     Valuations are based on both proprietary and industry recognized     models (including Intex and Bloomberg), discounted cash flow     techniques and hypothetical securitization analyses. In the     recent market environment, the most significant inputs to the     valuation of these instruments are rates of delinquency, default     and loss expectations, which are driven in part by housing     prices. Inputs are determined based on relative value analyses,     which incorporate comparisons to instruments with similar     collateral and risk profiles, including relevant indices such as     the ABX     (1).                 Loan portfolios.  Valuations are based on     discounted cash flow techniques, for which the key inputs are     the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and market     yields for such instruments. Inputs are determined based on     relative value analyses which incorporate comparisons to recent     auction data for other similar loan portfolios.                Derivative contracts.  Valuation models are     calibrated to initial transaction price. Subsequent changes in     valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation     models (e.g., interest rates, credit spreads, volatilities,     etc.). Inputs are changed only when corroborated by market data.     Valuations of less liquid OTC derivatives are typically based on     level 1 or level 2 inputs that can be observed in the     market, as well as unobservable inputs, such as correlations and     volatilities.           Total level 3 assets were $66.19 billion and     $69.15 billion as of November 2008 and     November 2007, respectively. The decrease in level 3     assets for the year ended November 2008 primarily reflected     (i) unrealized losses on loans and securities backed by     commercial real estate, bank loans and bridge loans, and private     equity and real estate fund investments, and (ii) sales and     paydowns on bank loans and bridge loans and loan portfolios.     These decreases were partially offset by transfers to     level 3 of certain loans and securities backed by     commercial real estate due to reduced price transparency.          (1) The      CMBX and ABX are indices that track the performance of     commercial mortgage bonds and subprime residential mortgage     bonds, respectively.        71    Table of Contents       The following table sets forth the fair values of financial     assets classified as level 3 within the fair value     hierarchy:     Level 3     Financial Assets at Fair Value (in     millions)                                                    As of November      Description        2008       2007          Private equity and real estate fund     investments (1)            $       16,006               $       18,006              Bank loans and bridge     loans (2)                11,957                   13,334              Corporate debt securities and other debt     obligations (3)                7,596                   6,111              Mortgage and other     asset-backed     loans and securities                                           Loans and securities backed by commercial real estate                9,340                   7,410              Loans and securities backed by residential real estate                2,049                   2,484              Loan     portfolios (4)                4,118                   6,106                                                    Cash instruments                51,066                   53,451              Derivative contracts                15,124                   15,700                                                    Total level 3 assets at fair value                66,190                   69,151              Level 3 assets for which we do not bear economic     exposure (5)                (6,616       )               (14,437       )                                                Level 3 assets for which we bear economic exposure            $       59,574               $       54,714                                                                (1)         Includes $1.18 billion and $7.06 billion as of     November 2008 and November 2007, respectively, of     assets for which we do not bear economic exposure.

In addition to Trading assets, at     fair value and Trading liabilities, at fair     value, we have elected to account for certain of our other     financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value under     the fair value option. The primary reasons for electing the fair     value option are to reflect economic events in earnings on a     timely basis, to mitigate volatility in earnings from using     different measurement attributes and to address simplification     and     cost-benefit     considerations.

We test the goodwill in each of our     operating segments, which are components one level below our     three business segments, for impairment at least annually in     accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other     Intangible Assets, by comparing the estimated fair value     of each operating segment with its estimated net book value. We     derive the fair value of each of our operating segments based on     valuation techniques we believe market participants would use     for each segment (observable average price-to-earnings multiples     of our competitors in these businesses and price-to-book     multiples). We derive the net book value of our operating     segments by estimating the amount of shareholders equity     required to support the activities of each operating segment.     Our last annual impairment test was performed during our 2008     fourth quarter and no impairment was identified. Substantially     all of our goodwill is in our Equities component of our Trading     and Principal Investments segment and in our Asset Management     and Securities Services segment. Our Asset Management and     Securities Services segment generated record net revenues in     2008 and our Equities component of our Trading and Principal     Investments segment had its second best year following its     record net revenues in 2007.        74    Table of Contents       During 2008, particularly during the fourth quarter, the     financial services industry and the securities markets generally     were materially and adversely affected by significant declines     in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a serious lack     of liquidity. Our stock price, consistent with stock prices in     the broader financial services sector, declined significantly     during this period of time. During the fourth quarter of 2008,     our market capitalization fell below recorded book value,     principally during the last five weeks of the quarter. With     respect to the testing of our goodwill for impairment, we     believe that it is reasonable to consider market capitalization     as an indicator of fair value over a reasonable period of time.     If the current economic market conditions persist and if there     is a prolonged period of weakness in the business environment     and financial markets, our businesses may be adversely affected,     which could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future.         The following table sets forth the carrying value of our     goodwill by operating segment:     Goodwill by     Operating Segment (in     millions)                                                    As of November             2008       2007          Investment Banking                                           Underwriting            $       125               $       125              Trading and Principal Investments                                           FICC                247                   123              Equities (1)                2,389                   2,381              Principal Investments                80                   11              Asset Management and Securities Services                                           Asset     Management (2)                565                   564              Securities Services                117                   117                                                    Total            $       3,523               $       3,321                                                              (1)   Primarily related to SLK.           (2)   Primarily related to Ayco.              Identifiable Intangible Assets.  We amortize     our identifiable intangible assets over their estimated lives in     accordance with SFAS No. 142 or, in the case of     insurance contracts, in accordance with SFAS No. 60,     Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises,     and SFAS No. 97, Accounting and Reporting by     Insurance Enterprises for Certain     Long-Duration     Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of     Investments. Identifiable intangible assets are tested for     impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest     that an assets or asset groups carrying value may     not be fully recoverable in accordance with     SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or     Disposal of     Long-Lived     Assets, or SFAS No. 60 and     SFAS No. 97. An impairment loss, generally calculated     as the difference between the estimated fair value and the     carrying value of an asset or asset group, is recognized if the     sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the     asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying     value.        75    Table of Contents       The following table sets forth the carrying value and range of     remaining lives of our identifiable intangible assets by major     asset class:     Identifiable     Intangible Assets by Asset Class ($ in     millions)                                                                As of November             2008       2007                     Range of Estimated                      Carrying        Remaining Lives        Carrying               Value         (in years)         Value           Customer     lists (1)            $       724                   2 - 17               $       732              New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Designated Market Maker     (DMM) rights                462                   13                   502              Insurance-related     assets (2)                303                   7                   372          Exchange-traded     fund (ETF) lead market maker rights                95                   19                   100              Other (3)                93                   1 - 17                   65                                                                    Total            $       1,677                               $       1,771                                                                              (1)   Primarily includes our clearance     and execution and NASDAQ customer lists related to SLK and     financial counseling customer lists related to Ayco.           (2)   Consists of the value of business     acquired (VOBA) and deferred acquisition costs (DAC). VOBA     represents the present value of estimated future gross profits     of acquired variable annuity and life insurance businesses. DAC     results from commissions paid by Goldman Sachs to the primary     insurer (ceding company) on life and annuity reinsurance     agreements as compensation to place the business with us and to     cover the ceding companys acquisition expenses. VOBA and     DAC are amortized over the estimated life of the underlying     contracts based on estimated gross profits, and amortization is     adjusted based on actual experience. The     seven-year     estimated life represents the weighted average remaining     amortization period of the underlying contracts (certain of     which extend for approximately 30 years).           (3)   Primarily includes     marketing-related assets and power contracts.                  A prolonged period of weakness in global equity markets and the     trading of securities in multiple markets and on multiple     exchanges could adversely impact our businesses and impair the     value of our identifiable intangible assets. In addition,     certain events could indicate a potential impairment of our     identifiable intangible assets, including (i) changes in     market structure that could adversely affect our specialist     businesses (see discussion below), (ii) an adverse action     or assessment by a regulator, or (iii) adverse actual     experience on the contracts in our variable annuity and life     insurance business.         In October 2008, the SEC approved the NYSEs proposal     to create a new market model and redefine the role of NYSE DMMs.     This new rule set further aligns the NYSEs model with     investor requirements for speed and efficiency of execution and     establishes specialists as DMMs. While DMMs still have an     obligation to commit capital, they are now able to trade on     parity with other market participants. In addition, in     November 2008 the NYSE introduced a reserve order type that     allows for anonymous trade execution, which is expected to allow     the NYSE to recapture liquidity and market share from other     venues in which anonymous reserve orders have been available for     some time. The new rule set and the launch of the reserve order     type, in combination with technology improvements to increase     execution speed, are expected to bolster the NYSEs     competitive position.        76    Table of Contents       In 2007, we tested our NYSE DMM rights for impairment in     accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the     Impairment or Disposal of     Long-Lived     Assets. Under SFAS No. 144, an impairment loss     is recognized if the carrying amount of our NYSE DMM rights     exceeds the projected undiscounted cash flows of the business     over the estimated remaining life of our NYSE DMM rights.     Projected undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying amount     of our NYSE DMM rights, and accordingly we did not record an     impairment loss. In projecting the undiscounted cash flows of     the business, we made several important assumptions about the     potential beneficial effects of the rule and market structure     changes described above. Specifically, we assumed that:                         total equity trading volumes in NYSE-listed companies will     continue to grow at a rate consistent with recent historical     trends;                    the NYSE will be able to recapture approximately     one-half of     the market share that it lost in 2007; and                    we will increase our market share of the NYSE DMM business and,     as a DMM, the profitability of each share traded.           We also assumed that the rule changes would be implemented in     our fiscal fourth quarter of 2008 (as noted above, such rule     changes were approved in October 2008) and that     projected cash flow increases related to the implementation of     the rule set would begin in 2009, consistent with the     assumptions above. Subsequently, there have been no events or     changes in circumstances indicating that NYSE DMM rights     intangible asset may not be recoverable. However, there can be     no assurance that the assumptions, rule or structure changes     described above will result in sufficient cash flows to avoid     impairment of our NYSE DMM rights in the future. We will     continue to evaluate the performance of the specialist business     under the new market model. As of November 2008, the     carrying value of our NYSE DMM rights was $462 million. To     the extent that there were to be an impairment in the future, it     could result in a significant writedown in the carrying value of     these DMM rights.      Use of     Estimates          The use of generally accepted accounting principles requires     management to make certain estimates and assumptions. In     addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value     measurements and the accounting for goodwill and identifiable     intangible assets, the use of estimates and assumptions is also     important in determining provisions for potential losses that     may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax     audits.         We estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out     of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such     losses are probable and can be estimated, in accordance with     SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies.     We estimate and provide for potential liabilities that may arise     out of tax audits to the extent that uncertain tax positions     fail to meet the recognition standard of FIN 48,     Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an     Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. See     Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for further information on FIN 48.         Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and     our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different.     Our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and     regulatory proceedings is determined on a     case-by-case     basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after     considering, among other factors, the progress of each case or     proceeding, our experience and the experience of others in     similar cases or proceedings, and the opinions and views of     legal counsel. Given the inherent difficulty of predicting the     outcome of our litigation and regulatory matters, particularly     in cases or proceedings in which substantial or indeterminate     damages or fines are sought, we cannot estimate losses or ranges     of losses for cases or proceedings where there is only a     reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.

The composition of net revenues can also vary over the shorter     term due to fluctuations in U.S. and global economic and     market conditions.

(2)   Tangible common shareholders     equity equals total shareholders equity less preferred     stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, excluding     power contracts. Identifiable intangible assets associated with     power contracts are not deducted from total shareholders     equity because, unlike other intangible assets, less than 50% of     these assets are supported by common shareholders equity.               We believe that return on average tangible common     shareholders equity (ROTE) is meaningful because it     measures the performance of businesses consistently, whether     they were acquired or developed internally. ROTE is computed by     dividing net earnings applicable to common shareholders by     average monthly tangible common shareholders equity.         The following table sets forth the reconciliation of average     total shareholders equity to average tangible common     shareholders equity:                                                           Average for the              Year Ended November             2008       2007       2006                 (in millions)               Total shareholders equity            $       47,167               $       37,959               $       31,048              Preferred stock                (5,157       )               (3,100       )               (2,400       )                                                                Common shareholders equity                42,010                   34,859                   28,648              Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, excluding power     contracts                (5,220       )               (4,971       )               (5,013       )                                                                Tangible common shareholders equity            $       36,790               $       29,888               $       23,635                                                                       78    Table of Contents   Net     Revenues     2008 versus 2007.  Our net revenues were     $22.22 billion in 2008, a decrease of 52% compared with     2007, reflecting a particularly difficult operating environment,     including significant asset price declines, high levels of     volatility and reduced levels of liquidity, particularly in the     fourth quarter. In addition, credit markets experienced     significant dislocation between prices for cash instruments and     the related derivative contracts and between credit indices and     underlying single names. Net revenues in Trading and Principal     Investments were significantly lower compared with 2007,     reflecting significant declines in FICC, Principal Investments     and Equities. The decrease in FICC primarily reflected losses in     credit products, which included a loss of approximately     $3.1 billion (net of hedges) related to     non-investment-grade     credit origination activities and losses from investments,     including corporate debt and private and public equities.     Results in mortgages included net losses of approximately     $1.7 billion on residential mortgage loans and securities     and approximately $1.4 billion on commercial mortgage loans     and securities. Interest rate products, currencies and     commodities each produced particularly strong results and net     revenues were higher compared with 2007. During 2008, although     client-driven activity was generally solid, FICC operated in a     challenging environment characterized by     broad-based     declines in asset values, wider mortgage and corporate credit     spreads, reduced levels of liquidity and     broad-based     investor deleveraging, particularly in the second half of the     year. The decline in Principal Investments primarily reflected     net losses of $2.53 billion from corporate principal     investments and $949 million from real estate principal     investments, as well as a $446 million loss from our     investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC. In Equities, the     decrease compared with particularly strong net revenues in 2007     reflected losses in principal strategies, partially offset by     higher net revenues in our client franchise businesses.     Commissions were particularly strong and were higher than 2007.     During 2008, Equities operated in an environment characterized     by a significant decline in global equity prices,     broad-based     investor deleveraging and very high levels of volatility,     particularly in the second half of the year.         Net revenues in Investment Banking also declined significantly     compared with 2007, reflecting significantly lower net revenues     in both Financial Advisory and Underwriting. In Financial     Advisory, the decrease compared with particularly strong net     revenues in 2007 reflected a decline in     industry-wide     completed mergers and acquisitions. The decrease in Underwriting     primarily reflected significantly lower net revenues in debt     underwriting, primarily due to a decline in leveraged finance     and     mortgage-related     activity, reflecting difficult market conditions. Net revenues     in equity underwriting were slightly lower compared with 2007,     reflecting a decrease in     industry-wide     equity and     equity-related     offerings.         Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services     increased compared with 2007. Securities Services net revenues     were higher, reflecting the impact of changes in the composition     of securities lending customer balances, as well as higher total     average customer balances. Asset Management net revenues     increased slightly compared with 2007. During the year, assets     under management decreased $89 billion to     $779 billion, due to $123 billion of market     depreciation, primarily in equity assets, partially offset by     $34 billion of net inflows.        79    Table of Contents   2007 versus 2006.  Our net revenues were     $45.99 billion in 2007, an increase of 22% compared with     2006, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in Trading     and Principal Investments and Investment Banking, and higher net     revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services. The     increase in Trading and Principal Investments reflected higher     net revenues in Equities, FICC and Principal Investments. Net     revenues in Equities increased 33% compared with 2006,     reflecting significantly higher net revenues in both our client     franchise businesses and principal strategies. During 2007,     Equities operated in an environment characterized by strong     client-driven activity, generally higher equity prices and     higher levels of volatility, particularly during the second half     of the year. The increase in FICC reflected significantly higher     net revenues in currencies and interest rate products. In     addition, net revenues in mortgages were higher despite a     significant deterioration in the mortgage market throughout the     year, while net revenues in credit products were strong, but     slightly lower compared with 2006. Credit products included     substantial gains from equity investments, including a gain of     approximately $900 million related to the disposition of     Horizon Wind Energy L.L.C., as well as a loss of approximately     $1 billion (net of hedges) related to     non-investment-grade     credit origination activities. During 2007, FICC operated in an     environment generally characterized by strong client-driven     activity and favorable market opportunities. However, during the     year, the mortgage market experienced significant deterioration     and, in the second half of the year, the broader credit markets     were characterized by wider spreads and reduced levels of     liquidity. The increase in Principal Investments reflected     strong results in both corporate and real estate investing.         The increase in Investment Banking reflected a 64% increase in     Financial Advisory net revenues and a strong performance in our     Underwriting business. The increase in Financial Advisory     primarily reflected growth in     industry-wide     completed mergers and acquisitions. The increase in Underwriting     reflected higher net revenues in debt underwriting, as leveraged     finance activity was strong during the first half of our fiscal     year, while net revenues in equity underwriting were strong but     essentially unchanged from 2006.         Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services also     increased. The increase in Securities Services primarily     reflected significant growth in global customer balances. The     increase in Asset Management reflected significantly higher     asset management fees, partially offset by significantly lower     incentive fees. During the year, assets under management     increased $192 billion, or 28%, to $868 billion,     including net inflows of $161 billion.        80    Table of Contents   Operating     Expenses         Our operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation,     headcount and levels of business activity. A substantial portion     of our compensation expense represents discretionary bonuses     which are significantly impacted by, among other factors, the     level of net revenues, prevailing labor markets, business mix     and the structure of our     share-based     compensation programs. For 2008, our ratio of compensation and     benefits (excluding severance costs of approximately     $275 million in the fourth quarter of 2008) to net     revenues was 48.0%. Our ratio of compensation and benefits to     net revenues was 43.9% for 2007.

Consolidated entities     held for investment purposes are entities that are held strictly     for capital appreciation, have a defined exit strategy and are     engaged in activities that are not closely related to our     principal businesses.

For example, these investments include     consolidated entities that hold real estate assets, such as     hotels, but exclude investments in entities that primarily hold     financial assets. We believe that it is meaningful to review     non-compensation     expenses excluding expenses related to these consolidated     entities in order to evaluate trends in     non-compensation     expenses related to our principal business activities. Revenues     related to such entities are included in Trading and     principal investments in the consolidated statements of     earnings.           (2)   Beginning in the first quarter of     2008, Cost of power generation was reclassified into     Other expenses in the consolidated statements of     earnings. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the     current presentation.              2008 versus 2007.  Operating expenses were     $19.89 billion for 2008, 30% lower than 2007. Compensation     and benefits expenses (including salaries, bonuses, amortization     of prior year equity awards and other items such as payroll     taxes and benefits) of $10.93 billion decreased 46%     compared with 2007, reflecting lower levels of discretionary     compensation due to lower net revenues. For 2008, our ratio of     compensation and benefits (excluding severance costs of     approximately $275 million in the fourth quarter of     2008) to net revenues was 48.0%. Our ratio of compensation     and benefits to net revenues was 43.9% for 2007. Employment     levels decreased 1% compared with November 2007, reflecting     an 8% decrease during the fourth quarter.     Non-compensation     expenses of $8.95 billion for 2008 increased 9% compared     with 2007. Excluding consolidated entities held for investment     purposes,     non-compensation     expenses increased 5% compared with 2007. The majority of this     increase was attributable to higher brokerage, clearing,     exchange and distribution fees, principally reflecting higher     activity levels in Equities and FICC. The increase in     non-compensation     expenses related to consolidated entities held for investment     purposes primarily reflected the impact of impairment on certain     real estate assets during 2008.     2007 versus 2006.  Operating expenses were     $28.38 billion for 2007, 23% higher than 2006. Compensation     and benefits expenses of $20.19 billion increased 23%     compared with 2006, reflecting increased discretionary     compensation and growth in employment levels. The ratio of     compensation and benefits to net revenues for 2007 was 43.9%     compared with 43.7% for 2006. Employment levels increased 15%     compared with November 2006.        82    Table of Contents   Non-compensation     expenses of $8.19 billion for 2007 increased 23% compared     with 2006, primarily attributable to higher levels of business     activity and continued geographic expansion.     One-half of     this increase was attributable to brokerage, clearing, exchange     and distribution fees, principally reflecting higher transaction     volumes in Equities. Professional fees, other expenses and     communications and technology expenses also increased, primarily     due to higher levels of business activity. Occupancy and     depreciation and amortization expenses in 2007 included exit     costs of $128 million related to our office space.     Provision for     Taxes         The effective income tax rate was approximately 1% for 2008,     down from 34.1% for 2007. The decrease in the effective income     tax rate was primarily due to an increase in permanent benefits     as a percentage of lower earnings and changes in geographic     earnings mix. The effective income tax rate was 34.1% for 2007,     down from 34.5% for 2006, primarily due to changes in the     geographic mix of earnings.         Our effective income tax rate can vary from period to period     depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business     mix of our earnings, the level of our     pre-tax     earnings, the level of our tax credits and the effect of tax     audits. Certain of these and other factors, including our     history of     pre-tax     earnings, are taken into account in assessing our ability to     realize our net deferred tax assets. See Note 16 to the     consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8     of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for further information regarding our provision for taxes.        83    Table of Contents      Segment Operating     Results          The following table sets forth the net revenues, operating     expenses and     pre-tax     earnings of our segments:     Segment Operating     Results (in     millions)                                                                              Year Ended November                     2008       2007       2006           Investment            Net revenues           $       5,185               $       7,555               $       5,629          Banking            Operating expenses               3,143                   4,985                   4,062                                                                                   Pre-tax earnings           $       2,042               $       2,570               $       1,567                                                                        Trading and Principal            Net revenues           $       9,063               $       31,226               $       25,562          Investments            Operating expenses               11,808                   17,998                   14,962                                                                               Pre-tax     earnings/(loss)           $       (2,745       )           $       13,228               $       10,600                                                                        Asset Management and            Net revenues           $       7,974               $       7,206               $       6,474          Securities Services            Operating expenses               4,939                   5,363                   4,036                                                                                   Pre-tax earnings           $       3,035               $       1,843               $       2,438                                                                        Total            Net revenues           $       22,222               $       45,987               $       37,665                     Operating     expenses (1)               19,886                   28,383                   23,105                                                                               Pre-tax     earnings           $       2,336               $       17,604               $       14,560                                                                                      (1)   Operating expenses include net     provisions for a number of litigation and regulatory proceedings     of $(4) million, $37 million and $45 million for the     years ended November 2008, November 2007 and     November 2006, respectively, that have not been allocated     to our segments.                  Net revenues in our segments include allocations of interest     income and interest expense to specific securities, commodities     and other positions in relation to the cash generated by, or     funding requirements of, such underlying positions. See     Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for further information regarding our business segments.         The cost drivers of Goldman Sachs taken as a whole      compensation, headcount and levels of business     activity  are broadly similar in each of our business     segments. Compensation and benefits expenses within our segments     reflect, among other factors, the overall performance of Goldman     Sachs as well as the performance of individual business units.     Consequently,     pre-tax     margins in one segment of our business may be significantly     affected by the performance of our other business segments. A     discussion of segment operating results follows.        84    Table of Contents   Investment     Banking         Our Investment Banking segment is divided into two components:                     Financial Advisory.  Financial Advisory     includes advisory assignments with respect to mergers and     acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense activities,     restructurings and     spin-offs.                Underwriting.  Underwriting includes public     offerings and private placements of a wide range of securities     and other financial instruments.

Net revenues in Investment Banking of     $5.19 billion for 2008 decreased 31% compared with 2007.         Net revenues in Financial Advisory of $2.66 billion     decreased 37% compared with particularly strong net revenues in     2007, primarily reflecting a decline in     industry-wide     completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in our     Underwriting business of $2.53 billion decreased 24%     compared with 2007, principally due to significantly lower net     revenues in debt underwriting. The decrease in debt underwriting     was primarily due to a decline in leveraged finance and     mortgage-related     activity, reflecting difficult market conditions. Net revenues     in equity underwriting were slightly lower compared with 2007,     reflecting a decrease in     industry-wide     equity and     equity-related     offerings. Our investment banking transaction backlog ended the     year significantly lower than at the end of 2007.     (1)         Operating expenses of $3.14 billion for 2008 decreased 37%     compared with 2007, due to decreased compensation and benefits     expenses, resulting from lower levels of discretionary     compensation.     Pre-tax     earnings of $2.04 billion in 2008 decreased 21% compared     with 2007.     2007 versus 2006.  Net revenues in Investment     Banking of $7.56 billion for 2007 increased 34% compared     with 2006.         Net revenues in Financial Advisory of $4.22 billion     increased 64% compared with 2006, primarily reflecting growth in     industry-wide     completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in our     Underwriting business of $3.33 billion increased 9%     compared with 2006, due to higher net revenues in debt     underwriting, primarily reflecting strength in leveraged finance     during the first half of 2007. Net revenues in equity     underwriting were also strong, but essentially unchanged from     2006. Our investment banking transaction backlog at the end of     2007 was higher than at the end of 2006.     (1)         Operating expenses of $4.99 billion for 2007 increased 23%     compared with 2006, primarily due to increased compensation and     benefits expenses, resulting from higher discretionary     compensation and growth in employment levels.     Pre-tax     earnings of $2.57 billion in 2007 increased 64% compared     with 2006.     Trading and     Principal Investments         Our Trading and Principal Investments segment is divided into     three components:                     FICC.  We make markets in and trade interest     rate and credit products,     mortgage-related     securities and loan products and other     asset-backed     instruments, currencies and commodities, structure and enter     into a wide variety of derivative transactions, and engage in     proprietary trading and investing.                Equities.  We make markets in and trade     equities and     equity-related     products, structure and enter into equity derivative     transactions and engage in proprietary trading. We generate     commissions from executing and clearing client transactions on     major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide through our     Equities client franchise and clearing activities. We also     engage in specialist and insurance activities.                Principal Investments.  We make real estate and     corporate principal investments, including our investment in the     ordinary shares of ICBC. We generate net revenues from returns     on these investments and from the increased share of the income     and gains derived from our merchant banking funds when the     return on a funds investments over the life of the fund     exceeds certain threshold returns (typically referred to as an     override).        (1) Our      investment banking transaction backlog represents an estimate of     our future net revenues from investment banking transactions     where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely     than not.                  86    Table of Contents       Substantially all of our inventory is     marked-to-market     daily and, therefore, its value and our net revenues are subject     to fluctuations based on market movements. In addition, net     revenues derived from our principal investments, including those     in privately held concerns and in real estate, may fluctuate     significantly depending on the revaluation of these investments     in any given period. We also regularly enter into large     transactions as part of our trading businesses. The number and     size of such transactions may affect our results of operations     in a given period.         Net revenues from Principal Investments do not include     management fees generated from our merchant banking funds. These     management fees are included in the net revenues of the Asset     Management and Securities Services segment.

Net revenues in Trading and     Principal Investments of $9.06 billion for 2008 decreased     71% compared with 2007.         Net revenues in FICC of $3.71 billion for 2008 decreased     77% compared with 2007, primarily reflecting losses in credit     products, which included a loss of approximately     $3.1 billion (net of hedges) related to     non-investment-grade     credit origination activities and losses from investments,     including corporate debt and private and public equities.     Results in mortgages included net losses of approximately     $1.7 billion on residential mortgage loans and securities     and approximately $1.4 billion on commercial mortgage loans     and securities. Interest rate products, currencies and     commodities each produced particularly strong results and net     revenues were higher compared with 2007. During 2008, although     client-driven activity was generally solid, FICC operated in a     challenging environment characterized by     broad-based     declines in asset values, wider mortgage and corporate credit     spreads, reduced levels of liquidity and     broad-based     investor deleveraging, particularly in the second half of the     year.        87    Table of Contents       Net revenues in Equities of $9.21 billion for 2008     decreased 19% compared with a particularly strong 2007,     reflecting losses in principal strategies, partially offset by     higher net revenues in the client franchise businesses.     Commissions were particularly strong and were higher than 2007.     During 2008, Equities operated in an environment characterized     by a significant decline in global equity prices,     broad-based     investor deleveraging and very high levels of volatility,     particularly in the second half of the year.         Principal Investments recorded a net loss of $3.86 billion     for 2008. These results included net losses of     $2.53 billion from corporate principal investments and     $949 million from real estate principal investments, as     well as a $446 million loss related to our investment in     the ordinary shares of ICBC.         Operating expenses of $11.81 billion for 2008 decreased 34%     compared with 2007, due to decreased compensation and benefits     expenses, resulting from lower levels of discretionary     compensation. This decrease was partially offset by higher     non-compensation expenses. Excluding consolidated entities held     for investment purposes, the majority of this increase was     attributable to higher brokerage, clearing, exchange and     distribution fees, principally reflecting higher activity levels     in Equities and FICC. The increase in non-compensation expenses     related to consolidated entities held for investment purposes     primarily reflected the impact of impairment on certain real     estate assets during 2008.     Pre-tax loss     was $2.75 billion in 2008 compared with     pre-tax     earnings of $13.23 billion in 2007.     2007 versus 2006.  Net revenues in Trading and     Principal Investments of $31.23 billion for 2007 increased     22% compared with 2006.         Net revenues in FICC of $16.17 billion for 2007 increased     13% compared with 2006, reflecting significantly higher net     revenues in currencies and interest rate products. In addition,     net revenues in mortgages were higher despite a significant     deterioration in the mortgage market throughout 2007, while net     revenues in credit products were strong, but slightly lower     compared with 2006. Credit products included substantial gains     from equity investments, including a gain of approximately     $900 million related to the disposition of Horizon Wind     Energy L.L.C., as well as a loss of approximately     $1 billion (net of hedges) related to     non-investment-grade     credit origination activities. Net revenues in commodities were     also strong but lower compared with 2006. During 2007, FICC     operated in an environment generally characterized by strong     client-driven activity and favorable market opportunities.     However, during 2007, the mortgage market experienced     significant deterioration and, in the second half of the year,     the broader credit markets were characterized by wider spreads     and reduced levels of liquidity.         Net revenues in Equities of $11.30 billion for 2007     increased 33% compared with 2006, reflecting significantly     higher net revenues in both our client franchise businesses and     principal strategies. The client franchise businesses benefited     from significantly higher commission volumes. During 2007,     Equities operated in an environment characterized by strong     client-driven activity, generally higher equity prices and     higher levels of volatility, particularly during the second half     of the year.         Principal Investments recorded net revenues of     $3.76 billion for 2007, reflecting gains and overrides from     corporate and real estate principal investments. Results in     Principal Investments included a $495 million gain related     to our investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC and a     $129 million loss related to our investment in the     convertible preferred stock of SMFG.         Operating expenses of $18.00 billion for 2007 increased 20%     compared with 2006, primarily due to increased compensation and     benefits expenses, resulting from higher discretionary     compensation and growth in employment levels.     Non-compensation     expenses increased due to the impact of higher levels of     business activity and continued geographic expansion. The     majority of this increase was in brokerage, clearing, exchange     and distribution fees, which primarily reflected higher     transaction volumes in Equities. Professional fees also     increased, reflecting increased business activity.     Pre-tax     earnings of $13.23 billion in 2007 increased 25% compared     with 2006.        88    Table of Contents   Asset     Management and Securities Services         Our Asset Management and Securities Services segment is divided     into two components:                     Asset Management.  Asset Management provides     investment advisory and financial planning services and offers     investment products (primarily through separately managed     accounts and commingled vehicles, such as mutual funds and     private investment funds) across all major asset classes to a     diverse group of institutions and individuals worldwide and     primarily generates revenues in the form of management and     incentive fees.                Securities Services.  Securities Services     provides prime brokerage services, financing services and     securities lending services to institutional clients, including     hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds and foundations, and to     high-net-worth     individuals worldwide, and generates revenues primarily in the     form of interest rate spreads or fees.           Assets under management typically generate fees as a percentage     of asset value, which is affected by investment performance and     by inflows and redemptions. The fees that we charge vary by     asset class, as do our related expenses. In certain     circumstances, we are also entitled to receive incentive fees     based on a percentage of a funds return or when the return     on assets under management exceeds specified benchmark returns     or other performance targets. Incentive fees are recognized when     the performance period ends and they are no longer subject to     adjustment. We have numerous incentive fee arrangements, many of     which have annual performance periods that end on     December 31. For that reason, incentive fees have been     seasonally weighted to our first quarter.         The following table sets forth the operating results of our     Asset Management and Securities Services segment:     Asset Management     and Securities Services Operating Results (in     millions)                                                                Year Ended November             2008       2007       2006          Management and other fees            $       4,321               $       4,303               $       3,332              Incentive fees                231                   187                   962                                                                    Total Asset Management                4,552                   4,490                   4,294              Securities Services                3,422                   2,716                   2,180                                                                    Total net revenues                7,974                   7,206                   6,474              Operating expenses                4,939                   5,363                   4,036                                                                Pre-tax     earnings            $       3,035               $       1,843               $       2,438                                                                           Assets under management include our mutual funds, alternative     investment funds and separately managed accounts for     institutional and individual investors. Substantially all assets     under management are valued as of calendar month-end. Assets     under management do not include:                         assets in brokerage accounts that generate commissions,     mark-ups and     spreads based on transactional activity,                    our own investments in funds that we manage;                    or     non-fee-paying     assets, including interest-bearing deposits held through our     depository institution subsidiaries.          89    Table of Contents         The following table sets forth our assets under management by     asset class:     Assets Under     Management by Asset Class (in     billions)                                                                As of November 30             2008       2007       2006          Alternative     investments (1)            $        146                $       151               $       145              Equity                112                   255                   215              Fixed income                248                   256                   198                                                                    Total     non-money     market assets                506                   662                   558              Money markets                273                   206                   118                                                                    Total assets under management            $       779               $       868               $       676                                                                       (1)       Primarily includes hedge funds, private equity, real estate,     currencies, commodities and asset allocation strategies.

(2)   Net of the transfer of     $8 billion of money market assets under management to     interest-bearing deposits at GS Bank USA.           (3)   Includes $3 billion of net     asset inflows in connection with the acquisition of our variable     annuity and life insurance business.              2008 versus 2007.  Net revenues in Asset     Management and Securities Services of $7.97 billion for     2008 increased 11% compared with 2007.         Asset Management net revenues of $4.55 billion for 2008     increased 1% compared with 2007. During 2008, assets under     management decreased $89 billion to $779 billion, due     to $123 billion of market depreciation, primarily in equity     assets, partially offset by $34 billion of net inflows. Net     inflows reflected inflows in money market, fixed income and     alternative investment assets, partially offset by outflows in     equity assets.        90    Table of Contents       Securities Services net revenues of $3.42 billion for 2008     increased 26% compared with 2007, reflecting the impact of     changes in the composition of securities lending customer     balances, as well as higher total average customer balances.         Operating expenses of $4.94 billion for 2008 decreased 8%     compared with 2007, due to decreased compensation and benefits     expenses, resulting from lower levels of discretionary     compensation.     Pre-tax     earnings of $3.04 billion in 2008 increased 65% compared     with 2007.     2007 versus 2006.  Net revenues in Asset     Management and Securities Services of $7.21 billion for     2007 increased 11% compared with 2006.         Asset Management net revenues of $4.49 billion for 2007     increased 5% compared with 2006, reflecting a 29% increase in     management and other fees, partially offset by significantly     lower incentive fees. Incentive fees were $187 million for     2007 compared with $962 million for 2006. During 2007,     assets under management increased $192 billion, or 28%, to     $868 billion, reflecting     non-money     market net inflows of $73 billion     (1),      primarily in fixed income and equity assets, money market net     inflows of $88 billion, and net market appreciation of     $31 billion, reflecting appreciation in fixed income and     equity assets, partially offset by depreciation in alternative     investment assets.         Securities Services net revenues of $2.72 billion for 2007     increased 25% compared with 2006, as our prime brokerage     business continued to generate strong results, primarily     reflecting significantly higher customer balances in securities     lending and margin lending.         Operating expenses of $5.36 billion for 2007 increased 33%     compared with 2006, primarily due to increased compensation and     benefits expenses, resulting from higher discretionary     compensation and growth in employment levels, and higher     distribution fees (included in brokerage, clearing, exchange and     distribution fees).     Pre-tax     earnings of $1.84 billion in 2007 decreased 24% compared     with 2006.      Geographic     Data          See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for a summary of our total net revenues,     pre-tax     earnings and net earnings by geographic region.      Off-Balance-Sheet     Arrangements          We have various types of     off-balance-sheet     arrangements that we enter into in the ordinary course of     business. Our involvement in these arrangements can take many     different forms, including purchasing or retaining residual and     other interests in     mortgage-backed     and other     asset-backed     securitization vehicles; holding senior and subordinated debt,     interests in limited and general partnerships, and preferred and     common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles; entering into     interest rate, foreign currency, equity, commodity and credit     derivatives, including total return swaps; entering into     operating leases; and providing guarantees, indemnifications,     loan commitments, letters of credit and representations and     warranties.         We enter into these arrangements for a variety of business     purposes, including the securitization of commercial and     residential mortgages, home equity and auto loans, government     and corporate bonds, and other types of financial assets. Other     reasons for entering into these arrangements include     underwriting client securitization transactions; providing     secondary market liquidity; making investments in performing and     nonperforming debt, equity, real estate and other assets;     providing investors with     credit-linked     and     asset-repackaged     notes; and receiving or providing letters of credit to satisfy     margin requirements and to facilitate the clearance and     settlement process.      (1) Includes      $7 billion in net asset inflows in connection with our     acquisition of Macquarie  IMM Investment Management.        91    Table of Contents       We engage in transactions with variable interest entities (VIEs)     and qualifying     special-purpose     entities (QSPEs). Such vehicles are critical to the functioning     of several significant investor markets, including the     mortgage-backed     and other     asset-backed     securities markets, since they offer investors access to     specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization     process. Our financial interests in, and derivative transactions     with, such nonconsolidated entities are accounted for at fair     value, in the same manner as our other financial instruments,     except in cases where we apply the equity method of accounting.         We did not have     off-balance-sheet     commitments to purchase or finance any CDOs held by structured     investment vehicles as of November 2008 or     November 2007.         In December 2007, the American Securitization Forum (ASF)     issued the Streamlined Foreclosure and Loss Avoidance     Framework for Securitized Subprime Adjustable Rate Mortgage     Loans (ASF Framework). The ASF Framework provides guidance     for servicers to streamline borrower evaluation procedures and     to facilitate the use of foreclosure and loss prevention     measures for securitized subprime residential mortgages that     meet certain criteria. For certain eligible loans as defined in     the ASF Framework, servicers may presume default is reasonably     foreseeable and apply a     fast-track     loan modification plan, under which the loan interest rate will     be kept at the introductory rate for a period of five years     following the upcoming reset date. Mortgage loan modifications     of these eligible loans will not affect our accounting treatment     for QSPEs that hold the subprime loans.         The following table sets forth where a discussion of     off-balance-sheet     arrangements may be found in Part II, Items 7 and 8 of     our Annual Report on     Form 10-K:                     Type of Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangement       Disclosure in our Annual Report on Form 10-K                                  Retained interests or contingent interests in assets transferred     by us to nonconsolidated entities           See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II,     Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Guarantees           See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II,     Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.                       Other obligations, including contingent obligations, arising out     of variable interests we have in nonconsolidated entities           See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Part     II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.                       Derivative contracts           See      Critical     Accounting Policies above, and      Risk     Management and      Derivatives     below and Notes 3 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements     in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.                                                      In addition, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial     statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for a discussion of our consolidation policies.        92    Table of Contents      Equity     Capital          The level and composition of our equity capital are principally     determined by our consolidated regulatory capital requirements     but may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines,     subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment,     conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential     future losses due to extreme and adverse changes in our business     and market environments. As of November 2008, our total     shareholders equity was $64.37 billion (consisting of     common shareholders equity of $47.90 billion and     preferred stock of $16.47 billion) compared with total     shareholders equity of $42.80 billion as of     November 2007 (consisting of common shareholders     equity of $39.70 billion and preferred stock of     $3.10 billion). In addition to total shareholders     equity, we consider the $5.00 billion of junior     subordinated debt issued to trusts (see discussion below) to be     part of our equity capital, as it qualifies as capital for     regulatory and certain rating agency purposes.     Consolidated     Capital Requirements         We are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered     by the U.S. federal banking agencies. Our bank depository     institution subsidiaries, including GS Bank USA, are subject to     similar capital guidelines. Under the Federal Reserve     Boards capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory     framework for prompt corrective action (PCA) that is applicable     to GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs and its bank depository     institution subsidiaries must meet specific capital guidelines     that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and     certain     off-balance-sheet     items as calculated under regulatory reporting practices.     Goldman Sachs and its bank depository institution     subsidiaries capital amounts, as well as GS Bank     USAs PCA classification, are also subject to qualitative     judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings     and other factors. We anticipate reporting capital ratios as     follows:                         Before we became a bank holding company, we were subject to     capital guidelines by the SEC as a Consolidated Supervised     Entity (CSE) that were generally consistent with those set out     in the Revised Framework for the International Convergence of     Capital Measurement and Capital Standards issued by the Basel     Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel II). We currently     compute and report our firmwide capital ratios in accordance     with the Basel II requirements as applicable to us when we were     regulated as a CSE for the purpose of assessing the adequacy of     our capital. Under the Basel II framework as it applied to us     when we were regulated as a CSE, we evaluate our Tier 1     Capital and Total Allowable Capital as a percentage of RWAs. As     of November 2008, our Total Capital Ratio (Total Allowable     Capital as a percentage of RWAs) was 18.9% and our Tier 1     Ratio (Tier 1 Capital as a percentage of RWAs) was 15.6%,     in each case calculated under the Basel II framework as it     applied to us when we were regulated as a CSE. See      Consolidated Capital Ratios below for     further information. We expect to continue to report to     investors for a period of time our Basel II capital ratios     as applicable to us when we were regulated as a CSE.                    The regulatory capital guidelines currently applicable to bank     holding companies are based on the Capital Accord of the Basel     Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel I), with Basel II to be     phased in over time. We are currently working with the Federal     Reserve Board to put in place the appropriate reporting and     compliance mechanisms and methodologies to allow reporting of     the Basel I capital ratios as of the end of March 2009.                    In addition, we are currently working to implement the Basel II     framework as applicable to us as a bank holding company (as     opposed to as a CSE). U.S. banking regulators have     incorporated the Basel II framework into the existing     risk-based     capital requirements by requiring that internationally active     banking organizations, such as Group Inc., transition to Basel     II over the next several years.           The Federal Reserve Board also has established minimum leverage     ratio guidelines. We were not subject to these guidelines before     becoming a bank holding company and, accordingly, we are     currently working with the Federal Reserve Board to finalize our     methodology for calculating this ratio.        93    Table of Contents       The Tier 1 leverage ratio is defined as Tier 1 capital     (as applicable to us as a bank holding company) divided by     adjusted average total assets (which includes adjustments for     disallowed goodwill and certain intangible assets). The minimum     Tier 1 leverage ratio is 3% for bank holding companies that     have received the highest supervisory rating under Federal     Reserve Board guidelines or that have implemented the Federal     Reserve Boards     risk-based     capital measure for market risk. Other bank holding companies     must have a minimum leverage ratio of 4%. Bank holding companies     may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum     levels, depending upon their particular condition, risk profile     and growth plans. As of November 2008, our estimated     Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.1%. This ratio represents a     preliminary estimate and may be revised in subsequent filings as     we continue to work with the Federal Reserve Board to finalize     the methodology for the calculation.     Consolidated     Capital Ratios         The following table sets forth additional information on our     capital ratios as of November 2008 calculated in the same     manner (generally consistent with Basel II) as when the     firm was regulated by the SEC as a CSE:                                   As of              November              2008                 ($ in millions)      I.

(2)   Substantially all of our existing     subordinated debt qualified as Total Allowable Capital for CSE     purposes.                  Our RWAs are driven by the amount of market risk, credit risk     and operational risk associated with our business activities in     a manner generally consistent with methodologies set out in     Basel II. The methodologies used to compute RWAs for each of     market risk, credit risk and operational risk are closely     aligned with our risk management practices. See      Market     Risk and  Credit Risk below for a     discussion of how we manage risks in our trading and principal     investing businesses. Further details on the methodologies used     to calculate RWAs are set forth below.        94    Table of Contents   Risk-Weighted     Assets for Market Risk         For positions captured in VaR, RWAs are calculated using VaR and     other     model-based     measures, including requirements for incremental default risk     and other event risks. VaR is the potential loss in value of     trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined     time horizon with a specified confidence level. Market risk RWAs     are calculated consistent with the specific conditions set out     in the Basel II framework (based on VaR calibrated to a 99%     confidence level, over a     10-day     holding period, multiplied by a factor). Additional RWAs are     calculated with respect to incremental default risk and other     event risks, in a manner generally consistent with our internal     risk management methodologies.         For positions not included in VaR because VaR is not the most     appropriate measure of risk, we calculate RWAs based on     alternative methodologies, including sensitivity analyses.     Risk-Weighted     Assets for Credit Risk         RWAs for credit risk are calculated for on- and     off-balance-sheet exposures that are not captured in our market     risk RWAs, with the exception of OTC derivatives for which both     market risk and credit risk RWAs are calculated. The     calculations are consistent with the Advanced Internal Ratings     Based (AIRB) approach and the Internal Models Method     (IMM) of Basel II, and were based on Exposure at Default     (EAD), which is an estimate of the amount that would be owed to     us at the time of a default, multiplied by each     counterpartys risk weight.         Under the Basel II AIRB approach, a counterpartys risk     weight is generally derived from a combination of the     Probability of Default (PD), the Loss Given Default (LGD) and     the maturity of the trade or portfolio of trades, where:                         PD is an estimate of the probability that an obligor will     default over a     one-year     horizon. PD is derived from the use of internally determined     equivalents of public rating agency ratings.                    LGD is an estimate of the economic loss rate if a default occurs     during economic downturn conditions. LGD is determined based on     industry data.           For OTC derivatives and funding trades (such as repurchase and     reverse repurchase transactions), we use the Basel II IMM     approach, which allows EAD to be calculated using     model-based     measures to determine potential exposure, consistent with models     and methodologies that we use for internal risk management     purposes. For commitments, EAD is calculated as a percentage of     the outstanding notional balance. For other credit exposures,     EAD is generally the carrying value of the exposure.     Risk-Weighted     Assets for Operational Risk         RWAs for operational risk are calculated using a     risk-based     methodology consistent with the qualitative and quantitative     criteria for the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA), as defined     in Basel II. The methodology incorporates internal loss events,     relevant external loss events, results of scenario analyses and     managements assessment of our business environment and     internal controls. We estimate capital requirements for both     expected and unexpected losses, seeking to capture the major     drivers of operational risk over a     one-year     time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. Operational risk     capital is allocated among our businesses and is regularly     reported to senior management and key risk and oversight     committees.     Rating Agency     Guidelines         The credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the     obligations of Group Inc., which directly issues or guarantees     substantially all of the firms senior unsecured     obligations. The level and composition of our equity capital are     among the many factors considered in determining our credit     ratings. Each agency has its own definition of eligible capital     and methodology for evaluating capital        95    Table of Contents       adequacy, and assessments are generally based on a combination     of factors rather than a single calculation. See      Liquidity     and Funding Risk  Credit Ratings below for     further information regarding our credit ratings.     Subsidiary     Capital Requirements         Many of our subsidiaries are subject to separate regulation and     capital requirements in the     U.S. and/or     elsewhere. GS&Co. and Goldman Sachs Execution &     Clearing, L.P. are registered     U.S. broker-dealers     and futures commissions merchants, and are subject to regulatory     capital requirements, including those imposed by the SEC, the     Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Chicago Board of     Trade, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA)     and the National Futures Association.         Our depository institution subsidiary, GS Bank USA, a New York     State-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System     and the FDIC, is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board and the     New York State Banking Department and is subject to minimum     capital requirements that (subject to certain exceptions) are     similar to those applicable to bank holding companies. GS Bank     USA was formed in November 2008 through the merger of our     existing Utah industrial bank (named GS Bank USA) into our New     York limited purpose trust company, with the surviving company     taking the name GS Bank USA. As of November 2007, GS Bank     USAs predecessor was a wholly owned industrial bank     regulated by the Utah Department of Financial Institutions, was     a member of the FDIC and was subject to minimum capital     requirements. We compute the capital ratios for GS Bank USA in     accordance with the Basel I framework for purposes of assessing     the adequacy of its capital. In order to be considered a     well capitalized depository institution under the     Federal Reserve Board guidelines, GS Bank USA must maintain a     Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6%, a total capital ratio     of at least 10%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least     5%. In connection with the November 2008 asset transfer     described below, GS Bank USA agreed with the Federal     Reserve Board to minimum capital ratios in excess of these     well capitalized levels. Accordingly, for a period     of time, GS Bank USA is expected to maintain a Tier 1     capital ratio of at least 8%, a total capital ratio of at least     11% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 6%. In     November 2008, we contributed subsidiaries with an     aggregate of $117.16 billion of assets into GS Bank     USA (which brought total assets in GS Bank USA to     $145.06 billion as of November 2008). As a result, we are     currently working with the Federal Reserve Board to finalize our     methodology for the Basel I calculations. As of November     2008, under Basel I, GS Bank USAs estimated     Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.9% and estimated total capital     ratio was 11.6%. In addition, GS Bank USAs estimated     Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.1%.         Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of     GS&Co., GS Bank USA and GS Bank Europe, subject to certain     exceptions. In November 2008, as noted above, we     contributed subsidiaries, with an aggregate of     $117.16 billion of assets, into GS Bank USA and Group Inc.     agreed to guarantee certain losses, including     credit-related     losses, relating to assets held by the contributed entities. In     connection with this guarantee, Group Inc. also agreed to pledge     to GS Bank USA certain collateral, including interests in     subsidiaries and other illiquid assets.         GS Bank Europe, our regulated Irish bank, is subject to minimum     capital requirements imposed by the Irish Financial Services     Regulatory Authority. Several other subsidiaries of Goldman     Sachs are regulated by securities, investment advisory, banking,     insurance, and other regulators and authorities around the     world. Goldman Sachs International (GSI), our regulated U.K.     broker-dealer,     is subject to minimum capital requirements imposed by the     Financial Services Authority (FSA). Goldman Sachs Japan Co.,     Ltd., our regulated Japanese     broker-dealer,     is subject to minimum capital requirements imposed by     Japans Financial Services Agency. As of November 2008     and November 2007, these subsidiaries were in compliance     with their local capital requirements.         As discussed above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to     regulatory capital requirements in jurisdictions throughout the     world. Subsidiaries not subject to separate regulation may hold     capital to satisfy local tax guidelines, rating agency     requirements (for entities with assigned credit ratings) or        96    Table of Contents       internal policies, including policies concerning the minimum     amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based on its     underlying level of risk. See      Liquidity     and Funding Risk  Conservative Liability     Structure below for a discussion of our potential     inability to access funds from our subsidiaries.         Equity investments in subsidiaries are generally funded with     parent company equity capital. As of November 2008, Group     Inc.s equity investment in subsidiaries was     $51.70 billion compared with its total shareholders     equity of $64.37 billion.         Our capital invested in     non-U.S. subsidiaries     is generally exposed to foreign exchange risk, substantially all     of which is managed through a combination of derivative     contracts and     non-U.S. denominated     debt. In addition, we generally manage the     non-trading     exposure to foreign exchange risk that arises from transactions     denominated in currencies other than the transacting     entitys functional currency.         See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for further information regarding our regulated subsidiaries.     Equity Capital     Management         Our objective is to maintain a sufficient level and optimal     composition of equity capital. We manage our capital through     repurchases of our common stock, as permitted, and issuances of     common and preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to     trusts and other subordinated debt. We manage our capital     requirements principally by setting limits on balance sheet     assets     and/or     limits on risk, in each case at both the consolidated and     business unit levels. We attribute capital usage to each of our     business units based upon our regulatory capital framework and     manage the levels of usage based upon the balance sheet and risk     limits established.     Share Repurchase Program.  Subject to the     limitations of the U.S. Treasurys TARP Capital     Purchase Program described below under      Equity     Capital  Equity Capital Management      Preferred Stock, we seek to use our share repurchase     program to substantially offset increases in share count over     time resulting from employee     share-based     compensation. The repurchase program is effected primarily     through regular     open-market     purchases, the amounts and timing of which are determined     primarily by our current and projected capital positions     (i.e., comparisons of our desired level of capital to our     actual level of capital) but which may also be influenced by     general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading     volumes of our common stock, in each case subject to the limit     imposed under the U.S. Treasurys TARP Capital     Purchase Program. See      Equity     Capital  Equity Capital Management      Preferred Stock below for information regarding     restrictions on our ability to repurchase common stock.         The following table sets forth the level of share repurchases     for the years ended November 2008 and November 2007:                                               As of November             2008       2007                 (in millions, except                 per share amounts)          Number of shares repurchased                10.54                   41.22              Total cost            $       2,037               $       8,956              Average cost per share            $       193.18               $       217.29                     As of November 2008, we were authorized to repurchase up to     60.9 million additional shares of common stock pursuant to     our repurchase program. See Market for Registrants     Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases     of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 5 of our     Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for additional information on our repurchase program.     Stock Offerings.  In September 2008, we     completed a public offering of 46.7 million shares of     common stock at $123.00 per share for proceeds of     $5.75 billion.        97    Table of Contents       In October 2008, we issued to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and     certain affiliates 50,000 shares of 10% Cumulative     Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series G (Series G     Preferred Stock), and a five-year warrant to purchase up to     43.5 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of     $115.00 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $5.00 billion.     The allocated carrying values of the warrant and the     Series G Preferred Stock on the date of issuance (based on     their relative fair values) were $1.14 billion and     $3.86 billion, respectively. The warrant is exercisable at     any time until October 1, 2013 and the number of     shares of common stock underlying the warrant and the exercise     price are subject to adjustment for certain dilutive events.         In October 2008, under the U.S. Treasurys TARP     Capital Purchase Program, we issued to the U.S. Treasury     10.0 million shares of Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual     Preferred Stock, Series H (Series H Preferred Stock),     and a     10-year     warrant to purchase up to 12.2 million shares of common     stock at an exercise price of $122.90 per share, for aggregate     proceeds of $10.00 billion. The allocated carrying values     of the warrant and the Series H Preferred Stock on the date     of issuance (based on their relative fair values) were     $490 million and $9.51 billion, respectively.     Cumulative dividends on the Series H Preferred Stock are     payable at 5% per annum through November 14, 2013 and     at a rate of 9% per annum thereafter. The Series H     Preferred Stock will be accreted to the redemption price of     $10.00 billion over five years. The warrant is exercisable     at any time until October 28, 2018 and the number of     shares of common stock underlying the warrant and the exercise     price are subject to adjustment for certain dilutive events. If,     on or prior to December 31, 2009, we receive aggregate     gross cash proceeds of at least $10 billion from sales of     Tier 1 qualifying perpetual preferred stock or common     stock, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon     exercise of the warrant will be reduced by     one-half of     the original number of shares of common stock.     Preferred Stock.

Each share of Series H Preferred Stock issued and     outstanding has a par value of $0.01, has a liquidation     preference of $1,000 and is redeemable at our option, subject to     the approval of the        98    Table of Contents       Federal Reserve Board, at a redemption price equal to $1,000     plus accrued and unpaid dividends, provided that through     November 14, 2011 the Series H Preferred Stock is     redeemable only in an amount up to the aggregate net cash     proceeds received from sales of Tier 1 qualifying perpetual     preferred stock or common stock, and only once such sales have     resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of at least     $2.5 billion.         All series of preferred stock are pari passu and have a     preference over our common stock upon liquidation. Dividends on     each series of preferred stock, if declared, are payable     quarterly in arrears. Our ability to declare or pay dividends     on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, our common stock     is subject to certain restrictions in the event that we fail to     pay or set aside full dividends on our preferred stock for the     latest completed dividend period. In addition, pursuant to the     U.S. Treasurys TARP Capital Purchase Program, until     the earliest of October 28, 2011, the redemption of     all of the Series H Preferred Stock or transfer by the     U.S. Treasury of all of the Series H Preferred Stock     to third parties, we must obtain the consent of the     U.S. Treasury to raise our common stock dividend or to     repurchase any shares of common stock or other preferred stock,     with certain exceptions (including repurchases of our common     stock under our share repurchase program to offset dilution from     equity-based     compensation). For as long as the Series H Preferred Stock     remains outstanding, due to the limitations pursuant to the U.S.     Treasurys TARP Capital Purchase Program, we will     repurchase our common stock through our share repurchase program     only for the purpose of offsetting dilution from     equity-based     compensation, to the extent permitted.     Junior Subordinated Debt Issued to Trusts in Connection with     Normal Automatic Preferred Enhanced Capital     Securities.  In 2007, we issued $1.75 billion     of fixed rate junior subordinated debt to Goldman Sachs Capital     II and $500 million of floating rate junior subordinated     debt to Goldman Sachs Capital III, Delaware statutory trusts     that, in turn, issued $2.25 billion of guaranteed perpetual     Automatic Preferred Enhanced Capital Securities (APEX) to third     parties and a de minimis amount of common securities to Goldman     Sachs. The junior subordinated debt is included in     Unsecured     long-term     borrowings in the consolidated statements of financial     condition. In connection with the APEX issuance, we entered into     stock purchase contracts with Goldman Sachs Capital II and III     under which we will be obligated to sell and these entities will     be obligated to purchase $2.25 billion of perpetual     non-cumulative     preferred stock that we will issue in the future. Goldman Sachs     Capital II and III are required to remarket the junior     subordinated debt in order to fund their purchase of the     preferred stock, but in the event that a remarketing is     unsuccessful, they will relinquish the subordinated debt to us     in exchange for the preferred stock. Because of certain     characteristics of the junior subordinated debt (and the     associated APEX), including its     long-term     nature, the future issuance of perpetual     non-cumulative     preferred stock under the stock purchase contracts, our ability     to defer payments due on the debt and the subordinated nature of     the debt in our capital structure, it qualifies as Tier 1     and Total Allowable Capital and is included as part of our     equity capital.     Junior Subordinated Debt Issued to a Trust in Connection with     Trust Preferred Securities.  We issued     $2.84 billion of junior subordinated debentures in 2004 to     Goldman Sachs Capital I, a Delaware statutory trust that, in     turn, issued $2.75 billion of guaranteed preferred     beneficial interests to third parties and $85 million of     common beneficial interests to Goldman Sachs. The junior     subordinated debentures are included in Unsecured     long-term     borrowings in the consolidated statements of financial     condition. Because of certain characteristics of the junior     subordinated debt (and the associated trust preferred     securities), including its     long-term     nature, our ability to defer coupon interest for up to ten     consecutive     semi-annual     periods and the subordinated nature of the debt in our capital     structure, it qualifies as Tier 1 and Total Allowable     Capital and is included as part of our equity capital.     Subordinated Debt.  In addition to junior     subordinated debt issued to trusts, we had other subordinated     debt outstanding of $14.17 billion as of     November 2008. Although not part of our shareholders     equity, substantially all of our subordinated debt qualifies as     Total Allowable Capital.        99    Table of Contents   Other Capital     Ratios and Metrics         The following table sets forth information on our assets,     shareholders equity, leverage ratios and book value per     common share:                                               As of November             2008       2007                 ($ in millions, except                 per share amounts)          Total assets            $       884,547               $       1,119,796              Adjusted     assets (1)                528,161                   745,700              Total shareholders equity                64,369                   42,800              Tangible equity     capital (2)                64,186                   42,728              Leverage     ratio (3)                13.7       x               26.2       x          Adjusted leverage     ratio (4)                8.2       x               17.5       x          Debt to equity     ratio (5)                2.6       x               3.8       x          Common shareholders equity            $       47,898               $       39,700              Tangible common shareholders     equity (6)                42,715                   34,628              Book value per common     share (7)            $       98.68               $       90.43              Tangible book value per common     share (8)                88.00                   78.88                        (1)   Adjusted assets excludes     (i) low-risk     collateralized assets generally associated with our matched book     and securities lending businesses and federal funds sold,     (ii) cash and securities we segregate for regulatory and     other purposes and (iii) goodwill and identifiable     intangible assets, excluding power contracts. We do not deduct     identifiable intangible assets associated with power contracts     from total assets in order to be consistent with the calculation     of tangible equity capital and the adjusted leverage ratio (see     footnote 2 below).

We do not deduct identifiable     intangible assets associated with power contracts from total     shareholders equity because, unlike other intangible     assets, less than 50% of these assets are supported by common     shareholders equity. We consider junior subordinated debt     issued to trusts to be a component of our tangible equity     capital base due to certain characteristics of the debt,     including its     long-term     nature, our ability to defer payments due on the debt and the     subordinated nature of the debt in our capital structure.               The following table sets forth the reconciliation of total     shareholders equity to tangible equity capital:                                                             As of November                     2008       2007                         (in millions)          Total shareholders equity            $       64,369               $       42,800              Add:            Junior subordinated debt issued to trusts               5,000                   5,000              Deduct:            Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, excluding power     contracts               (5,183       )               (5,072       )                                                        Tangible equity capital            $       64,186               $       42,728                                                       100    Table of Contents          (3)   The leverage ratio equals total     assets divided by total shareholders equity. This ratio is     different from the Tier 1 leverage ratios included in      Equity     Capital  Consolidated Capital Requirements and      Equity Capital  Subsidiary Capital     Requirements above.           (4)   The adjusted leverage ratio equals     adjusted assets divided by tangible equity capital. We believe     that the adjusted leverage ratio is a more meaningful measure of     our capital adequacy than the leverage ratio because it excludes     certain     low-risk     collateralized assets that are generally supported with little     or no capital and reflects the tangible equity capital deployed     in our businesses.           (5)   The debt to equity ratio equals     unsecured     long-term     borrowings divided by total shareholders equity.           (6)   Tangible common shareholders     equity equals total shareholders equity less preferred     stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, excluding     power contracts. We do not deduct identifiable intangible assets     associated with power contracts from total shareholders     equity because, unlike other intangible assets, less than 50% of     these assets are supported by common shareholders equity.

The following table sets forth our contractual obligations by     fiscal maturity date as of November 2008:     Contractual     Obligations (in     millions)                                                                                                2010-        2012-        2014-                      2009       2011       2013       Thereafter       Total          Unsecured     long-term     borrowings (1)(2)(3)            $                      $       25,122               $       38,750               $       104,348               $       168,220              Secured     long-term     financings (1)(2)(4)                                   6,735                   4,417                   6,306                   17,458              Contractual interest     payments (5)                8,145                   14,681                   11,947                   34,399                   69,172              Insurance     liabilities (6)                642                   951                   791                   4,879                   7,263              Minimum rental payments                494                   800                   535                   1,664                   3,493              Purchase obligations                569                   132                   21                   21                   743                        (1)   Obligations maturing within one     year of our financial statement date or redeemable within one     year of our financial statement date at the option of the holder     are excluded from this table and are treated as     short-term     obligations. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial     statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for further information regarding our secured financings.           (2)   Obligations that are repayable     prior to maturity at the option of Goldman Sachs are reflected     at their contractual maturity dates. Obligations that are     redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the holder are     reflected at the dates such options become exercisable.           (3)   Includes $17.45 billion     accounted for at fair value under SFAS No. 155 or SFAS     No. 159, primarily consisting of hybrid financial     instruments and prepaid physical commodity transactions.           (4)   These obligations are reported     within Other secured financings in the consolidated     statements of financial condition and include $7.85 billion     accounted for at fair value under SFAS No. 159.           (5)   Represents estimated future     interest payments related to unsecured     long-term     borrowings and secured     long-term     financings based on applicable interest rates as of     November 2008. Includes stated coupons, if any, on     structured notes.           (6)   Represents estimated undiscounted     payments related to future benefits and unpaid claims arising     from policies associated with our insurance activities,     excluding separate accounts and estimated recoveries under     reinsurance contracts.                  As of November 2008, our unsecured     long-term     borrowings were $168.22 billion, with maturities extending     to 2043, and consisted principally of senior borrowings. See     Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for further information regarding our unsecured     long-term     borrowings.         As of November 2008, our future minimum rental payments,     net of minimum sublease rentals, under noncancelable leases were     $3.49 billion. These lease commitments, principally for     office space, expire on various dates through 2069. Certain     agreements are subject to periodic escalation provisions for     increases in real estate taxes and other charges. See     Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for further information regarding our leases.         Our occupancy expenses include costs associated with office     space held in excess of our current requirements. This excess     space, the cost of which is charged to earnings as incurred, is     being held for potential growth or to replace currently occupied     space that we may exit in the future. We regularly evaluate our     current and future space capacity in relation to current and     projected staffing levels. In 2008, we incurred exit costs of     $80 million related to our office space (included in        102    Table of Contents       Occupancy and Depreciation and     Amortization in the consolidated statement of earnings).     We may incur exit costs in the future to the extent we     (i) reduce our space capacity or (ii) commit to, or     occupy, new properties in the locations in which we operate and,     consequently, dispose of existing space that had been held for     potential growth. These exit costs may be material to our     results of operations in a given period.         As of November 2008, included in purchase obligations was     $483 million of     construction-related     obligations. Our     construction-related     obligations include commitments of $388 million related to     our new headquarters in New York City, which is expected to cost     between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion. We have     partially financed this construction project with     $1.65 billion of     tax-exempt     Liberty Bonds.         Due to the uncertainty of the timing and amounts that will     ultimately be paid, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits     has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table.

Our commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to     counterparties that have fixed termination dates and are     contingent on the satisfaction of all conditions to borrowing     set forth in the contract. In connection with our lending     activities, we had outstanding commitments to extend credit of     $41.04 billion as of November 2008. Since these     commitments may expire unused or be reduced or cancelled at the     counterpartys request, the total commitment amount does     not necessarily reflect the actual future cash flow     requirements. Our commercial lending commitments are generally     extended in connection with contingent acquisition financing and     other types of corporate lending as well as commercial real     estate financing. We may seek to reduce our credit risk on these     commitments by syndicating all or substantial portions of     commitments to other investors in the future. In addition,        103    Table of Contents       commitments that are extended for contingent acquisition     financing are often intended to be     short-term     in nature, as borrowers often seek to replace them with other     funding sources.         Included within     non-investment-grade     commitments as of November 2008 was $2.07 billion of     exposure to leveraged lending capital market transactions,     $164 million related to commercial real estate transactions     and $7.09 billion arising from other unfunded credit     facilities. Including funded loans, our total exposure to     leveraged lending capital market transactions was     $7.97 billion as of November 2008.

Substantially all of the commitments provided under the William     Street credit extension program are to     investment-grade     corporate borrowers. Commitments under the program are     principally extended by William Street Commitment Corporation     (Commitment Corp.), a consolidated wholly owned subsidiary of GS     Bank USA, and also by William Street Credit Corporation, GS Bank     USA or Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. The commitments     extended by Commitment Corp. are supported, in part, by funding     raised by William Street Funding Corporation (Funding Corp.),     another consolidated wholly owned subsidiary of GS Bank USA. The     assets and liabilities of Commitment Corp. and Funding Corp. are     legally separated from other assets and liabilities of the firm.     With respect to most of the William Street commitments, SMFG     provides us with credit loss protection that is generally     limited to 95% of the first loss we realize on approved loan     commitments, up to a maximum of $1.00 billion. In addition,     subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, upon our     request, SMFG will provide protection for 70% of additional     losses on such commitments, up to a maximum of     $1.13 billion, of which $375 million of protection has     been provided as of November 2008. We also use other     financial instruments to mitigate credit risks related to     certain William Street commitments not covered by SMFG.         Our commitments to extend credit also include financing for the     warehousing of financial assets. These arrangements are secured     by the warehoused assets, primarily consisting of commercial     mortgages as of November 2008.         See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for further information regarding our commitments, contingencies     and guarantees.        104    Table of Contents      Risk     Management          Management believes that effective risk management is of primary     importance to the success of Goldman Sachs. Accordingly, we have     a comprehensive risk management process to monitor, evaluate and     manage the principal risks we assume in conducting our     activities. These risks include market, credit, liquidity,     operational, legal and reputational exposures.     Risk Management     Structure         We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a     variety of separate but complementary financial, credit,     operational, compliance and legal reporting systems. In     addition, a number of committees are responsible for monitoring     risk exposures and for general oversight of our risk management     process, as described further below. These committees (including     their subcommittees), meet regularly and consist of senior     members of both our revenue-producing units and departments that     are independent of our revenue-producing units.         Segregation of duties and management oversight are fundamental     elements of our risk management process. In addition to the     committees described below, functions that are independent of     the revenue-producing units, such as Compliance, Finance, Legal,     Management Controls (Internal Audit) and Operations, perform     risk management functions, which include monitoring, analyzing     and evaluating risk.     Management Committee.  All risk control     functions ultimately report to our Management Committee. Through     both direct and delegated authority, the Management Committee     approves all of our operating activities and trading risk     parameters.     Risk Committees.  The Firmwide Risk Committee     reviews the activities of existing trading businesses, approves     new businesses and products, approves firmwide market risk     limits, reviews business unit market risk limits, approves     market risk limits for selected sovereign markets and business     units, approves sovereign credit risk limits and credit risk     limits by ratings group, and reviews scenario analyses based on     abnormal or catastrophic market movements.         The Securities Divisional Risk Committee sets market risk limits     for our trading activities subject to overall firmwide risk     limits, based on a number of measures, including VaR, stress     tests and scenario analyses.         Business unit risk limits are established by the appropriate     risk committee and may be further allocated by the business unit     managers to individual trading desks. Trading desk managers have     the first line of responsibility for managing risk within     prescribed limits. These managers have     in-depth     knowledge of the primary sources of risk in their respective     markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures.         Market risk limits are monitored by the Finance Division and are     reviewed regularly by the appropriate risk committee. Limit     violations are reported to the appropriate risk committee and     business unit managers and addressed, as necessary. Credit risk     limits are also monitored by the Finance Division and reviewed     by the appropriate risk committee.         The Asset Management Divisional Risk Committee oversees various     risk, valuation and credit issues related to our asset     management business.     Business Practices Committee.  The Business     Practices Committee assists senior management in its oversight     of compliance and operational risks and related reputational     concerns, seeks to ensure the consistency of our policies,     practices and procedures with our Business Principles, and makes     recommendations on ways to mitigate potential risks.        105    Table of Contents   Firmwide Capital Committee.  The Firmwide     Capital Committee reviews and approves transactions involving     commitments of our capital. Such capital commitments include,     but are not limited to, extensions of credit, alternative     liquidity commitments, certain bond underwritings and certain     distressed debt and principal finance activities. The Firmwide     Capital Committee is also responsible for establishing business     and reputational standards for capital commitments and seeking     to ensure that they are maintained on a global basis.     Commitments Committee.  The Commitments     Committee reviews and approves underwriting and distribution     activities, primarily with respect to offerings of equity and     equity-related     securities, and sets and maintains policies and procedures     designed to ensure that legal, reputational, regulatory and     business standards are maintained in conjunction with these     activities. In addition to reviewing specific transactions, the     Commitments Committee periodically conducts strategic reviews of     industry sectors and products and establishes policies in     connection with transaction practices.     Credit Policy Committee.  The Credit Policy     Committee establishes and reviews broad credit policies and     parameters that are implemented by the Credit Department.     Finance Committee.  The Finance Committee     establishes and oversees our liquidity policies, sets certain     inventory position limits and has oversight responsibility for     liquidity risk, the size and composition of our balance sheet     and capital base, and our credit ratings. The Finance Committee     regularly reviews our funding position and capitalization and     makes adjustments in light of current events, risks and     exposures.     New Products Committee.  The New Products     Committee, under the oversight of the Firmwide Risk Committee,     is responsible for reviewing and approving new products and     businesses globally.

The Operational     Risk Committee provides oversight of the ongoing development and     implementation of our operational risk policies, framework and     methodologies, and monitors the effectiveness of operational     risk management.     Structured Products Committee.  The Structured     Products Committee reviews and approves structured product     transactions entered into with our clients that raise legal,     regulatory, tax or accounting issues or present reputational     risk to Goldman Sachs.      Market     Risk          The potential for changes in the market value of our trading and     investing positions is referred to as market risk. Such     positions result from     market-making,     proprietary trading, underwriting, specialist and investing     activities. Substantially all of our inventory positions are     marked-to-market     on a daily basis and changes are recorded in net revenues.         Categories of market risk include exposures to interest rates,     equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. A     description of each market risk category is set forth below:                         Interest rate risks primarily result from exposures to changes     in the level, slope and curvature of the yield curve, the     volatility of interest rates, mortgage prepayment speeds and     credit spreads.                    Equity price risks result from exposures to changes in prices     and volatilities of individual equities, equity baskets and     equity indices.                    Currency rate risks result from exposures to changes in spot     prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates.                    Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot     prices, forward prices and volatilities of commodities, such as     electricity, natural gas, crude oil, petroleum products, and     precious and base metals.          106    Table of Contents         We seek to manage these risks by diversifying exposures,     controlling position sizes and establishing economic hedges in     related securities or derivatives. For example, we may seek to     hedge a portfolio of common stocks by taking an offsetting     position in a related     equity-index     futures contract. The ability to manage an exposure may,     however, be limited by adverse changes in the liquidity of the     security or the related hedge instrument and in the correlation     of price movements between the security and related hedge     instrument.         In addition to applying business judgment, senior management     uses a number of quantitative tools to manage our exposure to     market risk for Trading assets, at fair value and     Trading liabilities, at fair value in the     consolidated statements of financial condition. These tools     include:                         risk limits based on a summary measure of market risk exposure     referred to as VaR;                    scenario analyses, stress tests and other analytical tools that     measure the potential effects on our trading net revenues of     various market events, including, but not limited to, a large     widening of credit spreads, a substantial decline in equity     markets and significant moves in selected emerging markets; and                    inventory position limits for selected business units.       VaR         VaR is the potential loss in value of trading positions due to     adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a     specified confidence level.         For the VaR numbers reported below, a     one-day time     horizon and a 95% confidence level were used. This means that     there is a 1 in 20 chance that daily trading net revenues will     fall below the expected daily trading net revenues by an amount     at least as large as the reported VaR. Thus, shortfalls from     expected trading net revenues on a single trading day greater     than the reported VaR would be anticipated to occur, on average,     about once a month. Shortfalls on a single day can exceed     reported VaR by significant amounts. Shortfalls can also occur     more frequently or accumulate over a longer time horizon such as     a number of consecutive trading days.         The modeling of the risk characteristics of our trading     positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations.     While we believe that these assumptions and approximations are     reasonable, there is no standard methodology for estimating VaR,     and different assumptions     and/or     approximations could produce materially different VaR estimates.         We use historical data to estimate our VaR and, to better     reflect current asset volatilities, we generally weight     historical data to give greater importance to more recent     observations. Given its reliance on historical data, VaR is most     effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there     are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market     conditions. An inherent limitation of VaR is that the     distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not     produce accurate predictions of future market risk. Different     VaR methodologies and distributional assumptions could produce a     materially different VaR. Moreover, VaR calculated for a     one-day time     horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that     cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within one day.        107    Table of Contents       The following tables set forth the daily VaR:     Average Daily VaR     (1) (in     millions)                                                                Year Ended November      Risk Categories        2008       2007       2006          Interest rates            $       142               $       85               $       49              Equity prices                72                   100                   72              Currency rates                30                   23                   21              Commodity prices                44                   26                   30              Diversification     effect (2)                (108       )               (96       )               (71       )                                                                Total            $       180               $       138               $       101                                                                              (1)   Certain portfolios and individual     positions are not included in VaR, where VaR is not the most     appropriate measure of risk (e.g., due to transfer     restrictions     and/or     illiquidity).

This     effect arises because the four market risk categories are not     perfectly correlated.                  Our average daily VaR increased to $180 million in 2008     from $138 million in 2007, principally due to increases in     the interest rate, commodity price and currency rate categories,     partially offset by a decrease in the equity price category. The     increase in interest rates was primarily due to higher levels of     volatility and wider spreads, partially offset by position     reductions, and the increases in commodity prices and currency     rates were primarily due to higher levels of volatility. The     decrease in equity prices was principally due to position     reductions, partially offset by higher levels of volatility.         Our average daily VaR increased to $138 million in 2007     from $101 million in 2006. The increase was primarily due     to higher levels of exposure and volatility in interest rates     and equity prices.         VaR excludes the impact of changes in counterparty and our own     credit spreads on derivatives as well as changes in our own     credit spreads on unsecured borrowings for which the fair value     option was elected. The estimated sensitivity of our net     revenues to a one basis point increase in credit spreads     (counterparty and our own) on derivatives was $1 million as     of November 2008. In addition, the estimated sensitivity of     our net revenues to a one basis point increase in our own credit     spreads on unsecured borrowings for which the fair value option     was elected was $1 million (including hedges) as of     November 2008.

This     effect arises because the four market risk categories are not     perfectly correlated.              108    Table of Contents       Our daily VaR increased to $244 million as of     November 2008 from $134 million as of     November 2007, primarily due to an increase in the interest     rate category and a reduction in the diversification benefit     across risk categories, partially offset by a decrease in the     equity price category. The increase in interest rates was     principally due to higher levels of volatility and wider     spreads, partially offset by position reductions. The decrease     in equity prices was primarily due to position reductions,     partially offset by higher levels of volatility.         The following chart presents our daily VaR during 2008:     Daily VaR         ($ in millions)             109    Table of Contents   Trading Net     Revenues Distribution         The following chart sets forth the frequency distribution of our     daily trading net revenues for substantially all inventory     positions included in VaR for the year ended November 2008:     Daily Trading Net     Revenues         ($ in millions)                 As part of our overall risk control process, daily trading net     revenues are compared with VaR calculated as of the end of the     prior business day. Trading losses incurred on a single day     exceeded our 95%     one-day VaR     on 13 and 10 occasions during 2008 and 2007, respectively.     Other Market     Risk Measures         Certain portfolios and individual positions are not included in     VaR, where VaR is not the most appropriate measure of risk     (e.g., due to transfer restrictions     and/or     illiquidity). The market risk related to our investment in the     ordinary shares of ICBC, excluding interests held by investment     funds managed by Goldman Sachs, is measured by estimating the     potential reduction in net revenues associated with a 10%     decline in the ICBC ordinary share price. The market risk     related to the remaining positions is measured by estimating the     potential reduction in net revenues associated with a 10%     decline in asset values.         The sensitivity analyses for equity and debt positions in our     trading portfolio and equity, debt (primarily mezzanine     instruments) and real estate positions in our     non-trading     portfolio are measured by the impact of a decline in the asset     values (including the impact of leverage in the underlying     investments for real estate positions in our     non-trading     portfolio) of such positions. The fair value of the underlying     positions may be impacted by factors such as transactions in     similar instruments, completed or pending     third-party     transactions in the underlying investment or comparable     entities, subsequent rounds of financing, recapitalizations and     other transactions across the capital structure, offerings in     the equity or debt capital markets, and changes in financial     ratios or cash flows.        110    Table of Contents       The following table sets forth market risk for positions not     included in VaR. These measures do not reflect diversification     benefits across asset categories and, given the differing     likelihood of the potential declines in asset categories, these     measures have not been aggregated:                                                             10% Sensitivity                     Amount as of November      Asset Categories         10% Sensitivity Measure        2008       2007                         (in millions)           Trading Risk (1)                                                   Equity (2)            Underlying asset value           $       790               $       1,325              Debt (3)            Underlying asset value               808                   1,020                                                        Non-trading     Risk                                                   ICBC            ICBC ordinary share price               202                   250              Other     Equity (4)            Underlying asset value               1,155                   1,054              Debt (5)            Underlying asset value               694                   500              Real     Estate (6)            Underlying asset value               1,330                   1,108                        (1)   In addition to the positions in     these portfolios, which are accounted for at fair value, we make     investments accounted for under the equity method and we also     make direct investments in real estate, both of which are     included in Other assets in the consolidated     statements of financial condition. Direct investments in real     estate are accounted for at cost less accumulated depreciation.     See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for information on Other assets.           (2)   Relates to private and restricted     public equity securities held within the FICC and Equities     components of our Trading and Principal Investments segment.           (3)   Relates to acquired portfolios of     distressed loans (primarily backed by commercial and residential     real estate collateral), bank loans and bridge loans, and loans     backed by commercial real estate and held within the FICC     component of our Trading and Principal Investments segment.           (4)   Primarily relates to interests in     our merchant banking funds that invest in corporate equities.           (5)   Primarily relates to interests in     our merchant banking funds that invest in corporate mezzanine     debt instruments.           (6)   Primarily relates to interests in     our merchant banking funds that invest in real estate. Such     funds typically employ leverage as part of the investment     strategy. This sensitivity measure is based on our percentage     ownership of the underlying asset values in the funds and     unfunded commitments to the funds.                  The decrease in our 10% sensitivity measures as of     November 2008 from November 2007 for equity and debt     positions in our trading portfolio was due to dispositions and a     decrease in the fair value of the portfolio, partially offset by     new investments. The increase in our 10% sensitivity measures as     of November 2008 from November 2007 for our     non-trading     portfolio (excluding ICBC) was due to new investments, partially     offset by a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio.         In addition to the positions included in VaR and the other risk     measures described above, as of November 2008, we held     approximately $10.39 billion of financial instruments in     our bank and insurance subsidiaries, primarily consisting of     $3.08 billion of U.S. government, federal agency and     sovereign obligations, $2.87 billion of corporate debt     securities and other debt obligations, $2.86 billion of     money market instruments, and $1.22 billion of mortgage and     other     asset-backed     loans and securities. As of November 2007, we held     approximately $10.58 billion of financial instruments in     our bank and insurance subsidiaries, primarily consisting of     $4.70 billion of mortgage and other     asset-backed     loans and securities, $2.93 billion of corporate debt     securities and other debt obligations and $2.77 billion of     U.S. government, federal agency and sovereign obligations.     In addition, as of November 2008 and November 2007, we     held commitments and loans under the William Street credit     extension program. See      Contractual     Obligations and Commitments  Commitments above     for information on our William Street program.        111    Table of Contents      Credit     Risk          Credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a     counterparty or an issuer of securities or other instruments we     hold fails to perform under its contractual obligations to us,     or upon a deterioration in the credit quality of third parties     whose securities or other instruments, including OTC     derivatives, we hold. Our exposure to credit risk principally     arises through our trading, investing and financing activities.     To reduce our credit exposures, we seek to enter into netting     agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset     receivables and payables with such counterparties. In addition,     we attempt to further reduce credit risk with certain     counterparties by (i) entering into agreements that enable     us to obtain collateral from a counterparty on an upfront or     contingent basis, (ii) seeking     third-party     guarantees of the counterpartys obligations,     and/or     (iii) transferring our credit risk to third parties using     credit derivatives     and/or other     structures and techniques.         To measure and manage our credit exposures, we use a variety of     tools, including credit limits referenced to both current     exposure and potential exposure. Potential exposure is an     estimate of exposure, within a specified confidence level, that     could be outstanding over the life of a transaction based on     market movements. In addition, as part of our market risk     management process, for positions measured by changes in credit     spreads, we use VaR and other sensitivity measures. To     supplement our primary credit exposure measures, we also use     scenario analyses, such as credit spread widening scenarios,     stress tests and other quantitative tools.         Our global credit management systems monitor credit exposure to     individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to     counterparties and their affiliates. These systems also provide     management, including the Firmwide Risk and Credit Policy     Committees, with information regarding credit risk by product,     industry sector, country and region.         While our activities expose us to many different industries and     counterparties, we routinely execute a high volume of     transactions with counterparties in the financial services     industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks and     investment funds, resulting in significant credit concentration     with respect to this industry. In the ordinary course of     business, we may also be subject to a concentration of credit     risk to a particular counterparty, borrower or issuer.         As of November 2008 and November 2007, we held     $53.98 billion (6% of total assets) and $45.75 billion     (4% of total assets), respectively, of U.S. government and     federal agency obligations included in Trading assets, at     fair value and Cash and securities segregated for     regulatory and other purposes in the consolidated     statements of financial condition. As of November 2008 and     November 2007, we held $21.13 billion (2% of total     assets) and $31.65 billion (3% of total assets),     respectively, of other sovereign obligations, principally     consisting of securities issued by the governments of Japan and     the United Kingdom. In addition, as of November 2008 and     November 2007, $126.27 billion and     $144.92 billion of our securities purchased under     agreements to resell and securities borrowed (including those in     Cash and securities segregated for regulatory and other     purposes), respectively, were collateralized by     U.S. government and federal agency obligations. As of     November 2008 and November 2007, $65.37 billion     and $41.26 billion of our securities purchased under     agreements to resell and securities borrowed, respectively, were     collateralized by other sovereign obligations. As of     November 2008 and November 2007, we did not have     credit exposure to any other counterparty that exceeded 2% of     our total assets. However, over the past several years, the     amount and duration of our credit exposures with respect to OTC     derivatives has been increasing, due to, among other factors,     the growth of our OTC derivative activities and market evolution     toward longer-dated transactions. A further discussion of our     derivative activities follows below.        112    Table of Contents      Derivatives          Derivative contracts are instruments, such as futures, forwards,     swaps or option contracts, that derive their value from     underlying assets, indices, reference rates or a combination of     these factors. Derivative instruments may be privately     negotiated contracts, which are often referred to as OTC     derivatives, or they may be listed and traded on an exchange.         Substantially all of our derivative transactions are entered     into to facilitate client transactions, to take proprietary     positions or as a means of risk management. In addition to     derivative transactions entered into for trading purposes, we     enter into derivative contracts to manage currency exposure on     our net investment in     non-U.S. operations     and to manage the interest rate and currency exposure on our     long-term     borrowings and certain     short-term     borrowings.         Derivatives are used in many of our businesses, and we believe     that the associated market risk can only be understood relative     to all of the underlying assets or risks being hedged, or as     part of a broader trading strategy. Accordingly, the market risk     of derivative positions is managed together with our     nonderivative positions.         The fair value of our derivative contracts is reflected net of     cash paid or received pursuant to credit support agreements and     is reported on a     net-by-counterparty     basis in our consolidated statements of financial condition when     we believe a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable     netting agreement. For an OTC derivative, our credit exposure is     directly with our counterparty and continues until the maturity     or termination of such contract.        113    Table of Contents       The following tables set forth the fair values of our OTC     derivative assets and liabilities by product and by remaining     contractual maturity:     OTC     Derivatives (in     millions)                                                                                Assets       As of November 2008             0-12        1 - 5        5 - 10        10 Years               Contract Type         Months         Years         Years         or Greater         Total                Interest rates            $       16,220               $       43,864               $       35,050               $       40,649               $       135,783              Credit derivatives                10,364                   45,596                   20,110                   13,788                   89,858              Currencies                28,056                   12,191                   5,980                   4,137                   50,364              Commodities                13,660                   12,717                   1,175                   1,681                   29,233              Equities                17,830                   4,742                   3,927                   1,061                   27,560              Netting across contract     types (1)                (6,238       )               (9,160       )               (3,515       )               (3,802       )               (22,715       )                                                                                                Subtotal            $       79,892        (4)           $       109,950               $       62,727               $       57,514               $       310,083                                                                                                    Cross maturity     netting (2)                                                                                (48,750       )          Cash collateral     netting (3)                                                                                (137,160       )                                                                                                Total                                                                            $       124,173                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Liabilities                                                     0-12        1 - 5        5 - 10        10 Years               Contract Type         Months         Years         Years         or Greater         Total                Interest rates            $       8,004               $       16,152               $       17,456               $       26,399               $       68,011              Credit derivatives                6,591                   20,958                   10,301                   13,610                   51,460              Currencies                29,130                   13,755                   4,109                   2,051                   49,045              Commodities                12,685                   10,391                   1,575                   827                   25,478              Equities                14,016                   4,741                   1,751                   320                   20,828              Netting across contract     types (1)                (6,238       )               (9,160       )               (3,515       )               (3,802       )               (22,715       )                                                                                                Subtotal            $       64,188        (4)           $       56,837               $       31,677               $       39,405               $       192,107                                                                                                    Cross maturity     netting (2)                                                                                (48,750       )          Cash collateral     netting (3)                                                                                (34,009       )                                                                                                Total                                                                            $       109,348                                                                                                              (1)   Represents the netting of     receivable balances with payable balances for the same     counterparty across contract types within a maturity category,     pursuant to credit support agreements.

In the tables above, for option contracts that require     settlement by delivery of an underlying derivative instrument,     the remaining contractual maturity is generally classified based     upon the maturity date of the underlying derivative instrument.     In those instances where the underlying instrument does not have     a maturity date or either counterparty has the right to settle     in cash, the remaining contractual maturity is generally based     upon the option expiration date.        115    Table of Contents       The following tables set forth the distribution, by credit     rating, of our exposure with respect to OTC derivatives by     remaining contractual maturity, both before and after     consideration of the effect of collateral and netting     agreements.

(2)        Represents the netting of receivable balances with payable     balances for the same counterparty across maturity categories     and the netting of cash collateral received, pursuant to credit     support agreements. Receivable and payable balances with the     same counterparty in the same maturity category are netted     within such maturity category, where appropriate.              Derivative transactions may also involve legal risks including     the risk that they are not authorized or appropriate for a     counterparty, that documentation has not been properly executed     or that executed agreements may not be enforceable against the     counterparty. We attempt to minimize these risks by obtaining     advice of counsel on the enforceability of agreements as well as     on the authority of a counterparty to effect the derivative     transaction. In addition, certain derivative transactions     (e.g., credit derivative contracts) involve the risk that     we may have difficulty obtaining, or be unable to obtain, the     underlying security or obligation in order to satisfy any     physical settlement requirement.        116    Table of Contents      Liquidity and     Funding Risk          Liquidity is of critical importance to companies in the     financial services sector. Most failures of financial     institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient     liquidity resulting from adverse circumstances. Accordingly,     Goldman Sachs has in place a comprehensive set of liquidity and     funding policies that are intended to maintain significant     flexibility to address both Goldman Sachs-specific and broader     industry or market liquidity events. Our principal objective is     to be able to fund Goldman Sachs and to enable our core     businesses to continue to generate revenues, even under adverse     circumstances.         We have implemented a number of policies according to the     following liquidity risk management framework:                         Excess Liquidity  We maintain substantial excess     liquidity to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows in a     stressed environment, including financing obligations.                Asset-Liability     Management  We seek to maintain secured and unsecured     funding sources that are sufficiently     long-term in     order to withstand a prolonged or severe liquidity-stressed     environment without having to rely on asset sales.                    Conservative Liability Structure  We seek to access     funding across a diverse range of markets, products and     counterparties, emphasize less     credit-sensitive     sources of funding and conservatively manage the distribution of     funding across our entity structure.                    Crisis Planning  We base our liquidity and funding     management on     stress-scenario     planning and maintain a crisis plan detailing our response to a     liquidity-threatening event.       Excess     Liquidity         Our most important liquidity policy is to     pre-fund     what we estimate will be our likely cash needs during a     liquidity crisis and hold such excess liquidity in the form of     unencumbered, highly liquid securities that may be sold or     pledged to provide     same-day     liquidity. This Global Core Excess is intended to     allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell     other assets or depend on additional funding from     credit-sensitive     markets. We believe that this pool of excess liquidity provides     us with a resilient source of funds and gives us significant     flexibility in managing through a difficult funding environment.     Our Global Core Excess reflects the following principles:                         The first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most     critical to a companys survival.                    Focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral     outflows, not just disruptions to financing flows. Goldman     Sachs businesses are diverse, and its cash needs are     driven by many factors, including market movements, collateral     requirements and client commitments, all of which can change     dramatically in a difficult funding environment.                    During a liquidity crisis,     credit-sensitive     funding, including unsecured debt and some types of secured     financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms or     availability of other types of secured financing may change.                    As a result of our policy to     pre-fund     liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis, we hold     more unencumbered securities and have larger unsecured debt     balances than our businesses would otherwise require. We believe     that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly     liquid unencumbered securities, even though it increases our     unsecured liabilities and our funding costs.          117    Table of Contents         The size of our Global Core Excess is based on an internal     liquidity model together with a qualitative assessment of the     condition of the financial markets and of Goldman Sachs. Our     liquidity model identifies and estimates cash and collateral     outflows over a     short-term     horizon in a liquidity crisis, including, but not limited to:                         upcoming maturities of unsecured debt and letters of credit;                    potential buybacks of a portion of our outstanding negotiable     unsecured debt and potential withdrawals of client deposits;                    adverse changes in the terms or availability of secured funding;                    derivatives and other margin and collateral outflows, including     those due to market moves;                    potential cash outflows associated with our prime brokerage     business;                    additional collateral that could be called in the event of a     two-notch     downgrade in our credit ratings;                    draws on our unfunded commitments not supported by William     Street Funding     Corporation (1);      and                    upcoming cash outflows, such as tax and other large payments.           The following table sets forth the average loan value (the     estimated amount of cash that would be advanced by     counterparties against these securities), as well as overnight     cash deposits, of our Global Core Excess:                                               Year Ended November             2008       2007                  (in millions)      U.S. dollar-denominated            $       78,048               $       52,115          Non-U.S. dollar-denominated                18,677                   11,928                                                    Total Global Core Excess     (2)            $       96,725               $       64,043                                                           The     U.S. dollar-denominated     excess is comprised of only unencumbered U.S. government     securities, U.S. agency securities and highly liquid     U.S. agency     mortgage-backed     securities, all of which are eligible as collateral in Federal     Reserve open market operations, as well as overnight cash     deposits. Our     non-U.S. dollar-denominated     excess is comprised of only unencumbered French, German, United     Kingdom and Japanese government bonds and overnight cash     deposits in highly liquid currencies. We strictly limit our     Global Core Excess to this narrowly defined list of securities     and cash because we believe they are highly liquid, even in a     difficult funding environment. We do not believe other potential     sources of excess liquidity, such as lower-quality unencumbered     securities or committed credit facilities, are as reliable in a     liquidity crisis.         We maintain our Global Core Excess to enable us to meet current     and potential liquidity requirements of our parent company,     Group Inc., and all of its subsidiaries. The amount of our     Global Core Excess is driven by our assessment of potential cash     and collateral outflows, regulatory obligations and the currency     and timing requirements of our global business model. In     addition, we recognize that our Global Core Excess held in a     regulated entity may not be available to our parent company or     other subsidiaries and therefore may only be available to meet     the potential liquidity requirements of that entity.      (1) The      Global Core Excess excludes liquid assets of $4.40 billion     held separately by William Street Funding Corporation. See      Contractual     Obligations and Commitments above for a further discussion     of the William Street credit extension program.   (2) Beginning      in 2008, our Global Core Excess as presented includes the Global     Core Excess of GS Bank USA and GS Bank Europe. The 2007 amounts     include $3.48 billion of Global Core Excess at GS Bank USA.        118    Table of Contents       In addition to our Global Core Excess, we have a significant     amount of other unencumbered securities as a result of our     business activities. These assets, which are located in the U.     S., Europe and Asia, include other government bonds,     high-grade     money market securities, corporate bonds and marginable     equities. We do not include these securities in our Global Core     Excess.         We maintain our Global Core Excess and other unencumbered assets     in an amount that, if pledged or sold, would provide the funds     necessary to replace at least 110% of our unsecured obligations     that are scheduled to mature (or where holders have the option     to redeem) within the next 12 months. We assume     conservative loan values that are based on     stress-scenario     borrowing capacity and we regularly review these assumptions     asset class by asset class. The estimated aggregate loan value     of our Global Core Excess, as well as overnight cash deposits,     and our other unencumbered assets averaged $163.41 billion     and $156.74 billion for the fiscal years ended     November 2008 and November 2007, respectively.     Asset-Liability     Management         We seek to maintain a highly liquid balance sheet and     substantially all of our inventory is     marked-to-market     daily. We utilize aged inventory limits for certain financial     instruments as a disincentive to our businesses to hold     inventory over longer periods of time. We believe that these     limits provide a complementary mechanism for ensuring     appropriate balance sheet liquidity in addition to our standard     position limits. Although our balance sheet fluctuates due to     client activity, market conventions and periodic market     opportunities in certain of our businesses, our total assets and     adjusted assets at financial statement dates are typically not     materially different from those occurring within our reporting     periods.         We seek to manage the maturity profile of our secured and     unsecured funding base such that we should be able to liquidate     our assets prior to our liabilities coming due, even in times of     prolonged or severe liquidity stress. We do not rely on     immediate sales of assets (other than our Global Core Excess) to     maintain liquidity in a distressed environment, although we     recognize orderly asset sales may be prudent or necessary in a     severe or persistent liquidity crisis.         In order to avoid reliance on asset sales, our goal is to ensure     that we have sufficient total capital (unsecured     long-term     borrowings plus total shareholders equity) to fund our     balance sheet for at least one year. The target amount of our     total capital is based on an internal liquidity model, which     incorporates, among other things, the following     long-term     financing requirements:                         the portion of trading assets that we believe could not be     funded on a secured basis in periods of market stress, assuming     conservative loan values;                    goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, property, leasehold     improvements and equipment, and other illiquid assets;                    derivative and other margin and collateral requirements;                    anticipated draws on our unfunded loan commitments; and                    capital or other forms of financing in our regulated     subsidiaries that are in excess of their     long-term     financing requirements. See      Conservative     Liability Structure below for a further discussion of how     we fund our subsidiaries.          119    Table of Contents         Certain financial instruments may be more difficult to fund on a     secured basis during times of market stress. Accordingly, we     generally hold higher levels of total capital for these assets     than more liquid types of financial instruments. The following     table sets forth our aggregate holdings in these categories of     financial instruments:                                               As of November             2008       2007                 (in millions)          Mortgage and other     asset-backed     loans and securities            $       22,393               $       46,436        (6)          Bank loans and bridge     loans (1)                21,839                   49,154              Emerging market debt securities                2,827                   3,343          High-yield     and other debt obligations                9,998                   12,807              Private equity and real estate fund     investments (2)                18,171                   16,244              Emerging market equity securities                2,665                   8,014              ICBC ordinary     shares (3)                5,496                   6,807              SMFG convertible preferred     stock (4)                1,135                   4,060              Other restricted public equity securities                568                   3,455              Other investments in     funds (5)                2,714                   3,437                        (1)   Includes funded commitments and     inventory held in connection with our origination and secondary     trading activities.           (2)   Includes interests in our merchant     banking funds. Such amounts exclude assets related to     consolidated investment funds of $1.16 billion and     $8.13 billion as of November 2008 and     November 2007, respectively, for which Goldman Sachs does     not bear economic exposure.           (3)   Includes interests of     $3.48 billion and $4.30 billion as of     November 2008 and November 2007, respectively, held by     investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs.           (4)   During our second quarter of 2008,     we converted     one-third of     our SMFG preferred stock investment into SMFG common stock, and     delivered the common stock to close out     one-third of     our hedge position.                     (5)   Includes interests in other     investment funds that we manage.           (6)   Excludes $7.64 billion as of     November 2007 of mortgage whole loans that were transferred     to securitization vehicles where such transfers were accounted     for as secured financings rather than sales under     SFAS No. 140. We distributed to investors the     securities that were issued by the securitization vehicles and     therefore did not bear economic exposure to the underlying     mortgage whole loans.                  A large portion of these assets are funded through secured     funding markets or nonrecourse financing. We focus on funding     these assets on a secured basis with long contractual maturities     to reduce refinancing risk in periods of market stress.         See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for further information regarding the financial instruments we     hold.     Conservative     Liability Structure         We seek to structure our liabilities conservatively to reduce     refinancing risk and the risk that we may be required to redeem     or repurchase certain of our borrowings prior to their     contractual maturity.         We fund a substantial portion of our inventory on a secured     basis, which we believe provides Goldman Sachs with a more     stable source of liquidity than unsecured financing, as it is     less sensitive to changes in our credit due to the underlying     collateral. However, we recognize that the terms or availability     of secured funding, particularly overnight funding, can     deteriorate rapidly in a difficult environment. To help mitigate     this risk, we raise the majority of our funding for durations     longer than overnight. We seek longer terms for secured funding     collateralized by lower-quality assets, as we believe these     funding transactions may pose greater refinancing risk. The     weighted average life of our secured funding, excluding funding     collateralized by highly liquid securities, such as U.S.,     French, German, United Kingdom and Japanese government bonds,     and U.S. agency securities, exceeded 100 days as of     November 2008.        120    Table of Contents       Our liquidity also depends to an important degree on the     stability of our     short-term     unsecured financing base. Accordingly, we prefer the use of     promissory notes (in which Goldman Sachs does not make a market)     over commercial paper, which we may repurchase prior to maturity     through the ordinary course of business as a market maker. As of     November 2008 and November 2007, our unsecured     short-term     borrowings, including the current portion of unsecured     long-term     borrowings, were $52.66 billion and $71.56 billion,     respectively. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial     statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for further information regarding our unsecured     short-term     borrowings.         We issue     long-term     borrowings as a source of total capital in order to meet our     long-term     financing requirements. The following table sets forth our     quarterly unsecured     long-term     borrowings maturity profile through 2014:     Unsecured     Long-Term     Borrowings Maturity Profile         ($ in millions)                 The weighted average maturity of our unsecured     long-term     borrowings as of November 2008 was approximately eight     years. To mitigate refinancing risk, we seek to limit the     principal amount of debt maturing on any one day or during any     week or year. We swap a substantial portion of our     long-term     borrowings into U.S. dollar obligations with     short-term     floating interest rates in order to minimize our exposure to     interest rates and foreign exchange movements.         We issue substantially all of our unsecured debt without     provisions that would, based solely upon an adverse change in     our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or     stock price, trigger a requirement for an early payment,     collateral support, change in terms, acceleration of maturity or     the creation of an additional financial obligation.         As of November 2008, our bank depository institution     subsidiaries had $27.64 billion in customer deposits,     including $19.15 billion of deposits from our bank sweep     programs and $8.49 billion of brokered certificates of     deposit with a weighted average maturity of three years. In     addition, we are pursuing a number of strategies to raise     additional deposits as a source of funding for the firm. As of        121    Table of Contents       September 2008, GS Bank USA has access to funding through     the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. While we do not rely     on funding through the Federal Reserve Bank discount window in     our liquidity modeling and stress testing, we maintain policies     and procedures necessary to access this funding.         We seek to maintain broad and diversified funding sources     globally for both secured and unsecured funding. We make     extensive use of the repurchase agreement and securities lending     markets, as well as other secured funding markets. In addition,     we issue debt through syndicated U.S. registered offerings,     U.S. registered and 144A     medium-term     note programs, offshore     medium-term     note offerings and other bond offerings, U.S. and     non-U.S. commercial     paper and promissory note issuances and other methods. We also     arrange for letters of credit to be issued on our behalf.         We seek to distribute our funding products through our own sales     force to a large, diverse global creditor base and we believe     that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our     liquidity. Our creditors include banks, governments, securities     lenders, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and     individuals. We access funding in a variety of markets in the     Americas, Europe and Asia. We have imposed various internal     guidelines on creditor concentration, including the amount of     our commercial paper and promissory notes that can be owned and     letters of credit that can be issued by any single creditor or     group of creditors.         In the latter half of 2008, we were unable to raise significant     amounts of long-term unsecured debt in the public markets, other     than as a result of the issuance of securities guaranteed by the     FDIC under the TLGP. It is unclear when we will regain access to     the public long-term unsecured debt markets on customary terms     or whether any similar program will be available after the     TLGPs scheduled June 2009 expiration. However, we continue     to have access to short-term funding and to a number of sources     of secured funding, both in the private markets and through     various government and central bank sponsored initiatives.         Over the past year, a number of U.S. regulatory agencies     have taken steps to enhance the liquidity support available to     financial services companies such as Group Inc., GS&Co.,     GSI and GS Bank USA. Some of these steps include:                         The Federal Reserve Bank of New York established the Primary     Dealer Credit Facility in March 2008 to provide overnight     funding to primary dealers in exchange for a specified range of     collateral. In September 2008, the eligible collateral was     expanded to include all collateral eligible in tri-party     repurchase arrangements with the major clearing banks, and the     facility was made available to GSI. This facility is scheduled     to expire on April 30, 2009.                    The Federal Reserve Board introduced a new Term Securities     Lending Facility (TSLF) in March 2008, which extended the     term for which the Federal Reserve Board will lend Treasury     securities to primary dealers from overnight to 28 days     and, in September 2008, expanded the types of assets that     can be used as collateral under the TSLF to include all     investment-grade     debt securities (rather than just Treasury, agency and certain     AAA-rated asset-backed securities). This facility is scheduled     to expire on April 30, 2009.                    In October 2008, the Federal Reserve Board established the     Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) to serve as a funding     backstop to facilitate the issuance of term commercial paper by     eligible issuers. Through the CPFF, the Federal Reserve Bank of     New York will finance the purchase of unsecured and     asset-backed     highly rated,     U.S. dollar-denominated, three-month     commercial paper from eligible issuers through its primary     dealers. The facility is scheduled to expire on     April 30, 2009. Our available funding under the CPFF     is approximately $11 billion, of which a de minimis amount     was utilized as of January 22, 2009.          122    Table of Contents                         The FDICs TLGP, which was established in     October 2008, provides a guarantee of certain newly issued     senior unsecured debt issued by eligible entities, including     Group Inc. and GS Bank USA, as well as funds over $250,000 in     non-interest-bearing     transaction deposit accounts held by FDIC-insured banks (such as     GS Bank USA). The debt guarantee is available, subject to     limitations, for debt issued through June 30, 2009 and     the deposit coverage lasts through December 31, 2009.     We are able to have outstanding approximately $35 billion     of debt under the TLGP that is issued prior to     June 30, 2009. As of November 2008 and     January 22, 2009, we had outstanding $4.18 billion of     senior unsecured     short-term     borrowings and $25.54 billion of senior unsecured debt     (comprised of $11.57 billion of short-term and $13.97 billion of     long-term), respectively, under the TLGP.           See      Certain     Risk Factors That May Affect Our Businesses above, and     Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our     Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for a discussion of factors that could impair our ability to     access the capital markets.     Subsidiary Funding Policies.  Substantially all     of our unsecured funding is raised by our parent company, Group     Inc. The parent company then lends the necessary funds to its     subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their asset     financing and capital requirements. In addition, the parent     company provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary     capital to meet their regulatory requirements. The benefits of     this approach to subsidiary funding include enhanced control and     greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our     subsidiaries. Funding is also raised at the subsidiary level     through secured funding and deposits.         Our intercompany funding policies are predicated on an     assumption that, unless legally provided for, funds or     securities are not freely available from a subsidiary to its     parent company or other subsidiaries. In particular, many of our     subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory     bodies to block or limit the flow of funds from those     subsidiaries to Group Inc. Regulatory action of that kind could     impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on     obligations, including debt obligations. As such, we assume that     capital or other financing provided to our regulated     subsidiaries is not available to our parent company or other     subsidiaries until the maturity of such financing. In addition,     we recognize that the Global Core Excess held in our regulated     entities may not be available to our parent company or other     subsidiaries and therefore may only be available to meet the     potential liquidity requirements of those entities.         We also manage our liquidity risk by requiring senior and     subordinated intercompany loans to have maturities equal to or     shorter than the maturities of the aggregate borrowings of the     parent company. This policy ensures that the subsidiaries     obligations to the parent company will generally mature in     advance of the parent companys     third-party     borrowings. In addition, many of our subsidiaries and affiliates     maintain unencumbered assets to cover their unsecured     intercompany borrowings (other than subordinated debt) in order     to mitigate parent company liquidity risk.         Group Inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and     subordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to its     regulated subsidiaries; for example, as of November 2008,     Group Inc. had $26.01 billion of such equity and     subordinated indebtedness invested in GS&Co., its principal     U.S. registered     broker-dealer;     $22.06 billion invested in GSI, a regulated U.K.     broker-dealer;     $2.48 billion invested in Goldman Sachs     Execution & Clearing, L.P., a U.S. registered     broker-dealer;     $3.79 billion invested in Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd., a     regulated Japanese     broker-dealer;     and $17.32 billion invested in GS Bank USA, a regulated New     York State-chartered bank. Group Inc. also had     $62.81 billion of unsubordinated loans to these entities as     of November 2008, as well as significant amounts of capital     invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries.        123    Table of Contents   Crisis     Planning         In order to be prepared for a liquidity event, or a period of     market stress, we base our liquidity risk management framework     and our resulting funding and liquidity policies on conservative     stress-scenario     assumptions. Our planning incorporates several     market-based     and operational stress scenarios. We also periodically conduct     liquidity crisis drills to test our lines of communication and     backup funding procedures.         In addition, we maintain a liquidity crisis plan that specifies     an approach for analyzing and responding to a     liquidity-threatening event. The plan provides the framework to     estimate the likely impact of a liquidity event on Goldman Sachs     based on some of the risks identified above and outlines which     and to what extent liquidity maintenance activities should be     implemented based on the severity of the event.     Credit     Ratings         We rely upon the     short-term     and     long-term     debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our     day-to-day     operations. The cost and availability of debt financing is     influenced by our credit ratings. Credit ratings are important     when we are competing in certain markets and when we seek to     engage in longer-term transactions, including OTC derivatives.     We believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit     rating agencies assessment of our liquidity, market,     credit and operational risk management practices, the level and     variability of our earnings, our capital base, our franchise,     reputation and management, our corporate governance and the     external operating environment. See      Certain     Risk Factors That May Affect Our Businesses above, and     Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our     Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for a discussion of the risks associated with a reduction in our     credit ratings.         On December 16, 2008, Moodys Investors Service     affirmed Group Inc.s     Short-Term     Debt rating and lowered Group Inc.s ratings on     Long-Term     Debt (from Aa3 to A1), Subordinated Debt (from A1 to A2) and     Preferred Stock (from A2 to A3), and retained its outlook of     negative. Also on December 16, 2008,     Dominion Bond Rating Service Limited affirmed Group Inc.s     credit ratings but revised its outlook from negative     to under review with negative implications. On     December 17, 2008, Rating and Investment Information,     Inc. affirmed Group Inc.s     Short-Term     Debt rating at     a-1+,     lowered Group Inc.s     Long-Term     Debt ratings from AA to AA- and retained its outlook of     negative. On December 19, 2008,     Standard & Poors Ratings Services lowered Group     Inc.s ratings on     Short-Term     Debt (from     A-1+ to     A-1), Long-Term     Debt (from AA- to A), Subordinated Debt (from A+ to A-) and     Preferred Stock (from A to BBB) and retained its outlook of     negative. On January 23, 2009, Dominion Bond     Rating Service Limited lowered Group Inc.s ratings on     Long-Term Debt (from AA (low) to A (high)), Subordinated Debt     (from A (high) to A) and Preferred Stock (from A to     A (low)).         The following table sets forth our unsecured credit ratings as     of January 23, 2009:                                               Short-Term Debt       Long-Term Debt       Subordinated Debt       Preferred Stock          Dominion Bond Rating Service Limited            R-1 (middle)           A (high)           A           A (low)          Fitch, Inc.             F1+           AA-           A+           A+          Moodys Investors Service            P-1           A1           A2           A3          Standard & Poors Ratings Services            A-1           A           A-           BBB          Rating and Investment Information, Inc.             a-1+           AA-           Not Applicable           Not Applicable             124    Table of Contents       Based on our credit ratings as of November 2008, additional     collateral or termination payments pursuant to bilateral     agreements with certain counterparties of approximately     $1.11 billion and $1.51 billion would have been     required in the event of a     one-notch     and     two-notch     reduction, respectively, in our     long-term     credit ratings. Based on our credit ratings reflected in the     above table, additional collateral or termination payments     pursuant to bilateral agreements with certain counterparties of     approximately $897 million and $2.14 billion would     have been required in the event of a one-notch and two-notch     reduction, respectively, in our long-term credit ratings as of     December 26, 2008. In evaluating our liquidity     requirements, we consider additional collateral or termination     payments that would be required in the event of a     two-notch     reduction in our     long-term     credit ratings, as well as collateral that has not been called     by counterparties, but is available to them.     Cash     Flows         As a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex     and interrelated and bear little relation to our net earnings     and net assets and, consequently, we believe that traditional     cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our     liquidity position than the excess liquidity and     asset-liability     management policies described above. Cash flow analysis may,     however, be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and     strategic initiatives in our business.     Year Ended November 2008.  Our cash and     cash equivalents increased by $5.46 billion to     $15.74 billion at the end of 2008. We raised     $9.80 billion in net cash from operating and financing     activities, primarily from common and preferred stock issuances     and deposits, partially offset by repayments of     short-term     borrowings. We used net cash of $4.34 billion in our     investing activities.     Year Ended November 2007.  Our cash and     cash equivalents increased by $4.34 billion to     $10.28 billion at the end of 2007. We raised     $73.79 billion in net cash from financing and investing     activities, primarily through the issuance of unsecured     borrowings, partially offset by common stock repurchases. We     used net cash of $69.45 billion in our operating     activities, primarily to capitalize on trading and investing     opportunities for our clients and ourselves.      Operational     Risk          Operational risk relates to the risk of loss arising from     shortcomings or failures in internal processes, people or     systems, or from external events. Operational risk can arise     from many factors ranging from routine processing errors to     potentially costly incidents related to, for example, major     systems failures. Operational risk may also cause reputational     harm. Thus, efforts to identify, manage and mitigate operational     risk must be equally sensitive to the risk of reputational     damage as well as the risk of financial loss.         We manage operational risk through the application of     long-standing,     but continuously evolving, firmwide control standards which are     supported by the training, supervision and development of our     people; the active participation and commitment of senior     management in a continuous process of identifying and mitigating     key operational risks across Goldman Sachs; and a framework of     strong and independent control departments that monitor     operational risk on a daily basis. Together, these elements form     a strong firmwide control culture that serves as the foundation     of our efforts to minimize operational risk exposure.         Operational Risk Management & Analysis, a risk     management function independent of our revenue-producing units,     is responsible for developing and implementing a formalized     framework to identify, measure, monitor, and report operational     risks to support active risk management across Goldman Sachs.     This framework, which evolves with the changing needs of our     businesses and regulatory guidance, incorporates analysis of     internal and external operational risk events, business     environment and internal control factors, and scenario analysis.     The framework also provides regular reporting of our operational     risk exposures to our Board, risk committees and senior     management. For a further discussion of operational risk see      Certain     Risk Factors That May Affect Our Businesses above, and      Risk     Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report     on     Form 10-K.        125    Table of Contents      Recent Accounting     Developments      EITF Issue     No. 06-11.  In     June 2007, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached     consensus on Issue     No. 06-11,     Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on     Share-Based     Payment Awards. EITF Issue     No. 06-11     requires that the tax benefit related to dividend equivalents     paid on restricted stock units, which are expected to vest, be     recorded as an increase to additional     paid-in     capital. We currently account for this tax benefit as a     reduction to income tax expense. EITF Issue     No. 06-11     is to be applied prospectively for tax benefits on dividends     declared in fiscal years beginning after     December 15, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of     EITF Issue     No. 06-11     to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of     operations or cash flows.     FASB Staff Position No. FAS     140-3.  In     February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP)     No. FAS 140-3,     Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets and     Repurchase Financing Transactions.     FSP No. FAS 140-3     requires an initial transfer of a financial asset and a     repurchase financing that was entered into contemporaneously or     in contemplation of the initial transfer to be evaluated as a     linked transaction under SFAS No. 140 unless certain     criteria are met, including that the transferred asset must be     readily obtainable in the marketplace.     FSP No. FAS 140-3     is effective for fiscal years beginning after     November 15, 2008, and is applicable to new     transactions entered into after the date of adoption. Early     adoption is prohibited. We do not expect adoption of     FSP No. FAS 140-3     to have a material effect on our financial condition and cash     flows. Adoption of     FSP No. FAS 140-3     will have no effect on our results of operations.     SFAS No. 161.  In March 2008,     the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about     Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  an     amendment of FASB Statement No. 133.     SFAS No. 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an     entitys derivative and hedging activities, and is     effective for financial statements issued for reporting periods     beginning after November 15, 2008, with early     application encouraged. Since SFAS No. 161 requires     only additional disclosures concerning derivatives and hedging     activities, adoption of SFAS No. 161 will not affect     our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.     FASB Staff Position No. EITF     03-6-1.  In     June 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. EITF     03-6-1,     Determining Whether Instruments Granted in     Share-Based     Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities. The FSP     addresses whether instruments granted in     share-based     payment transactions are participating securities prior to     vesting and therefore need to be included in the earnings     allocation in calculating earnings per share under the two-class     method described in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per     Share. The FSP requires companies to treat unvested     share-based     payment awards that have     non-forfeitable     rights to dividend or dividend equivalents as a separate class     of securities in calculating earnings per share. The FSP is     effective for fiscal years beginning after     December 15, 2008; earlier application is not     permitted. We do not expect adoption of FSP     No. EITF 03-6-1     to have a material effect on our results of operations or     earnings per share.     FASB Staff Position     No. FAS 133-1     and     FIN 45-4.  In     September 2008, the FASB issued     FSP No. FAS 133-1     and     FIN 45-4,     Disclosures about Credit Derivatives and Certain     Guarantees: An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 and FASB     Interpretation No. 45; and Clarification of the Effective     Date of FASB Statement No. 161.     FSP No. FAS 133-1     and     FIN 45-4     requires enhanced disclosures about credit derivatives and     guarantees and amends FIN 45, Guarantors     Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including     Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others to exclude     credit derivative instruments accounted for at fair value under     SFAS No. 133. The FSP is effective for financial     statements issued for reporting periods ending after     November 15, 2008. Since     FSP No. FAS 133-1     and     FIN 45-4     only requires additional disclosures concerning credit     derivatives and guarantees, adoption of     FSP No. FAS 133-1     and     FIN 45-4     did not have an effect on our financial condition, results of     operations or cash flows.        126    Table of Contents   FASB Staff Position     No. FAS 157-3.  In     October 2008, the FASB issued     FSP No. FAS 157-3,     Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the     Market for That Asset Is Not Active.     FSP No. FAS 157-3     clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 in an     inactive market, without changing its existing principles. The     FSP was effective immediately upon issuance. The adoption of     FSP No. FAS 157-3     did not have an effect on our financial condition, results of     operations or cash flows.     SFAS No. 141(R).  In     December 2007, the FASB issued a revision to     SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations.     SFAS No. 141(R) requires changes to the accounting for     transaction costs, certain contingent assets and liabilities,     and other balances in a business combination. In addition, in     partial acquisitions, when control is obtained, the acquiring     company must measure and record all of the targets assets     and liabilities, including goodwill, at fair value as if the     entire target company had been acquired. We will apply the     provisions of SFAS No. 141(R) to business combinations     occurring after December 26, 2008. Adoption of     SFAS No. 141(R) will not affect our financial     condition, results of operations or cash flows, but may have an     effect on accounting for future business combinations.     SFAS No. 160.  In December 2007,     the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling     Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  an     amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS No. 160     requires that ownership interests in consolidated subsidiaries     held by parties other than the parent (noncontrolling interests)     be accounted for and presented as equity, rather than as a     liability or mezzanine equity. SFAS No. 160 is     effective for fiscal years beginning on or after     December 15, 2008, but the presentation and disclosure     requirements are to be applied retrospectively. We do not expect     adoption of the statement to have a material effect on our     financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.     FASB Staff Position     No. FAS 140-4     and FIN 46(R)-8.  In December 2008, the     FASB issued     FSP No. FAS 140-4     and FIN 46(R)-8, Disclosures by Public Entities     (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests     in Variable Interest Entities.     FSP No. FAS 140-4     and FIN 46(R)-8 requires enhanced disclosures about     transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest     entities. The FSP is effective for interim and annual periods     ending after December 15, 2008. Since the FSP requires     only additional disclosures concerning transfers of financial     assets and interests in variable interest entities, adoption of     the FSP will not affect our financial condition, results of     operations or cash flows.     EITF Issue     No. 07-5.  In     June 2008, the EITF reached consensus on Issue     No. 07-5,     Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is     Indexed to an Entitys Own Stock. EITF Issue     No. 07-5     provides guidance about whether an instrument (such as our     outstanding common stock warrants) should be classified as     equity and not marked to market for accounting purposes. EITF     Issue     No. 07-5     is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,     2008. Adoption of EITF Issue     No. 07-5     will not affect our financial condition, results of operations     or cash flows.      Item 7A.

The firms internal control over     financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision     of the firms principal executive and principal financial     officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the     reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the     firms financial statements for external reporting purposes     in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting     principles.         As of the end of the firms 2008 fiscal year, management     conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the firms     internal control over financial reporting based on the framework     established in Internal Control  Integrated     Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring     Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this     assessment, management has determined that the firms     internal control over financial reporting as of     November 28, 2008 was effective.         Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies     and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that,     in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions     and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that     transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of     financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally     accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and     expenditures are being made only in accordance with     authorizations of management and the directors of the firm; and     provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely     detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the     firms assets that could have a material effect on our     financial statements.         The firms internal control over financial reporting as of     November 28, 2008 has been audited by     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public     accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on     page 130, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the     effectiveness of the firms internal control over financial     reporting as of November 28, 2008.        129    Table of Contents      Report of     Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm          To the Board of Directors and the Shareholders of       The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.:         In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in     the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,     the financial position of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and its     subsidiaries (the Company) at November 28, 2008 and     November 30, 2007, and the results of its operations     and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the     period ended November 28, 2008 in conformity with     accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of     America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all     material respects, effective internal control over financial     reporting as of November 28, 2008, based on criteria     established in Internal Control  Integrated     Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring     Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The     Companys management is responsible for these financial     statements, for maintaining effective internal control over     financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness     of internal control over financial reporting, included in     Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial     Reporting appearing on page 129. Our responsibility is to     express opinions on these financial statements and on the     Companys internal control over financial reporting based     on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance     with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight     Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and     perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether     the financial statements are free of material misstatement and     whether effective internal control over financial reporting was     maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial     statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence     supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial     statements, assessing the accounting principles used and     significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the     overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal     control over financial reporting included obtaining an     understanding of internal control over financial reporting,     assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing     and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of     internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also     included performing such other procedures as we considered     necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits     provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.         As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial     statements, as of the beginning of 2007 the Company adopted     SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements and     SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for     Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.         A companys internal control over financial reporting is a     process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the     reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of     financial statements for external purposes in accordance with     generally accepted accounting principles. A companys     internal control over financial reporting includes those     policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance     of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly     reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the     company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that     transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of     financial statements in accordance with generally accepted     accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the     company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of     management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide     reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of     unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the     companys assets that could have a material effect on the     financial statements.         Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over     financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.     Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future     periods are subject to the risk that controls may become     inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree     of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.         /s/     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP              New York, New York       January 22, 2009        130    Table of Contents   THE

Description     of Business           The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc.), a Delaware     corporation, is a bank holding company and, together with its     consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the firm), a leading     global investment banking, securities and investment management     firm that provides a wide range of services worldwide to a     substantial and diversified client base that includes     corporations, financial institutions, governments and     high-net-worth     individuals.         The firms activities are divided into three segments:                     Investment Banking. The firm provides a broad range     of investment banking services to a diverse group of     corporations, financial institutions, investment funds,     governments and individuals.                Trading and Principal Investments. The firm     facilitates client transactions with a diverse group of     corporations, financial institutions, investment funds,     governments and individuals and takes proprietary positions     through market making in, trading of and investing in fixed     income and equity products, currencies, commodities and     derivatives on these products. In addition, the firm engages in     market-making and specialist activities on equities and options     exchanges, and the firm clears client transactions on major     stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide. In connection     with the firms merchant banking and other investing     activities, the firm makes principal investments directly and     through funds that the firm raises and manages.                Asset Management and Securities Services. The firm     provides investment advisory and financial planning services and     offers investment products (primarily through separately managed     accounts and commingled vehicles, such as mutual funds and     private investment funds) across all major asset classes to a     diverse group of institutions and individuals worldwide and     provides prime brokerage services, financing services and     securities lending services to institutional clients, including     hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds and foundations, and to     high-net-worth     individuals worldwide.             Note 2.     Significant     Accounting Policies       Basis of     Presentation         These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of     Group Inc. and all other entities in which the firm has a     controlling financial interest. All material intercompany     transactions and balances have been eliminated.         The firm determines whether it has a controlling financial     interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is     a voting interest entity, a variable interest entity (VIE) or a     qualifying     special-purpose     entity (QSPE) under generally accepted accounting principles.                     Voting Interest Entities. Voting interest entities     are entities in which (i) the total equity investment at     risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its     activities independently and (ii) the equity holders have     the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual     returns and the right to make decisions about the entitys     activities. Voting interest entities are consolidated in     accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,     Consolidated Financial Statements, as amended. The     usual condition for a controlling financial interest in an     entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. Accordingly,     the firm consolidates voting interest entities in which it has a     majority voting interest.                Variable Interest Entities. VIEs are entities that     lack one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest     entity. A controlling financial interest in a VIE is present     when an enterprise has a variable interest, or a combination of     variable interests, that will absorb a majority of the     VIEs expected losses, receive a majority of the VIEs     expected residual returns, or both. The          136    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                    enterprise with a controlling financial interest, known as the     primary beneficiary, consolidates the VIE. In accordance with     Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation     (FIN) 46-R,     Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, the     firm consolidates VIEs for which it is the primary beneficiary.     The firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a     VIE by first performing a qualitative analysis of the VIEs     expected losses and expected residual returns. This analysis     includes a review of, among other factors, the VIEs     capital structure, contractual terms, which interests create or     absorb variability, related party relationships and the design     of the VIE. Where qualitative analysis is not conclusive, the     firm performs a quantitative analysis. For purposes of     allocating a VIEs expected losses and expected residual     returns to its variable interest holders, the firm utilizes the     top down method. Under that method, the firm     calculates its share of the VIEs expected losses and     expected residual returns using the specific cash flows that     would be allocated to it, based on contractual arrangements     and/or the     firms position in the capital structure of the VIE, under     various probability-weighted scenarios. The firm reassesses its     initial evaluation of an entity as a VIE and its initial     determination of whether the firm is the primary beneficiary of     a VIE upon the occurrence of certain reconsideration events as     defined in     FIN 46-R.                       QSPEs. QSPEs are passive entities that are commonly     used in mortgage and other securitization transactions.     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140,     Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets     and Extinguishments of Liabilities, sets forth the     criteria an entity must satisfy to be a QSPE. These criteria     include the types of assets a QSPE may hold, limits on asset     sales, the use of derivatives and financial guarantees, and the     level of discretion a servicer may exercise in attempting to     collect receivables. These criteria may require management to     make judgments about complex matters, such as whether a     derivative is considered passive and the level of discretion a     servicer may exercise, including, for example, determining when     default is reasonably foreseeable. In accordance with     SFAS No. 140 and     FIN 46-R,     the firm does not consolidate QSPEs.                Equity-Method     Investments. When the firm does not have a controlling     financial interest in an entity but exerts significant influence     over the entitys operating and financial policies     (generally defined as owning a voting interest of 20% to 50%)     and has an investment in common stock or     in-substance     common stock, the firm accounts for its investment either in     accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB)     No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for     Investments in Common Stock or at fair value in accordance     with SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for     Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. In general,     the firm accounts for investments acquired subsequent to the     adoption of SFAS No. 159 at fair value. In certain cases,     the firm may apply the equity method of accounting to new     investments that are strategic in nature or closely related to     the firms principal business activities, where the firm     has a significant degree of involvement in the cash flows or     operations of the investee, or where     cost-benefit     considerations are less significant. See      Revenue     Recognition  Other Financial Assets and Financial     Liabilities at Fair Value below for a discussion of the     firms application of SFAS No. 159.                Other. If the firm does not consolidate an entity or     apply the equity method of accounting, the firm accounts for its     investment at fair value. The firm also has formed numerous     nonconsolidated investment funds with     third-party     investors that are typically organized as limited partnerships.     The firm acts as general partner for these funds and generally     does not hold a majority of the economic interests in these     funds. The firm has generally provided the     third-party     investors with rights to terminate the funds or to remove the     firm as the general partner. As a result, the firm does not     consolidate these funds. These fund investments are included in     Trading assets, at fair value in the consolidated     statements of financial condition.          137    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)           Unless otherwise stated herein, all references to 2008, 2007 and     2006 refer to the firms fiscal years ended, or the dates,     as the context requires, November 28, 2008,     November 30, 2007 and November 24, 2006,     respectively. Certain reclassifications have been made to     previously reported amounts to conform to the current     presentation.     Use of     Estimates         These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in     accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that     require management to make certain estimates and assumptions.     The most important of these estimates and assumptions relate to     fair value measurements, the accounting for goodwill and     identifiable intangible assets and the provision for potential     losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings     and tax audits. Although these and other estimates and     assumptions are based on the best available information, actual     results could be materially different from these estimates.     Revenue     Recognition     Investment Banking. Underwriting revenues and fees     from mergers and acquisitions and other financial advisory     assignments are recognized in the consolidated statements of     earnings when the services related to the underlying transaction     are completed under the terms of the engagement. Expenses     associated with such transactions are deferred until the related     revenue is recognized or the engagement is otherwise concluded.     Underwriting revenues are presented net of related expenses.     Expenses associated with financial advisory transactions are     recorded as     non-compensation     expenses, net of client reimbursements.     Trading Assets and Trading     Liabilities. Substantially all trading assets and     trading liabilities are reflected in the consolidated statements     of financial condition at fair value, pursuant principally to:                         SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments     in Debt and Equity Securities;                    specialized industry accounting for     broker-dealers     and investment companies;                    SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative     Instruments and Hedging Activities; or                    the fair value option under either SFAS No. 155,     Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial     Instruments  an amendment of FASB Statements     No. 133 and 140, or SFAS No. 159, The     Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial     Liabilities, (i.e., the fair value option).           Related unrealized gains or losses are generally recognized in     Trading and principal investments in the     consolidated statements of earnings.         Upon becoming a bank holding company in September 2008, the     firm could no longer apply specialized     broker-dealer     industry accounting to those subsidiaries not regulated as     broker-dealers.     Therefore, within the firms     non-broker-dealer     subsidiaries, the firm designated as held for trading those     instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 115 (i.e.,     debt securities and marketable equity securities), and elected     the fair value option for other cash instruments (specifically     loans, loan commitments and certain private equity and     restricted public equity securities) which the firm historically     had carried at fair value. These fair value elections were in     addition to previous elections made for certain corporate loans,     loan commitments and certificates of deposit issued by Goldman     Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank USA). There was no impact on earnings     from these initial elections because all of these instruments     were already recorded at fair value in Trading assets, at     fair value or Trading liabilities, at fair     value in the consolidated statements of financial     condition prior to Group Inc. becoming a bank holding company.        138    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)       Other Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities at Fair     Value. In addition to Trading assets, at fair     value and Trading liabilities, at fair value,     the firm has elected to account for certain of its other     financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value under     the fair value option. The primary reasons for electing the fair     value option are to reflect economic events in earnings on a     timely basis, to mitigate volatility in earnings from using     different measurement attributes and to address simplification     and     cost-benefit     considerations.         Such financial assets and financial liabilities accounted for at     fair value include:                         certain unsecured     short-term     borrowings, consisting of all promissory notes and commercial     paper and certain hybrid financial instruments;                    certain other secured financings, primarily transfers accounted     for as financings rather than sales under     SFAS No. 140, debt raised through the firms     William Street program and certain other nonrecourse financings;                    certain unsecured     long-term     borrowings, including prepaid physical commodity transactions;                    resale and repurchase agreements;                    securities borrowed and loaned within Trading and Principal     Investments, consisting of the firms matched book and     certain firm financing activities;                    certain corporate loans, loan commitments and certificates of     deposit issued by GS Bank USA as well as securities held by GS     Bank USA;                    receivables from customers and counterparties arising from     transfers accounted for as secured loans rather than purchases     under SFAS No. 140;                    certain insurance and reinsurance contracts; and                    in general, investments acquired after the adoption of     SFAS No. 159 where the firm has significant influence     over the investee and would otherwise apply the equity method of     accounting.       Fair Value Measurements. The fair value of a     financial instrument is the amount that would be received to     sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly     transaction between market participants at the measurement date     (the exit price). Financial assets are marked to bid prices and     financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value     measurements do not include transaction costs.         The firm adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value     Measurements, as of the beginning of 2007.     SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that     prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure     fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to     unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets     or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest     priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The     three levels of the fair value hierarchy under     SFAS No. 157 are described below:     Basis of Fair Value     Measurement                      Level 1            Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible     at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or     liabilities;            Level 2            Quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or     financial instruments for which all significant inputs are     observable, either directly or indirectly;            Level 3            Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both     significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.          139    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         A financial instruments level within the fair value     hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is     significant to the fair value measurement.         The firm defines active markets for equity instruments based on     the average daily trading volume both in absolute terms and     relative to the market capitalization for the instrument. The     firm defines active markets for debt instruments based on both     the average daily trading volume and the number of days with     trading activity.         During the fourth quarter of 2008, both the FASB and the staff     of the SEC re-emphasized the importance of sound fair value     measurement in financial reporting. In October 2008, the     FASB issued FASB Staff Position     No. FAS 157-3,     Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the     Market for That Asset is Not Active. This statement     clarifies that determining fair value in an inactive or     dislocated market depends on facts and circumstances and     requires significant management judgment. This statement     specifies that it is acceptable to use inputs based on     management estimates or assumptions, or for management to make     adjustments to observable inputs to determine fair value when     markets are not active and relevant observable inputs are not     available. The firms fair value measurement policies are     consistent with the guidance in     FSP No. FAS 157-3.         Credit risk is an essential component of fair value. Cash     products (e.g., bonds and loans) and derivative instruments     (particularly those with significant future projected cash     flows) trade in the market at levels which reflect credit     considerations. The firm calculates the fair value of derivative     assets by discounting future cash flows at a rate which     incorporates counterparty credit spreads and the fair value of     derivative liabilities by discounting future cash flows at a     rate which incorporates the firms own credit spreads. In     doing so, credit exposures are adjusted to reflect mitigants,     namely collateral agreements which reduce exposures based on     triggers and contractual posting requirements. The firm manages     its exposure to credit risk as it does other market risks and     will price, economically hedge, facilitate and intermediate     trades which involve credit risk. The firm records liquidity     valuation adjustments to reflect the cost of exiting     concentrated risk positions, including exposure to the     firms own credit spreads.         In determining fair value, the firm separates its Trading     assets, at fair value and its Trading liabilities,     at fair value into two categories: cash instruments and     derivative contracts.                     Cash Instruments. The firms cash instruments     are generally classified within level 1 or level 2 of     the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted     market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative     pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.     The types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in     active markets include most U.S. government and sovereign     obligations, active listed equities and certain money market     securities. Such instruments are generally classified within     level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. In accordance with     SFAS No. 157, the firm does not adjust the quoted     price for such instruments, even in situations where the firm     holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the     quoted price.           The types of instruments that trade in markets that are not     considered to be active, but are valued based on quoted market     prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing     sources with reasonable levels of price transparency include     most government agency securities,     investment-grade     corporate bonds, certain mortgage products, certain bank loans     and bridge loans, less liquid listed equities, state, municipal     and provincial obligations and certain money market securities     and loan commitments. Such instruments are generally classified     within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.         Certain cash instruments are classified within level 3 of     the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and     therefore have little or no price transparency. Such instruments     include private equity and real estate fund investments, certain     bank loans and bridge loans (including        140    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         certain mezzanine financing, leveraged loans arising from     capital market transactions and other corporate bank debt), less     liquid corporate debt securities and other debt obligations     (including less liquid     high-yield     corporate bonds, distressed debt instruments and collateralized     debt obligations (CDOs) backed by corporate obligations), less     liquid mortgage whole loans and securities (backed by either     commercial or residential real estate), and acquired portfolios     of distressed loans. The transaction price is initially used as     the best estimate of fair value. Accordingly, when a pricing     model is used to value such an instrument, the model is adjusted     so that the model value at inception equals the transaction     price. This valuation is adjusted only when changes to inputs     and assumptions are corroborated by evidence such as     transactions in similar instruments, completed or pending     third-party     transactions in the underlying investment or comparable     entities, subsequent rounds of financing, recapitalizations and     other transactions across the capital structure, offerings in     the equity or debt capital markets, and changes in financial     ratios or cash flows.         For positions that are not traded in active markets or are     subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to     reflect illiquidity     and/or non-transferability.     Such adjustments are generally based on available market     evidence. In the absence of such evidence, managements     best estimate is used.         Recent market conditions, particularly in the fourth quarter of     2008 (characterized by dislocations between asset classes,     elevated levels of volatility, and reduced price transparency),     have increased the level of management judgment required to     value cash trading instruments classified within level 3 of     the fair value hierarchy. In particular, managements     judgment is required to determine the appropriate     risk-adjusted     discount rate for cash trading instruments with little or no     price transparency as a result of decreased volumes and lower     levels of trading activity. In such situations, the firms     valuation is adjusted to approximate rates which market     participants would likely consider appropriate for relevant     credit and liquidity risks.                     Derivative Contracts. Derivative contracts can be     exchange-traded     or     over-the-counter     (OTC).     Exchange-traded     derivatives typically fall within level 1 or level 2     of the fair value hierarchy depending on whether they are deemed     to be actively traded or not. The firm generally values     exchange-traded     derivatives using models which calibrate to     market-clearing     levels and eliminate timing differences between the closing     price of the     exchange-traded     derivatives and their underlying instruments. In such cases,     exchange-traded     derivatives are classified within level 2 of the fair value     hierarchy.           OTC derivatives are valued using market transactions and other     market evidence whenever possible, including     market-based     inputs to models, model calibration to     market-clearing     transactions, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative     pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.     Where models are used, the selection of a particular model to     value an OTC derivative depends upon the contractual terms of,     and specific risks inherent in, the instrument as well as the     availability of pricing information in the market. The firm     generally uses similar models to value similar instruments.     Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including     contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, credit curves,     measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of     such inputs. For OTC derivatives that trade in liquid markets,     such as generic forwards, swaps and options, model inputs can     generally be verified and model selection does not involve     significant management judgment. OTC derivatives are classified     within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy when all of the     significant inputs can be corroborated to market evidence.         Certain OTC derivatives trade in less liquid markets with     limited pricing information, and the determination of fair value     for these derivatives is inherently more difficult. Such     instruments        141    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.     Where the firm does not have corroborating market evidence to     support significant model inputs and cannot verify the model to     market transactions, the transaction price is initially used as     the best estimate of fair value. Accordingly, when a pricing     model is used to value such an instrument, the model is adjusted     so that the model value at inception equals the transaction     price. The valuations of these less liquid OTC derivatives are     typically based on level 1     and/or     level 2 inputs that can be observed in the market, as well     as unobservable level 3 inputs. Subsequent to initial     recognition, the firm updates the level 1 and level 2     inputs to reflect observable market changes, with resulting     gains and losses reflected within level 3. Level 3     inputs are only changed when corroborated by evidence such as     similar market transactions,     third-party     pricing services     and/or     broker or dealer quotations, or other empirical market data. In     circumstances where the firm cannot verify the model value to     market transactions, it is possible that a different valuation     model could produce a materially different estimate of fair     value.         When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors     such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads and credit considerations.     Such adjustments are generally based on available market     evidence. In the absence of such evidence, managements     best estimate is used.     Collateralized Agreements and     Financings. Collateralized agreements consist of resale     agreements and securities borrowed. Collateralized financings     consist of repurchase agreements, securities loaned and other     secured financings. Interest on collateralized agreements and     collateralized financings is recognized in Interest     income and Interest expense, respectively,     over the life of the transaction.                     Resale and Repurchase Agreements. Securities     purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under     agreements to repurchase, principally U.S. government,     federal agency and     investment-grade     sovereign obligations, represent collateralized financing     transactions. The firm receives securities purchased under     agreements to resell, makes delivery of securities sold under     agreements to repurchase, monitors the market value of these     securities on a daily basis and delivers or obtains additional     collateral as appropriate. As noted above, resale and repurchase     agreements are carried in the consolidated statements of     financial condition at fair value under SFAS No. 159.     Resale and repurchase agreements are generally valued based on     inputs with reasonable levels of price transparency and are     classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.     Resale and repurchase agreements are presented on a     net-by-counterparty     basis when the requirements of FIN 41, Offsetting of     Amounts Related to Certain Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase     Agreements, or FIN 39, Offsetting of Amounts     Related to Certain Contracts, are satisfied.                Securities Borrowed and Loaned. Securities borrowed     and loaned are generally collateralized by cash, securities or     letters of credit. The firm receives securities borrowed, makes     delivery of securities loaned, monitors the market value of     securities borrowed and loaned, and delivers or obtains     additional collateral as appropriate. Securities borrowed and     loaned within Securities Services, relating to both customer     activities and, to a lesser extent, certain firm financing     activities, are recorded based on the amount of cash collateral     advanced or received plus accrued interest. As these     arrangements generally can be terminated on demand, they exhibit     little, if any, sensitivity to changes in interest rates. As     noted above, securities borrowed and loaned within Trading and     Principal Investments, which are related to the firms     matched book and certain firm financing activities, are recorded     at fair value under SFAS No. 159. These securities     borrowed and loaned transactions are generally valued based on     inputs with reasonable levels of price transparency and are     classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.          142    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                       Other Secured Financings. In addition to repurchase     agreements and securities loaned, the firm funds assets through     the use of other secured financing arrangements and pledges     financial instruments and other assets as collateral in these     transactions. As noted above, the firm has elected to apply     SFAS No. 159 to transfers accounted for as financings     rather than sales under SFAS No. 140, debt raised     through the firms William Street program and certain other     nonrecourse financings, for which the use of fair value     eliminates     non-economic     volatility in earnings that would arise from using different     measurement attributes. These other secured financing     transactions are generally valued based on inputs with     reasonable levels of price transparency and are generally     classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.     Other secured financings that are not recorded at fair value are     recorded based on the amount of cash received plus accrued     interest. See Note 3 for further information regarding     other secured financings.       Hybrid Financial Instruments. Hybrid financial     instruments are instruments that contain bifurcatable embedded     derivatives under SFAS No. 133 and do not require     settlement by physical delivery of     non-financial     assets (e.g., physical commodities). If the firm elects to     bifurcate the embedded derivative, it is accounted for at fair     value and the host contract is accounted for at amortized cost,     adjusted for the effective portion of any fair value hedge     accounting relationships. If the firm does not elect to     bifurcate, the entire hybrid financial instrument is accounted     for at fair value under SFAS No. 155. See Notes 3     and 6 for further information regarding hybrid financial     instruments.     Transfers of Financial Assets. In general, transfers     of financial assets are accounted for as sales under     SFAS No. 140 when the firm has relinquished control     over the transferred assets. For transfers accounted for as     sales, any related gains or losses are recognized in net     revenues. Transfers that are not accounted for as sales are     accounted for as collateralized financings, with the related     interest expense recognized in net revenues over the life of the     transaction.     Commissions. Commission revenues from executing and     clearing client transactions on stock, options and futures     markets are recognized in Trading and principal     investments in the consolidated statements of earnings on     a trade-date     basis.     Insurance Activities. Certain of the firms     insurance and reinsurance contracts are accounted for at fair     value under SFAS No. 159, with changes in fair value     included in Trading and principal investments in the     consolidated statements of earnings.         Revenues from variable annuity and life insurance and     reinsurance contracts not accounted for at fair value under     SFAS No. 159 generally consist of fees assessed on     contract holder account balances for mortality charges, policy     administration fees and surrender charges, and are recognized     within Trading and principal investments in the     consolidated statements of earnings in the period that services     are provided.         Interest credited to variable annuity and life insurance and     reinsurance contracts account balances and changes in reserves     are recognized in Other expenses in the consolidated     statements of earnings.         Premiums earned for underwriting property catastrophe     reinsurance are recognized within Trading and principal     investments in the consolidated statements of earnings     over the coverage period, net of premiums ceded for the cost of     reinsurance. Expenses for liabilities related to property     catastrophe reinsurance claims, including estimates of losses     that have been incurred but not reported, are recognized within     Other expenses in the consolidated statements of     earnings.     Merchant Banking Overrides. The firm is entitled to     receive merchant banking overrides (i.e., an increased     share of a funds income and gains) when the return on the     funds investments        143    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         exceeds certain threshold returns. Overrides are based on     investment performance over the life of each merchant banking     fund, and future investment underperformance may require amounts     of override previously distributed to the firm to be returned to     the funds. Accordingly, overrides are recognized in the     consolidated statements of earnings only when all material     contingencies have been resolved. Overrides are included in     Trading and principal investments in the     consolidated statements of earnings.     Asset Management. Management fees are recognized     over the period that the related service is provided based upon     average net asset values. In certain circumstances, the firm is     also entitled to receive incentive fees based on a percentage of     a funds return or when the return on assets under     management exceeds specified benchmark returns or other     performance targets. Incentive fees are generally based on     investment performance over a     12-month     period and are subject to adjustment prior to the end of the     measurement period. Accordingly, incentive fees are recognized     in the consolidated statements of earnings when the measurement     period ends. Asset management fees and incentive fees are     included in Asset management and securities services     in the consolidated statements of earnings.     Share-Based     Compensation         The firm accounts for     share-based     compensation in accordance with     SFAS No. 123-R, Share-Based     Payment. The cost of employee services received in     exchange for a     share-based     award is generally measured based on the grant-date fair value     of the award.     Share-based     awards that do not require future service (i.e., vested     awards, including awards granted to retirement-eligible     employees) are expensed immediately.     Share-based     employee awards that require future service are amortized over     the relevant service period. Expected forfeitures are included     in determining     share-based     employee compensation expense. In the first quarter of 2006, the     firm adopted     SFAS No. 123-R     under the modified prospective adoption method. Under that     method of adoption, the provisions of     SFAS No. 123-R     are generally applied only to     share-based     awards granted subsequent to adoption.     Share-based     awards held by employees that were retirement-eligible on the     date of adoption of     SFAS No. 123-R     must continue to be amortized over the stated service period of     the award (and accelerated if the employee actually retires).         The firm pays cash dividend equivalents on outstanding     restricted stock units. Dividend equivalents paid on restricted     stock units are generally charged to retained earnings. Dividend     equivalents paid on restricted stock units expected to be     forfeited are included in compensation expense. The tax benefit     related to dividend equivalents paid on restricted stock units     is accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense. See      Recent     Accounting Developments for a discussion of Emerging     Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue     No. 06-11,     Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on     Share-Based     Payment Awards.         In certain cases, primarily related to the death of an employee     or conflicted employment (as outlined in the applicable award     agreements), the firm may cash settle     share-based     compensation awards. For awards accounted for as equity     instruments, Additional     paid-in     capital is adjusted to the extent of the difference     between the current value of the award and the grant-date value     of the award.     Goodwill         Goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair     value of identifiable net assets at acquisition date. In     accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other     Intangible Assets, goodwill is tested at least annually     for impairment. An impairment loss is recognized if the     estimated fair value of an operating segment, which is a     component one level below the firms three business     segments, is        144    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         less than its estimated net book value. Such loss is calculated     as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill     and its carrying value.     Identifiable     Intangible Assets         Identifiable intangible assets, which consist primarily of     customer lists, Designated Market Maker (DMM) rights and     the value of business acquired (VOBA) and deferred acquisition     costs (DAC) in the firms insurance subsidiaries, are     amortized over their estimated lives in accordance with     SFAS No. 142 or, in the case of insurance contracts,     in accordance with SFAS No. 60, Accounting and     Reporting by Insurance Enterprises, and     SFAS No. 97, Accounting and Reporting by     Insurance Enterprises for Certain     Long-Duration     Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of     Investments. Identifiable intangible assets are tested for     impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest     that an assets or asset groups carrying value may     not be fully recoverable in accordance with     SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or     Disposal of     Long-Lived     Assets, or SFAS No. 60 and     SFAS No. 97. An impairment loss, generally calculated     as the difference between the estimated fair value and the     carrying value of an asset or asset group, is recognized if the     sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the     asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying     value.     Property,     Leasehold Improvements and Equipment         Property, leasehold improvements and equipment, net of     accumulated depreciation and amortization, are recorded at cost     and included in Other assets in the consolidated     statements of financial condition.         Substantially all property and equipment are depreciated on a     straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset. Leasehold     improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the     useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease,     whichever is shorter. Certain costs of software developed or     obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a     straight-line basis over the useful life of the software.         Property, leasehold improvements and equipment are tested for     impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest     that an assets or asset groups carrying value may     not be fully recoverable in accordance with     SFAS No. 144. An impairment loss, calculated as the     difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying     value of an asset or asset group, is recognized if the sum of     the expected undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or     asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value.         The firms operating leases include office space held in     excess of current requirements. Rent expense relating to space     held for growth is included in Occupancy in the     consolidated statements of earnings. In accordance with     SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated     with Exit or Disposal Activities, the firm records a     liability, based on the fair value of the remaining lease     rentals reduced by any potential or existing sublease rentals,     for leases where the firm has ceased using the space and     management has concluded that the firm will not derive any     future economic benefits. Costs to terminate a lease before the     end of its term are recognized and measured at fair value upon     termination.     Foreign     Currency Translation         Assets and liabilities denominated in     non-U.S. currencies     are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the date of     the consolidated statement of financial condition, and revenues     and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange for the     period. Gains or losses on translation of the financial     statements of a     non-U.S. operation,     when the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar,     are included, net of hedges and taxes, in the consolidated     statements of comprehensive        145    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         income. The firm seeks to reduce its net investment exposure to     fluctuations in foreign exchange rates through the use of     foreign currency forward contracts and foreign     currency-denominated     debt. For foreign currency forward contracts, hedge     effectiveness is assessed based on changes in forward exchange     rates; accordingly, forward points are reflected as a component     of the currency translation adjustment in the consolidated     statements of comprehensive income. For foreign     currency-denominated debt, hedge effectiveness is assessed based     on changes in spot rates. Foreign currency remeasurement gains     or losses on transactions in nonfunctional currencies are     included in the consolidated statements of earnings.     Income     Taxes         Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary     differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of the     firms assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are     established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that     more likely than not will be realized. The firms tax     assets and liabilities are presented as a component of     Other assets and Other liabilities and accrued     expenses, respectively, in the consolidated statements of     financial condition. Tax provisions are computed in accordance     with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income     Taxes.         The firm adopted the provisions of FIN 48, Accounting     for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an Interpretation of     FASB Statement No. 109, as of     December 1, 2007, and recorded a transition adjustment     resulting in a reduction of $201 million to beginning     retained earnings. See Note 16 for further information     regarding the firms adoption of FIN 48. A tax     position can be recognized in the financial statements only when     it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained     upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the     technical merits of the position. A position that meets this     standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will     more likely than not be realized upon settlement. A liability is     established for differences between positions taken in a tax     return and amounts recognized in the financial statements.     FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,     classification, interim period accounting and accounting for     interest and penalties. Prior to the adoption of FIN 48,     contingent liabilities related to income taxes were recorded     when the criteria for loss recognition under     SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies,     as amended, had been met.     Earnings Per     Common Share (EPS)         Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net earnings applicable to     common shareholders by the weighted average number of common     shares outstanding. Common shares outstanding includes common     stock and restricted stock units for which no future service is     required as a condition to the delivery of the underlying common     stock. Diluted EPS includes the determinants of basic EPS and,     in addition, reflects the dilutive effect of the common stock     deliverable pursuant to stock warrants and options and to     restricted stock units for which future service is required as a     condition to the delivery of the underlying common stock.     Cash and Cash     Equivalents         The firm defines cash equivalents as highly liquid overnight     deposits held in the ordinary course of business. As of     November 2008, Cash and cash equivalents on the     consolidated statements of financial condition included     $5.60 billion of cash and due from banks and     $10.14 billion of interest-bearing deposits with banks. As     of November 2007, Cash and cash equivalents on     the consolidated statements of financial condition included     $4.29 billion of cash and due from banks and     $5.99 billion of interest-bearing deposits with banks.        146    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     Recent     Accounting Developments     EITF Issue     No. 06-11. In     June 2007, the EITF reached consensus on Issue     No. 06-11,     Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on     Share-Based     Payment Awards. EITF Issue     No. 06-11     requires that the tax benefit related to dividend equivalents     paid on restricted stock units, which are expected to vest, be     recorded as an increase to additional     paid-in     capital. The firm currently accounts for this tax benefit as a     reduction to income tax expense. EITF Issue     No. 06-11     is to be applied prospectively for tax benefits on dividends     declared in fiscal years beginning after     December 15, 2007. The firm does not expect the     adoption of EITF Issue     No. 06-11     to have a material effect on its financial condition, results of     operations or cash flows.     FASB Staff Position     No. FAS 140-3. In     February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP)     No. FAS 140-3,     Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets and     Repurchase Financing Transactions.     FSP No. FAS 140-3     requires an initial transfer of a financial asset and a     repurchase financing that was entered into contemporaneously or     in contemplation of the initial transfer to be evaluated as a     linked transaction under SFAS No. 140 unless certain     criteria are met, including that the transferred asset must be     readily obtainable in the marketplace.     FSP No. FAS 140-3     is effective for fiscal years beginning after     November 15, 2008, and is applicable to new     transactions entered into after the date of adoption. Early     adoption is prohibited. The firm does not expect adoption of     FSP No. FAS 140-3     to have a material effect on its financial condition and cash     flows. Adoption of     FSP No. FAS 140-3     will have no effect on the firms results of operations.     SFAS No. 161. In March 2008, the FASB     issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about     Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  an     amendment of FASB Statement No. 133.     SFAS No. 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an     entitys derivative and hedging activities, and is     effective for financial statements issued for reporting periods     beginning after November 15, 2008, with early     application encouraged. Since SFAS No. 161 requires     only additional disclosures concerning derivatives and hedging     activities, adoption of SFAS No. 161 will not affect     the firms financial condition, results of operations or     cash flows.     FASB Staff Position     No. EITF 03-6-1. In     June 2008, the FASB issued FSP No.     EITF 03-6-1,     Determining Whether Instruments Granted in     Share-Based     Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities. The FSP     addresses whether instruments granted in     share-based     payment transactions are participating securities prior to     vesting and therefore need to be included in the earnings     allocation in calculating earnings per share under the two-class     method described in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per     Share. The FSP requires companies to treat unvested     share-based     payment awards that have     non-forfeitable     rights to dividend or dividend equivalents as a separate class     of securities in calculating earnings per share. The FSP is     effective for fiscal years beginning after     December 15, 2008; earlier application is not     permitted. The firm does not expect adoption of FSP No.     EITF 03-6-1     to have a material effect on its results of operations or     earnings per share.     FASB Staff Position     No. FAS 133-1     and     FIN 45-4. In     September 2008, the FASB issued     FSP No. FAS 133-1     and     FIN 45-4,     Disclosures about Credit Derivatives and Certain     Guarantees: An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 and FASB     Interpretation No. 45; and Clarification of the Effective     Date of FASB Statement No. 161.     FSP No. FAS 133-1     and     FIN 45-4     requires enhanced disclosures about credit derivatives and     guarantees and amends FIN 45, Guarantors     Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including     Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others to exclude     credit derivative instruments accounted for at fair value under     SFAS No. 133. The FSP is effective for financial     statements issued for reporting periods ending after     November 15, 2008. Since     FSP No. FAS 133-1     and     FIN 45-4     only requires additional disclosures concerning credit     derivatives and guarantees, adoption of     FSP No. FAS 133-1     and     FIN 45-4     did not have an effect on the firms financial condition,     results of operations or cash flows.        147    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     FASB Staff Position     No. FAS 157-3. In     October 2008, the FASB issued     FSP No. FAS 157-3,     Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the     Market for That Asset Is Not Active.     FSP No. FAS 157-3     clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 in an     inactive market, without changing its existing principles. The     FSP was effective immediately upon issuance. The adoption of     FSP No. FAS 157-3     did not have an effect on the firms financial condition,     results of operations or cash flows.     SFAS No. 141(R). In December 2007,     the FASB issued a revision to SFAS No. 141,     Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141(R)     requires changes to the accounting for transaction costs,     certain contingent assets and liabilities, and other balances in     a business combination. In addition, in partial acquisitions,     when control is obtained, the acquiring company must measure and     record all of the targets assets and liabilities,     including goodwill, at fair value as if the entire target     company had been acquired. The firm will apply the provisions of     SFAS No. 141(R) to business combinations occurring     after December 26, 2008. Adoption of     SFAS No. 141(R) will not affect the firms     financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, but     may have an effect on accounting for future business     combinations.     SFAS No. 160. In December 2007, the     FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling     Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  an     amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS No. 160     requires that ownership interests in consolidated subsidiaries     held by parties other than the parent (noncontrolling interests)     be accounted for and presented as equity, rather than as a     liability or mezzanine equity. SFAS No. 160 is     effective for fiscal years beginning on or after     December 15, 2008, but the presentation and disclosure     requirements are to be applied retrospectively. The firm does     not expect adoption of the statement to have a material effect     on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.     FASB Staff Position     No. FAS 140-4     and FIN 46(R)-8. In December 2008, the FASB     issued     FSP No. FAS 140-4     and FIN 46(R)-8, Disclosures by Public Entities     (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests     in Variable Interest Entities.     FSP No. FAS 140-4     and FIN 46(R)-8 requires enhanced disclosures about     transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest     entities. The FSP is effective for interim and annual periods     ending after December 15, 2008. Since the FSP requires     only additional disclosures concerning transfers of financial     assets and interests in variable interest entities, adoption of     the FSP will not affect the firms financial condition,     results of operations or cash flows.     EITF Issue     No. 07-5. In     June 2008, the EITF reached consensus on Issue     No. 07-5,     Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is     Indexed to an Entitys Own Stock. EITF Issue     No. 07-5     provides guidance about whether an instrument (such as the     firms outstanding common stock warrants) should be     classified as equity and not marked to market for accounting     purposes. EITF Issue     No. 07-5     is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,     2008. Adoption of EITF Issue     No. 07-5     will not affect the firms financial condition, results of     operations or cash flows.        148    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)           Note 3.

Losses     during the year reflected the significant weakness in the global     credit and equity markets.         Level 3 cash instruments are frequently economically hedged     with instruments classified within level 1 and     level 2, and accordingly, gains or losses that have been     reported in level 3 can be offset by gains or losses     attributable to instruments classified within level 1 or     level 2 or by gains or losses on derivative contracts classified     in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.     Derivative     Contracts         The net unrealized gain on level 3 derivative contracts of     $5.58 billion for the year ended November 2008 was     primarily attributable to changes in observable credit spreads     (which are level 2 inputs) on the underlying instruments.     Level 3 gains and losses on derivative contracts should be     considered in the context of the following:                         A derivative contract with level 1     and/or     level 2 inputs is classified as a level 3 financial     instrument in its entirety if it has at least one significant     level 3 input.                    If there is one significant level 3 input, the entire gain     or loss from adjusting only observable inputs     (i.e., level 1 and level 2) is still     classified as level 3.                    Gains or losses that have been reported in level 3     resulting from changes in level 1 or level 2 inputs     are frequently offset by gains or losses attributable to     instruments classified within level 1 or level 2 or by     cash instruments reported in level 3 of the fair value     hierarchy.          155    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         The tables below set forth a summary of changes in the fair     value of the firms level 3 financial assets and     financial liabilities for the years ended November 2008 and     November 2007. The tables reflect gains and losses,     including gains and losses on financial assets and financial     liabilities that were transferred to level 3 during the     year, for all financial assets and financial liabilities     categorized as level 3 as of November 2008 and     November 2007, respectively. The tables do not include     gains or losses that were reported in level 3 in prior     periods for instruments that were sold or transferred out of     level 3 prior to the end of the period presented.

The aggregate amounts include approximately     $(1.77) billion and $1.71 billion reported in Trading     and principal investments and Interest income,     respectively, in the consolidated statements of earnings for the     year ended November 2007.       (2)        Principally reflects transfers from level 2 within the fair     value hierarchy of loans and securities backed by commercial     real estate, reflecting reduced price transparency for these     financial instruments.       (3)        Substantially all is reported in Trading and principal     investments in the consolidated statements of earnings.       (4)        Principally resulted from changes in level 2 inputs.       (5)        Principally reflects transfers to level 2 within the fair     value hierarchy of     mortgage-related     derivative assets, as recent trading activity provided improved     transparency of correlation inputs. This decrease was partially     offset by transfers from level 2 within the fair value     hierarchy of credit and     equity-linked     derivatives due to reduced price transparency.       (6)        Consists of transfers from level 2 within the fair value     hierarchy.       (7)        Principally reflects transfers from level 2 within the fair     value hierarchy of loans and securities backed by commercial and     residential real estate and certain bank loans and bridge loans,     reflecting reduced price transparency for these financial     instruments.       (8)        Principally reflects transfers from level 2 within the fair     value hierarchy of structured credit derivative liabilities, due     to reduced transparency of correlation inputs.          156    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)       Impact of     Credit Spreads         On an ongoing basis, the firm realizes gains or losses relating     to changes in credit risk on derivative contracts through     changes in credit mitigants or the sale or unwind of the     contracts. The net gain/(loss) attributable to the impact of     changes in credit exposure and credit spreads on derivative     contracts was $(137) million and $86 million for the     years ended November 2008 and November 2007,     respectively.         The following table sets forth the net gains attributable to the     impact of changes in the firms own credit spreads on     unsecured borrowings for which the fair value option was     elected. The firm calculates the fair value of unsecured     borrowings by discounting future cash flows at a rate which     incorporates the firms observable credit spreads.                                               Year Ended November             2008       2007                 (in millions)          Net gains including hedges            $       1,127               $       203              Net gains excluding hedges                1,196                   216                  The impact of changes in instrument-specific credit spreads on     loans and loan commitments for which the fair value option was     elected was a loss of $4.61 billion for the year ended     November 2008 and not material for the year ended     November 2007. The firm attributes changes in the fair     value of floating rate loans and loan commitments to changes in     instrument-specific credit spreads. For fixed rate loans and     loan commitments, the firm allocates changes in fair value     between interest rate-related changes and credit spread-related     changes based on changes in interest rates. See below for     additional details regarding the fair value option.     The Fair Value     Option     Gains/Losses         The following table sets forth the gains/(losses) included in     earnings for the years ended November 2008 and     November 2007 as a result of the firm electing to apply the     fair value option to certain financial assets and financial     liabilities, as described in Note 2. The table excludes     gains and losses related to trading assets and trading     liabilities, as well as gains and losses that would have been     recognized under other generally accepted accounting principles     if the firm had not elected the fair value option or that are     economically hedged with instruments accounted for at fair value     under other generally accepted accounting principles.                                               Year Ended November             2008       2007                 (in millions)          Unsecured     long-term     borrowings (1)            $       915               $       202              Other secured     financings (2)                894                   (293       )          Unsecured     short-term     borrowings (3)                266                   6              Other (4)                (20       )               18                                                    Total (5)            $       2,055               $       (67       )                                                          (1)   Excludes gains of     $2.42 billion and losses of $2.18 billion for the     years ended November 2008 and November 2007,     respectively, related to the derivative component of hybrid     financial instruments. Such gains and losses would have been     recognized pursuant to SFAS No. 133 if the firm had     not elected to account for the entire hybrid instrument at fair     value under the fair value option.              157    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)            (2)   Excludes gains of     $1.29 billion and $2.19 billion for the years ended     November 2008 and November 2007, respectively, related     to financings recorded as a result of securitization-related     transactions that were accounted for as secured financings     rather than sales under SFAS No. 140. Changes in the     fair value of these secured financings are offset by changes in     the fair value of the related financial instruments included     within the firms Trading assets, at fair value     in the consolidated statements of financial condition.           (3)   Excludes gains of     $6.37 billion and losses of $1.07 billion for the     years ended November 2008 and November 2007,     respectively, related to the derivative component of hybrid     financial instruments. Such gains and losses would have been     recognized pursuant to SFAS No. 133 if the firm had     not elected to account for the entire hybrid instrument at fair     value under the fair value option.           (4)   Primarily consists of certain     insurance and reinsurance contracts, resale and repurchase     agreements and securities borrowed and loaned within Trading and     Principal Investments.           (5)   Reported within Trading and     principal investments within the consolidated statements     of earnings. The amounts exclude contractual interest, which is     included in Interest income and Interest     expense, for all instruments other than hybrid financial     instruments.               All trading assets and trading liabilities are accounted for at     fair value either under the fair value option or as required by     other accounting pronouncements. Excluding equities commissions     of $5.00 billion and $4.58 billion for the years ended     November 2008 and November 2007, respectively, and the gains and     losses on the instruments accounted for under the fair value     option described above, the firms Trading and     principal investments revenues in the consolidated     statements of earnings primarily represent gains and losses on     Trading assets, at fair value and Trading     liabilities, at fair value in the consolidated statements     of financial condition.     Loans and Loan     Commitments         As of November 2008, the aggregate contractual principal     amount of loans and long-term receivables for which the fair     value option was elected exceeded the related fair value by     $50.21 billion, including a difference of     $37.46 billion related to loans with an aggregate fair     value of $3.77 billion that were on nonaccrual status     (including loans more than 90 days past due). The aggregate     contractual principal exceeds the related fair value primarily     because the firm regularly purchases loans, such as distressed     loans, at values significantly below contractual principal     amounts.         As of November 2008, the fair value of unfunded lending     commitments for which the fair value option was elected was a     liability of $3.52 billion and the related total     contractual amount of these lending commitments was     $39.49 billion.         As of November 2007, substantially all of the firms     loans and unfunded lending commitments were recorded at fair     value in accordance with specialized industry accounting for     broker-dealers, and not pursuant to the fair value option. As a     result, the difference between the aggregate fair value and     related contractual principal amounts of loans and long-term     receivables accounted for under the fair value option was not     material as of November 2007. See Note 2 for further     information related to fair value option elections made by the     firm upon becoming a bank holding company in September 2008.     Long-term Debt     Instruments         The aggregate contractual principal amount of long-term debt     instruments (principal and non-principal protected) for which     the fair value option was elected exceeded the related fair     value by $2.42 billion as of November 2008, while the     difference between the fair value and the aggregate contractual     principal amount was not material to the carrying value as of     November 2007.        158    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     Credit     Concentrations         Credit concentrations may arise from trading, investing,     underwriting and securities borrowing activities and may be     impacted by changes in economic, industry or political factors.     The firm seeks to mitigate credit risk by actively monitoring     exposures and obtaining collateral as deemed appropriate. While     the firms activities expose it to many different     industries and counterparties, the firm routinely executes a     high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial     services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial     banks, investment funds and other institutional clients,     resulting in significant credit concentration with respect to     this industry. In the ordinary course of business, the firm may     also be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a     particular counterparty, borrower or issuer.         As of November 2008 and November 2007, the firm held     $53.98 billion (6% of total assets) and $45.75 billion     (4% of total assets), respectively, of U.S. government and     federal agency obligations included in Trading assets, at     fair value and Cash and securities segregated for     regulatory and other purposes in the consolidated     statements of financial condition. As of November 2008 and     November 2007, the firm held $21.13 billion (2% of     total assets) and $31.65 billion (3% of total assets),     respectively, of other sovereign obligations, principally     consisting of securities issued by the governments of Japan and     the United Kingdom. In addition, as of November 2008 and     November 2007, $126.27 billion and     $144.92 billion of the firms securities purchased     under agreements to resell and securities borrowed (including     those in Cash and securities segregated for regulatory and     other purposes), respectively, were collateralized by     U.S. government and federal agency obligations. As of     November 2008 and November 2007, $65.37 billion     and $41.26 billion of the firms securities purchased     under agreements to resell and securities borrowed,     respectively, were collateralized by other sovereign     obligations. As of November 2008 and November 2007,     the firm did not have credit exposure to any other counterparty     that exceeded 2% of the firms total assets.     Derivative     Activities         Derivative contracts are instruments, such as futures, forwards,     swaps or option contracts, that derive their value from     underlying assets, indices, reference rates or a combination of     these factors. Derivative instruments may be privately     negotiated contracts, which are often referred to as OTC     derivatives, or they may be listed and traded on an exchange.     Derivatives may involve future commitments to purchase or sell     financial instruments or commodities, or to exchange currency or     interest payment streams. The amounts exchanged are based on the     specific terms of the contract with reference to specified     rates, securities, commodities, currencies or indices.         Certain cash instruments, such as     mortgage-backed     securities, interest-only and principal-only obligations, and     indexed debt instruments, are not considered derivatives even     though their values or contractually required cash flows are     derived from the price of some other security or index. However,     certain commodity-related contracts are included in the     firms derivatives disclosure, as these contracts may be     settled in cash or the assets to be delivered under the contract     are readily convertible into cash.         The firm enters into derivative transactions to facilitate     client transactions, to take proprietary positions and as a     means of risk management. Risk exposures are managed through     diversification, by controlling position sizes and by entering     into offsetting positions. For example, the firm may manage the     risk related to a portfolio of common stock by entering into an     offsetting position in a related     equity-index     futures contract.         The firm applies hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133     to certain derivative contracts. The firm uses these derivatives     to manage certain interest rate and currency exposures,     including the firms net investment in     non-U.S. operations.     The firm designates certain interest rate swap contracts as fair     value hedges. These interest rate swap contracts hedge changes     in the relevant benchmark interest        159    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         rate (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)),     effectively converting a substantial portion of the firms     unsecured     long-term     and certain unsecured     short-term     borrowings into floating rate obligations. See Note 2 for     information regarding the firms accounting policy for     foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge its net     investment in     non-U.S. operations.         The firm applies a     long-haul     method to all of its hedge accounting relationships to perform     an ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of these     relationships in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or     offsetting cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged. The     firm utilizes a     dollar-offset     method, which compares the change in the fair value of the     hedging instrument to the change in the fair value of the hedged     item, excluding the effect of the passage of time, to     prospectively and retrospectively assess hedge effectiveness.     The firms prospective     dollar-offset     assessment utilizes scenario analyses to test hedge     effectiveness via simulations of numerous parallel and slope     shifts of the relevant yield curve. Parallel shifts change the     interest rate of all maturities by identical amounts. Slope     shifts change the curvature of the yield curve. For both the     prospective assessment, in response to each of the simulated     yield curve shifts, and the retrospective assessment, a hedging     relationship is deemed to be effective if the fair value of the     hedging instrument and the hedged item change inversely within a     range of 80% to 125%.         For fair value hedges, gains or losses on derivative     transactions are recognized in Interest expense in     the consolidated statements of earnings. The change in fair     value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged     is reported as an adjustment to its carrying value and is     subsequently amortized into interest expense over its remaining     life. Gains or losses related to hedge ineffectiveness for all     hedges are generally included in Interest expense.     These gains or losses and the component of gains or losses on     derivative transactions excluded from the assessment of hedge     effectiveness (e.g., the effect of the passage of time on     fair value hedges of the firms borrowings) were not     material to the firms results of operations for the years     ended November 2008, November 2007 and     November 2006. Gains and losses on derivatives used for     trading purposes are included in Trading and principal     investments in the consolidated statements of earnings.         The fair value of the firms derivative contracts is     reflected net of cash paid or received pursuant to credit     support agreements and is reported on a     net-by-counterparty     basis in the firms consolidated statements of financial     condition when management believes a legal right of setoff     exists under an enforceable netting agreement.

The firm also has embedded derivatives that have been bifurcated     from related borrowings under SFAS No. 133. Such     derivatives, which are classified in unsecured     short-term     and unsecured     long-term     borrowings, had a carrying value of $(774) million and     $463 million (excluding the debt host contract) as of     November 2008 and November 2007, respectively. See     Notes 6 and 7 for further information regarding the     firms unsecured borrowings.         The firm enters into various derivative transactions that are     considered credit derivatives under FSP No.     FAS 133-1     and     FIN 45-4.     The firms written and purchased credit derivatives include     credit default swaps, credit spread options, credit index     products and total return swaps. As of November 2008, the     firms written and purchased credit derivatives had total     gross notional amounts of $3.78 trillion and     $4.03 trillion, respectively, for total net purchased     protection of $255.24 billion in notional value.         The following table sets forth certain information related to     the firms credit derivatives. Fair values in the table     below exclude the effects of both netting under enforceable     netting agreements and netting of cash paid pursuant to credit     support agreements, and therefore are not representative of the     firms net exposure.

(3)        Credit spread on the underlying, together with the period of     expiration, are indicators of payment/performance risk. For     example, the firm is least likely to pay or otherwise be     required to perform where the credit spread on the underlying is     0-250     basis points and the period of expiration is 0-5     Years. The likelihood of payment or performance is     generally greater as the credit spread on the underlying and     period of expiration increase.       (4)        Includes a maximum payout/notional amount for written credit     derivatives of $208.44 billion expiring within one year as     of November 2008.       (5)        This liability excludes the effects of both netting under     enforceable netting agreements and netting of cash collateral     paid pursuant to credit support agreements. Including the     effects of netting receivable balances with payable balances for     the same counterparty pursuant to enforceable netting     agreements, the firms net liability related to credit     derivatives in the firms statement of financial condition     as of November 2008 was $33.76 billion. This net     amount excludes the netting of cash collateral paid pursuant to     credit support agreements.          161    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)       Collateralized     Transactions         The firm receives financial instruments as collateral, primarily     in connection with resale agreements, securities borrowed,     derivative transactions and customer margin loans. Such     financial instruments may include obligations of the     U.S. government, federal agencies, sovereigns and     corporations, as well as equities and convertibles.         In many cases, the firm is permitted to deliver or repledge     these financial instruments in connection with entering into     repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements and other     secured financings, collateralizing derivative transactions and     meeting firm or customer settlement requirements. As of     November 2008 and November 2007, the fair value of     financial instruments received as collateral by the firm that it     was permitted to deliver or repledge was $578.72 billion     and $891.05 billion, respectively, of which the firm     delivered or repledged $445.11 billion and     $785.62 billion, respectively.         The firm also pledges assets that it owns to counterparties who     may or may not have the right to deliver or repledge them.     Trading assets pledged to counterparties that have the right to     deliver or repledge are included in Trading assets, at     fair value in the consolidated statements of financial     condition and were $26.31 billion and $46.14 billion     as of November 2008 and November 2007, respectively.     Trading assets, pledged in connection with repurchase     agreements, securities lending agreements and other secured     financings to counterparties that did not have the right to sell     or repledge are included in Trading assets, at fair     value in the consolidated statements of financial     condition and were $80.85 billion and $156.92 billion     as of November 2008 and November 2007, respectively.     Other assets (primarily real estate and cash) owned and pledged     in connection with other secured financings to counterparties     that did not have the right to sell or repledge were     $9.24 billion and $5.86 billion as of     November 2008 and November 2007, respectively.         In addition to repurchase agreements and securities lending     agreements, the firm obtains secured funding through the use of     other arrangements. Other secured financings include     arrangements that are nonrecourse, that is, only the subsidiary     that executed the arrangement or a subsidiary guaranteeing the     arrangement is obligated to repay the financing. Other secured     financings consist of liabilities related to the firms     William Street program, consolidated VIEs, collateralized     central bank financings, transfers of financial assets that are     accounted for as financings rather than sales under     SFAS No. 140 (primarily pledged bank loans and     mortgage whole loans) and other structured financing     arrangements.        162    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         Other secured financings by maturity are set forth in the table     below:                                               As of November             2008       2007                 (in millions)          Other secured financings     (short-term) (1)(2)            $       21,225               $       32,410              Other secured financings     (long-term):                                           2009                                   2,903              2010                2,157                   2,301              2011                4,578                   2,427              2012                3,040                   4,973              2013                1,377                   702              2014-thereafter                6,306                   19,994                                                    Total other secured financings     (long-term) (3)(4)                17,458                   33,300                                                    Total other secured     financings (5)            $       38,683               $       65,710                                                              (1)   As of November 2008, consists     of     U.S. dollar-denominated     financings of $12.53 billion with a weighted average     interest rate of 2.98% and     non-U.S. dollar-denominated     financings of $8.70 billion with a weighted average     interest rate of 0.95%, after giving effect to hedging     activities.

Securitization     Activities and Variable Interest Entities       Securitization     Activities         The firm securitizes commercial and residential mortgages, home     equity and auto loans, government and corporate bonds and other     types of financial assets. The firm acts as underwriter of the     beneficial interests that are sold to investors. The firm     derecognizes financial assets transferred in securitizations,     provided it has relinquished control over such assets.     Transferred assets are accounted for at fair value prior to     securitization. Net revenues related to these underwriting     activities are recognized in connection with the sales of the     underlying beneficial interests to investors.        163    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         The firm may retain interests in securitized financial assets,     primarily in the form of senior or subordinated securities,     including residual interests.

(2)         Anticipated credit losses are computed only on positions for     which expected credit loss is a key assumption in the     determination of fair value or positions for which expected     credit loss is not reflected within the discount rate.         (3)         The impacts of adverse change take into account credit mitigants     incorporated in the retained interests, including     over-collateralization     and subordination provisions.         (4)         Includes $192 million and $905 million as of     November 2008 and November 2007, respectively, of     retained interests related to transfers of securitized assets     that were accounted for as secured financings rather than sales     under SFAS No. 140.          164    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)           The preceding table does not give effect to the offsetting     benefit of other financial instruments that are held to mitigate     risks inherent in these retained interests. Changes in fair     value based on an adverse variation in assumptions generally     cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in     assumptions to the change in fair value is not usually linear.     In addition, the impact of a change in a particular assumption     is calculated independently of changes in any other assumption.     In practice, simultaneous changes in assumptions might magnify     or counteract the sensitivities disclosed above.         In addition to the retained interests described above, the firm     also held interests in residential mortgage QSPEs purchased in     connection with secondary     market-making     activities. These purchased interests were approximately     $4 billion and $6 billion as of November 2008 and     November 2007, respectively.         As of November 2008 and November 2007, the firm held     mortgage servicing rights with a fair value of $147 million     and $93 million, respectively. These servicing assets     represent the firms right to receive a future stream of     cash flows, such as servicing fees, in excess of the firms     obligation to service residential mortgages. The fair value of     mortgage servicing rights will fluctuate in response to changes     in certain economic variables, such as discount rates and loan     prepayment rates. The firm estimates the fair value of mortgage     servicing rights by using valuation models that incorporate     these variables in quantifying anticipated cash flows related to     servicing activities. Mortgage servicing rights are included in     Trading assets, at fair value in the consolidated     statements of financial condition and are classified within     level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The following table     sets forth changes in the firms mortgage servicing rights,     as well as servicing fees earned:                                   Year Ended               November 2008                  (in millions)          Balance, beginning of year            $       93              Purchases (1)                272              Servicing assets that resulted from transfers of financial assets                3              Changes in fair value due to changes in valuation inputs and     assumptions                (221       )                                Balance, end of     year (2)            $       147                                                          Contractually specified servicing fees            $       315                                              (1)   Primarily related to the     acquisition of Litton Loan Servicing LP.           (2)   As of November 2008, the fair     value was estimated using a weighted average discount rate of     approximately 16% and a weighted average prepayment rate of     approximately 27%.              165    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     Variable     Interest Entities (VIEs)         The firm, in the ordinary course of business, retains interests     in VIEs in connection with its securitization activities. The     firm also purchases and sells variable interests in VIEs, which     primarily issue     mortgage-backed     and other     asset-backed     securities, CDOs and CLOs, in connection with its     market-making     activities and makes investments in and loans to VIEs that hold     performing and nonperforming debt, equity, real estate,     power-related and other assets. In addition, the firm utilizes     VIEs to provide investors with principal-protected notes,     credit-linked     notes and     asset-repackaged     notes designed to meet their objectives.         VIEs generally purchase assets by issuing debt and equity     instruments. In certain instances, the firm provides guarantees     to VIEs or holders of variable interests in VIEs. In such cases,     the maximum exposure to loss included in the tables set forth     below is the notional amount of such guarantees. Such amounts do     not represent anticipated losses in connection with these     guarantees.         The firms variable interests in VIEs include senior and     subordinated debt; loan commitments; limited and general     partnership interests; preferred and common stock; interest     rate, foreign currency, equity, commodity and credit     derivatives; guarantees; and residual interests in     mortgage-backed     and     asset-backed     securitization vehicles, CDOs and CLOs. The firms exposure     to the obligations of VIEs is generally limited to its interests     in these entities.        166    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         The following tables set forth total assets in nonconsolidated     VIEs in which the firm holds significant variable interests and     the firms maximum exposure to loss excluding the benefit     of offsetting financial instruments that are held to mitigate     the risks associated with these variable interests.

Short-Term     Borrowings           As of November 2008,     short-term     borrowings were $73.89 billion, comprised of     $21.23 billion included in Other secured     financings in the consolidated statement of financial     condition and $52.66 billion of unsecured     short-term     borrowings. As of November 2007,     short-term     borrowings were $103.97 billion, comprised of     $32.41 billion included in Other secured     financings in the consolidated statement of financial     condition and $71.56 billion of unsecured     short-term     borrowings. See Note 3 for information on other secured     financings.         Unsecured     short-term     borrowings include the portion of unsecured     long-term     borrowings maturing within one year of the financial statement     date and unsecured     long-term     borrowings that are redeemable within one year of the financial     statement date at the option of the holder. The firm accounts     for promissory notes, commercial paper and certain hybrid     financial instruments at fair value under SFAS No. 155     or SFAS No. 159.     Short-term     borrowings that are not recorded at fair value are recorded     based on the amount of cash received plus accrued interest, and     such amounts approximate fair value due to the     short-term     nature of the obligations.         Unsecured     short-term     borrowings are set forth below:                                               As of November             2008       2007                 (in millions)          Current portion of unsecured     long-term     borrowings (1)            $       26,281               $       22,740              Hybrid financial instruments                12,086                   22,318              Promissory     notes (2)                6,944                   13,251              Commercial     paper (3)                1,125                   4,343              Other     short-term     borrowings                6,222                   8,905                                                    Total (4)            $       52,658               $       71,557                                                              (1)   Includes $25.12 billion and     $21.24 billion as of November 2008 and     November 2007, respectively, issued by     Group Inc.

As of November 2008     and November 2007, $31.99 billion and     $32.44 billion, respectively, of the firms floating     rate debt obligations were denominated in     non-U.S. dollars.

(2)   Unsecured     long-term     borrowings that are repayable prior to maturity at the option of     the firm are reflected at their contractual maturity dates.     Unsecured     long-term     borrowings that are redeemable prior to maturity at the option     of the holder are reflected at the dates such options become     exercisable.               The firm enters into derivative contracts to effectively convert     a substantial portion of its unsecured     long-term     borrowings which are not accounted for at fair value into     U.S. dollar-based     floating rate obligations. Accordingly, excluding the cumulative     impact of changes in the firms credit spreads, the     carrying value of unsecured     long-term     borrowings approximated fair value as of November 2008 and     November 2007. For unsecured     long-term     borrowings for which the firm did not elect the fair value     option, the cumulative impact due to the widening of the     firms own credit spreads was a reduction in the fair value     of total unsecured     long-term     borrowings of approximately 9% and 1% as of November 2008     and November 2007, respectively.         The effective weighted average interest rates for unsecured     long-term     borrowings are set forth below:                                                                       As of November             2008       2007              Amount         Rate         Amount         Rate                  ($ in millions)          Fixed rate obligations                                                                           Group Inc.             $       1,863                   5.71       %           $       1,858                   5.69       %          Subsidiaries                2,152                   4.32                   1,929                   4.88              Floating rate     obligations (1)(2)                                                                           Group Inc.                 156,609                   2.66                   153,493                   5.20              Subsidiaries                7,596                   4.23                   6,894                   4.43                                                                                    Total (2)            $       168,220                   2.73       %           $       164,174                   5.19       %                                                                                          (1)   Includes fixed rate obligations     that have been converted into floating rate obligations through     derivative contracts.

As of November 2007, unsecured     long-term     borrowings were comprised of subordinated borrowings with     outstanding principal amounts of $16.32 billion as set     forth below, of which $16.00 billion has been issued by     Group Inc.     Junior Subordinated Debt Issued to Trusts in Connection with     Fixed-to-Floating     and Floating Rate Normal Automatic Preferred Enhanced Capital     Securities.  In 2007, Group Inc. issued a total of     $2.25 billion of remarketable junior subordinated debt to     Goldman Sachs Capital II and Goldman Sachs Capital III (APEX     Trusts), Delaware statutory trusts that, in turn, issued     $2.25 billion of guaranteed perpetual Automatic Preferred     Enhanced Capital Securities (APEX) to third parties and a de     minimis amount of common securities to Group Inc. Group Inc.     also entered into contracts with the APEX Trusts to sell     $2.25 billion of perpetual     non-cumulative     preferred stock to be issued by Group Inc. (the stock purchase     contracts). The APEX Trusts are wholly owned finance     subsidiaries of the firm for regulatory and legal purposes but     are not consolidated for accounting purposes.         The firm pays interest     semi-annually     on $1.75 billion of junior subordinated debt issued to     Goldman Sachs Capital II at a fixed annual rate of 5.59% and the     debt matures on June 1, 2043. The firm pays interest     quarterly on $500 million of junior subordinated debt     issued to Goldman Sachs Capital III at a rate per annum equal to     three-month     LIBOR plus 0.57% and the debt matures on     September 1, 2043. In addition, the firm makes     contract payments at a rate of 0.20% per annum on the stock     purchase contracts held by the APEX Trusts. The firm has the     right to defer payments on the junior subordinated debt and the     stock purchase contracts, subject to limitations, and therefore     cause payment on the APEX to be deferred. During any such     extension period, the firm will not be permitted to, among other     things, pay dividends on or make certain repurchases of its     common or preferred stock. The junior subordinated debt is     junior in right of payment to all of Group Inc.s senior     indebtedness and all of Group Inc.s other subordinated     borrowings.         In connection with the APEX issuance, the firm covenanted in     favor of certain of its debtholders, who are initially the     holders of Group Inc.s 6.345% Junior Subordinated     Debentures due February 15, 2034, that, subject to     certain exceptions, the firm would not redeem or purchase     (i) Group Inc.s junior subordinated debt issued to     the APEX Trusts prior to the applicable stock purchase date or     (ii) APEX or shares of Group Inc.s Series E or     Series F Preferred Stock prior to the date that is ten     years after the applicable stock purchase date, unless the     applicable redemption or purchase price does not exceed a     maximum amount determined by reference to the aggregate amount     of net cash proceeds that the firm has received from the sale of     qualifying equity securities during the     180-day     period preceding the redemption or purchase.         The firm has accounted for the stock purchase contracts as     equity instruments under EITF Issue     No. 00-19,     Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed     to, and Potentially Settled in, a Companys Own     Stock, and, accordingly, recorded the cost of the stock     purchase contracts as a reduction to additional     paid-in     capital. See Note 9 for information on the preferred stock     that Group Inc. will issue in connection with the stock purchase     contracts.     Junior Subordinated Debt Issued to a Trust in Connection with     Trust Preferred Securities.  Group Inc.     issued $2.84 billion of junior subordinated debentures in     2004 to Goldman Sachs Capital I (Trust), a Delaware statutory     trust that, in turn, issued $2.75 billion of guaranteed     preferred beneficial interests to third parties and     $85 million of common beneficial interests to Group Inc.     and invested the proceeds from the sale in junior subordinated     debentures issued by Group Inc.

The firm pays interest     semi-annually     on these debentures at an annual rate of 6.345% and the     debentures mature on February 15, 2034. The coupon     rate and the payment dates applicable to the beneficial     interests are the same as the interest rate and payment dates     applicable to the debentures. The firm has the right, from time     to time, to defer payment of interest on the debentures, and,     therefore, cause payment on the Trusts preferred     beneficial interests to be deferred, in each case up to ten     consecutive     semi-annual     periods. During any such extension period, the firm will not be     permitted to, among other things, pay dividends on or make     certain repurchases of its common stock. The Trust is not     permitted to pay any distributions on the common beneficial     interests held by Group Inc. unless all dividends payable on the     preferred beneficial interests have been paid in full. These     debentures are junior in right of payment to all of Group     Inc.s senior indebtedness and all of Group Inc.s     subordinated borrowings, other than the junior subordinated debt     issued in connection with the Normal Automatic Preferred     Enhanced Capital Securities.     Subordinated Debt.  As of November 2008,     the firm had $14.17 billion of other subordinated debt     outstanding, of which $13.70 billion has been issued by     Group Inc., with maturities ranging from fiscal 2009 to 2038.     The effective weighted average interest rate on this debt was     1.99%, after giving effect to derivative contracts used to     convert fixed rate obligations into floating rate obligations.     As of November 2007, the firm had $11.23 billion of     other subordinated debt outstanding, of which     $10.91 billion has been issued by Group Inc., with     maturities ranging from fiscal 2009 to 2037. The effective     weighted average interest rate on this debt was 5.75%, after     giving effect to derivative contracts used to convert fixed rate     obligations into floating rate obligations. This debt is junior     in right of payment to all of the firms senior     indebtedness.           Note 8.     Commitments,     Contingencies and Guarantees       Commitments     Forward Starting Collateralized Agreements and     Financings.  The firm had forward starting resale     agreements and securities borrowing agreements of     $61.46 billion and $28.14 billion as of     November 2008 and November 2007, respectively. The     firm had forward starting repurchase agreements and securities     lending agreements of $6.95 billion and $15.39 billion     as of November 2008 and November 2007, respectively.     Commitments to Extend Credit.  In connection     with its lending activities, the firm had outstanding     commitments to extend credit of $41.04 billion and     $82.75 billion as of November 2008 and     November 2007, respectively. The firms commitments to     extend credit are agreements to lend to counterparties that have     fixed termination dates and are contingent on the satisfaction     of all conditions to borrowing set forth in the contract. Since     these commitments may expire unused or be reduced or cancelled     at the counterpartys request, the total commitment amount     does not necessarily reflect the actual future cash flow     requirements. The firm accounts for these commitments at fair     value. To the extent that the firm recognizes losses on these     commitments, such losses are recorded within the firms     Trading and Principal Investments segment net of any related     underwriting fees.        173    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         The following table summarizes the firms commitments to     extend credit, net of amounts syndicated to third parties, as of     November 2008 and November 2007:                                               Year Ended November             2008       2007                 (in millions)          Commercial lending commitments                                       Investment-grade            $       8,007               $       11,719          Non-investment-grade                9,318                   41,930              William Street program                22,610                   24,488              Warehouse financing                1,101                   4,610                                                    Total commitments to extend credit            $       41,036               $       82,747                                                                    Commercial lending commitments.  The     firms commercial lending commitments are generally     extended in connection with contingent acquisition financing and     other types of corporate lending as well as commercial real     estate financing. The total commitment amount does not     necessarily reflect the actual future cash flow requirements, as     the firm may syndicate all or substantial portions of these     commitments in the future, the commitments may expire unused, or     the commitments may be cancelled or reduced at the request of     the counterparty. In addition, commitments that are extended for     contingent acquisition financing are often intended to be     short-term     in nature, as borrowers often seek to replace them with other     funding sources.           Included within     non-investment-grade     commitments as of November 2008 was $2.07 billion of     exposure to leveraged lending capital market transactions,     $164 million related to commercial real estate transactions     and $7.09 billion arising from other unfunded credit     facilities. Included within the     non-investment-grade     amount as of November 2007 was $26.09 billion of     exposure to leveraged lending capital market transactions,     $3.50 billion related to commercial real estate     transactions and $12.34 billion arising from other unfunded     credit facilities. Including funded loans, the firms total     exposure to leveraged lending capital market transactions was     $7.97 billion and $43.06 billion as of     November 2008 and November 2007, respectively.                     William Street program.  Substantially all of     the commitments provided under the William Street credit     extension program are to     investment-grade     corporate borrowers. Commitments under the program are     principally extended by William Street Commitment Corporation     (Commitment Corp.), a consolidated wholly owned subsidiary of GS     Bank USA, and also by William Street Credit Corporation, GS Bank     USA or Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. The commitments     extended by Commitment Corp. are supported, in part, by funding     raised by William Street Funding Corporation (Funding Corp.),     another consolidated wholly owned subsidiary of GS Bank USA. The     assets and liabilities of Commitment Corp. and Funding Corp. are     legally separated from other assets and liabilities of the firm.     The assets of Commitment Corp. and of Funding Corp. will not be     available to their respective shareholders until the claims of     their respective creditors have been paid. In addition, no     affiliate of either Commitment Corp. or Funding Corp., except in     limited cases as expressly agreed in writing, is responsible for     any obligation of either entity. With respect to most of the     William Street commitments, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group,     Inc. (SMFG) provides the firm with credit loss protection that     is generally limited to 95% of the first loss the firm realizes     on approved loan commitments, up to a maximum of     $1.00 billion. In addition, subject to the satisfaction of     certain conditions, upon the firms request, SMFG will     provide protection for 70% of additional losses on such     commitments, up to a maximum of $1.13 billion, of which     $375 million of protection has been provided as of     November 2008. The firm also uses other financial     instruments to mitigate credit risks related to certain William     Street commitments not covered by SMFG.          174    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                       Warehouse financing.  The firm provides     financing for the warehousing of financial assets. These     arrangements are secured by the warehoused assets, primarily     consisting of commercial mortgages as of November 2008 and     corporate bank loans and commercial mortgages as of     November 2007.       Letters of Credit.  The firm provides letters     of credit issued by various banks to counterparties in lieu of     securities or cash to satisfy various collateral and margin     deposit requirements. Letters of credit outstanding were     $7.25 billion and $8.75 billion as of     November 2008 and November 2007, respectively.     Investment Commitments.  In connection with its     merchant banking and other investing activities, the firm     invests in private equity, real estate and other assets directly     and through funds that it raises and manages. In connection with     these activities, the firm had commitments to invest up to     $14.27 billion and $17.76 billion as of     November 2008 and November 2007, respectively,     including $12.25 billion and $12.32 billion,     respectively, of commitments to invest in funds managed by the     firm.     Construction-Related     Commitments.  As of November 2008 and     November 2007, the firm had     construction-related     commitments of $483 million and $769 million,     respectively, including commitments of $388 million and     $642 million as of November 2008 and     November 2007, respectively, related to the firms new     headquarters in New York City, which is expected to cost between     $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion. The firm has partially     financed this construction project with $1.65 billion of     tax-exempt     Liberty Bonds.     Underwriting Commitments.  As of     November 2008 and November 2007, the firm had     commitments to purchase $241 million and $88 million,     respectively, of securities in connection with its underwriting     activities.     Other.  The firm had other purchase commitments     of $260 million as of November 2008 and     $1.76 billion (including a $1.34 billion commitment     for the acquisition of Litton Loan Servicing LP) as of     November 2007.     Leases.  The firm has contractual obligations     under     long-term     noncancelable lease agreements, principally for office space,     expiring on various dates through 2069. Certain agreements are     subject to periodic escalation provisions for increases in real     estate taxes and other charges. Future minimum rental payments,     net of minimum sublease rentals are set forth below (in     millions):                                Minimum rental payments                           2009            $       494              2010                458              2011                342              2012                276              2013                259              2014-thereafter                1,664                                    Total            $       3,493                                        Rent charged to operating expense is set forth below (in     millions):                                Net rent expense                           2006            $       404              2007                412              2008                438                 175    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     Contingencies         The firm is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and     arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in connection     with the conduct of its businesses. Management believes, based     on currently available information, that the results of such     proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse     effect on the firms financial condition, but may be     material to the firms operating results for any particular     period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such     period. Given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome     of the firms litigation and regulatory matters,     particularly in cases or proceedings in which substantial or     indeterminate damages or fines are sought, the firm cannot     estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases or proceedings     where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may be     incurred.         In connection with its insurance business, the firm is     contingently liable to provide guaranteed minimum death and     income benefits to certain contract holders and has established     a reserve related to $6.13 billion and $10.84 billion     of contract holder account balances as of November 2008 and     November 2007, respectively, for such benefits. The     weighted average attained age of these contract holders was     68 years and 67 years as of November 2008 and     November 2007, respectively. The net amount at risk,     representing guaranteed minimum death and income benefits in     excess of contract holder account balances, was     $2.96 billion and $1.04 billion as of     November 2008 and November 2007, respectively. See     Note 12 for more information on the firms insurance     liabilities.     Guarantees         The firm enters into various derivative contracts that meet the     definition of a guarantee under FIN 45,     Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements     for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of     Others, as amended by     FSP No. FAS 133-1     and     FIN 45-4.         FIN 45 does not require disclosures about derivative     contracts if such contracts may be cash settled and the firm has     no basis to conclude it is probable that the counterparties     held, at inception, the underlying instruments related to the     derivative contracts. The firm has concluded that these     conditions have been met for certain large, internationally     active commercial and investment bank counterparties and certain     other counterparties. Accordingly, the firm has not included     such contracts in the tables below.         The firm, in its capacity as an agency lender, indemnifies most     of its securities lending customers against losses incurred in     the event that borrowers do not return securities and the     collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the     securities borrowed.         In the ordinary course of business, the firm provides other     financial guarantees of the obligations of third parties     (e.g., performance bonds, standby letters of credit and     other guarantees to enable clients to complete transactions and     merchant banking fund-related guarantees). These guarantees     represent obligations to make payments to beneficiaries if the     guaranteed party fails to fulfill its obligation under a     contractual arrangement with that beneficiary.        176    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         As of November 2008 and November 2007, derivative contracts     that meet the definition of a guarantee include written equity     and commodity put options, written currency contracts and     interest rate caps, floors and swaptions. As of     November 2007, prior to the adoption of     FSP No. FAS 133-1     and     FIN 45-4,     derivative contracts that met the definition of a guarantee also     included credit derivatives, such as credit default swaps,     credit spread options, credit index products and total return     swaps. See      Recent     Accounting Developments for further information on     FSP No. FAS 133-1     and     FIN 45-4     and Note 3 for additional information on the firms     credit derivatives as of November 2008. The following     tables set forth certain information about the firms     derivative contracts that meet the definition of a guarantee and     certain other guarantees as of November 2008 and     November 2007:                                                                                               As of November 2008                     Maximum Payout/Notional Amount by Period of     Expiration (1)             Carrying                2010-        2012-        2014-                       Value         2009         2011         2013         Thereafter         Total                  (in millions)               Derivatives (2)                $17,462                   $114,863                   $73,224                   $30,312                   $90,643                   $309,042              Securities lending     indemnifications (3)                                   19,306                                                                            19,306              Other financial guarantees                235                   203                   477                   458                   238                   1,376                                                                                                                       As of November 2007                     Maximum Payout/Notional Amount by Period of     Expiration (1)             Carrying                2009-        2011-        2013-                       Value         2008         2010         2012         Thereafter         Total                  (in millions)               Derivatives (2)(4)                $33,098                   $580,769                   $492,563                   $457,511                   $514,498                   $2,045,341              Securities lending     indemnifications (3)                                   26,673                                                                            26,673              Performance     bond (5)                                   2,046                                                                            2,046              Other financial guarantees                43                   381                   121                   258                   46                   806                        (1)   Such amounts do not represent the     anticipated losses in connection with these contracts.           (2)   Because derivative contracts are     accounted for at fair value, carrying value is considered the     best indication of payment/performance risk for individual     contracts. However, the carrying value excludes the effect of a     legal right of setoff that may exist under an enforceable     netting agreement and the effect of netting of cash paid     pursuant to credit support agreements. These derivative     contracts are risk managed together with derivative contracts     that are not considered guarantees under FIN 45 and,     therefore, these amounts do not reflect the firms overall     risk related to its derivative activities.           (3)   Collateral held by the lenders in     connection with securities lending indemnifications was     $19.95 billion and $27.49 billion as of     November 2008 and November 2007, respectively. Because     the contractual nature of these arrangements requires the firm     to obtain collateral with a market value that exceeds the value     of the securities on loan from the borrower, there is minimal     performance risk associated with these guarantees.           (4)   Includes credit derivatives that     meet the definition of a guarantee as of November 2007.           (5)   Excludes cash collateral of     $2.05 billion related to this obligation.               The firm has established trusts, including Goldman Sachs Capital     I, II and III, and other entities for the limited purpose of     issuing securities to third parties, lending the proceeds to the     firm and entering into contractual arrangements with the firm     and third parties related to this purpose. See Note 7 for     information regarding the transactions involving Goldman Sachs     Capital I, II and III. The firm effectively provides for the     full and unconditional guarantee of the securities issued by     these entities, which are not consolidated for accounting     purposes. Timely payment by the firm of amounts due to these     entities under the borrowing, preferred stock and related     contractual arrangements will be sufficient to cover payments     due on the securities issued by these entities. Management     believes that it is unlikely that any circumstances will occur,     such as nonperformance on the part of paying agents or other     service providers, that would make it necessary for the firm to     make payments related        177    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         to these entities other than those required under the terms of     the borrowing, preferred stock and related contractual     arrangements and in connection with certain expenses incurred by     these entities.         In the ordinary course of business, the firm indemnifies and     guarantees certain service providers, such as clearing and     custody agents, trustees and administrators, against specified     potential losses in connection with their acting as an agent of,     or providing services to, the firm or its affiliates. The firm     also indemnifies some clients against potential losses incurred     in the event specified     third-party     service providers, including     sub-custodians     and     third-party     brokers, improperly execute transactions. In addition, the firm     is a member of payment, clearing and settlement networks as well     as securities exchanges around the world that may require the     firm to meet the obligations of such networks and exchanges in     the event of member defaults. In connection with its prime     brokerage and clearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear and     settle on behalf of its clients the transactions entered into by     them with other brokerage firms. The firms obligations in     respect of such transactions are secured by the assets in the     clients account as well as any proceeds received from the     transactions cleared and settled by the firm on behalf of the     client. In connection with joint venture investments, the firm     may issue loan guarantees under which it may be liable in the     event of fraud, misappropriation, environmental liabilities and     certain other matters involving the borrower. The firm is unable     to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these     guarantees and indemnifications. However, management believes     that it is unlikely the firm will have to make any material     payments under these arrangements, and no liabilities related to     these guarantees and indemnifications have been recognized in     the consolidated statements of financial condition as of     November 2008 and November 2007.         The firm provides representations and warranties to     counterparties in connection with a variety of commercial     transactions and occasionally indemnifies them against potential     losses caused by the breach of those representations and     warranties. The firm may also provide indemnifications     protecting against changes in or adverse application of certain     U.S. tax laws in connection with ordinary-course     transactions such as securities issuances, borrowings or     derivatives. In addition, the firm may provide indemnifications     to some counterparties to protect them in the event additional     taxes are owed or payments are withheld, due either to a change     in or an adverse application of certain     non-U.S. tax     laws. These indemnifications generally are standard contractual     terms and are entered into in the ordinary course of business.     Generally, there are no stated or notional amounts included in     these indemnifications, and the contingencies triggering the     obligation to indemnify are not expected to occur. The firm is     unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these     guarantees and indemnifications. However, management believes     that it is unlikely the firm will have to make any material     payments under these arrangements, and no liabilities related to     these arrangements have been recognized in the consolidated     statements of financial condition as of November 2008 and     November 2007.         Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of Goldman,     Sachs & Co. (GS&Co.), GS Bank USA and GS     Bank Europe, subject to certain exceptions. In     November 2008, the firm contributed subsidiaries with an     aggregate of $117.16 billion of assets into GS Bank USA     (which brought total assets in GS Bank USA to     $145.06 billion as of November 2008) and Group Inc. agreed     to guarantee certain losses, including     credit-related     losses, relating to assets held by the contributed entities. In     connection with this guarantee, Group Inc. also agreed to pledge     to GS Bank USA certain collateral, including interests in     subsidiaries and other illiquid assets. In addition, Group Inc.     guarantees many of the obligations of its other consolidated     subsidiaries on a     transaction-by-transaction     basis, as negotiated with counterparties. Group Inc. is unable     to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under its     subsidiary guarantees; however, because these guaranteed     obligations are also obligations of consolidated subsidiaries     included in the tables above, Group Inc.s liabilities as     guarantor are not separately disclosed.        178    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)           Note 9.     Shareholders     Equity       Common and     Preferred Equity         In September 2008, Group Inc. completed a public offering     of 46.7 million shares of common stock at $123.00 per share     for proceeds of $5.75 billion.         In October 2008, Group Inc. issued to Berkshire Hathaway     Inc. and certain affiliates 50,000 shares of 10% Cumulative     Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series G (Series G     Preferred Stock), and a five-year warrant to purchase up to     43.5 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of     $115.00 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $5.00 billion.     The allocated carrying values of the warrant and the     Series G Preferred Stock on the date of issuance (based on     their relative fair values) were $1.14 billion and     $3.86 billion, respectively. The warrant is exercisable at     any time until October 1, 2013 and the number of     shares of common stock underlying the warrant and the exercise     price are subject to adjustment for certain dilutive events.         In October 2008, under the U.S. Department of the     Treasurys (U.S. Treasury) TARP Capital Purchase     Program, Group Inc. issued to the U.S. Treasury     10.0 million shares of Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual     Preferred Stock, Series H (Series H Preferred Stock),     and a     10-year     warrant to purchase up to 12.2 million shares of common     stock at an exercise price of $122.90 per share, for aggregate     proceeds of $10.00 billion. The allocated carrying values     of the warrant and the Series H Preferred Stock on the date     of issuance (based on their relative fair values) were     $490 million and $9.51 billion, respectively.     Cumulative dividends on the Series H Preferred Stock are     payable at 5% per annum through November 14, 2013 and     at a rate of 9% per annum thereafter. The Series H     Preferred Stock will be accreted to the redemption price of     $10.00 billion over five years. The warrant is exercisable     at any time until October 28, 2018 and the number of     shares of common stock underlying the warrant and the exercise     price are subject to adjustment for certain dilutive events. If,     on or prior to December 31, 2009, the firm receives     aggregate gross cash proceeds of at least $10 billion from     sales of Tier 1 qualifying perpetual preferred stock or     common stock, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon     exercise of the warrant will be reduced by     one-half of     the original number of shares of common stock.         Dividends declared per common share were $1.40 in 2008, $1.40 in     2007, and $1.30 in 2006. On December 15, 2008, the     Board of Directors of Group Inc. (Board) declared a dividend of     $0.4666666 per common share to be paid on     March 26, 2009 to common shareholders of record on     February 24, 2009. The dividend of $0.4666666 per     common share is reflective of a four-month period     (December 2008 through March 2009), due to the change     in the firms fiscal year-end. See Note 21 for further     information regarding the change in the firms fiscal     year-end. See below for information regarding restrictions on     the firms ability to raise its common stock dividend.         During 2008 and 2007, the firm repurchased 10.5 million and     41.2 million shares of its common stock at an average cost     per share of $193.18 and $217.29, for a total cost of     $2.04 billion and $8.96 billion, respectively. In     addition, to satisfy minimum statutory employee tax withholding     requirements related to the delivery of common stock underlying     restricted stock units, the firm cancelled 6.7 million and     4.7 million of restricted stock units with a total value of     $1.31 billion and $929 million in 2008 and 2007,     respectively.         The firms share repurchase program is intended to help     maintain the appropriate level of common equity and to     substantially offset increases in share count over time     resulting from employee     share-based     compensation. The repurchase program is effected primarily     through regular     open-market     purchases, the amounts and timing of which are determined     primarily by the firms current and projected capital     positions (i.e., comparisons of the firms desired     level of capital to its actual level of capital) but which may     also be influenced by general market conditions and the        179    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         prevailing price and trading volumes of the firms common     stock, in each case subject to the limit imposed under the     U.S. Treasurys TARP Capital Purchase Program. See     below for information regarding current restrictions on the     firms ability to repurchase common stock.         As of November 2008, the firm had 10.2 million shares     of perpetual preferred stock issued and outstanding as set forth     in the following table:                                                                             Dividend        Shares        Shares                Earliest        Redemption Value       Series         Preference         Issued         Authorized         Dividend Rate         Redemption Date         (in millions)           A            Non-cumulative               30,000                   50,000               3 month LIBOR + 0.75%,     with floor of 3.75% per annum           April 25, 2010           $       750                                                                                            B            Non-cumulative               32,000                   50,000               6.20% per annum           October 31, 2010               800                                                                                            C            Non-cumulative               8,000                   25,000               3 month LIBOR + 0.75%,     with floor of 4.00% per annum           October 31, 2010               200                                                                                            D            Non-cumulative               54,000                   60,000               3 month LIBOR + 0.67%,     with floor of 4.00% per annum           May 24, 2011               1,350                                                                                            G            Cumulative               50,000                   50,000               10.00% per annum           Date of issuance               5,500                                                                                            H            Cumulative               10,000,000                   10,000,000               5.00% per annum through     November 14, 2013 and      9.00% per annum thereafter           Date of issuance               10,000                                                                                                               10,174,000                   10,235,000                               $       18,600                                                                                                Each share of     non-cumulative     preferred stock issued and outstanding has a par value of $0.01,     has a liquidation preference of $25,000, is represented by 1,000     depositary shares and is redeemable at the firms option,     subject to the approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal     Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board), at a redemption price     equal to $25,000 plus declared and unpaid dividends.         Each share of Series G Preferred Stock issued and     outstanding has a par value of $0.01, has a liquidation     preference of $100,000 and is redeemable at the firms     option, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, at     a redemption price equal to $110,000 plus accrued and unpaid     dividends.         Each share of Series H Preferred Stock issued and     outstanding has a par value of $0.01, has a liquidation     preference of $1,000 and is redeemable at the firms     option, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, at     a redemption price equal to $1,000 plus accrued and unpaid     dividends, provided that through November 14, 2011 the     Series H Preferred Stock is redeemable only in an amount up     to the aggregate net cash proceeds received from sales of     Tier 1 qualifying perpetual preferred stock or common     stock, and only once such sales have resulted in aggregate gross     proceeds of at least $2.5 billion.         All series of preferred stock are pari passu and have a     preference over the firms common stock upon liquidation.     Dividends on each series of preferred stock, if declared, are     payable quarterly in arrears. The firms ability to declare     or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire,     its common stock is subject to certain restrictions in the event     that the firm fails to pay or set aside full dividends on the     preferred stock for the latest completed dividend period. In     addition, pursuant to the U.S. Treasurys TARP Capital     Purchase Program, until the earliest of     October 28, 2011, the redemption of all of the     Series H Preferred Stock or transfer by the     U.S. Treasury of all of the Series H Preferred Stock     to third parties, the firm must obtain the consent of the     U.S. Treasury to raise the firms common stock     dividend or to repurchase any shares of common stock or other     preferred stock, with certain exceptions (including repurchases     of shares of common stock under the firms share repurchase     program to offset dilution from     equity-based     compensation). For as long as the Series H Preferred Stock     remains outstanding, due to the limitations pursuant to the U.S.     Treasurys TARP Capital Purchase Program, the firm will     repurchase shares of common stock through its share        180    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         repurchase program only for the purpose of offsetting dilution     from     equity-based     compensation, to the extent permitted.         In 2007, the Board authorized 17,500.1 shares of perpetual     Non-Cumulative     Preferred Stock, Series E, and 5,000.1 shares of     perpetual     Non-Cumulative     Preferred Stock, Series F, in connection with the APEX     issuance. See Note 7 for further information on the APEX     issuance. Under the stock purchase contracts, Group Inc. will     issue on the relevant stock purchase dates (on or before     June 1, 2013 and September 1, 2013 for     Series E and Series F preferred stock, respectively)     one share of Series E and Series F preferred stock to     Goldman Sachs Capital II and III, respectively, for each     $100,000 principal amount of subordinated debt held by these     trusts. When issued, each share of Series E and     Series F preferred stock will have a par value of $0.01 and     a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share. Dividends on     Series E preferred stock, if declared, will be payable     semi-annually     at a fixed annual rate of 5.79% if the stock is issued prior to     June 1, 2012 and quarterly thereafter, at a rate per     annum equal to the greater of     (i) three-month     LIBOR plus 0.77% and (ii) 4.00%. Dividends on Series F     preferred stock, if declared, will be payable quarterly at a     rate per annum equal to     three-month     LIBOR plus 0.77% if the stock is issued prior to     September 1, 2012 and quarterly thereafter, at a rate     per annum equal to the greater of     (i) three-month     LIBOR plus 0.77% and (ii) 4.00%. The preferred stock may be     redeemed at the option of the firm on the stock purchase dates     or any day thereafter, subject to regulatory approval and     certain covenant restrictions governing the firms ability     to redeem or purchase the preferred stock without issuing common     stock or other instruments with     equity-like     characteristics.

Separate account     assets are included in Cash and securities segregated for     regulatory and other purposes in the consolidated     statements of financial condition.         Liabilities for future benefits and unpaid claims include     liabilities arising from reinsurance provided by the firm to     other insurers. The firm had a receivable for $1.30 billion     as of both November 2008 and November 2007, related to     such reinsurance contracts, which is reported in     Receivables from customers and counterparties in the     consolidated statements of financial condition. In addition, the     firm has ceded risks to reinsurers related to certain of its     liabilities for future benefits and unpaid claims and had a     receivable of $1.20 billion and $785 million as of     November 2008 and November 2007, respectively, related     to such reinsurance contracts, which is reported in     Receivables from customers and counterparties in the     consolidated statements of financial condition. Contracts to     cede risks to reinsurers do not relieve the firm from its     obligations to contract holders. Liabilities for future benefits     and unpaid claims include $978 million carried at fair     value under SFAS No. 159.         Reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits     represent a liability for the expected value of guaranteed     benefits in excess of projected annuity account balances. These     reserves are computed in accordance with AICPA     SOP 03-1     and are based on total payments expected to be made less total     fees expected to be assessed over the life of the contract.            (2)   Includes $784 million and     $5.95 billion related to consolidated investment funds as     of November 2008 and November 2007, respectively.              186    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)           Note 13.

These     plans generally provide benefits based on years of credited     service and a percentage of the employees eligible     compensation. The firm maintains a defined benefit pension plan     for most U.K. employees. As of April 2008, the U.K. defined     benefit plan was closed to new participants, but will continue     to accrue benefits for existing participants.         The firm also maintains a defined benefit pension plan for     substantially all U.S. employees hired prior to     November 1, 2003. As of November 2004, this plan     was closed to new participants and frozen such that existing     participants would not accrue any additional benefits. In     addition, the firm maintains unfunded postretirement benefit     plans that provide medical and life insurance for eligible     retirees and their dependents covered under these programs.         On November 30, 2007, the firm adopted     SFAS No. 158 which requires an entity to recognize in     its statement of financial condition the funded status of its     defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, measured as     the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the     benefit obligation. Upon adoption, SFAS No. 158     requires an entity to recognize previously unrecognized     actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs, and transition     obligations and assets within Accumulated other     comprehensive income/(loss) in the consolidated statements     of changes in shareholders equity. Additional minimum     pension liabilities are derecognized upon adoption of the new     standard.         As a result of adopting SFAS No. 158, the firm     recorded increases of $59 million and $253 million to     Other assets and Other liabilities and accrued     expenses, respectively, and a $194 million loss, net     of taxes, within Accumulated other comprehensive     income/(loss).        187    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO

The firms approach in determining the     long-term     rate of return for plan assets is based upon historical     financial market relationships that have existed over time with     the presumption that this trend will generally remain constant     in the future.         For measurement purposes, an annual growth rate in the per     capita cost of covered healthcare benefits of 9.30% was assumed     for the year ending November 2009. The rate was assumed to     decrease ratably to 5.00% for the year ending November 2015     and remain at that level thereafter.         The assumed cost of healthcare has an effect on the amounts     reported for the firms postretirement plans. A 1% change     in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would have the     following effects:                                                                       1% Increase       1% Decrease             2008       2007       2008       2007                 (in millions)          Service plus interest costs            $       11               $       12               $       (9       )           $       (9       )          Obligation                90                   94                   (70       )               (72       )             190    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         The following table sets forth the composition of plan assets     for the U.S. and     non-U.S. defined     benefit pension plans by asset category:                                                                       As of November             2008       2007             U.S.        Non-U.S.        U.S.        Non-U.S.               Pension         Pension         Pension         Pension           Equity securities                69       %               28       %               63       %               45       %          Debt securities                29                   7                   23                   8              Other                2                   65                   14                   47                                                                                    Total                100       %               100       %               100       %               100       %                                                                                    The investment approach of the firms U.S. and major     non-U.S. defined     benefit pension plans involves employing a sufficient level of     flexibility to capture investment opportunities as they occur,     while maintaining reasonable parameters to ensure that prudence     and care are exercised in the execution of the investment     programs. The plans employ a total return on investment     approach, whereby a mix, which is broadly similar to the actual     asset allocation as of November 2008, of equity securities,     debt securities and other assets, is targeted to maximize the     long-term     return on assets for a given level of risk. Investment risk is     measured and monitored on an ongoing basis by the firms     Retirement Committee through periodic portfolio reviews,     meetings with investment managers and annual liability     measurements.         The firm expects to contribute a minimum of $73 million to     its pension plans and $13 million to its postretirement     plans in 2009.

The firms contribution to these plans     was $208 million, $258 million and $230 million     for the years ended November 2008, November 2007 and     November 2006, respectively.        191    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)           Note 14.     Employee     Incentive Plans       Stock     Incentive Plan         The firm sponsors a stock incentive plan, The Goldman Sachs     Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (Amended SIP), which     provides for grants of incentive stock options, nonqualified     stock options, stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalent     rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, awards with     performance conditions and other     share-based     awards. In the second quarter of 2003, the Amended SIP was     approved by the firms shareholders, effective for grants     after April 1, 2003.         The total number of shares of common stock that may be issued     under the Amended SIP through 2008 may not exceed     250 million shares and, in each year thereafter, may not     exceed 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock,     determined as of the last day of the immediately preceding year,     increased by the number of shares available for awards in     previous years but not covered by awards granted in such years.     As of November 2008 and November 2007,     162.4 million and 160.6 million shares, respectively,     were available for grant under the Amended SIP.     Other     Compensation Arrangements         The firm has maintained deferred compensation plans for eligible     employees. In general, under the plans, participants were able     to defer payment of a portion of their cash year-end     compensation. During the deferral period, participants were able     to notionally invest their deferrals in certain alternatives     available under the plans. Generally, under current tax law,     participants are not subject to income tax on amounts deferred     or on any notional investment earnings until the returns are     distributed, and the firm is not entitled to a corresponding tax     deduction until the amounts are distributed. Beginning with the     2008 year, these deferred compensation plans were frozen     with respect to new contributions and the plans were terminated.     Participants generally will receive distributions of their     benefits in 2009 except that no payments will be accelerated for     certain senior executives. The firm has recognized compensation     expense for the amounts deferred under these plans. As of     November 2008 and November 2007, $220 million and     $281 million, respectively, related to these plans was     included in Other liabilities and accrued expenses     in the consolidated statements of financial condition.         The firm has a discount stock program through which     Participating Managing Directors may be permitted to acquire     restricted stock units at an effective 25% discount (for     2008 year-end compensation, the program was suspended, and     no individual was permitted to acquire discounted restricted     stock units thereunder). In prior years, the 25% discount was     effected by an additional grant of restricted stock units equal     to one-third     of the number of restricted stock units purchased by qualifying     participants. The purchased restricted stock units were 100%     vested when granted, but the shares underlying them generally     were subject to certain transfer restrictions (which were waived     in December 2008 except for certain senior executives). The     shares underlying the restricted stock units that were granted     to effect the 25% discount generally vest in equal installments     on the second and third anniversaries following the grant date     and were not transferable before the third anniversary of the     grant date (transfer restrictions on vested awards were waived     in December 2008 except for certain senior executives).     Compensation expense related to these restricted stock units is     recognized over the vesting period. The total value of     restricted stock units granted for 2007 in order to effect the     25% discount was $66 million.        192    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     Restricted     Stock Units         The firm issues restricted stock units to employees under the     Amended SIP, primarily in connection with year-end compensation     and acquisitions. Restricted stock units are valued based on the     closing price of the underlying shares at the date of grant.     Year-end restricted stock units generally vest and deliver as     outlined in the applicable restricted stock unit agreements. All     employee restricted stock unit agreements provide that vesting     is accelerated in certain circumstances, such as upon     retirement, death and extended absence. Of the total restricted     stock units outstanding as of November 2008 and     November 2007, (i) 12.0 million units and     22.0 million units, respectively, required future service     as a condition to the delivery of the underlying shares of     common stock and (ii) 43.9 million units and     51.6 million units, respectively, did not require future     service. In all cases, delivery of the underlying shares of     common stock is conditioned on the grantees satisfying certain     vesting and other requirements outlined in the award agreements.     When delivering the underlying shares to employees, the firm     generally issues new shares of common stock. The activity     related to these restricted stock units is set forth below:                                                                               Weighted Average Grant-Date              Restricted Stock        Fair Value of Restricted              Units Outstanding       Stock Units Outstanding             Future        No Future        Future        No Future              Service        Service        Service        Service               Required         Required         Required         Required           Outstanding,     November 2007 (1)                22,025,347                   51,565,557               $       180.98               $       164.94              Granted (2)(3)                1,787,746                   103,474                   154.32                   154.13              Forfeited                (898,950       )               (649,694       )               184.67                   171.40              Delivered (4)                                   (18,086,395       )                                  112.27              Vested (3)                (10,950,279       )               10,950,279                   152.06                   152.06                                                                                    Outstanding, November 2008                11,963,864                   43,883,221               $       203.19               $       183.31                                                                                              (1)   Includes restricted stock units     granted to employees in December 2007 as part of     compensation for fiscal 2007.           (2)   The weighted average grant-date     fair value of restricted stock units granted during the years     ended November 2008, November 2007 and     November 2006 was $154.31, $224.13 and $196.99,     respectively.           (3)   The aggregate fair value of awards     vested during the years ended November 2008,     November 2007 and November 2006 was     $1.03 billion, $5.63 billion and $4.40 billion,     respectively.           (4)   Includes restricted stock units     that were cash settled.           Stock     Options         Stock options granted to employees generally vest as outlined in     the applicable stock option agreement and generally first become     exercisable on or after the third anniversary of the grant date.     Other than the options granted in December 2007 related to     2007 compensation, no options were granted during fiscal 2008.     Year-end stock options for 2007 become exercisable in     January 2011 and expire on November 24, 2017.     Shares received on exercise prior to January 2013 for     year-end 2007 options cannot be sold, transferred or otherwise     disposed of until January 2013. All employee stock option     agreements provide that vesting is accelerated in certain     circumstances, such as upon retirement, death and extended     absence. In general, all stock options expire on the tenth     anniversary of the grant date, although they may be subject to     earlier termination or cancellation under certain circumstances     in accordance with the terms of the Amended SIP and the     applicable stock option agreement.

Fair value     was estimated as of the grant date based on a Black-Scholes     option-pricing model principally using the following weighted     average assumptions:                                                           Year Ended November             2008 (1)       2007       2006      Risk-free     interest rate                N/A                   4.0       %               4.6       %          Expected volatility                N/A                   35.0                   27.5              Dividend yield                N/A                   0.7                   0.7              Expected life                N/A                   7.5 years                   7.5 years                        (1)   There were no options granted     during fiscal 2008 other than those related to 2007 compensation     and included in the 2007 disclosures above.              194    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         The common stock underlying the options granted for 2007 and     2006 is subject to transfer restrictions for a period of     2 years and 1 year, respectively, from the date the     options become exercisable. The value of the common stock     underlying the options granted for 2007 and 2006 reflects a     liquidity discount of 24.0% and 17.5%, respectively, as a result     of these transfer restrictions. The liquidity discount was based     on the firms     pre-determined     written liquidity discount policies. The 7.5 years expected     life of the options reflects the estimated impact of these sales     restrictions on the life of the awards.         The following table sets forth     share-based     compensation and the related tax benefit:                                                           Year Ended November             2008       2007       2006                 (in millions)      Share-based     compensation            $       1,587               $       4,549               $       3,669              Excess tax benefit related to options exercised                144                   469                   542              Excess tax benefit related to     share-based     compensation (1)                645                   908                   653                        (1)   Represents the tax benefit,     recognized in additional     paid-in     capital, on stock options exercised and the delivery of common     stock underlying restricted stock units.               As of November 2008, there was $1.25 billion of total     unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested     share-based     compensation arrangements. This cost is expected to be     recognized over a weighted average period of 1.84 years.         On December 17, 2008 the firm granted     20.6 million restricted stock units and 36.0 million     stock options to its employees. The restricted stock units and     options require future service and are subject to additional     vesting conditions as outlined in the award agreements.     Generally shares underlying RSUs are delivered and stock options     become exercisable shortly after vesting, but are subject to     certain transfer restrictions. These grants are not included in     the above tables.           Note 15.     Transactions     with Affiliated Funds           The firm has formed numerous nonconsolidated investment funds     with     third-party     investors. The firm generally acts as the investment manager for     these funds and, as such, is entitled to receive management fees     and, in certain cases, advisory fees, incentive fees or     overrides from these funds. These fees amounted to     $3.14 billion, $3.62 billion and $3.37 billion     for the years ended November 2008, November 2007 and     November 2006, respectively. As of November 2008 and     November 2007, the fees receivable from these funds were     $861 million and $596 million, respectively.     Additionally, the firm may invest alongside the     third-party     investors in certain funds. The aggregate carrying value of the     firms interests in these funds was $14.45 billion and     $12.90 billion as of November 2008 and     November 2007, respectively.

(2)   Before netting within tax     jurisdictions.               The firm permanently reinvests eligible earnings of certain     foreign subsidiaries and, accordingly, does not accrue any     U.S. income taxes that would arise if such earnings were     repatriated. As of November 2008, this policy resulted in     an unrecognized net deferred tax liability of $1.1 billion     attributable to reinvested earnings of $11.6 billion.        196    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         During 2008, the valuation allowance was decreased by     $19 million, primarily due to the utilization of net     operating losses previously considered more likely than not to     expire unused. Net operating loss carryforwards were     $2.77 billion and $2.12 billion as of     November 2008 and November 2007, respectively.         The firm had federal net operating loss carryforwards, primarily     resulting from acquisitions, of $172 million and     $139 million as of November 2008 and     November 2007, respectively. The firm recorded a related     net deferred income tax asset of $56 million and     $44 million as of November 2008 and     November 2007, respectively. These carryforwards are     subject to annual limitations on utilization and will begin to     expire in 2016.         The firm had state and local net operating loss carryforwards,     primarily resulting from acquisitions, of $2.59 billion and     $1.62 billion as of November 2008 and     November 2007, respectively. The firm recorded a related     net deferred income tax asset of $97 million and     $21 million as of November 2008 and     November 2007, respectively. These carryforwards are     subject to annual limitations on utilization and will begin to     expire in 2012.         The firm had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of     $5 million and $306 million as of November 2008     and November 2007, respectively. The firm recorded a     related net deferred income tax asset of $84 million as of     November 2007. These carryforwards are subject to     limitation on utilization and can be carried forward     indefinitely.         The firm had foreign tax credit carryforwards of     $334 million as of November 2008. These carryforwards     are subject to limitation on utilization and will begin to     expire in 2018.         The firm adopted the provisions of FIN 48 as of     December 1, 2007 and recorded a transition adjustment     resulting in a reduction of $201 million to beginning     retained earnings.         The following table sets forth the changes in the firms     unrecognized tax benefits from December 1, 2007 to     November 28, 2008 (in millions):                                Balance at December 1, 2007            $       1,042              Increases based on tax positions related to the current year                172              Increases based on tax positions related to prior years                264              Decreases related to tax positions of prior years                (67       )          Decreases related to settlements                (38       )                                Balance at November 2008            $       1,373                                        As of November 2008, the firms liability for     unrecognized tax benefits reported in Other liabilities     and accrued expenses in the consolidated statement of     financial condition was $1.4 billion. The firm reported a     related deferred tax asset of $625 million in Other     assets in the consolidated statement of financial     condition. If recognized, the net tax benefit of     $748 million would reduce the firms effective income     tax rate. As of November 2008, the firms accrued     liability for interest expense related to income tax matters and     income tax penalties was $110.9 million. The firm reports     interest expense related to income tax matters in     Provision for taxes in the consolidated statements     of earnings and income tax penalties in Other     expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. The     firm recognized $36.7 million of interest and income tax     penalties for the year ended November 2008. The firm does     not expect unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly     during the twelve months subsequent to     November 28, 2008.        197    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         The firm is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal     Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing authorities in     jurisdictions where the firm has significant business     operations, such as the United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong, Korea     and various states, such as New York. The tax years under     examination vary by jurisdiction. The firm does not expect that     potential additional assessments from these examinations will be     material to its results of operations.         Below is a table of the earliest tax years that remain subject     to examination by major jurisdiction:                                   Earliest              Tax Year              Subject to       Jurisdiction         Examination           U.S. Federal                2005        (1)          New York State and City                2004        (2)          United Kingdom                2005              Japan                2005              Hong Kong                2002              Korea                2003                        All years subsequent to the above years remain open to     examination by the taxing authorities. The firm believes that     the liability for unrecognized tax benefits it has established     is adequate in relation to the potential for additional     assessments. The resolution of tax matters is not expected to     have a material effect on the firms financial condition     but may be material to the firms operating results for a     particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating     results for that period.         A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax     rate to the firms effective income tax rate is set forth     below:                                                           Year Ended November             2008       2007       2006          U.S. federal statutory income tax rate                35.0       %               35.0       %               35.0       %          Increase related to state and local taxes, net of     U.S. income tax effects                                   1.8                   1.6              Tax credits                (4.3       )               (0.5       )               (0.6       )          Foreign operations                (29.8       )               (1.6       )               (1.3       )      Tax-exempt     income, including dividends                (5.9       )               (0.4       )               (0.4       )          Other                5.6        (1)               (0.2       ) (2)               0.2                                                                    Effective income tax rate                0.6       %               34.1       %               34.5       %                                                                          (1)   Primarily includes the effect of     FIN 48 liability increase.

Regulation           On September 21, 2008, Group Inc. became a bank     holding company under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of     1956. As of that date, the Federal Reserve Board became the     primary U.S. regulator of Group Inc., as a consolidated     entity. Prior to September 21, 2008, Group Inc. was     subject to regulation by the SEC as a Consolidated Supervised     Entity (CSE) and was subject to     group-wide     supervision and examination by the SEC and to minimum capital     standards on a consolidated basis. On     September 26, 2008, the SEC announced that it was     ending the CSE program. The firms principal     U.S. broker-dealer,     GS&Co., remains subject to regulation by the SEC.         The firm is subject to regulatory capital requirements     administered by the U.S. federal banking agencies. The     firms bank depository institution subsidiaries, including     GS Bank USA, are subject to similar capital guidelines. Under     the Federal Reserve Boards capital adequacy guidelines and     the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action (PCA) that     is applicable to GS Bank USA, the firm and its bank     depository institution subsidiaries must meet specific capital     guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets,     liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated     under regulatory reporting practices. The firm and its bank     depository institution subsidiaries capital amounts, as     well as GS Bank USAs PCA classification, are also     subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about     components, risk weightings and other factors. The firm     anticipates reporting capital ratios as follows:                         Before Group Inc. became a bank holding company, it was subject     to capital guidelines by the SEC as a CSE that were generally     consistent with those set out in the Revised Framework for the     International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital     Standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision     (Basel II). The firm currently computes and reports its     firmwide capital ratios in accordance with the Basel II     requirements as applicable to the firm when it was regulated as     a CSE for the purpose of assessing the adequacy of its capital.     Under the Basel II framework as it applied to the firm when it     was regulated as a CSE, the firm evaluates its Tier 1     Capital and Total Allowable Capital as a percentage of     Risk-Weighted     Assets (RWAs). As of November 2008, the firms Total     Capital Ratio (Total Allowable Capital as a percentage of RWAs)     was 18.9% and the firms Tier 1 Ratio (Tier 1     Capital as a percentage of RWAs) was 15.6%, in each case     calculated under the Basel II framework as it applied to the     firm when it was regulated as a CSE. The firm expects to     continue to report to investors for a period of time its     Basel II capital ratios as applicable to it when it was     regulated as a CSE.                    The regulatory capital guidelines currently applicable to bank     holding companies are based on the Capital Accord of the Basel     Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel I), with     Basel II to be phased in over time. The firm is currently     working with the Federal Reserve Board to put in place the     appropriate reporting and compliance mechanisms and     methodologies to allow reporting of the Basel I capital     ratios as of the end of March 2009.                    In addition, the firm is currently working to implement the     Basel II framework as applicable to it as a bank holding company     (as opposed to as a CSE). U.S. banking regulators have     incorporated the Basel II framework into the existing     risk-based     capital requirements by requiring that internationally active     banking organizations, such as Group Inc., transition to Basel     II over the next several years.          199    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         The Federal Reserve Board also has established minimum leverage     ratio guidelines. The firm was not subject to these guidelines     before becoming a bank holding company and, accordingly, is     currently working with the Federal Reserve Board to finalize its     methodology for calculating this ratio. The Tier 1 leverage     ratio is defined as Tier 1 capital (as applicable to the     firm as a bank holding company) divided by adjusted average     total assets (which includes adjustments for disallowed goodwill     and certain intangible assets). The minimum Tier 1 leverage     ratio is 3% for bank holding companies that have received the     highest supervisory rating under Federal Reserve Board     guidelines or that have implemented the Federal Reserve     Boards     risk-based     capital measure for market risk. Other bank holding companies     must have a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. Bank     holding companies may be expected to maintain ratios well above     the minimum levels, depending upon their particular condition,     risk profile and growth plans. As of November 2008, the     firms estimated Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.1%. This     ratio represents a preliminary estimate and may be revised in     subsequent filings as the firm continues to work with the     Federal Reserve Board to finalize the methodology for the     calculation.         The firms U.S. regulated     broker-dealer     subsidiaries include GS&Co. and Goldman Sachs     Execution & Clearing, L.P. (GSEC). GS&Co. and     GSEC are registered     U.S. broker-dealers     and futures commission merchants subject to     Rule 15c3-1     of the SEC and Rule 1.17 of the Commodity Futures Trading     Commission, which specify uniform minimum net capital     requirements, as defined, for their registrants, and also     effectively require that a significant part of the     registrants assets be kept in relatively liquid form.     GS&Co. and GSEC have elected to compute their minimum     capital requirements in accordance with the Alternative     Net Capital Requirement as permitted by     Rule 15c3-1.     As of November 2008, GS&Co. had regulatory net     capital, as defined by     Rule 15c3-1,     of $10.92 billion, which exceeded the amounts required by     $8.87 billion. As of November 2008, GSEC had     regulatory net capital, as defined by     Rule 15c3-1,     of $1.38 billion, which exceeded the amounts required by     $1.29 billion. In addition to its alternative minimum net     capital requirements, GS&Co. is also required to hold     tentative net capital in excess of $1 billion and net     capital in excess of $500 million in accordance with the     market and credit risk standards of Appendix E of     Rule 15c3-1.     GS&Co. is also required to notify the SEC in the event that     its tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. As of     November 2008 and November 2007, GS&Co. had     tentative net capital and net capital in excess of both the     minimum and the notification requirements.         As of November 2008, GS Bank USA, a New York     State-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System     and the FDIC, is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board and the     New York State Banking Department and is subject to minimum     capital requirements that (subject to certain exceptions) are     similar to those applicable to bank holding companies. GS Bank     USA was formed in November 2008 through the merger of the     firms existing Utah industrial bank (named GS Bank USA)     into the firms New York limited purpose trust company,     with the surviving company taking the name GS Bank USA. As of     November 2007, GS Bank USAs predecessor was a wholly     owned industrial bank regulated by the Utah Department of     Financial Institutions, was a member of the FDIC and was subject     to minimum capital requirements. The firm computes the capital     ratios for GS Bank USA in accordance with the Basel I     framework for purposes of assessing the adequacy of its capital.     In order to be considered a well capitalized     depository institution under the Federal Reserve Board     guidelines, GS Bank USA must maintain a Tier 1 capital     ratio of at least 6%, a total capital ratio of at least 10% and     a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. In connection with     the November 2008 asset transfer described below, GS Bank USA     agreed with the Federal Reserve Board to minimum capital ratios     in excess of these well capitalized levels.     Accordingly, for a period of time, GS Bank USA is expected     to maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8%, a total     capital ratio of at least 11% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio     of at least 6%. In November 2008, the firm contributed     subsidiaries with an aggregate of $117.16 billion in assets     into GS Bank USA (which brought total assets in     GS Bank USA        200    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)         to $145.06 billion as of November 2008). As a result, the     firm is currently working with the Federal Reserve Board to     finalize its methodology for the Basel I calculations. As     of November 2008, under Basel I, GS Bank USAs     estimated Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.9% and estimated total     capital ratio was 11.6%. In addition, GS Bank USAs     estimated Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.1%.         The deposits of GS Bank USA are insured by the FDIC to the     extent provided by law. The Federal Reserve Board requires     depository institutions to maintain cash reserves with a Federal     Reserve Bank. The reserve balance deposited by the firms     depository institution subsidiaries held at the Federal Reserve     Bank was approximately $94 million and $32 million as     of November 2008 and November 2007, respectively. GS     Bank Europe, a wholly owned credit institution, is regulated by     the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority and is subject     to minimum capital requirements. As of November 2008, GS     Bank USA and GS Bank Europe were both in compliance with all     regulatory capital requirements.         Transactions between GS Bank USA and Group Inc. and its     subsidiaries and affiliates (other than, generally, subsidiaries     of GS Bank USA) are regulated by the Federal Reserve Board.     These regulations generally limit the types and amounts of     transactions (including loans to and borrowings from GS Bank     USA) that may take place and generally require those     transactions to be on an arms-length basis.         The firm has U.S. insurance subsidiaries that are subject     to state insurance regulation and oversight in the states in     which they are domiciled and in the other states in which they     are licensed. In addition, certain of the firms insurance     subsidiaries outside of the U.S. are regulated by the     Bermuda Monetary Authority and by Lloyds (which is, in     turn, regulated by the U.K.s Financial Services Authority     (FSA)). The firms insurance subsidiaries were in     compliance with all regulatory capital requirements as of     November 2008 and November 2007.         The firms principal     non-U.S. regulated     subsidiaries include Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and     Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL). GSI, the firms     regulated U.K.     broker-dealer,     is subject to the capital requirements of the FSA. GSJCL, the     firms regulated Japanese     broker-dealer,     is subject to the capital requirements imposed by Japans     Financial Services Agency. As of November 2008 and     November 2007, GSI and GSJCL were in compliance with their     local capital adequacy requirements. Certain other     non-U.S. subsidiaries     of the firm are also subject to capital adequacy requirements     promulgated by authorities of the countries in which they     operate. As of November 2008 and November 2007, these     subsidiaries were in compliance with their local capital     adequacy requirements.         The regulatory requirements referred to above restrict Group     Inc.s ability to withdraw capital from its regulated     subsidiaries. As of November 2008 and November 2007,     approximately $26.92 billion and $18.10 billion,     respectively, of net assets of regulated subsidiaries were     restricted as to the payment of dividends to Group Inc. In     addition to limitations on the payment of dividends imposed by     federal and state laws, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC     have authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends     by the banking organizations they supervise (including     GS Bank USA) if, in the Federal Reserve Boards     opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or     unsound practice in the light of the financial condition of the     banking organization. As of November 2008, GS Bank USA was not     able to declare dividends to Group Inc. without regulatory     approval.        201    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)           Note 18.     Business     Segments           In reporting to management, the firms operating results     are categorized into the following three business segments:     Investment Banking, Trading and Principal Investments, and Asset     Management and Securities Services.     Basis of     Presentation         In reporting segments, certain of the firms business lines     have been aggregated where they have similar economic     characteristics and are similar in each of the following areas:     (i) the nature of the services they provide,     (ii) their methods of distribution, (iii) the types of     clients they serve and (iv) the regulatory environments in     which they operate.         The cost drivers of the firm taken as a whole      compensation, headcount and levels of business     activity  are broadly similar in each of the     firms business segments. Compensation and benefits     expenses within the firms segments reflect, among other     factors, the overall performance of the firm as well as the     performance of individual business units. Consequently,     pre-tax     margins in one segment of the firms business may be     significantly affected by the performance of the firms     other business segments.         The firm allocates revenues and expenses among the three     business segments. Due to the integrated nature of these     segments, estimates and judgments have been made in allocating     certain revenue and expense items. Transactions between segments     are based on specific criteria or approximate     third-party     rates. Total operating expenses include corporate items that     have not been allocated to individual business segments. The     allocation process is based on the manner in which management     views the business of the firm.         The segment information presented in the table below is prepared     according to the following methodologies:                         Revenues and expenses directly associated with each segment are     included in determining     pre-tax     earnings.                    Net revenues in the firms segments include allocations of     interest income and interest expense to specific securities,     commodities and other positions in relation to the cash     generated by, or funding requirements of, such underlying     positions. Net interest is included within segment net revenues     as it is consistent with the way in which management assesses     segment performance.                    Overhead expenses not directly allocable to specific segments     are allocated ratably based on direct segment expenses.          202    Table of Contents     THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO

Subsequent     Events           On December 15, 2008, the Board approved a change in     the firms fiscal year-end from the last Friday of November     to the last Friday of December. The change is effective for the     firms 2009 fiscal year. The firms 2009 fiscal year     began December 27, 2008 and will end     December 25, 2009, resulting in a     one-month     transition period that began November 29, 2008 and     ended December 26, 2008.         In December 2008, there was continued deterioration in the     credit of LyondellBasell Finance Company, to which the firm had     provided bridge loan financing. On January 6, 2009,     certain legal entities within the LyondellBasell Industries AF     S.C.A. group filed for bankruptcy. As a result, the firm     incurred a loss of approximately $850 million in     December 2008 from marking the bridge and bank loan     facilities held in LyondellBasell Finance Company to expected     recovery levels.        208    Table of Contents      SUPPLEMENTAL     FINANCIAL INFORMATION       Quarterly Results     (unaudited)          The following represents the firms unaudited quarterly     results for 2008 and 2007.
