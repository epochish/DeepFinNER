Financial information concerning our business segments for 2010,     2009 and 2008 (with prior periods recast to reflect our new     segment reporting) is included in Managements     Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of     Operations and the Financial Statements and     Supplementary Data, which are in Part II,     Items 7 and 8, respectively, of this     Form 10-K.     See Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     for a further breakdown of our net revenues.          2.        Includes the following expenses that have not been allocated to     our segments: (i) charitable contributions of     $345 million and $810 million for the years ended     December 2010 and December 2009, respectively;     (ii) net provisions for a number of litigation and     regulatory proceedings of $682 million, $104 million     and $(4) million for the years ended December 2010,     December 2009 and November 2008, respectively; and     (iii) real estate-related exit costs of $28 million,     $61 million and $80 million for the years ended     December 2010, December 2009 and November 2008,     respectively.        Investment     Banking          Investment Banking serves corporate and government clients     around the world. We provide financial advisory services and     help companies raise capital to strengthen and grow their     businesses. We seek to develop and maintain     long-term     relationships with a diverse global group of institutional     clients, including governments, states and municipalities. Our     goal is to deliver to our clients the entire resources of the     firm in a seamless fashion, with investment banking serving as     the main initial point of contact with Goldman Sachs.         Financial Advisory.  Financial Advisory     includes strategic advisory assignments with respect to mergers     and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense activities,     risk management, restructurings and     spin-offs.     In particular, we help clients execute large, complex     transactions for which we provide multiple services, including     one-stop     acquisition financing and cross-border structuring expertise.         We also assist our clients in managing their asset and liability     exposures and their capital. In addition, we may provide lending     commitments and bank loan and bridge loan facilities in     connection with our advisory assignments.                  2       Table of Contents         Underwriting.  The other core activity of     Investment Banking is helping companies raise capital to fund     their businesses. As a financial intermediary, our job is to     match the capital of our investing clients  who aim     to grow the savings of millions of people  with     the needs of our corporate and government clients      who need financing to generate growth, create jobs and deliver     products and services. Our underwriting activities include     public offerings and private placements, including domestic and     cross-border transactions, of a wide range of securities and     other financial instruments. Underwriting also includes revenues     from derivative transactions entered into with institutional     clients in connection with our underwriting activities.     Equity Underwriting.  We underwrite     common and preferred stock and convertible and exchangeable     securities. We regularly receive mandates for large, complex     transactions and have held a leading position in worldwide     public common stock offerings and worldwide initial public     offerings for many years.     Debt Underwriting.  We underwrite and     originate various types of debt instruments, including     investment-grade     and     high-yield     debt, bank loans and bridge loans, and emerging and growth     market debt, which may be issued by, among others, corporate,     sovereign, municipal and agency issuers. In addition, we     underwrite and originate structured securities, which include     mortgage-related     securities and other     asset-backed     securities.      Institutional     Client Services        Institutional Client Services serves our clients who come to the     firm to buy and sell financial products, raise funding and     manage risk. We do this by acting as a market maker and offering     market expertise on a global basis. Institutional Client     Services makes markets and facilitates client transactions in     fixed income, equity, currency and commodity products. In     addition, we make markets in and clear client transactions on     major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide. Market     makers provide liquidity and play a critical role in price     discovery, which contributes to the overall efficiency of the     capital markets. Our willingness to make markets, commit capital     and take risk in a broad range of products is crucial to our     client relationships.         Our clients are primarily institutions that are professional     market participants, including investment entities whose     ultimate customers include individual investors investing for     their retirement, buying insurance or putting aside surplus cash     in a deposit account.             Through our global sales force, we maintain relationships with     our clients, receiving orders and distributing investment     research, trading ideas, market information and analysis. As a     market maker, we provide prices to clients globally across     thousands of products in all major asset classes and markets. At     times we take the other side of transactions ourselves if a     buyer or seller is not readily available and at other times we     connect our clients to other parties who want to transact. Much     of this connectivity between the firm and its clients is     maintained on technology platforms and operates globally     wherever and whenever markets are open for trading.         Institutional Client Services and our other businesses are     supported by our Global Investment Research division, which, as     of December 2010, provided fundamental research on more     than 3,300 companies worldwide and over 45 national economies,     as well as on industries, currencies and commodities.         Institutional Client Services generates revenues in three ways:                      In large, highly liquid markets (such as markets for     U.S. Treasury bills or large capitalization S&P 500     stocks), we execute a high volume of transactions for our     clients for modest spreads and fees.                  In less liquid markets (such as mid-cap corporate bonds and     growth market currencies), we execute transactions for our     clients for spreads and fees that are generally somewhat larger.                  We also structure and execute transactions involving customized     or tailor-made products that address our clients risk     exposures, investment objectives or other complex needs (such as     a jet fuel hedge for an airline).           Institutional Client Services activities are organized by asset     class and include both cash and     derivative instruments. Cash refers to     trading the underlying instrument (such as a stock, bond or     barrel of oil). Derivative refers to instruments     that derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices,     reference rates and other inputs, or a combination of these     factors (such as an option, which is the right or obligation to     buy or sell a certain bond or stock index on a specified date in     the future at a certain price, or an interest rate swap, which     is the right to convert a fixed rate of interest into a floating     rate or vice versa).            3       Table of Contents       Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client     Execution.  Includes interest rate products,     credit products, mortgages, currencies and commodities.                   Interest Rate Products.  Government bonds,     money market instruments such as commercial paper, treasury     bills, repurchase agreements and other highly liquid securities     and instruments, as well as interest rate swaps, options and     other derivatives.               Credit     Products.  Investment-grade     corporate securities,     high-yield     securities, bank and secured loans, municipal securities,     emerging market and distressed debt, and credit derivatives.               Mortgages.  Commercial and residential     mortgage-related securities and loan products, and other     asset-backed     and derivative instruments.               Currencies.  Most currencies, including growth     market currencies.               Commodities.  Oil and natural gas, base,     precious and other metals, electricity, coal, agricultural and     other commodity products.       Equities.  Includes equity client execution,     commissions and fees, and securities services.     Equities Client Execution.  We make     markets in equity securities and     equity-related     products, including convertible securities, options, futures and     over-the-counter     (OTC) derivative instruments, on a global basis. As a principal,     we facilitate client transactions by providing liquidity to our     clients with large blocks of stocks or options, requiring the     commitment of our capital. In addition, we engage in insurance     activities where we reinsure and purchase portfolios of     insurance risk and acquire pension liabilities.         We also structure and execute derivatives on indices, industry     groups, financial measures and individual company stocks. We     develop strategies and provide information about portfolio     hedging and restructuring and asset allocation transactions for     our clients. We also work with our clients to create specially     tailored instruments to enable sophisticated investors to     establish or liquidate investment positions or undertake hedging     strategies. We are one of the leading participants in the     trading and development of equity derivative instruments.             Our exchange-based     market-making     activities include making markets in stocks and     exchange-traded     funds. In the United States, we are one of the leading     Designated Market Makers (DMMs) for stocks traded on the NYSE.     For ETFs, we are registered market makers on NYSE Arca. In     listed options, we are registered as a primary or lead market     maker or otherwise make markets on the International Securities     Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, NYSE Arca, the     Boston Options Exchange, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and     NYSE Amex. In futures and options on futures, we are market     makers on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board     of Trade.     Commissions and Fees.  We generate     commissions and fees from executing and clearing institutional     client transactions on major stock, options and futures     exchanges worldwide. We increasingly provide our clients with     access to electronic     low-touch     equity trading platforms, and electronic trades account for the     majority of our equity trading activity. However, a majority of     our net revenues in these activities continue to be derived from     our traditional     high-touch     handling of more complex trades. We expect both types of     activity to remain important.     Securities Services.  Includes     financing, securities lending and other prime brokerage services.                   Financing Services.  We provide financing to     our clients for their securities trading activities through     margin loans that are collateralized by securities, cash or     other acceptable collateral. We earn a spread equal to the     difference between the amount we pay for funds and the amount we     receive from our client.               Securities Lending Services.  We provide     services that principally involve borrowing and lending     securities to cover institutional clients short sales and     borrowing securities to cover our short sales and otherwise to     make deliveries into the market. In addition, we are an active     participant in     broker-to-broker     securities lending and     third-party     agency lending activities.               Other Prime Brokerage Services.  We earn fees     by providing clearing, custody and settlement services globally.     In addition, we help our hedge fund and other clients maintain     the infrastructure that supports their investing activity by     providing a suite of services from the moment a client begins     the process of establishing a new investing business. We provide     a technology platform and reporting which enables clients to     monitor their security portfolios, and manage risk exposures.              4       Table of Contents                  Investing &     Lending        Our investing and lending activities, which are typically     longer-term, include the firms investing and relationship     lending activities across various asset classes, primarily     including debt securities and loans, public and private equity     securities, and real estate. These activities include investing     directly in publicly and privately traded securities and also     through certain investment funds that we manage. We also provide     financing to our clients. We manage a diversified global     portfolio of investments in equity and debt securities and other     investments in privately negotiated transactions, leveraged     buyouts, acquisitions and investments in funds managed by     external parties.     ICBC.  We have an investment in the ordinary     shares of ICBC, the largest bank in China.     Equity Securities (excluding ICBC).  We     make corporate, real estate and infrastructure     equity-related     investments.     Debt Securities and Loans.  We make     corporate, real estate and infrastructure debt security-related     investments. In addition, we provide credit to corporate clients     through loan facilities and to     high-net-worth     individuals through secured loans.     Other.  Our other investments primarily     include our consolidated investment entities, which are entities     we hold for investment purposes strictly for capital     appreciation. These entities have a defined exit strategy and     are engaged in activities that are not closely related to our     principal businesses. We also invest directly in distressed     assets, currencies, commodities and other assets, including     power generation facilities.      Investment     Management        Investment Management provides investment and wealth advisory     services to help clients preserve and grow their financial     assets. Our clients include institutions and     high-net-worth     individuals as well as retail investors, who access our products     through a network of     third-party     distributors around the world.         We manage client assets across a broad range of asset classes     and investment strategies, including equity, fixed income and     alternative investments. Alternative investments primarily     include hedge funds, private equity, real estate, currencies,     commodities, and asset allocation strategies. Our investment     offerings include those managed on a fiduciary basis by our     portfolio managers as well as strategies managed by     third-party     managers. We offer our investments in a variety of structures,     including separately managed           accounts, mutual funds, private partnerships and other     commingled vehicles.         We also provide customized investment advisory solutions     designed to address our clients investment needs. These     solutions begin with identifying clients objectives and     continue through portfolio construction, ongoing asset     allocation and risk management and investment realization. We     draw from a variety of     third-party     managers as well as our proprietary offerings to implement     solutions for clients.         We supplement our investment advisory solutions for     high-net-worth     clients with wealth advisory services that include income and     liability management, trust and estate planning, philanthropic     giving and tax planning. We also use the firms global     securities and derivatives     market-making     capabilities to address clients specific investment needs.     Management and Other Fees.  The majority     of revenues in management and other fees is comprised of     asset-based     management fees on client assets. The fees that we charge vary     by asset class and are affected by investment performance as     well as asset inflows and redemptions. Other fees we receive     include financial counseling fees generated through our wealth     advisory services and fees related to the administration of real     estate assets.         Assets under management include only those client assets where     we earn a fee for managing assets on a discretionary basis. This     includes assets in our mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity     funds and separately managed accounts for institutional and     individual investors. Assets under management do not include the     self-directed     assets of our clients, including brokerage accounts, or     interest-bearing deposits held through our bank depository     institution subsidiaries.     Incentive Fees.  In certain circumstances, we     are also entitled to receive incentive fees based on a     percentage of a funds or a separately managed     accounts return, or when the return exceeds a specified     benchmark or other performance targets. Such fees include     overrides, which consist of the increased share of the income     and gains derived primarily from our private equity and real     estate funds when the return on a funds investments over     the life of the fund exceeds certain threshold returns.     Incentive fees are recognized only when all material     contingencies are resolved.     Transaction Revenues.

Our Business Continuity Program has been     developed to provide reasonable assurance of business continuity     in the event of disruptions at the firms critical     facilities and to comply with regulatory requirements, including     those of FINRA. Because we are a bank holding company, our     Business Continuity Program is also subject to review by the     Federal Reserve Board. The key elements of the program are     crisis management, people recovery facilities, business     recovery, systems and data recovery, and process improvement. In     the area of information security, we have developed and     implemented a framework of principles, policies and technology     to protect the information assets of the firm and our clients.     Safeguards are applied to maintain the confidentiality,     integrity and availability of information resources.          Employees          Management believes that a major strength and principal reason     for the success of Goldman Sachs is the quality and     dedication of our people and the shared sense of being part     of a team. We strive to maintain a work environment that fosters     professionalism, excellence, diversity, cooperation among our     employees worldwide and high standards of business ethics.         Instilling the Goldman Sachs culture in all employees is a     continuous process, in which training plays an important part.     All employees are offered the opportunity to participate in     education and periodic seminars that we sponsor at various     locations throughout the world. Another important part of     instilling the Goldman Sachs culture is our employee review     process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors, co-workers and     employees they supervise in a     360-degree     review process that is integral to our team approach, and     includes an evaluation of an employees performance with     respect to risk management, compliance and diversity.         As of December 2010, we had 35,700 total staff, excluding     staff at consolidated entities held for investment purposes. See     Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial     Condition and Results of Operations  Results of     Operations  Operating Expenses in Part II,     Item 7 of this     Form 10-K     for additional information on our consolidated entities held for     investment purposes.                  6       Table of Contents       Competition             The financial services industry  and all of our     businesses  are intensely competitive, and we expect     them to remain so. Our competitors are other entities that     provide investment banking, securities and investment management     services, as well as those entities that make investments in     securities, commodities, derivatives, real estate, loans and     other financial assets. These entities include brokers and     dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, insurance     companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds,     private equity funds and merchant banks. We compete with some     entities globally and with others on a regional, product or     niche basis. Our competition is based on a number of factors,     including transaction execution, our products and services,     innovation, reputation and price.         We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining     qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete     effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new     employees, retain and motivate our existing employees and to     continue to compensate employees competitively amid intense     public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensation practices of     large financial institutions. Our pay practices and those of our     principal competitors are subject to review by, and the     standards of, the Federal Reserve Board and regulators outside     the United States, including the Financial Services Authority     (FSA) in the United Kingdom. See Regulation      Banking Regulation and Regulation      Compensation Practices below and Risk     Factors  Our businesses may be adversely affected if     we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees in     Part I, Item 1A of this     Form 10-K     for more information on the regulation of our compensation     practices.         Over time, there has been substantial consolidation and     convergence among companies in the financial services industry.     This trend accelerated in recent years as the credit crisis     caused numerous mergers and asset acquisitions among industry     participants. Many commercial banks and other     broad-based     financial services firms have had the ability for some time to     offer a wide range of products, from loans, deposit-taking and     insurance to brokerage, asset management and investment banking     services, which may enhance their competitive position. They     also have had the ability to support investment banking and     securities products with commercial banking, insurance and other     financial services revenues in an effort to gain market share,     which has resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking     and client execution           businesses and could result in pricing pressure in other of our     businesses.         Moreover, we have faced, and expect to continue to face,     pressure to retain market share by committing capital to     businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may     not be commensurate with their risks. In particular, corporate     clients seek such commitments (such as agreements to participate     in their commercial paper backstop or other loan facilities)     from financial services firms in connection with investment     banking and other assignments.         Consolidation and convergence have significantly increased the     capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitors,     and have also hastened the globalization of the securities and     other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to     commit capital to support our international operations and to     execute large global transactions. To take advantage of some of     our most significant challenges and opportunities, we will have     to compete successfully with financial institutions that are     larger and have more capital and that may have a stronger local     presence and longer operating history outside the United States.         We have experienced intense price competition in some of our     businesses in recent years. For example, over the past several     years the increasing volume of trades executed electronically,     through the internet and through alternative trading systems,     has increased the pressure on trading commissions, in that     commissions for     low-touch     electronic trading are generally lower than for     high-touch non-electronic     trading. It appears that this trend toward electronic and other     low-touch, low-commission     trading will continue. In addition, we believe that we will     continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other     areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain     market share by further reducing prices.         The provisions of the     U.S. Dodd-Frank     Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act)     and other financial regulation could affect our competitive     position to the extent that limitations on activities, increased     fees and compliance costs or other regulatory requirements do     not apply, or do not apply equally, to all of our competitors.     The impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our competitive position     will depend to a large extent on the details of the required     rulemaking, as discussed further under Regulation     below.                  7       Table of Contents       Regulation             As a participant in the banking, securities, futures and options     and insurance industries, we are subject to extensive regulation     worldwide. Regulatory bodies around the world are generally     charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and     other financial markets and with protecting the interests of the     customers of market participants, including depositors in     banking entities and the customers of     broker-dealers.     They are not, however, generally charged with protecting the     interests of security holders.         The financial services industry has been the subject of intense     regulatory scrutiny in recent years. Our businesses have been     subject to increasing regulation in the United States and other     countries, and we expect this trend to continue in the future.     The Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted in July 2010,     significantly alters the framework within which we operate,     including through the creation of a new systemic risk oversight     body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). The FSOC     will oversee and coordinate the efforts of the primary     U.S. financial regulatory agencies (including the Federal     Reserve Board, the SEC, the CFTC and the FDIC) in establishing     regulations to address financial stability concerns. The     Dodd-Frank Act directs the FSOC to make recommendations to the     Federal Reserve Board as to supervisory requirements and     prudential standards applicable to systemically important     financial institutions, including     risk-based     capital, leverage, liquidity and     risk-management     requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates that the requirements     applicable to systemically important financial institutions be     more stringent than those applicable to other financial     companies. Although the criteria for treatment as a systemically     important financial institution have not yet been determined, it     is probable that they will apply to our firm.         The implications of the Dodd-Frank Act for our businesses will     depend to a large extent on the provisions of required future     rulemaking by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the SEC, the CFTC     and other agencies, as well as the development of market     practices and structures under the regime established by the     legislation and the rules adopted pursuant to it, as discussed     further throughout this section.         Banking     Regulation       In September 2008, Group Inc. became a bank holding     company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act) and     the Federal Reserve Board became the primary regulator of     Group Inc., as a consolidated entity. In August 2009,     Group Inc. became a financial holding company under     amendments to the BHC Act effected by the     U.S. Gramm-Leach-Bliley     Act of 1999 (GLB Act).     Supervision and     Regulation       As a bank holding company and a financial holding company under     the BHC Act, Group Inc. is subject to supervision and     examination by the Federal Reserve Board. Under the system of     functional regulation established under the BHC Act,     the Federal Reserve Board serves as the primary regulator of our     consolidated organization, but generally defers to the primary     regulators of our     U.S. non-bank     subsidiaries with respect to the activities of those     subsidiaries. Such functionally regulated     non-bank     subsidiaries include     broker-dealers     registered with the SEC, such as our principal     U.S. broker-dealer,     Goldman, Sachs & Co. (GS&Co.), insurance     companies regulated by state insurance authorities, investment     advisers registered with the SEC with respect to their     investment advisory activities and entities regulated by the     CFTC with respect to certain futures-related activities.     Activities       The BHC Act generally restricts bank holding companies from     engaging in business activities other than the business of     banking and certain closely related activities. As a financial     holding company, we may engage in a broader range of financial     and related activities than are permissible for bank holding     companies as long as we continue to meet the  eligibility     requirements for financial holding companies, including our     U.S. depository institution subsidiaries (consisting of     GS Bank USA and our national bank trust company subsidiary)     maintaining their status as well-capitalized and     well-managed as described under      Prompt Corrective Action below. These     activities include underwriting, dealing and making markets in     securities, insurance underwriting and making investments in     nonfinancial companies. In addition, we are permitted under the     GLB Act to continue to engage in certain commodities     activities in the United States that would otherwise be     impermissible for bank holding companies, so long as the assets     held pursuant to these activities do not equal 5% or more of our     consolidated assets.            8       Table of Contents           Beginning in July 2011, our financial holding company     status will also depend on Group Inc.s maintaining     its status as well-capitalized and     well-managed.         As a bank holding company, we are required to obtain prior     Federal Reserve Board approval before directly or indirectly     acquiring more than 5% of any class of voting shares of any     unaffiliated depository institution. In addition, as a bank     holding company, we may generally engage in banking and other     financial activities abroad, including investing in and owning     non-U.S. banks,     if those activities and investments do not exceed certain limits     and, in some cases, if we have obtained the prior approval of     the Federal Reserve Board.         We expect to face additional limitations on our activities upon     implementation of those provisions of the     Dodd-Frank     Act referred to as the Volcker Rule, which will     prohibit proprietary trading (other than for certain     risk-mitigation     activities) and limit the sponsorship of, and investment in,     hedge funds and private equity funds by banking entities,     including bank holding companies such as us. The extent of the     additional limitations will depend on the details of agency     rulemaking. The Volcker Rule provisions will take effect no     later than July 2012, and companies will be required to     come into compliance within two years after the effective date     (subject to possible extensions).     Capital and     Liquidity Requirements       As a bank holding company, we are subject to consolidated     regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal     Reserve Board. GS Bank USA is subject to broadly similar     capital requirements, as discussed below. Under the Federal     Reserve Boards capital adequacy requirements and the     regulatory framework for prompt corrective action that is     applicable to GS Bank USA, Group Inc. and GS Bank     USA must meet specific regulatory capital requirements that     involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain     off-balance-sheet     items. The calculation of our capital levels and those of     GS Bank USA, as well as GS Bank USAs prompt     corrective action classification, are also subject to     qualitative judgments by regulators.     Tier 1 Leverage and Basel I Capital     Ratios.  See Note 20 to the consolidated     financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     for information on our Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1     capital, total capital,     risk-weighted     assets and Tier 1 leverage ratio, and for a discussion of     minimum required ratios.         Pending Changes in Capital Requirements.  We     are currently working to implement the requirements set out in     the Federal Reserve Boards Capital Adequacy Guidelines for     Bank Holding Companies: Internal Ratings-Based and Advanced     Measurement Approaches, which are based on the advanced     approaches under the Revised Framework for the International     Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards issued     by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee)     as such requirements apply to us as a bank holding company     (Basel 2). U.S. banking regulators have incorporated     the Basel 2 framework into the existing     risk-based     capital requirements by requiring that internationally active     banking organizations, such as us, transition to Basel 2     following the successful completion of a parallel run.         In addition, the Basel Committee has undertaken a program of     substantial revisions to its capital guidelines. In particular,     the changes in the Basel 2.5 guidelines will     result in increased capital requirements for market risk.     Additionally, the Basel 3 guidelines issued by the Basel     Committee in December 2010 revise the definition of     Tier 1 capital, introduce Tier 1 common equity as a     regulatory metric, set new minimum capital ratios (including a     new capital conservation buffer, which must be     composed exclusively of Tier 1 common equity and will be in     addition to the other capital ratios), introduce a Tier 1     leverage ratio within international guidelines for the first     time, and make substantial revisions to the computation of     risk-weighted     assets for credit exposures. Implementation of the new     requirements is expected to take place over an extended     transition period, starting at the end of 2011 (for     Basel 2.5) and end of 2012 (for Basel 3). Although the     U.S. federal banking agencies have now issued proposed     rules that are intended to implement certain aspects of the     Basel 2.5 guidelines, they have not yet addressed all     aspects of those guidelines or the Basel 3 changes. In     addition, both the Basel Committee and U.S. banking     regulators implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have indicated that     they will impose more stringent capital standards on     systemically important financial institutions. Therefore, the     regulations ultimately applicable to us may be substantially     different from those that have been published to date.            9       Table of Contents           The Dodd-Frank Act will subject Goldman Sachs at a firmwide     level to the same leverage and     risk-based     capital requirements that apply to depository institutions, and     directs banking regulators to impose additional capital     requirements, as discussed above. The Federal Reserve Board will     be required to begin implementing the new leverage and     risk-based     capital regulation by January 2012. As a consequence of     these changes, Tier 1 capital treatment for our junior     subordinated debt issued to trusts and our cumulative preferred     stock will be phased out over a three-year period beginning on     January 1, 2013. The interaction between the     Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel Committees proposed changes     adds further uncertainty to our future capital requirements. For     example, regulations implementing provisions of the Dodd-Frank     Act are expected to subject us to a continuing floor     of the Federal Reserve Boards regulatory requirements     currently applicable to bank holding companies (Basel 1),     which are based on the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee, in     cases where Basel 2 or Basel 3 would otherwise permit lower     capital requirements.     Liquidity Ratios under Basel 3.  Historically,     regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company     liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, both in     the U.S. and internationally, without required formulaic     measures. Basel 3 will require banks and bank holding companies     to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests     that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures     historically applied by banks and regulators for management and     supervisory purposes, will be required by regulation. One test,     referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio, is designed to     ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of     unencumbered     high-quality     liquid assets equal to the entitys expected net cash     outflow for a     30-day time     horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow)     under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other, referred to     as the net stable funding ratio, is designed to promote more     medium- and     long-term     funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a     one-year     time horizon. These requirements may incent banking entities to     increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and     other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the     use of     long-term     debt as a funding source. The liquidity coverage ratio would be     implemented subject to an observation period beginning in 2011,     but would not be introduced as a requirement until     January 1, 2015, and the net stable funding ratio     would not be introduced as a requirement until     January 1, 2018. These new standards are subject to     further rulemaking and their terms may change before     implementation.         Payment of     Dividends       Dividend payments by Group Inc. to its shareholders are     subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve Board. Under     temporary guidance issued by the Federal Reserve Board in     November 2010, the dividend policy of large bank holding     companies, such as Goldman Sachs, is reviewed by the Federal     Reserve Board based on capital plans and stress tests submitted     by the bank holding company, and will be assessed against, among     other things, the ability to achieve the Basel 3 capital ratio     requirements referred to above as they are phased in by     U.S. regulators and any potential impact of the Dodd-Frank     Act on the companys risk profile, business strategy,     corporate structure or capital adequacy. The Federal     Reserves current guidance provides that, for large bank     holding companies like us, dividend payout ratios exceeding 30%     of after-tax net income will receive particularly close scrutiny.         Federal and state law imposes limitations on the payment of     dividends by our depository institution subsidiaries to     Group Inc. In general, the amount of dividends that may be     paid by GS Bank USA or our national bank trust company     subsidiary is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated     under a recent earnings test and an undivided     profits test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend     may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by the     entity in any calendar year is in excess of the current     years net income combined with the retained net income of     the two preceding years, unless the entity obtains prior     regulatory approval. Under the undivided profits test, a     dividend may not be paid in excess of the entitys     undivided profits (generally, accumulated net     profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred     to surplus). While GS Bank USA could have declared     dividends of $4.63 billion to Group Inc. as of     December 2010 in accordance with these limitations, the     banking regulators have overriding authority to prohibit the     payment of any dividends by GS Bank USA. In addition to the     dividend restrictions described above, the banking regulators     have authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends     by the banking organizations they supervise if, in the banking     regulators opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute     an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial     condition of the banking organization.         In addition, certain of Group Inc.s     non-bank     subsidiaries are subject to separate regulatory limitations on     dividends and distributions, including our     broker-dealer     and our insurance subsidiaries as described below.              10       Table of Contents       Source of     Strength       Federal Reserve Board policy historically has required bank     holding companies to act as a source of strength to their bank     subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to     support those subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act codifies this     policy as a statutory requirement. This support may be required     by the Federal Reserve Board at times when we might otherwise     determine not to provide it. Capital loans by a bank holding     company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment     to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary     bank. In the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy,     any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank     regulator to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be     assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority     payment.         However, because the BHC Act provides for functional regulation     of bank holding company activities by various regulators, the     BHC Act prohibits the Federal Reserve Board from requiring     payment by a holding company or subsidiary to a depository     institution if the functional regulator of the payor entity     objects to such payment. In such a case, the Federal Reserve     Board could instead require the divestiture of the depository     institution and impose operating restrictions pending the     divestiture.     Cross-guarantee     Provisions       Each insured depository institution controlled (as     defined in the BHC Act) by the same bank holding company can be     held liable to the FDIC for any loss incurred, or reasonably     expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of any     other insured depository institution controlled by that holding     company and for any assistance provided by the FDIC to any of     those depository institutions that is in danger of default. Such     a cross-guarantee claim against a depository     institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims     of the holding company and its affiliates against that     depository institution. At this time, we control only one     insured depository institution for this purpose, namely     GS Bank USA. However, if, in the future, we were to control     other insured depository institutions, the cross-guarantee would     apply to all such insured depository institutions.     Compensation     Practices       Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the     Federal Reserve Board and, with respect to some of our     subsidiaries and employees, by other financial regulatory bodies     worldwide. The scope and content of compensation regulation in     the financial industry are continuing to develop, and we expect     that these policies will evolve over a number of years.             The Dodd-Frank Act requires the U.S. financial regulators,     including the Federal Reserve Board, to establish joint     regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment     arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least     $1 billion in total assets (which would include     Group Inc. and some of its depositary institution,     broker-dealer     and investment advisor subsidiaries) that encourage     inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee,     director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation,     fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss     to the entity. In addition, these regulators must establish     regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to     regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. The     initial version of these regulations was proposed by the FDIC in     February 2011 and the regulations may become effective     before the end of 2011. If the regulations are adopted in the     form initially proposed, they will impose limitations on the     manner in which we may structure compensation for our executives.         In June 2010, the Federal Reserve Board and other financial     regulators jointly issued guidance designed to ensure that     incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations     take into account risk and are consistent with safe and     sound practices. The guidance sets forth the following three key     principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements:     the arrangements should provide employees incentives that     appropriately balance risk and financial results in     a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their     organizations to imprudent risk; the arrangements should be     compatible with effective controls and risk management; and the     arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance.     These three principles are incorporated into the proposed joint     compensation regulations under     Dodd-Frank,     discussed above. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has     conducted a review of the incentive compensation policies and     practices of a number of large, complex banking organizations,     including us. The June 2010 guidance provides that     supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will     be incorporated, as appropriate, into the organizations     supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make     acquisitions or perform other actions. The guidance also     provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking     organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or     related risk management, control or governance processes pose a     risk to the organizations safety and soundness.            11       Table of Contents           The Financial Stability Board, established at the direction of     the leaders of the Group of 20, has released standards for     implementing certain compensation principles for banks and other     financial companies designed to encourage sound compensation     practices. These standards are to be implemented by local     regulators. In July 2010, the European Parliament adopted     amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive designed to     implement the Financial Stability Boards compensation     standards within the EU. Regulators in a number of countries,     including the United Kingdom, France and Germany, have proposed     or adopted compensation policies or regulations applicable to     financial institutions pursuant to the Capital Requirements     Directive. These are in addition to the proposals and guidance     issued by U.S. financial regulators discussed above.     GS Bank     USA       Our subsidiary, GS Bank USA, an FDIC-insured, New York     State-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System     and the FDIC, is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board and the     New York State Banking Department and is subject to minimum     capital requirements (described further below) that are     calculated in a manner similar to those applicable to bank     holding companies. A number of our activities are conducted     partially or entirely through GS Bank USA and its     subsidiaries, including: origination of and market making in     bank loans; interest rate, credit, currency and other     derivatives; leveraged finance; commercial and residential     mortgage origination, trading and servicing; structured finance;     and agency lending, custody and hedge fund administration     services. These activities are subject to regulation by the     Federal Reserve Board, the New York State Banking Department and     the FDIC.         The Dodd-Frank Act contains derivative push-out     provisions that, beginning in July 2012, will essentially     prevent us from conducting certain     swaps-related     activities through GS Bank USA or another insured     depository institution subsidiary, subject to exceptions for     certain interest rate and currency swaps and for hedging or risk     mitigation activities directly related to the banks     business. These precluded activities may be conducted elsewhere     within the firm, subject to certain requirements.         Transactions with     Affiliates       Transactions between GS Bank USA and Group Inc. and     its subsidiaries and affiliates are regulated by the Federal     Reserve Board. These regulations limit the types and amounts of     transactions (including loans to and credit extensions from     GS Bank USA) that may take place and generally require     those transactions to be on an arms-length basis. These     regulations generally do not apply to transactions between     GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act     significantly expands the coverage and scope of the regulations     that limit affiliate transactions within a banking organization,     including coverage of the credit exposure on derivative     transactions, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements,     securities borrowing and lending transactions, and transactions     with sponsored hedge funds and private equity funds.         In November 2008, Group Inc. transferred assets and     operations to GS Bank USA. In connection with this     transfer, Group Inc. entered into a guarantee agreement     with GS Bank USA whereby Group Inc. agreed to     (i) purchase from GS Bank USA certain transferred     assets (other than derivatives and mortgage servicing rights) or     reimburse GS Bank USA for certain losses relating to those     assets; (ii) reimburse GS Bank USA for     credit-related     losses from assets transferred to GS Bank USA;     (iii) protect GS Bank USA or reimburse it for certain     losses arising from derivatives and mortgage servicing rights     transferred to GS Bank USA; and (iv) pledge collateral     to GS Bank USA.         The Dodd-Frank Act will require us to prepare and provide to     regulators a resolution plan (a so-called living     will) that must, among other things, ensure that our     depository institution subsidiaries are adequately protected     from risks arising from our other subsidiaries. The     establishment and maintenance of this resolution plan may, as a     practical matter, present additional constraints on our entity     structure and transactions among our subsidiaries.            12       Table of Contents       Deposit     Insurance       GS Bank USA accepts deposits, and those deposits have the     benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limits. The     FDICs Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on     insured depository institutions, such as GS Bank USA, and     these assessments are currently based on the risk category of an     institution and the amount of insured deposits that it holds.     The FDIC required all insured depository institutions to prepay     estimated assessments for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012 on     December 30, 2009. The FDIC may increase or decrease     the assessment rate schedule on a     semi-annual     basis. In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC amended     its regulations, effective April 1, 2011, to base insurance     assessments on the average total consolidated assets less the     average tangible equity of the insured depository institution     during the assessment period.     Prompt Corrective     Action       The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement     Act of 1991 (FDICIA), among other things, requires the federal     banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in     respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified     capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital categories     for FDIC-insured banks: well-capitalized, adequately     capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized     and critically undercapitalized.         A depository institution is generally deemed to be     well-capitalized,     the highest category, if it has a Tier 1 capital ratio of     at least 6%, a total capital ratio of at least 10% and a     Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. In connection with     the November 2008 asset transfer described under     Transactions with Affiliates below, GS Bank USA     agreed with the Federal Reserve Board to maintain minimum     capital ratios in excess of these well-capitalized     levels.         See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     for information on the calculation of GS Bank USAs     capital ratios under Basel 1 and for a discussion of     minimum required ratios.         GS Bank USA computes its capital ratios in accordance with     the regulatory capital requirements currently applicable to     state member banks, which are based on Basel 1 as implemented by     the Federal Reserve Board. An institution may be downgraded to,     or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than is     indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an     unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory     examination rating with respect to certain matters. FDICIA     imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on     operations, management and capital distributions, as the capital     category of an institution           declines. Failure to meet the capital requirements could also     subject a depository institution to capital raising     requirements. Ultimately, critically undercapitalized     institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or     conservator.         The prompt corrective action regulations apply only to     depository institutions and not to bank holding companies such     as Group Inc. However, the Federal Reserve Board is     authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company     level, based upon the undercapitalized status of the holding     companys depository institution subsidiaries. In certain     instances relating to an undercapitalized depository institution     subsidiary, the bank holding company would be required to     guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized     subsidiarys capital restoration plan and might be liable     for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments     on that guarantee. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy     of the holding company, the guarantee would take priority over     the holding companys general unsecured creditors.     Insolvency of an     Insured Depository Institution or a Bank Holding     Company       If the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of an     insured depository institution such as GS Bank USA, upon     its insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has the     power:                      to transfer any of the depository institutions assets and     liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the     depository institutions creditors;                  to enforce the terms of the depository institutions     contracts pursuant to their terms; or                  to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the     depository institution is a party, the performance of which is     determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or     repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the     orderly administration of the depository institution.           In addition, under federal law, the claims of holders of deposit     liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses     against an insured depository institution would be afforded a     priority over other general unsecured claims against such an     institution, including claims of debt holders of the     institution, in the liquidation or other resolution     of such an institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or     not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of     GS Bank USA, the debt holders would be treated differently     from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than,     the depositors of the depository institution.            13       Table of Contents           The Dodd-Frank Act creates a resolution regime for systemically     important     non-bank     financial companies, including bank holding companies and their     affiliates, under which the FDIC may be appointed receiver to     liquidate the entity. This resolution authority was based on the     FDIC resolution model for depository institutions, with certain     modifications to reflect differences between depository     institutions and     non-bank     financial companies and to reduce disparities between the     treatment of creditors claims under the     U.S. Bankruptcy Code and in an orderly liquidation     authority proceeding compared to those that would exist under     the resolution model for depository institutions.     Trust Companies       Group Inc.s two limited purpose trust company     subsidiaries are not permitted to and do not accept deposits or     make loans (other than as incidental to their trust     activities) and, as a result, are not insured by the FDIC. The     Goldman Sachs Trust Company, N.A., a national banking     association that is limited to fiduciary activities, is     regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency     and is a member bank of the Federal Reserve System. The Goldman     Sachs Trust Company of Delaware, a Delaware limited purpose     trust company, is regulated by the Office of the Delaware State     Bank Commissioner.     U.S. Securities     and Commodities Regulation       Goldman Sachs     broker-dealer     subsidiaries are subject to regulations that cover all aspects     of the securities business, including sales methods, trade     practices, use and safekeeping of clients funds and     securities, capital structure, recordkeeping, the financing of     clients purchases, and the conduct of directors, officers     and employees. In the United States, the SEC is the federal     agency responsible for the administration of the federal     securities laws. GS&Co. is registered as a     broker-dealer,     a municipal advisor and an investment adviser with the SEC and     as a     broker-dealer     in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.     Self-regulatory organizations, such as FINRA and the NYSE, adopt     rules that apply to, and examine,     broker-dealers     such as GS&Co.         In addition, state securities and other regulators also have     regulatory or oversight authority over GS&Co. Similarly,     our businesses are also subject to regulation by various     non-U.S. governmental     and regulatory bodies and self-regulatory authorities in     virtually all countries where we have offices. Goldman Sachs     Execution & Clearing, L.P. (GSEC) and one of its     subsidiaries are registered     U.S. broker-dealers     and are           regulated by the SEC, the NYSE and FINRA. Goldman Sachs     Financial Markets, L.P. is registered with the SEC as an OTC     derivatives dealer and conducts certain OTC derivatives     activities.         The commodity futures and commodity options industry in the     United States is subject to regulation under the     U.S. Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The CFTC is the federal     agency charged with the administration of the CEA. Several of     Goldman Sachs subsidiaries, including GS&Co. and     GSEC, are registered with the CFTC and act as futures commission     merchants, commodity pool operators or commodity trading     advisors and are subject to CEA regulations. The rules and     regulations of various self-regulatory organizations, such as     the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,     other futures exchanges and the National Futures Association,     also govern the commodity futures and commodity options     activities of these entities.         For a discussion of net capital requirements applicable to     GS&Co. and GSEC, see Note 20 to the consolidated     financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K.         Our exchange-based     market-making     activities are subject to extensive regulation by a number of     securities exchanges. As a DMM on the NYSE and as a market maker     on other exchanges, we are required to maintain orderly markets     in the securities to which we are assigned. Under the     NYSEs DMM rules, this may require us to supply liquidity     to these markets in certain circumstances.         J. Aron & Company is authorized by the     U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to sell     wholesale physical power at     market-based     rates. As a FERC-authorized power marketer, J. Aron &     Company is subject to regulation under the U.S. Federal     Power Act and FERC regulations and to the oversight of FERC. As     a result of our investing activities, GS&Co. is also an     exempt holding company under the U.S. Public     Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and applicable FERC rules.         In addition, as a result of our power-related and commodities     activities, we are subject to extensive and evolving energy,     environmental and other governmental laws and regulations, as     discussed under Risk     Factors  Our     commodities activities, particularly our power generation     interests and our physical commodities activities, subject us to     extensive regulation, potential catastrophic events and     environmental, reputational and other risks that may expose us     to significant liabilities and costs in Part I,     Item 1A of this     Form 10-K.            14       Table of Contents           The Dodd-Frank Act will result in additional regulation of our     broker-dealer     and regulated subsidiaries in a number of respects. The     legislation calls for the imposition of expanded standards of     care by market participants in dealing with clients and     customers, including by providing the SEC with authority to     adopt rules establishing fiduciary duties for     broker-dealers     and directing the SEC to examine and improve sales practices and     disclosure by     broker-dealers     and investment advisers. The Dodd-Frank Act also contains     provisions designed to increase transparency in     over-the-counter     derivatives markets by requiring the registration of all swap     dealers and     security-based     swap dealers, and the clearing and execution of     swaps through regulated facilities (subject to     limited exceptions, including swaps with     non-financial     end users and swaps that are not cleared by a clearing agency).     Furthermore, federal banking agencies are required under the     Dodd-Frank Act to develop rules whereby anyone who organizes or     initiates an     asset-backed     security transaction must retain a portion (generally, at least     five percent) of any credit risk that the person conveys to a     third party.     Other Regulation     in the United States       Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to state     insurance regulation and oversight in the states in which they     are domiciled and in the other states in which they are     licensed, and Group Inc. is subject to oversight as an     insurance holding company in states where our insurance     subsidiaries are domiciled. State insurance regulations limit     the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to     Group Inc. in certain circumstances, and could require     regulatory approval for any change in control of     Group Inc., which may include control of 10% or more of our     voting stock. In addition, a number of our other activities,     including our lending and mortgage activities, require us to     obtain licenses, adhere to applicable regulations and be subject     to the oversight of various regulators in the states in which we     conduct these activities.         The U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), as amended by the USA     PATRIOT Act of 2001 (PATRIOT Act), contains     anti-money     laundering and financial transparency laws and mandated the     implementation of various regulations applicable to all     financial institutions, including standards for verifying client     identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor     client transactions and report suspicious activities. Through     these and other provisions, the BSA and the PATRIOT Act seek to     promote the identification of parties that may be involved in     terrorism, money laundering or other suspicious activities.     Anti-money laundering laws outside the United States contain     some similar           provisions. The obligation of financial institutions, including     Goldman Sachs, to identify their clients, to monitor for and     report suspicious transactions, to respond to requests for     information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement     agencies, and to share information with other financial     institutions, has required the implementation and maintenance of     internal practices, procedures and controls that have increased,     and may continue to increase, our costs, and any failure with     respect to our programs in this area could subject us to     substantial liability and regulatory fines.     Regulation Outside     the United States       Goldman Sachs provides investment services in and from the     United Kingdom under the regulation of the FSA. Goldman Sachs     International (GSI), our regulated U.K.     broker-dealer,     is subject to the capital requirements imposed by the FSA. Other     subsidiaries, including Goldman Sachs International Bank (GSIB),     our regulated U.K. bank, are also regulated by the FSA. As of     December 2010, GSI and GSIB were in compliance with the FSA     capital requirements.         Goldman Sachs Bank (Europe) PLC (GS Bank Europe), our     regulated Irish bank, is subject to minimum capital requirements     imposed by the Central Bank of Ireland. As of     December 2010, this bank was in compliance with all     regulatory capital requirements. Group Inc. has issued a     general guarantee of the obligations of this bank.         Various other Goldman Sachs entities are regulated by the     banking, insurance and securities regulatory authorities of the     European countries in which they operate, including, among     others, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and     the Bundesbank in Germany, the Autorité de Contrôle     Prudentiel and the Autorité des Marchés Financiers in     France, Banca dItalia and the Commissione Nazionale per le     Società e la Borsa (CONSOB) in Italy, the Federal Financial     Markets Service and the Central Bank of the Russian Federation     in Russia and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority.     Certain Goldman Sachs entities are also regulated by the     European securities, derivatives and commodities exchanges of     which they are members.            15       Table of Contents           The investment services that are subject to oversight by the FSA     and other regulators within the European Union (EU) are     regulated in accordance with national laws, many of which     implement EU directives requiring, among other things,     compliance with certain capital adequacy standards, customer     protection requirements and market conduct and trade reporting     rules. These standards, requirements and rules are generally     implemented in a similar manner, under the same directives,     throughout the EU.         The EU has adopted risk retention requirements applicable to     asset-backed     security offerings similar to those required under the     Dodd-Frank Act, as well as enhanced disclosure requirements     applicable to such offerings.         Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), our regulated Japanese     broker-dealer,     is subject to the capital requirements imposed by Japans     Financial Services Agency. As of December 2010, GSJCL was     in compliance with its capital adequacy requirements. GSJCL is     also regulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Osaka Securities     Exchange, the Tokyo Financial Exchange, the Japan Securities     Dealers Association, the Tokyo Commodity Exchange and the     Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in Japan.         Also in Asia, the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong     Kong, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the China Securities     Regulatory Commission, the Korean Financial Supervisory Service,     the Reserve Bank of India and the Securities and Exchange Board     of India, among others, regulate various of our subsidiaries and     also have capital standards and other requirements comparable to     the rules of the SEC.         Various Goldman Sachs entities are regulated by the banking and     regulatory authorities in countries in which Goldman Sachs     operates, including, among others, Brazil and Dubai. In     addition, certain of our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by     the FSA and certain are regulated by the Bermuda Monetary     Authority.         Regulations     Applicable in and Outside the United States       The U.S. and     non-U.S. government     agencies, regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations,     as well as state securities commissions and other state     regulators in the United States, are empowered to conduct     administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the     issuance of cease and desist orders, or the suspension or     expulsion of a     broker-dealer     or its directors, officers or employees. From time to time, our     subsidiaries have been subject to investigations and     proceedings, and sanctions have been imposed for infractions of     various regulations relating to our activities.         The SEC and FINRA have rules governing research analysts,     including rules imposing restrictions on the interaction between     equity research analysts and investment banking personnel at     member securities firms. Various     non-U.S. jurisdictions     have imposed both substantive and disclosure-based requirements     with respect to research and may impose additional regulations.         Our investment management business is subject to significant     regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world relating     to, among other things, the safeguarding of client assets and     our management of client funds.         As discussed above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to     regulatory capital requirements in jurisdictions throughout the     world.

Cautionary     Statement Pursuant to the U.S. Private Securities     Litigation Reform Act of 1995          We have included or incorporated by reference in this     Form 10-K,     and from time to time our management may make, statements that     may constitute forward-looking statements within the     meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private     Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking     statements are not historical facts, but instead represent only     our           beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature,     are inherently uncertain and outside our control. These     statements include statements other than historical information     or statements of current condition and may relate to our future     plans and objectives and results, among other things, and may     also include our belief regarding the effect of changes to the     capital and leverage rules applicable to bank holding companies,     the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our businesses and     operations, and various legal proceedings as set forth under     Legal Proceedings in Note 30 to the     consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8     of this     Form 10-K,     as well as statements about the objectives and effectiveness of     our risk management and liquidity policies, statements about     trends in or growth opportunities for our businesses, statements     about our future status, activities or reporting under     U.S. or     non-U.S. banking     and financial regulation, and statements about our investment     banking transaction backlog.         By identifying these statements for you in this manner, we are     alerting you to the possibility that our actual results and     financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the     anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these     forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause     our actual results and financial condition to differ from those     indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among     others, those discussed below and under Risk Factors     in Part I, Item 1A of this     Form 10-K.         In the case of statements about our investment banking     transaction backlog, such statements are subject to the risk     that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that     they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues,     if any, that we actually earn from these transactions may     differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected.     Important factors that could result in a modification of the     terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed     include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or     continued weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of     hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or     an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the     securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions,     a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain     adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a     party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required     regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors     that could adversely affect our investment banking transactions,     see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of     this     Form 10-K.                  17       Table of Contents          Item 1A.     Risk     Factors              We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in     our businesses, including market, liquidity, credit,     operational, legal, regulatory and reputational risks. The     following are some of the more important factors that could     affect our businesses.     Our businesses have been and may continue to be adversely     affected by conditions in the global financial markets and     economic conditions generally.         Our businesses, by their nature, do not produce predictable     earnings, and all of our businesses are materially affected by     conditions in the global financial markets and economic     conditions generally. In the past several years, these     conditions have changed suddenly and, for a period of time, very     negatively. In 2008 and through early 2009, the financial     services industry and the securities markets generally were     materially and adversely affected by significant declines in the     values of nearly all asset classes and by a serious lack of     liquidity.         Since 2008, governments, regulators and central banks in the     United States and worldwide have taken numerous steps to     increase liquidity and to restore investor and public     confidence. In addition, there are numerous legislative and     regulatory actions that have been taken to deal with what     regulators, politicians and others believe to be the root     causes of the financial crisis, including laws and regulations     relating to financial institution capital requirements and     compensation practices, restrictions on the type of activities     in which financial institutions are permitted to engage, and     generally increased regulatory scrutiny. In some cases,     additional taxes have been (or have been proposed to be) imposed     on certain financial institutions. Many of the regulations that     are required to implement recently adopted legislation     (including the Dodd-Frank Act) are still being drafted or are     not yet in effect; therefore, the exact impact that these     regulations will have on our businesses, results of operations     and cash flows is presently unclear.             Business activity across a wide range of industries and regions     has been greatly reduced and many companies were, and some     continue to be, in serious difficulty due to reduced consumer     spending and low levels of liquidity in the credit markets.     National and local governments are facing difficult financial     conditions due to significant reductions in tax revenues,     particularly from corporate and personal income taxes, as well     as increased outlays for unemployment benefits due to high     unemployment levels and the cost of stimulus programs.         Declines in asset values, the lack of liquidity, reduced     volatility, general uncertainty about economic and market     activities and a lack of consumer, investor and CEO confidence     have negatively impacted many of our businesses.         Our financial performance is highly dependent on the environment     in which our businesses operate. A favorable business     environment is generally characterized by, among other factors,     high global gross domestic product growth, transparent, liquid     and efficient capital markets, low inflation, high business and     investor confidence, stable geopolitical conditions, and strong     business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market     conditions can be caused by: declines in economic growth,     business activity or investor or business confidence;     limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of     credit and capital; increases in inflation, interest rates,     exchange rate volatility, default rates or the price of basic     commodities; outbreaks of hostilities or other geopolitical     instability; corporate, political or other scandals that reduce     investor confidence in capital markets; natural disasters or     pandemics; or a combination of these or other factors.         The business environment continued to improve during 2010,     although there were several periods of market disruption, but     there can be no assurance that these conditions will continue in     the near or long term. If they do not, our results of operations     may be adversely affected.                  18       Table of Contents             Our businesses have been and may be adversely affected by     declining asset values. This is particularly true for those     businesses in which we have net long positions,     receive fees based on the value of assets managed, or receive or     post collateral.         Many of our businesses have net long positions in     debt securities, loans, derivatives, mortgages, equities     (including private equity and real estate) and most other asset     classes. These include positions we take when we act as a     principal to facilitate our clients activities, including     our exchange-based     market-making     activities, or commit large amounts of capital to maintain     positions in interest rate and credit products, as well as     through our currencies, commodities and equities activities.     Because nearly all of these investing, lending and market-making     positions are marked-to-market on a daily basis, declines in     asset values directly and immediately impact our earnings,     unless we have effectively hedged our exposures to     such declines. In certain circumstances (particularly in the     case of leveraged loans and private equities or other securities     that are not freely tradable or lack established and liquid     trading markets), it may not be possible or economic to hedge     such exposures and to the extent that we do so the hedge may be     ineffective or may greatly reduce our ability to profit from     increases in the values of the assets. Sudden declines and     significant volatility in the prices of assets may substantially     curtail or eliminate the trading markets for certain assets,     which may make it very difficult to sell, hedge or value such     assets. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets     reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the     difficulty in valuing assets may require us to maintain     additional capital and increase our funding costs.         In our exchange-based     market-making     activities, we are obligated by stock exchange rules to maintain     an orderly market, including by purchasing shares in a declining     market. In markets where asset values are declining and in     volatile markets, this results in losses and an increased need     for liquidity.         We receive     asset-based     management fees based on the value of our clients     portfolios or investment in funds managed by us and, in some     cases, we also receive incentive fees based on increases in the     value of such investments. Declines in asset values reduce the     value of our clients portfolios or fund assets, which in     turn reduce the fees we earn for managing such assets.             We post collateral to support our obligations and receive     collateral to support the obligations of our clients and     counterparties in connection with our client execution     businesses. When the value of the assets posted as collateral     declines, the party posting the collateral may need to provide     additional collateral or, if possible, reduce its trading     position. A classic example of such a situation is a     margin call in connection with a brokerage account.     Therefore, declines in the value of asset classes used as     collateral mean that either the cost of funding positions is     increased or the size of positions is decreased. If we are the     party providing collateral, this can increase our costs and     reduce our profitability and if we are the party receiving     collateral, this can also reduce our profitability by reducing     the level of business done with our clients and counterparties.     In addition, volatile or less liquid markets increase the     difficulty of valuing assets which can lead to costly and     time-consuming disputes over asset values and the level of     required collateral, as well as increased credit risk to the     recipient of the collateral due to delays in receiving adequate     collateral.     Our businesses have been and may be adversely affected by     disruptions in the credit markets, including reduced access to     credit and higher costs of obtaining credit.         Widening credit spreads, as well as significant declines in the     availability of credit, have in the past adversely affected our     ability to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis and may do so     in the future. We fund ourselves on an unsecured basis by     issuing     long-term     debt, promissory notes and commercial paper, by accepting     deposits at our bank subsidiaries or by obtaining bank loans or     lines of credit. We seek to finance many of our assets on a     secured basis, including by entering into repurchase agreements.     Any disruptions in the credit markets may make it harder and     more expensive to obtain funding for our businesses. If our     available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our     operations at a higher cost, these conditions may require us to     curtail our business activities and increase our cost of     funding, both of which could reduce our profitability,     particularly in our businesses that involve investing, lending     and market making.            19       Table of Contents           Our clients engaging in mergers and acquisitions often rely on     access to the secured and unsecured credit markets to finance     their transactions. A lack of available credit or an increased     cost of credit can adversely affect the size, volume and timing     of     our     clients     merger and     acquisition     transactions  particularly     large transactions  and adversely affect our     financial advisory and underwriting businesses.         In addition, we may incur significant unrealized gains or losses     due solely to changes in our credit spreads or those of third     parties, as these changes may affect the fair value of our     derivative instruments and the debt securities that we hold or     issue.     Our     market-making     activities have been and may be affected by changes in the     levels of market volatility.         Certain of our     market-making     activities depend on market volatility to provide trading and     arbitrage opportunities to our clients, and decreases in     volatility may reduce these opportunities and adversely affect     the results of these activities. On the other hand, increased     volatility, while it can increase trading volumes and spreads,     also increases risk as measured by     Value-at-Risk     (VaR) and may expose us to increased risks in connection with     our     market-making     activities or cause us to reduce our     market-making     positions in order to avoid increasing our VaR. Limiting the     size of our     market-making     positions can adversely affect our profitability, even though     spreads are widening and we may earn more on each trade. In     periods when volatility is increasing, but asset values are     declining significantly, it may not be possible to sell assets     at all or it may only be possible to do so at steep discounts.     In such circumstances we may be forced to either take on     additional risk or to incur losses in order to decrease our VaR.     In addition, increases in volatility increase the level of our     risk weighted assets and increase our capital requirements, both     of which in turn increase our funding costs.         Our investment banking, client execution and investment     management businesses have been adversely affected and may     continue to be adversely affected by market uncertainty or lack     of confidence among investors and CEOs due to general declines     in economic activity and other unfavorable economic,     geopolitical or market conditions.         Our investment banking business has been and may continue     to be adversely affected by market conditions. Poor economic     conditions and other adverse geopolitical conditions can     adversely affect and have adversely affected investor and CEO     confidence, resulting in significant     industry-wide     declines in the size and number of underwritings and of     financial advisory transactions, which could have an adverse     effect on our revenues and our profit margins. In particular,     because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues     is derived from our participation in large transactions, a     decline in the number of large transactions would adversely     affect our investment banking business.         In certain circumstances, market uncertainty or general declines     in market or economic activity may affect our client execution     businesses by decreasing levels of overall activity or by     decreasing volatility, but at other times market uncertainty and     even declining economic activity may result in higher trading     volumes or higher spreads or both.         Market uncertainty, volatility and adverse economic conditions,     as well as declines in asset values, may cause our clients to     transfer their assets out of our funds or other products or     their brokerage accounts and result in reduced net revenues,     principally in our investment management business. To the extent     that clients do not withdraw their funds, they may invest them     in products that generate less fee income.            20       Table of Contents       Our investment management business may be affected by the     poor investment performance of our investment products.         Poor investment returns in our investment management business,     due to either general market conditions or underperformance     (relative to our competitors or to benchmarks) by funds or     accounts that we manage or investment products that we design or     sell, affects our ability to retain existing assets and to     attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients.     This could affect the management and incentive fees that we earn     on assets under management or the commissions that we earn for     selling other investment products, such as structured notes or     derivatives.     We may incur losses as a result of ineffective risk     management processes and strategies.         We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk     and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but     complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and     legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review     processes and other mechanisms. Our risk management process     seeks to balance our ability to profit from     market-making,     investing or lending positions with our exposure to potential     losses. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk     monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and     the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate     every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing     of such outcomes. Thus, we may, in the course of our activities,     incur losses. Market conditions in recent years have involved     unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations     inherent in using historical data to manage risk.         The models that we use to assess and control our risk exposures     reflect assumptions about the degrees of correlation or lack     thereof among prices of various asset classes or other     market indicators. In times of market stress or other unforeseen     circumstances, such as occurred during 2008 and early 2009,     previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or     conversely previously correlated indicators may move in     different directions. These types of market movements have at     times limited the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and     have caused us to incur significant losses, and they may do so     in the future. These changes in correlation can be exacerbated     where other market participants are using risk or trading models     with assumptions or algorithms that are similar to ours. In     these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk     positions due to the activity of other market participants or     widespread market           dislocations, including circumstances where asset values are     declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets.         To the extent that we have positions through our     market-making     or origination activities or we make investments directly     through our investing activities in securities, including     private equity, that do not have an established liquid trading     market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or     hedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and     therefore reduce our risk associated with such positions. In     addition, we invest our own capital in private equity, debt,     real estate and hedge funds that we manage and limitations on     our ability to withdraw some or all of our investments in these     funds, whether for legal, reputational or other reasons, may     make it more difficult for us to control the risk exposures     relating to these investments.         For a further discussion of our risk management policies and     procedures, see Managements Discussion and Analysis     of Financial Condition and Results of Operations      Risk Management in Part II, Item 7 of this     Form 10-K.     Our liquidity, profitability and businesses may be     adversely affected by an inability to access the debt capital     markets or to sell assets or by a reduction in our credit     ratings or by an increase in our credit spreads.         Liquidity is essential to our businesses. Our liquidity may be     impaired by an inability to access secured     and/or     unsecured debt markets, an inability to access funds from our     subsidiaries, an inability to sell assets or redeem our     investments, or unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral. This     situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable     to control, such as a general market disruption or an     operational problem that affects third parties or us, or even by     the perception among market participants that we, or other     market participants, are experiencing greater liquidity risk.         The financial instruments that we hold and the contracts to     which we are a party are complex, as we employ structured     products to benefit our clients and ourselves, and these complex     structured products often do not have readily available markets     to access in times of liquidity stress. Our investing and     lending activities may lead to situations where the holdings     from these activities represent a significant portion of     specific markets, which could restrict liquidity for our     positions.            21       Table of Contents           Further, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other     market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the     same time, as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other market     crisis. In addition, financial institutions with which we     interact may exercise     set-off     rights or the right to require additional collateral, including     in difficult market conditions, which could further impair our     access to liquidity.         Our credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction     in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and     competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, limit our     access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under     certain provisions in some of our trading and collateralized     financing contracts. Under these provisions, counterparties     could be permitted to terminate contracts with Goldman Sachs or     require us to post additional collateral. Termination of our     trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause us to     sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to     find other sources of financing or to make significant cash     payments or securities movements. Certain rating agencies have     indicated that the     Dodd-Frank     Act could result in the rating agencies reducing their assumed     level of government support and therefore result in ratings     downgrades for certain large financial institutions, including     Goldman Sachs.         Our cost of obtaining     long-term     unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads (the     amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury     securities (or other benchmark securities) of the same     maturity that we need to pay to our debt investors). Increases     in our credit spreads can significantly increase our     cost of this funding. Changes in credit spreads are     continuous,     market-driven,     and subject at times to unpredictable and highly volatile     movements. Credit spreads are influenced by market perceptions     of our creditworthiness. In addition, our credit spreads     may be influenced by movements in the costs to purchasers     of credit default swaps referenced to our     long-term     debt. The market for credit default swaps, although very     large, has proven to be extremely volatile and currently lacks a     high degree of structure or transparency.         Conflicts of interest are increasing and a failure to     appropriately identify and address conflicts of interest could     adversely affect our businesses.         As we have expanded the scope of our businesses and our client     base, we increasingly must address potential conflicts of     interest, including situations where our services to a     particular client or our own investments or other interests     conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of     another client, as well as situations where one or more of our     businesses have access to material     non-public     information that may not be shared with other businesses within     the firm and situations where we may be a creditor of an entity     with which we also have an advisory or other relationship.         In addition, our status as a bank holding company subjects us to     heightened regulation and increased regulatory scrutiny by the     Federal Reserve Board with respect to transactions between     GS Bank USA and entities that are or could be viewed as     affiliates of ours.         We have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to     identify and address conflicts of interest, including those     designed to prevent the improper sharing of information among     our businesses. However, appropriately identifying and dealing     with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our     reputation, which is one of our most important assets, could be     damaged and the willingness of clients to enter into     transactions with us may be affected if we fail, or appear to     fail, to identify, disclose and deal appropriately with     conflicts of interest. In addition, potential or perceived     conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory     enforcement actions.            22       Table of Contents       Group Inc. is a holding company and is dependent for     liquidity on payments from its subsidiaries, many of which are     subject to restrictions.         Group Inc. is a holding company and, therefore, depends on     dividends, distributions and other payments from its     subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to fund all payments     on its obligations, including debt obligations. Many of our     subsidiaries, including our     broker-dealer,     bank and insurance subsidiaries, are subject to laws that     restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to     block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to     Group Inc. In addition, our     broker-dealer,     bank and insurance subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on     their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum     regulatory capital requirements, as well as restrictions on     their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or     bank accounts to fund their businesses. Additional restrictions     on related-party transactions, increased capital requirements     and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in     bank or brokerage accounts, as well as lower earnings, can     reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of     Group Inc. and even require Group Inc. to provide     additional funding to such subsidiaries. Restrictions or     regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that     Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations,     including debt obligations, or dividend payments. In addition,     Group Inc.s right to participate in a distribution of     assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is     subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors.         Furthermore, Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment     obligations of certain of its subsidiaries, including     GS&Co., GS Bank USA, GS Bank Europe and Goldman     Sachs Execution & Clearing, L.P. subject to certain     exceptions, and has pledged significant assets to GS Bank     USA to support obligations to GS Bank USA. In addition,     Group Inc. guarantees many of the obligations of its other     consolidated subsidiaries on a     transaction-by-transaction     basis, as negotiated with counterparties. These guarantees may     require Group Inc. to provide substantial funds or assets     to its subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a     time when Group Inc. is in need of liquidity to fund its     own obligations. See Business  Regulation     in Part I, Item 1 of this     Form 10-K     for a further discussion of regulatory restrictions.         Our businesses, profitability and liquidity may be     adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or     defaults by, third parties who owe us money, securities or other     assets or whose securities or obligations we hold.         We are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money,     securities or other assets will not perform their obligations.     These parties may default on their obligations to us due to     bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other     reasons. A failure of a significant market participant, or even     concerns about a default by such an institution, could lead to     significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other     institutions, which in turn could adversely affect us.         We are also subject to the risk that our rights against third     parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. In     addition, deterioration in the credit quality of third parties     whose securities or obligations we hold could result in losses     and/or     adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use     those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes. A     significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our     counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results.     While in many cases we are permitted to require additional     collateral from counterparties that experience financial     difficulty, disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we     are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets. The     termination of contracts and the foreclosure on collateral may     subject us to claims for the improper exercise of our rights.     Default rates, downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to     the valuation of collateral increase significantly in times of     market stress and illiquidity.         As part of our clearing and prime brokerage activities, we     finance our clients positions, and we could be held     responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our clients.     Although we regularly review credit exposures to specific     clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries     and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default     risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult     to detect or foresee.            23       Table of Contents       Concentration of risk increases the potential for     significant losses in our     market-making,     underwriting, investing and lending activities.         Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant     losses in our     market-making,     underwriting, investing and lending activities. The number and     size of such transactions may affect our results of operations     in a given period. Moreover, because of concentration of risk,     we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions     are generally favorable for our competitors. Disruptions in the     credit markets can make it difficult to hedge these credit     exposures effectively or economically. In addition, we extend     large commitments as part of our credit origination activities.     The Dodd-Frank Act will require issuers of     asset-backed     securities and any person who organizes and initiates an     asset-backed     securities transaction to retain economic exposure to the asset,     which could significantly increase the cost to us of engaging in     securitization activities. Our inability to reduce our credit     risk by selling, syndicating or securitizing these positions,     including during periods of market stress, could negatively     affect our results of operations due to a decrease in the fair     value of the positions, including due to the insolvency or     bankruptcy of the borrower, as well as the loss of revenues     associated with selling such securities or loans.         In the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to a     concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty,     borrower or issuer, including sovereign issuers, and a failure     or downgrade of, or default by, such entity could negatively     impact our businesses, perhaps materially, and the systems by     which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure     to individual entities, industries and countries may not     function as we have anticipated. While our activities expose us     to many different industries and counterparties, we routinely     execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties     engaged in financial services activities, including brokers and     dealers, commercial banks, clearing houses, exchanges and     investment funds. This has resulted in significant credit     concentration with respect to these counterparties. Provisions     of the Dodd-Frank Act are expected to lead to increased     centralization of trading activity through particular clearing     houses, central agents or exchanges, which may increase our     concentration of risk with respect to these entities.         The financial services industry is highly     competitive.         The financial services industry and all of our businesses are     intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We     compete on the basis of a number of factors, including     transaction execution, our products and services, innovation,     reputation, creditworthiness and price. Over time, there has     been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies     in the financial services industry. This trend accelerated over     recent years as a result of numerous mergers and asset     acquisitions among industry participants. This trend has also     hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial     services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to     support our international operations and to execute large global     transactions. To the extent we expand into new business areas     and new geographic regions, we will face competitors with more     experience and more established relationships with clients,     regulators and industry participants in the relevant market,     which could adversely affect our ability to expand. Governments     and regulators have recently adopted regulations, imposed taxes     or otherwise put forward various proposals that have or may     impact our ability to conduct certain of our businesses in a     cost-effective     manner or at all in certain or all jurisdictions, including     proposals relating to restrictions on the type of activities in     which financial institutions are permitted to engage. These or     other similar proposals, which may not apply to all our     U.S. or     non-U.S. competitors,     could impact our ability to compete effectively.         Pricing and other competitive pressures in our businesses have     continued to increase, particularly in situations where some of     our competitors may seek to increase market share by reducing     prices. For example, in connection with investment banking and     other assignments, we have experienced pressure to extend and     price credit at levels that may not always fully compensate us     for the risks we take.            24       Table of Contents         We face enhanced risks as new business initiatives lead us     to transact with a broader array of clients and counterparties     and expose us to new asset classes and new markets.         A number of our recent and planned business initiatives and     expansions of existing businesses may bring us into contact,     directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are     not within our traditional client and counterparty base and     expose us to new asset classes and new markets. For example, we     are increasingly transacting business and investing in new     regions, including a wider range of emerging and growth markets.     Furthermore, in a number of our businesses, including where we     make markets, invest and lend, we directly or indirectly own     interests in, or otherwise become affiliated with the ownership     and operation of public services, such as airports, toll roads     and shipping ports, as well as power generation facilities,     physical commodities and other commodities infrastructure     components, both within and outside the United States. Recent     market conditions may lead to an increase in opportunities to     acquire distressed assets and we may determine opportunistically     to increase our exposure to these types of assets.         These activities expose us to new and enhanced risks, including     risks associated with dealing with governmental entities,     reputational concerns arising from dealing with less     sophisticated counterparties and investors, greater regulatory     scrutiny of these activities, increased     credit-related,     sovereign and operational risks, risks arising from accidents or     acts of terrorism, and reputational concerns with the manner in     which these assets are being operated or held.         Derivative transactions and delayed settlements may expose     us to unexpected risk and potential losses.         We are party to a large number of derivative transactions,     including credit derivatives. Many of these derivative     instruments are individually negotiated and     non-standardized,     which can make exiting, transferring or settling positions     difficult. Many credit derivatives require that we deliver to     the counterparty the underlying security, loan or other     obligation in order to receive payment. In a number of cases, we     do not hold the underlying security, loan or other obligation     and may not be able to obtain the underlying security, loan or     other obligation. This could cause us to forfeit the payments     due to us under these contracts or result in settlement delays     with the attendant credit and operational risk as well as     increased costs to the firm. Derivative transactions may also     involve the risk that they are not authorized or appropriate for     a counterparty, that documentation has not been properly     executed or that executed agreements may not be enforceable     against the counterparty.         Derivative contracts and other transactions, including secondary     bank loan purchases and sales, entered into with third parties     are not always confirmed by the counterparties or settled on a     timely basis. While the transaction remains unconfirmed or     during any delay in settlement, we are subject to heightened     credit and operational risk and in the event of a default may     find it more difficult to enforce our rights. In addition, as     new and more complex derivative products are created, covering a     wider array of underlying credit and other instruments, disputes     about the terms of the underlying contracts could arise, which     could impair our ability to effectively manage our risk     exposures from these products and subject us to increased costs.     The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring central clearing     of credit derivatives and other OTC derivatives, or a market     shift toward standardized derivatives, could reduce the risk     associated with such transactions, but under certain     circumstances could also limit our ability to develop     derivatives that best suit the needs of our clients and     ourselves and adversely affect our profitability and increase     our credit exposure to such platform.            25       Table of Contents         Our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable     to hire and retain qualified employees.         Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts     of highly skilled individuals; therefore, our continued ability     to compete effectively in our businesses, to manage our     businesses effectively and to expand into new businesses and     geographic areas depends on our ability to attract new talented     and diverse employees and to retain and motivate our existing     employees. Factors that affect our ability to attract and retain     such employees include our compensation and benefits, and our     reputation as a successful business with a culture of fairly     hiring, training and promoting qualified employees.         Competition from within the financial services industry and from     businesses outside the financial services industry for qualified     employees has often been intense. This is particularly the case     in emerging and growth markets, where we are often competing for     qualified employees with entities that have a significantly     greater presence or more extensive experience in the region.         As described further in Business      Regulation  Banking Regulation and     Regulation  Compensation Practices in     Part I, Item 1 of this     Form 10-K,     our compensation practices are subject to review by, and the     standards of, the Federal Reserve Board. As a large financial     and banking institution, we may be subject to limitations on     compensation practices (which may or may not affect our     competitors) by the Federal Reserve Board, the FSA, the FDIC or     other regulators worldwide. These limitations, including any     imposed by or as a result of future legislation or regulation,     may require us to alter our compensation practices in ways that     could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain     talented employees. We may also be required to make additional     disclosure with respect to the compensation of employees,     including     non-executive     officers, in a manner that directly or indirectly results in the     identity of such employees and their compensation being made     public. Any such additional public disclosure of employee     compensation may also make it difficult to attract and retain     talented employees.         Our businesses and those of our clients are subject to     extensive and pervasive regulation around the world.         As a participant in the financial services industry and a bank     holding company, we are subject to extensive regulation in     jurisdictions around the world. We face the risk of significant     intervention by regulatory and taxing authorities in all     jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses. Among other     things, as a result of regulators enforcing existing laws and     regulations, we could be fined, prohibited from engaging in some     of our business activities, subject to limitations or conditions     on our business activities or subjected to new or substantially     higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with     the conduct of our business or with respect to our employees.         There is also the risk that new laws or regulations or changes     in enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our     businesses or those of our clients, including tax burdens and     compensation restrictions, could be imposed on a limited subset     of financial institutions (either based on size, activities,     geography or other criteria), which may adversely affect our     ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are     not affected in the same way.         The impact of such developments could impact our profitability     in the affected jurisdictions, or even make it uneconomic for us     to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such     jurisdictions, or could cause us to incur significant costs     associated with changing our business practices, restructuring     our businesses, moving all or certain of our businesses and our     employees to other locations or complying with applicable     capital requirements, including liquidating assets or raising     capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs     or otherwise adversely affects our shareholders and creditors.         For a discussion of the extensive regulation to which our     businesses are subject, see Business      Regulation in Part I, Item 1 of this     Form 10-K.            26       Table of Contents         We may be adversely affected by increased governmental and     regulatory scrutiny or negative publicity.         Governmental scrutiny from regulators, legislative bodies and     law enforcement agencies with respect to matters relating to     compensation, our business practices, our past actions and other     matters has increased dramatically in the past several years.     The financial crisis and the current political and public     sentiment regarding financial institutions has resulted in a     significant amount of adverse press coverage, as well as     adverse statements or charges by regulators or other government     officials. Press coverage and other public statements that     assert some form of wrongdoing often result in some type of     investigation by regulators, legislators and law enforcement     officials or in lawsuits. Responding to these investigations and     lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding,     is time consuming and expensive and can divert the time and     effort of our senior management from our business. Penalties and     fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased     substantially over the last several years, and certain     regulators have been more likely in recent years to commence     enforcement actions or to advance or support legislation     targeted at the financial services industry. Adverse publicity,     governmental scrutiny and legal and enforcement proceedings can     also have a negative impact on our reputation and on the morale     and performance of our employees, which could adversely     affect our businesses and results of operations.     A failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, or     those of third parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our     businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential     information, damage our reputation and cause losses.         Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process     and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of     transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous     and diverse markets in many currencies. These transactions, as     well as the information technology services we provide to     clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as     well as legal and regulatory standards.         As our client base and our geographical reach expands,     developing and maintaining our operational systems and     infrastructure becomes increasingly challenging. Our financial,     accounting, data processing or other operating systems and     facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a     result of events           that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as a spike     in transaction volume, adversely affecting our ability to     process these transactions or provide these services. We must     continuously update these systems to support our operations and     growth and to respond to changes in regulations and markets.     This updating entails significant costs and creates risks     associated with implementing new systems and integrating them     with existing ones.         In addition, we also face the risk of operational failure,     termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing     agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial     intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions,     and as our interconnectivity with our clients grows, we     increasingly face the risk of operational failure with respect     to our clients systems.         In recent years, there has been significant consolidation among     clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses and an increasing     number of derivative transactions are now or in the near future     will be cleared on exchanges, which has increased our exposure     to operational failure, termination or capacity constraints of     the particular financial intermediaries that we use and could     affect our ability to find adequate and     cost-effective     alternatives in the event of any such failure, termination or     constraint. Industry consolidation, whether among market     participants or financial intermediaries, increases the risk of     operational failure as disparate complex systems need to be     integrated, often on an accelerated basis.         Furthermore, the interconnectivity of multiple financial     institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses,     and the increased centrality of these entities, increases the     risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity     may cause an     industry-wide     operational failure that could materially impact our ability to     conduct business. Any such failure, termination or constraint     could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions,     service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our     businesses or result in financial loss or liability to our     clients, impairment of our liquidity, disruption of our     businesses, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.            27       Table of Contents             Despite the resiliency plans and facilities we have in place,     our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a     disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses     and the communities in which we are located. This may include a     disruption involving electrical, communications, internet,     transportation or other services used by us or third parties     with which we conduct business. These disruptions may occur as a     result of events that affect only our buildings or systems or     those of such third parties, or as a result of events with a     broader impact globally, regionally or in the cities where those     buildings or systems are located.         Nearly all of our employees in our primary locations, including     the New York metropolitan area, London, Bangalore, Hong Kong,     Tokyo and Salt Lake City, work in close proximity to one     another, in one or more buildings. Notwithstanding our efforts     to maintain business continuity, given that our headquarters and     the largest concentration of our employees are in the New York     metropolitan area, depending on the intensity and longevity of     the event, a catastrophic event impacting our New York     metropolitan area offices could very negatively affect our     business. If a disruption occurs in one location and our     employees in that location are unable to occupy our offices or     communicate with or travel to other locations, our ability to     service and interact with our clients may suffer, and we may not     be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend     on communication or travel.         Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and     transmission of confidential and other information in our     computer systems and networks. Although we take protective     measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant,     our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to     unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious     code and other events that could have a security impact. If one     or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize     our or our clients or counterparties     confidential and other information processed and stored in, and     transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or     otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our     clients, our counterparties or third parties     operations, which could result in significant losses     or reputational damage. We may be required to expend     significant additional resources to modify our protective     measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or     other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and     financial losses that are either not insured against or not     fully covered through any insurance maintained by us.             We routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and     proprietary information by email and other electronic means. We     have discussed and worked with clients, vendors, service     providers, counterparties and other third parties to develop     secure transmission capabilities, but we do not have, and may be     unable to put in place, secure capabilities with all of our     clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other     third parties and we may not be able to ensure that these third     parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the     confidentiality of the information. An interception, misuse or     mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information     being sent to or received from a client, vendor, service     provider, counterparty or other third party could result in     legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm.     Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory     action against us could have material adverse financial effects     or cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could     seriously harm our business prospects.         We face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the     volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in     litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial     institutions remain high. See Legal Proceedings     in Part I, Item 3 of this     Form 10-K     for a discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are     involved. Our experience has been that legal claims by customers     and clients increase in a market downturn and that     employment-related claims increase in periods when we have     reduced the total number of employees.         There have been a number of highly publicized cases, involving     actual or alleged fraud or other misconduct by employees in the     financial services industry in recent years, and we run the risk     that employee misconduct could occur. This misconduct has     included and may include in the future the theft of proprietary     software. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee     misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect     this activity have not been and may not be effective in all     cases.            28       Table of Contents         The growth of electronic trading and the introduction of     new trading technology may adversely affect our business and may     increase competition.         Technology is fundamental to our business and our industry. The     growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new     technologies is changing our businesses and presenting us with     new challenges. Securities, futures and options transactions are     increasingly occurring electronically, both on our own systems     and through other alternative trading systems, and it appears     that the trend toward alternative trading systems will continue     and probably accelerate. Some of these alternative trading     systems compete with us, particularly our exchange-based     market-making     activities, and we may experience continued competitive     pressures in these and other areas. In addition, the increased     use by our clients of     low-cost     electronic trading systems and direct electronic access to     trading markets could cause a reduction in commissions and     spreads. As our clients increasingly use our systems to trade     directly in the markets, we may incur liabilities as a result of     their use of our order routing and execution infrastructure. We     have invested significant resources into the development of     electronic trading systems and expect to continue to do so, but     there is no assurance that the revenues generated by these     systems will yield an adequate return on our investment,     particularly given the relatively lower commissions arising from     electronic trades.     Our commodities activities, particularly our power     generation interests and our physical commodities activities,     subject us to extensive regulation, potential catastrophic     events and environmental, reputational and other risks that may     expose us to significant liabilities and costs.         We engage in, or invest in entities that engage in, the     production, storage, transportation, marketing and trading of     numerous commodities, including crude oil, oil products, natural     gas, electric power, agricultural products, metals (base and     precious), minerals (including uranium), emission credits, coal,     freight, liquefied natural gas and related products and indices.     These activities subject us to extensive and evolving federal,     state and local energy, environmental and other governmental     laws and regulations worldwide, including environmental laws and     regulations relating to, among others, air quality, water     quality, waste management, transportation of hazardous     substances, natural resources, site remediation and health and     safety. Additionally, rising climate change concerns may lead to     additional regulation that could increase the operating costs     and profitability of our investments.             We may incur substantial costs in complying with current or     future laws and regulations relating to our commodities-related     activities and investments, particularly electric power     generation, transportation and storage of physical commodities     and wholesale sales and trading of electricity and natural gas.     Compliance with these laws and regulations could require us to     commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring,     installation of pollution control equipment, renovation of     storage facilities or transport vessels, payment of emission     fees and carbon or other taxes, and application for, and holding     of, permits and licenses.         Our commodities-related activities are also subject to the risk     of unforeseen or catastrophic events, many of which are outside     of our control, including breakdown or failure of power     generation equipment, transmission lines, transport vessels,     storage facilities or other equipment or processes or other     mechanical malfunctions, fires, leaks, spills or release of     hazardous substances, performance below expected levels of     output or efficiency, terrorist attacks, natural disasters or     other hostile or catastrophic events. In addition, we rely on     third-party suppliers or service providers to perform their     contractual obligations and any failure on their part, including     the failure to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices or to     safely transport or store commodities, could adversely affect     our activities. In addition, we may not be able to obtain     insurance to cover some of these risks and the insurance that we     have may be inadequate to cover our losses.         The occurrence of any of such events may prevent us from     performing under our agreements with clients, may impair our     operations or financial results and may result in litigation,     regulatory action, negative publicity or other reputational harm.            29       Table of Contents         In conducting our businesses around the world, we are     subject to political, economic, legal, operational and other     risks that are inherent in operating in many countries.         In conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our     global operations, we are subject to risks of possible     nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital     controls, exchange controls and other restrictive governmental     actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities or acts of     terrorism. In many countries, the laws and regulations     applicable to the securities and financial services industries     and many of the transactions in which we are involved are     uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to     determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market.     Any determination by local regulators that we have not acted in     compliance with the application of local laws in a particular     market or our failure to develop effective working relationships     with local regulators could have a significant and negative     effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our     reputation generally. We are also subject to the enhanced risk     that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable     in all cases.         Our businesses and operations are increasingly expanding into     new regions throughout the world, including emerging and growth     markets, and we expect this trend to continue. Various emerging     and growth market countries have experienced severe economic and     financial disruptions, including significant devaluations of     their currencies, defaults or threatened defaults on sovereign     debt, capital and currency exchange controls, and low or     negative growth rates in their economies, as well as military     activity or acts of terrorism. The possible effects of any of     these conditions include an adverse impact on our businesses and     increased volatility in financial markets generally.             While business and other practices throughout the world differ,     our principal legal entities are subject in their operations     worldwide to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and     illegal payments and money laundering, as well as laws relating     to doing business with certain individuals, groups and     countries, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,     the USA PATRIOT Act and U.K. Bribery Act. While we have invested     and continue to invest significant resources in training and in     compliance monitoring, the geographical diversity of our     operations, employees, clients and customers, as well as the     vendors and other third parties that we deal with, greatly     increases the risk that we may be found in violation of such     rules or regulations and any such violation could subject us to     significant penalties or adversely affect our reputation.     We may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or     catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic,     terrorist attacks or natural disasters.         The occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including     the emergence of a pandemic or other widespread health emergency     (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency),     terrorist attacks or natural disasters, could create economic     and financial disruptions, could lead to operational     difficulties (including travel limitations) that could impair     our ability to manage our businesses, and could expose our     insurance activities to significant losses.            30       Table of Contents                         Item 1B.     Unresolved     Staff Comments           There are no material unresolved written comments that were     received from the SEC staff 180 days or more before the end     of our fiscal year relating to our periodic or current reports     under the Exchange Act.           Item 2.     Properties           Our principal executive offices are located at 200 West     Street, New York, New York and comprise approximately     2.1 million gross square feet. The building is located on a     parcel leased from Battery Park City Authority pursuant to a     ground lease. Under the lease, Battery Park City Authority holds     title to all improvements, including the office building,     subject to Goldman Sachs right of exclusive possession and     use until June 2069, the expiration date of the lease.     Under the terms of the ground lease, we made a lump sum ground     rent payment in June 2007 of $161 million for rent     through the term of the lease.         We have offices at 30 Hudson Street in Jersey City,     New Jersey, which we own and which include approximately     1.6 million gross square feet of office space, and we own     over 700,000 square feet of additional commercial space spread     among four locations in New York and New Jersey. We lease     approximately 2.1 million rentable square feet in the New     York Metropolitan Area.         We have additional offices in the U.S. and elsewhere in the     Americas, which together comprise approximately 3.0 million     rentable square feet of leased space.         In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, we have offices that     total approximately 2.1 million rentable square feet. Our     European headquarters is located in London at Peterborough     Court, pursuant to a lease expiring in 2026. In total, we lease     approximately 1.6 million rentable square feet in London     through various leases, relating to various properties.             In Asia (including India), we have offices that total     approximately 1.7 million rentable square feet. Our     headquarters in this region are in Tokyo, at the Roppongi Hills     Mori Tower, and in Hong Kong, at the Cheung Kong Center. In     Tokyo, we currently lease approximately 388,000 rentable square     feet, the majority of which will expire in 2018. In Hong Kong,     we currently lease approximately 320,000 rentable square feet     under lease agreements, the majority of which will expire in     2017.

Item 3.     Legal     Proceedings           We are involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and     arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in connection     with the conduct of our businesses. Many of these     proceedings are at preliminary stages, and many of these cases     seek an indeterminate amount of damages. However, we believe,     based on currently available information, that the results of     such proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material     adverse effect on our financial condition, but may be material     to our operating results for any particular period, depending,     in part, upon the operating results for such period. Given the     range of litigation and investigations presently under way, our     litigation expenses can be expected to remain high.

On March 21, 2000, we announced that our Board had     approved a repurchase program, pursuant to which up to     15 million shares of our common stock may be repurchased.     This repurchase program was increased by an aggregate of     280 million shares by resolutions of our Board adopted on     June 18, 2001, March 18, 2002,     November 20, 2002, January 30, 2004,     January 25, 2005, September 16, 2005,     September 11, 2006 and December 17, 2007. We     use our share repurchase program to substantially offset     increases in share count over time resulting from employee     share-based     compensation and to help maintain the appropriate level of     common equity.                    The repurchase program is effected primarily through regular     open-market     purchases, the amounts and timing of which are determined     primarily by the firms issuance of shares resulting from     employee     share-based     compensation as well as its current and projected capital     position (i.e., comparisons of our desired level of capital     to our actual level of capital) but which may also be influenced     by general market conditions, the prevailing price and trading     volumes of our common stock. The total remaining authorization     under the repurchase program was 32,156,376 shares as of     February 11, 2011; the repurchase program has no set     expiration or termination date.                    Any repurchase of our common stock requires approval by the     Federal Reserve Board.                  Information relating to compensation plans under which our     equity securities are authorized for issuance is presented in     Part III, Item 12 of this     Form 10-K.               Item 6.

(Group Inc.) is a leading     global investment banking, securities and investment management     firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a     substantial and diversified client base that includes     corporations, financial institutions, governments and     high-net-worth     individuals. Founded in 1869, the firm is headquartered in New     York and maintains offices in all major financial centers around     the world.         Over the past  year, our Business Standards Committee performed     an extensive review of our business and delivered     recommendations designed to ensure that our business standards     and practices are of the highest quality, that they meet or     exceed the expectations of our clients, regulators and other     stakeholders, and that they contribute to overall financial     stability and economic opportunity. These recommendations have     been approved by our senior management and the Board of     Directors of Group Inc. (Board) and implementation has     already begun. In the fourth quarter of 2010, consistent with     managements view of the firms activities and the     recommendations of our Business Standards Committee, we     reorganized our three previous business segments into four new     business segments: Investment Banking, Institutional Client     Services, Investing & Lending and Investment     Management. Prior periods are presented on a comparable basis.     See Results of Operations below for further     information about our business segments.         When we use the terms Goldman Sachs, the     firm, we, us and our,     we mean Group Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its     consolidated subsidiaries. References to this     Form 10-K     are to our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.         All references to 2010, 2009 and 2008, unless specifically     stated otherwise, refer to our fiscal years ended, or the dates,     as the context requires, December 31, 2010,     December 31, 2009 and November 28, 2008,     respectively. Any reference to a future year refers to a fiscal     year ending on           December 31 of that year. All references to     December 2008, unless specifically stated otherwise, refer     to our fiscal one month ended, or the date, as the context     requires, December 26, 2008. Certain reclassifications     have been made to previously reported amounts to conform to the     current presentation.         In this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and     results of operations, we have included information that may     constitute forward-looking statements within the     meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private     Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking     statements are not historical facts, but instead represent only     our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their     nature, are inherently uncertain and outside our control. This     information includes statements other than historical     information or statements of current condition and may relate to     our future plans and objectives and results, among other things,     and may also include statements about the objectives and     effectiveness of our risk management and liquidity policies,     statements about trends in or growth opportunities for our     businesses, statements about our future status, activities or     reporting under U.S. or     non-U.S. banking     and financial regulation, and statements about our investment     banking transaction backlog. By identifying these statements for     you in this manner, we are alerting you to the possibility that     our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly     materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition     indicated in these forward-looking statements. Important factors     that could cause our actual results and financial condition to     differ from those indicated in these forward-looking statements     include, among others, those discussed below under Certain     Risk Factors That May Affect Our Businesses as well as     Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this     Form 10-K     and Cautionary Statement Pursuant to the U.S. Private     Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 in Part I,     Item 1 of this     Form 10-K.                  36       Table of Contents       Executive     Overview             Our diluted earnings per common share were $13.18 for the year     ended December 2010, compared with $22.13 for the year     ended December 2009. Return on average common     shareholders equity     (ROE) 1      was 11.5% for 2010, compared with 22.5% for 2009. Excluding the     impact of the $465 million U.K. bank payroll tax, the     $550 million SEC settlement and the $305 million     impairment of our New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Designated     Market Maker (DMM) rights, diluted earnings per common     share were     $15.22 2      and ROE was     13.1% 2      for 2010.         Book value per common share increased by approximately 10% to     $128.72 and tangible book value per common     share 3      increased by approximately 9% to $118.63 compared with the end     of 2009. Under Basel 1, our Tier 1 capital     ratio 4      was 16.0% and our Tier 1 common     ratio 4      was 13.3% as of December 2010. Our total assets were     $911 billion as of December 2010, 7% higher compared     with the end of 2009.         The firm generated net revenues of $39.16 billion and net     earnings of $8.35 billion for 2010, despite a challenging     operating environment. These results reflected significantly     lower net revenues in Institutional Client Services and slightly     lower net revenues in Investment Banking compared with 2009.     These decreases were partially offset by significantly higher     net revenues in Investing & Lending and higher net     revenues in Investment Management. The results of each of our     business segments are discussed below.         Institutional     Client Services       The decrease in Institutional Client Services reflected     significantly lower net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and     Commodities Client Execution and, to a lesser extent, Equities.     During 2010, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client     Execution operated in a challenging environment characterized by     lower client activity levels, which reflected broad market     concerns including European sovereign debt risk and uncertainty     over regulatory reform, as well as tighter bid/offer spreads.     The decrease in net revenues compared with a particularly strong     2009 primarily reflected significantly lower results in interest     rate products, credit products, commodities and, to a lesser     extent, currencies. These decreases were partially offset by     higher net revenues in mortgages.         The decline in Equities compared with 2009 primarily reflected     significantly lower net revenues in equities client execution,     principally due to significantly lower results in derivatives     and shares. Commissions and fees were also lower than 2009,     primarily reflecting lower client activity levels. In addition,     securities services net revenues were significantly lower     compared with 2009, primarily reflecting tighter securities     lending spreads, principally due to the impact of changes in the     composition of customer balances, partially offset by the impact     of higher average customer balances. During 2010, although     equity markets were volatile during the first half of the year,     equity prices generally improved and volatility levels declined     in the second half of the year.                       1. See Results of Operations  Financial     Overview below for further information about our     calculation of ROE.       2. We believe that presenting our results excluding the     impact of the U.K. bank payroll tax, the SEC settlement and the     NYSE DMM rights impairment is meaningful, as excluding these     items increases the comparability of     period-to-period     results. See Results of Operations  Financial     Overview below for further information about our     calculation of diluted earnings per common share and ROE     excluding the impact of these items.       3. We believe that tangible book value per common share is     meaningful because it is one of the measures that we and     investors use to assess capital adequacy. See Equity     Capital  Other Capital Metrics below for     further information about our calculation of tangible book value     per common share.       4. See Equity Capital  Consolidated     Regulatory Capital Ratios below for further information     about our Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 common ratio.         37       Table of Contents         Investment     Banking       The decrease in Investment Banking reflected lower net revenues     in our Underwriting business, partially offset by higher net     revenues in Financial Advisory. The decline in Underwriting     reflected lower net revenues in equity underwriting, principally     due to a decline in client activity in comparison to 2009, which     included significant capital-raising activity by financial     institution clients. Net revenues in debt underwriting were     essentially unchanged compared with 2009. The increase in     Financial Advisory primarily reflected an increase in client     activity.     Investing &     Lending       During 2010, an increase in global equity markets and tighter     credit spreads provided a favorable backdrop for our     Investing & Lending business. Results in     Investing & Lending for 2010 primarily reflected a     gain of $747 million from our investment in the ordinary     shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited     (ICBC), a net gain of $2.69 billion from other equity     securities and a net gain of $2.60 billion from debt     securities and loans.     Investment     Management       The increase in Investment Management primarily reflected higher     incentive fees across our alternative investment products.     Management and other fees also increased, reflecting favorable     changes in the mix of assets under management, as well as the     impact of appreciation in the value of client assets. During     2010, assets under management decreased 4% to $840 billion,     primarily reflecting outflows in money market assets, consistent     with industry trends.         Our business, by its nature, does not produce predictable     earnings. Our results in any given period can be materially     affected by conditions in global financial markets, economic     conditions generally and other factors. For a further discussion     of the factors that may affect our future operating results, see     Certain Risk Factors That May Affect Our Businesses     below as well as Risk Factors in Part I,     Item 1A of this     Form 10-K.          Business     Environment          Global economic conditions generally improved in 2010, as real     gross domestic product (GDP) grew in most major economies     following declines in 2009, and growth in emerging markets was     strong. However, certain unfavorable conditions emerged during     the second quarter of 2010 that made the environment more     challenging for our businesses, including broad market concerns     over European sovereign debt risk and uncertainty regarding     financial regulatory reform, sharply higher equity volatility     levels, lower global equity prices and wider corporate credit     spreads. During the second half of 2010, some of these     conditions reversed, as equity volatility levels decreased,     global equity prices generally recovered and corporate credit     spreads narrowed. In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve     announced quantitative easing measures during the fourth quarter     of 2010 in order to stimulate economic growth and protect     against the risk of deflation.     Industry-wide     announced mergers and acquisitions volumes increased, while     industry-wide     debt offerings volumes decreased compared with 2009. A     significant increase in initial public offerings volumes     compared with 2009 offset declines in common stock follow-on     offerings and convertible offerings volumes, as 2009 included     significant capital-raising activity by financial institutions.     For a further discussion of how market conditions affect our     businesses, see Certain Risk Factors That May Affect Our     Businesses below as well as Risk Factors in     Part I, Item 1A of this     Form 10-K.     Global       The global economy strengthened during 2010, as real GDP     increased in most major economies and economic growth in     emerging markets accelerated. The global recovery largely     reflected an increase in business investment, following a     significant decline in 2009. In addition, international trade     grew strongly in 2010. Unemployment levels generally stabilized,     although the rate of unemployment remained elevated in some     economies. During 2010, the U.S. Federal Reserve, the     European Central Bank and the Bank of England left interest     rates unchanged, while the Bank of Japan reduced its target     overnight call rate and the Peoples Bank of China     increased its     one-year     benchmark lending rate. The price of crude oil increased     significantly during 2010. The U.S. dollar strengthened     against the Euro and the British pound, but weakened against the     Japanese yen.            38       Table of Contents         United     States       In the United States, real GDP increased by an estimated 2.8% in     2010, compared with a decline of 2.6% in 2009. Growth was     primarily supported by improved business investment spending, as     well as an increase in federal government spending. In addition,     consumer spending and business and consumer confidence improved     during the year. However, residential investment remained weak.     Measures of core inflation decreased during the year, reflecting     high levels of unemployment and significant excess production     capacity, which caused downward pressure on wages and prices.     The U.S. Federal Reserve maintained its federal funds rate     at a target range of zero to 0.25% during the year. In addition,     the U.S. Federal Reserve announced quantitative easing     measures during the fourth quarter of 2010, including its     intention to purchase significant amounts of U.S. Treasury     debt. The yield on the     10-year     U.S. Treasury note fell by 55 basis points to 3.30% during     2010. The NASDAQ Composite Index, the S&P 500 Index and the     Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the year higher by 17%, 13%     and 11%, respectively.     Europe       Real GDP in the Eurozone economies increased by an estimated     1.7% in 2010, compared with a decline of 4.0% in 2009. Growth     primarily reflected an increase in consumer and government     expenditure, as well as the rebuilding of inventories. Exports     and imports increased significantly, although the contribution     from net trade was not significant. Business investment was weak     for the year, but showed signs of recovery in the second half of     the year, and surveys of business and consumer confidence     improved. However, economic growth in certain Eurozone economies     continued to be weighed down by fiscal challenges and banking     sector concerns. In addition, concerns about sovereign debt risk     in certain Eurozone economies intensified, contributing to     higher volatility and funding pressures. The European Central     Bank and certain governments in the Eurozone took a range of     policy measures to address these issues. Measures of core     inflation remained low and the European Central Bank maintained     its main refinancing operations rate at 1.00% during the year.     In the United Kingdom, real GDP increased by an estimated 1.3%     for 2010, compared with a decrease of 4.9% in 2009. The Bank of     England maintained its official bank rate at 0.50% during the     year.     Long-term     government bond yields in both the Eurozone and the U.K.     decreased during 2010. The Euro and British pound depreciated by     7% and 3%, respectively, against the U.S. dollar during     2010. The DAX           Index and the FTSE 100 Index increased by 16% and 9%,     respectively, while the Euro Stoxx 50 Index and the CAC 40 Index     declined by 6% and 3%, respectively, compared with the end of     2009.     Asia       In Japan, real GDP increased by an estimated 3.9% in 2010,     compared with a decrease of 6.3% in 2009. Growth primarily     reflected a significant increase in exports, as well as an     increase in consumer spending. Measures of inflation remained     negative during 2010. The Bank of Japan reduced its target     overnight call rate from 0.10% to a range of zero to 0.10% and     the yield on     10-year     Japanese government bonds fell by 17 basis points to 1.13%. The     Japanese yen appreciated by 13% against the U.S. dollar.     The Nikkei 225 Index decreased 3% during the year. In China,     real GDP growth was an estimated 10.3% in 2010, up from 9.2% in     2009. Economic growth was     broad-based,     with significant increases in exports, retail spending and     business investment. Measures of inflation increased during     2010, reflecting continued growth in demand. The Peoples     Bank of China raised its     one-year     benchmark lending rate by 50 basis points during the year to     5.81% and the Chinese yuan appreciated by 3% against the     U.S. dollar. The Shanghai Composite Index decreased by 14%     during 2010, partially due to concerns over the effect of     tighter policy on economic growth. In India, real GDP growth was     an estimated 8.5% in 2010, up from 7.5% in 2009. Growth     primarily reflected an increase in domestic demand, partially     offset by the impact of lower net exports. The rate of wholesale     inflation increased during the year. The Indian rupee     appreciated by 3% against the U.S. dollar. Equity markets     in Hong Kong ended the year higher and equity markets in India     and South Korea increased significantly during 2010.     Other     Markets       In Brazil, real GDP increased by an estimated 7.6% in 2010,     compared with a decline of 0.6% in 2009. The increase in real     GDP primarily reflected an increase in domestic demand. The     Brazilian real strengthened against the U.S. dollar.     Brazilian equity prices ended the year slightly higher compared     with the end of 2009. In Russia, real GDP increased by an     estimated 4.0% in 2010, compared with a decline of 7.9% in 2009.     Rising oil prices led to a significant improvement in investment     growth, following a decline in 2009. The Russian ruble was     essentially unchanged against the U.S. dollar and Russian     equity prices ended the year significantly higher compared with     2009.              39       Table of Contents       Critical     Accounting Policies      Fair     Value      Fair Value Hierarchy.  Financial instruments     owned, at fair value and Financial instruments sold, but not yet     purchased, at fair value (i.e., inventory), as well as     certain other financial assets and financial liabilities, are     reflected in our consolidated statements of financial condition     at fair value     (i.e., marked-to-market),     with related gains or losses generally recognized in our     consolidated statements of earnings. The use of fair value to     measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk     management practices and is our most critical accounting policy.         The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that     would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a     liability in an orderly transaction between market participants     at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the     hierarchy under U.S. generally accepted accounting     principles (U.S. GAAP) gives (i) the highest priority     to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical     assets or liabilities (level 1 inputs), (ii) the next     priority to inputs other than level 1 inputs that are     observable either directly or indirectly (level 2 inputs),     and (iii) the lowest priority to inputs that cannot be     observed in market activity (level 3 inputs). Assets and     liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest     level of input that is significant to their fair value     measurement.         The fair values for substantially all of our financial assets     and financial liabilities, including derivatives, are based on     observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels 1     and 2 of the hierarchy. Certain level 2 financial     instruments may require appropriate discounts     (i.e., valuation adjustments) for factors such as:                      transfer restrictions;                  the credit quality of a counterparty or the firm; and                  other premiums and discounts that a market participant would     require to arrive at fair value.           Valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence.             Instruments categorized within level 3 of the fair value     hierarchy, which represent approximately 5% of the firms     total assets, require one or more significant inputs that are     not observable. Absent evidence to the contrary, instruments     classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are     initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be     the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequent to the     transaction date, we use other methodologies to determine fair     value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Estimating     the fair value of level 3 financial instruments may require     judgments to be made. These judgments include:                      determining the appropriate valuation methodology     and/or model     for each type of level 3 financial instrument;                  determining model inputs based on an evaluation of all relevant     empirical market data, including prices evidenced by market     transactions, interest rates, credit spreads, volatilities and     correlations; and                  determining appropriate valuation adjustments related to     illiquidity or counterparty credit quality.           Regardless of the methodology, valuation inputs and assumptions     are only changed when corroborated by substantive evidence.     Controls Over Valuation of Financial     Instruments.  Our control infrastructure is     independent of the revenue-producing units and is fundamental to     ensuring that all of our financial instruments are appropriately     valued at     market-clearing     levels. In particular, our independent price verification     process is critical to ensuring that financial instruments are     properly valued.            40       Table of Contents         Price Verification.  The objective of price     verification is to have an informed and independent opinion with     regard to the valuation of financial instruments under review.     Instruments that have one or more significant inputs which     cannot be corroborated by external market data are classified     within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.         In situations where there is a question about a valuation, the     ultimate valuation is determined by senior managers in control     and support functions that are independent of the     revenue-producing units (independent control and support     functions). Price verification strategies utilized by our     independent control and support functions include:                   Trade Comparison.  Analysis of trade data (both     internal and external where available) is used to determine the     most relevant pricing inputs and valuations.               External Price Comparison.  Valuations and     prices are compared to pricing data obtained from third parties     (e.g., broker or dealers, MarkIt, Bloomberg, IDC, TRACE).     Data obtained from various sources is compared to ensure     consistency and validity. When broker or dealer quotations or     third-party     pricing vendors are used for valuation or price verification,     greater priority is generally given to executable quotations.               Calibration to Market Comparables. Market-based     transactions are used to corroborate the valuation of positions     with similar characteristics, risks and components.               Relative Value     Analyses.  Market-based     transactions are analyzed to determine the similarity, measured     in terms of risk, liquidity and return, of one instrument     relative to another, or for a given instrument, of one maturity     relative to another.               Collateral Analyses.  Margin disputes on     derivatives are examined and investigated to determine the     impact, if any, on our valuations.               Execution of trades.  Where appropriate,     trading desks are instructed to execute trades in order to     provide evidence of     market-clearing     levels.               Backtesting.  Valuations are corroborated by     comparison to values realized upon sales.           See Notes 5 through 8 to the consolidated financial     statements in Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     for further information about fair value measurements.         Review of Net Revenues.  Independent control     and support functions ensure adherence to our pricing policy     through a combination of daily procedures, one of which is the     process of validating and understanding results by attributing     and explaining net revenues by the underlying factors. Through     this process we independently validate net revenues, identify     and resolve potential fair value or trade booking issues on a     timely basis and ensure that risks are being properly     categorized and quantified.     Review of Valuation Models.  Quantitative     professionals within our Market Risk Management department     (Market Risk Management) perform an independent model approval     process. This process incorporates a review of a diverse set of     model and trade parameters across a broad range of values     (including extreme     and/or     improbable conditions) in order to critically evaluate:                      a models suitability for valuation and risk management of     a particular instrument type;                  the models accuracy in reflecting the characteristics of     the related product and its significant risks;                  the suitability and properties of the numerical algorithms     incorporated in the model;                  the models consistency with models for similar products;     and                  the models sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions.           New or changed models are reviewed and approved. Models are     evaluated and re-approved annually to assess the impact of any     changes in the product or market and any market developments in     pricing theories.         See Market Risk Management and Credit Risk     Management for a further discussion of how we manage the     risks inherent in our businesses.            41       Table of Contents         Level 3 Financial Assets at Fair     Value.  The table below presents financial assets     measured at fair value and the amount of such assets that are     classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.         Total level 3 assets were $45.38 billion and     $46.48 billion as of December 2010 and     December 2009, respectively. The decrease in level 3     assets during the year ended December 2010 primarily     reflected (i) sales and transfers to level 2 of loans     and securities backed by commercial real estate; and     (ii) net           reductions in level 3 financial instruments as a result of     the consolidations of certain variable interest entities (VIEs).     This decrease was partially offset by an increase in derivatives     primarily due to unrealized gains on credit derivatives,     principally resulting from changes in level 2 inputs.

Goodwill is the cost of acquired     companies in excess of the fair value of net assets, including     identifiable intangible assets, at the acquisition date. The     reorganization of the firms segments in 2010 resulted in     the reallocation of assets, including goodwill, and liabilities     across our reporting units. See Notes 13 and 27 to the     consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8     of this     Form 10-K     for further information on segments.         We test the goodwill in each of our reporting units for     impairment at least annually, by comparing the estimated fair     value of each reporting unit with its estimated net book value.     We derive the fair value based on valuation techniques we     believe market participants would use (i.e., observable     price-to-earnings     multiples and     price-to-book     multiples). We derive the net book value by estimating the     amount of shareholders equity required to support the     activities of each reporting unit. Estimating the fair value of     our reporting units requires management to make judgments.     Critical inputs include (i) projected earnings,     (ii) estimated     long-term     growth rates and (iii) cost of equity. Our last annual     impairment test was performed during our 2010 fourth quarter and     no impairment was identified. See Note 13 to the     consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8     of this     Form 10-K     for the carrying value of our goodwill by operating segment.     Identifiable Intangible Assets.  We amortize     our identifiable intangible assets over their estimated lives     or, in the case of insurance contracts, in proportion to     estimated gross profits or premium revenues. Identifiable     intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or     changes in circumstances suggest that an assets or asset     groups carrying value may not be fully recoverable.             An impairment loss, generally calculated as the difference     between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an     asset or asset group, is recognized if the sum of the estimated     undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is     less than the corresponding carrying value. See Note 13 to     the consolidated financial statements in Part II,     Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     for the carrying value and estimated remaining lives of our     identifiable intangible assets by major asset class and the     carrying value of our identifiable intangible assets by     operating segment.         A prolonged period of market weakness could adversely impact our     businesses and impair the value of our identifiable intangible     assets. In addition, certain events could indicate a potential     impairment of our identifiable intangible assets, including     (i) changes in trading volumes or market structure that     could adversely affect our NYSE DMM business (see discussion     below), (ii) an adverse action or assessment by a     regulator, (iii) adverse actual experience on the contracts     in our variable annuity and life insurance business,     (iv) decreases in cash receipts from television broadcast     royalties or (v) decreases in revenues from     commodity-related customer contracts and relationships.     Management judgment is required to evaluate whether indications     of potential impairment have occurred, and to test intangibles     for impairment if required.     NYSE DMM Rights.  During the fourth quarter of     2010, as a result of continuing weak operating results in our     NYSE DMM business, we tested our NYSE DMM rights for impairment     in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board     Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360. Because the     carrying value of our NYSE DMM rights exceeded the projected     undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining useful life     of our NYSE DMM rights, we determined that the rights were     impaired. We recorded an impairment loss of $305 million,     which was included in our Institutional Client Services segment     in the fourth quarter of 2010. This impairment loss represented     the excess of the carrying value of our NYSE DMM rights over     their estimated fair value. We estimated this fair value, which     is a level 3 measurement, using a relative value analysis     which incorporated a comparison to another DMM portfolio that     was transacted between third parties. As of December 2010,     the carrying value of our NYSE DMM rights was $76 million.            43       Table of Contents             Use of     Estimates                 The use of generally accepted accounting principles requires     management to make certain estimates and assumptions. In     addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value     measurements and the accounting for goodwill and identifiable     intangible assets, the use of estimates and assumptions is also     important in determining provisions for potential losses that     may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax     audits.         We estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out     of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such     losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In     accounting for income taxes, we estimate and provide for     potential liabilities that may arise out of tax audits to the     extent that uncertain tax positions fail to meet the recognition     standard under ASC 740. See Note 26 to the consolidated     financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     for further information about accounting for income taxes.             Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and     our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different.     Our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and     regulatory proceedings is determined on a     case-by-case     basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after     considering, among other factors, the progress of each case or     proceeding, our experience and the experience of others in     similar cases or proceedings, and the opinions and views of     legal counsel. See Note 30 to the consolidated financial     statements in Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     for information on certain judicial, regulatory and legal     proceedings.      Results of     Operations          The composition of our net revenues has varied over time as     financial markets and the scope of our operations have changed.     The composition of net revenues can also vary over the shorter     term due to fluctuations in U.S. and global economic and     market conditions.

The table below presents our average common     shareholders equity.

We believe that presenting our results excluding the impact of     the U.K. bank payroll tax, the SEC settlement and the NYSE DMM     rights impairment is meaningful, as excluding these items     increases the comparability of     period-to-period     results.

Net revenues were     $39.16 billion for 2010, 13% lower than 2009, reflecting     significantly lower net revenues in Institutional Client     Services and slightly lower net revenues in Investment Banking.     These decreases were partially offset by significantly higher     net revenues in Investing & Lending and higher net     revenues in Investment Management.                  Institutional Client Services.  The decrease in     Institutional Client Services reflected significantly lower net     revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client     Execution and, to a lesser extent, Equities. During 2010, Fixed     Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution operated in a     challenging environment characterized by lower client activity     levels, which reflected broad market concerns including European     sovereign debt risk and uncertainty over regulatory reform, as     well as tighter bid/offer spreads. The decrease in net revenues     compared with a particularly strong 2009 primarily reflected     significantly lower results in interest rate products, credit     products, commodities and, to a lesser extent, currencies. These     decreases were partially offset by higher net revenues in     mortgages, as 2009 included approximately $1 billion of     losses on commercial     mortgage-related     products.           The decline in Equities compared with 2009 primarily reflected     significantly lower net revenues in equities client execution,     principally due to significantly lower results in derivatives     and shares. Commissions and fees were also lower than 2009,     primarily reflecting lower client activity levels. In addition,     securities services net revenues were significantly lower     compared with 2009, primarily reflecting tighter securities     lending spreads, principally due to the impact of changes in the     composition of customer balances, partially offset by the impact     of higher average customer balances. During 2010, although     equity markets were volatile during the first half of the year,     equity prices generally improved and volatility levels declined     in the second half of the year.                       Investment Banking.  The decrease in Investment     Banking reflected lower net revenues in our Underwriting     business, partially offset by higher net revenues in Financial     Advisory. The decline in Underwriting reflected lower net     revenues in equity underwriting, principally due to a decline in     client activity in comparison to 2009, which included     significant capital-raising activity by financial institution     clients. Net revenues in debt underwriting were essentially     unchanged compared with 2009. The increase in Financial Advisory     primarily reflected an increase in client activity.               Investing & Lending.  During 2010, an     increase in global equity markets and tighter credit spreads     provided a favorable backdrop for our Investing &     Lending business. Results in Investing & Lending for     2010 primarily reflected a gain of $747 million from our     investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC, a net gain of     $2.69 billion from other equity securities and a net gain     of $2.60 billion from debt securities and loans. In 2009,     results in Investing & Lending primarily reflected a     gain of $1.58 billion from our investment in the ordinary     shares of ICBC, a net gain of $1.05 billion from debt     securities and loans, and a net loss of $596 million from     other equity securities.               Investment Management.  The increase in     Investment Management primarily reflected higher incentive fees     across our alternative investment products. Management and other     fees also increased, reflecting favorable changes in the mix of     assets under management, as well as the impact of appreciation     in the value of client assets. During 2010, assets under     management decreased 4% to $840 billion, primarily     reflecting outflows in money market assets, consistent with     industry trends.              46       Table of Contents         2009 versus 2008.  Net revenues were     $45.17 billion in 2009, more than double the amount in     2008, reflecting significantly improved results in     Investing & Lending, as well as significantly higher     net revenues in Institutional Client Services. These increases     were partially offset by lower net revenues in Investment     Management and Investment Banking.                   Investing & Lending.  The increase in     Investing & Lending primarily reflected net gains from     debt securities and loans and from our investment in the     ordinary shares of ICBC, compared with net losses in 2008, as     well as lower net losses from other equity securities. In 2009,     results in Investing & Lending primarily reflected a     gain of $1.58 billion from our investment in the ordinary     shares of ICBC, a net gain of $1.05 billion from debt     securities and loans and a net loss of $596 million from     other equity securities. During 2009, our Investing &     Lending results reflected a recovery in global credit and equity     markets following significant weakness during 2008. However,     continued weakness in commercial real estate markets negatively     impacted our results during 2009. In 2008, results in     Investing & Lending primarily reflected a loss of     $446 million from our investment in the ordinary shares of     ICBC, a net loss of $6.33 billion from debt securities and     loans and a net loss of $5.95 billion from other equity     securities.               Institutional Client Services.  The increase in     Institutional Client Services reflected a very strong     performance in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client     Execution. During 2009, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities     Client Execution operated in an environment characterized by     strong client-driven activity, particularly in more liquid     products. In addition, asset values generally improved and     corporate credit spreads tightened significantly for most of the     year. Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities     Client Execution were significantly higher compared with 2008,     reflecting particularly strong performances in credit products,     mortgages and interest rate products, which were each     significantly higher than 2008. Net revenues in commodities were     also particularly strong and were higher than 2008, while net     revenues in currencies were strong, but lower than a     particularly strong 2008. During 2009, mortgages included     approximately $1 billion of losses on commercial     mortgage-related     products. Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client     Execution results in 2008 included a loss of approximately     $3.1 billion (net of hedges) related to     non-investment-grade     credit origination activities. In addition, results in mortgages     in 2008 included net losses of approximately                           $900 million on residential     mortgage-related     products and approximately $600 million on commercial     mortgage-related     products.           Net revenues in Equities for 2009 were lower compared with a     particularly strong 2008, reflecting significant decreases in     securities services and commissions and fees. The decrease in     securities services primarily reflected the impact of lower     customer balances, reflecting lower hedge fund industry assets     and reduced leverage. The decrease in commissions and fees     primarily reflected lower average market levels in Europe and     Asia, as well as lower transaction volumes compared with 2008.     These decreases were partially offset by strong results in     equities client execution, primarily reflecting higher net     revenues in derivatives and shares. During 2009, Equities     operated in an environment characterized by a significant     increase in global equity prices and a significant decline in     volatility levels.                   Investment Management.  The decrease in     Investment Management primarily reflected the impact of changes     in the composition of assets managed, principally due to equity     market depreciation during the fourth quarter of 2008, as well     as lower incentive fees. During 2009, assets under management     increased $73 billion to $871 billion, due to     $76 billion of market appreciation, primarily in fixed     income and equity assets, partially offset by $3 billion of     net outflows. Outflows in money market assets were offset by     inflows in fixed income assets.               Investment Banking.  The decrease in Investment     Banking reflected significantly lower net revenues in Financial     Advisory, partially offset by higher net revenues in our     Underwriting business. The decrease in Financial Advisory     reflected a decline in     industry-wide     completed mergers and acquisitions. The increase in Underwriting     reflected higher net revenues in equity underwriting, primarily     reflecting an increase in     industry-wide     equity and     equity-related     offerings, including significant capital-raising activity by     financial institution clients during 2009. Net revenues in debt     underwriting were lower than 2008, primarily reflecting     significantly lower net revenues from leveraged finance     activity, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues     from     investment-grade     and municipal activity.              47       Table of Contents         One Month Ended December 2008.  Net     revenues were $183 million for the month of     December 2008. These results reflected a continuation of     the difficult operating environment experienced during our     fiscal fourth quarter of 2008, particularly across global equity     and credit markets.                   Investing &     Lending.  Investing & Lending     recorded negative net revenues of $1.63 billion for the     month of December 2008. During the month of December,     continued weakness in global equity and credit markets     negatively impacted results in our Investing & Lending     business. Results for December 2008 primarily reflected net     losses of $1.08 billion from equity securities (excluding     ICBC) and $856 million from debt securities and loans,     partially offset by a gain of $228 million from our     investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC.               Institutional Client Services.  Net revenues in     Institutional Client Services were $1.33 billion for the     month of December 2008. During the month of December,     market opportunities were favorable for certain of our Fixed     Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution product areas,     as interest rate products, commodities and currencies each     produced strong results. However, the environment for Fixed     Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution also reflected     continued weakness in the broader credit markets, as results in     credit products included a loss of approximately $1 billion     (net of hedges) related to     non-investment-grade     credit origination activities, primarily reflecting a writedown     of approximately $850 million related to the bridge and     bank loan facilities held in LyondellBasell Finance Company. In     addition, results in mortgages included a loss of approximately     $400 million on commercial     mortgage-related     products.           Results in Equities reflected lower commission volumes, as well     as lower client execution net revenues from derivatives compared     with average monthly levels in 2008. Net revenues in securities     services were also lower compared with average monthly levels in     2008, reflecting a decline in total average customer balances,     partially offset by the impact of favorable changes in the     composition of securities lending balances. During the month of     December, Equities operated in an environment characterized by     continued weakness in global equity markets and continued high     levels of volatility.                       Investment Banking.  Net revenues in Investment     Banking were $138 million for the month of     December 2008 and reflected very low levels of activity in     industry-wide     completed mergers and acquisitions, as well as continued     challenging market conditions across equity and leveraged     finance markets, which adversely affected our Underwriting     business.               Investment Management.  Net revenues in     Investment Management were $343 million for the month of     December 2008. During the calendar month of December,     assets under management increased $19 billion to     $798 billion, due to $13 billion of market     appreciation, primarily in fixed income and equity assets, and     $6 billion of net inflows. Net inflows reflected inflows in     money market assets, partially offset by outflows in fixed     income, equity and alternative investment assets.       Net Interest     Income   2010 versus 2009.  Net revenues for 2010     included net interest income of $5.50 billion, 26% lower     than 2009. The decrease compared with 2009 was primarily due to     lower average fixed income assets, most notably     U.S. federal agency obligations, higher interest expense     related to our     long-term     borrowings and tighter securities lending spreads.     2009 versus 2008.  Net revenues for 2009     included net interest income of $7.41 billion, 73% higher     than 2008. The increase compared with 2008 was primarily due to     lower interest expense on our     long-term     and     short-term     borrowings, partially offset by tighter spreads on     collateralized financing activity, as well as lower average     customer margin lending balances and financial instruments     owned, at fair value.     One Month Ended December 2008.  Net     revenues included net interest income of $685 million for     the month of December 2008. The increase compared with     average monthly net interest income in 2008 was primarily due to     higher average fixed income assets, most notably     U.S. federal agency obligations.     Operating     Expenses       Our operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation,     headcount and levels of business activity. Compensation and     benefits includes salaries, discretionary compensation,     amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits.     Discretionary compensation is significantly impacted by, among     other factors, the level of net revenues, prevailing labor     markets, business mix, the structure of our     share-based     compensation programs and the external environment.              48       Table of Contents        The table below presents our operating expenses and total staff.

Includes employees, consultants and temporary staff.          2.        Compensation and benefits and     non-compensation     expenses related to consolidated entities held for investment     purposes are included in their respective line items in the     consolidated statements of earnings. Consolidated entities held     for investment purposes are entities that are held strictly for     capital appreciation, have a defined exit strategy and are     engaged in activities that are not closely related to our     principal businesses.          2010 versus 2009.  Operating expenses were     $26.27 billion for 2010, 4% higher than 2009. Compensation     and benefits expenses were $15.38 billion for 2010, a 5%     decline compared with $16.19 billion for 2009, due to lower     net revenues. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net     revenues for 2010 was     39.3% 1      (which excludes the impact of the $465 million U.K. bank     payroll tax), compared with 35.8% for 2009. Total staff     increased 10% during 2010. Total staff including consolidated     entities held for investment purposes increased 7% during 2010.             During 2010, the United Kingdom enacted legislation that imposed     a     non-deductible     50% tax on certain financial institutions in respect of     discretionary bonuses in excess of £25,000 awarded under     arrangements made between December 9, 2009 and     April 5, 2010 to relevant banking     employees. Our operating expenses for 2010 included     $465 million related to this tax.                       1.        We believe that presenting our ratio of compensation and     benefits to net revenues excluding the impact of the U.K. bank     payroll tax is meaningful, as excluding this item increases the     comparability of     period-to-period     results.                                                  Year Ended                  $ in millions       December 2010                             Compensation and benefits (which excludes the impact of the     $465 million U.K. bank payroll tax)        $   15,376                      Ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues            39.3%                      Compensation and benefits, including the impact of the     $465 million U.K. bank payroll tax        $   15,841                      Ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues, including     the impact of the $465 million U.K. bank payroll tax            40.5%                                      49       Table of Contents         Non-compensation     expenses were $10.43 billion for 2010, 14% higher than     2009. This increase was primarily attributable to the impact of     net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of     $682 million, including $550 million related to the     SEC settlement (see Note 30 to the consolidated financial     statements in Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     for further information), and an impairment of our NYSE DMM     rights of $305 million, each during 2010. The remainder of     the increase compared with 2009 generally reflected higher     professional fees, market development expenses and occupancy     expenses. These increases were partially offset by the impact of     significantly higher real estate impairment charges during 2009     related to our consolidated entities held for investment     purposes, as well as higher charitable contributions during     2009. The real estate impairment charges, which were measured     based on discounted cash flow analyses, are included in our     Investing & Lending segment and reflected weakness in     the commercial real estate markets. Charitable contributions     were approximately $420 million during 2010, primarily     including $25 million to The Goldman Sachs Foundation and     $320 million to Goldman Sachs Gives, our     donor-advised     fund. Compensation was reduced to fund the charitable     contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives. The firm asks its     participating managing directors to make recommendations     regarding potential charitable recipients for this contribution.     2009 versus 2008.  Operating expenses were     $25.34 billion for 2009, 27% higher than 2008. Compensation     and benefits expenses of $16.19 billion were higher     compared with 2008, due to higher net revenues. Our ratio of     compensation and benefits to net revenues for 2009 was 35.8%,     down from 48.0% (excluding severance costs of approximately     $275 million in the fourth quarter of 2008) for 2008.     Total staff decreased 2% during 2009. Total staff including     consolidated entities held for investment purposes decreased 5%     during 2009.         Non-compensation     expenses were $9.15 billion for 2009, 2% higher than 2008.     The increase compared with 2008 reflected the impact of     charitable contributions of approximately $850 million     during 2009, primarily including $310 million to The     Goldman Sachs Foundation and $500 million to Goldman Sachs     Gives. Compensation was reduced to fund the charitable     contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives. The firm asks its     participating managing directors to make recommendations     regarding potential charitable recipients for this contribution.     Depreciation and amortization expenses also increased compared     with 2008 and included real estate impairment charges of     approximately $600 million related to consolidated entities     held for investment purposes during 2009. The real estate     impairment charges, which were measured based on discounted cash     flow analyses, are included in our Investing & Lending     segment and reflected weakness in the commercial real estate     markets, particularly in Asia. These increases were partially     offset by the impact of lower brokerage, clearing, exchange and     distribution fees, principally reflecting lower transaction     volumes in Equities, and the impact of reduced staff levels and     expense reduction initiatives during 2009.     One Month Ended December 2008.  Operating     expenses were $1.44 billion for the month of     December 2008. Compensation and benefits expenses were     $744 million. No discretionary compensation was accrued for     the month of December. Total staff decreased 3% compared with     the end of fiscal year 2008. Total staff including consolidated     entities held for investment purposes decreased 3% compared with     the end of fiscal year 2008.     Non-compensation     expenses of $697 million for the month of     December 2008 were generally lower than average monthly     levels in 2008, primarily reflecting lower levels of business     activity. Total     non-compensation     expenses included $68 million of net provisions for a     number of litigation and regulatory proceedings.            50       Table of Contents            Provision for     Taxes            The effective income tax rate for 2010, excluding the impact of     the $465 million U.K. bank payroll tax and the     $550 million SEC settlement, substantially all of which is     non-deductible,     was     32.7% 1,      essentially unchanged from 2009. Including the impact of these     amounts, the effective income tax rate was 35.2% for 2010.         The effective income tax rate for 2009 was 32.5%, compared with     approximately 1% for 2008. The increase in the effective income     tax rate for 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to     changes in the geographic earnings mix and a decrease in     permanent benefits as a percentage of higher earnings. The     effective income tax rate for 2009 represented a return to a     geographic earnings mix that is more in line with our historic     earnings mix. During 2008, we incurred losses in various     U.S. and       non-U.S. entities     whose income/(losses) are subject to tax in the U.S. We     also had profitable operations in certain     non-U.S. entities     that are taxed at their applicable local tax rates, which are     generally lower than the U.S. rate.         The effective income tax rate for the month of     December 2008 was 38.0%.         Effective January 1, 2010, the rules related to the     deferral of U.S. tax on certain     non-repatriated     active financing income expired. During December 2010, the     rules were extended retroactively through     December 31, 2011. If these rules are not extended     beyond December 2011, the expiration may materially     increase our effective income tax rate beginning in 2012.                       1.        We believe that presenting our effective income tax rate     excluding the impact of the U.K. bank payroll tax and the SEC     settlement, substantially all of which is     non-deductible,     is meaningful, as excluding these items increases the     comparability of     period-to-period     results. The table below presents the calculation of the     effective income tax rate excluding the impact of these amounts.

The cost drivers of Goldman Sachs taken as a     whole  compensation,     headcount and levels of business activity  are     broadly similar in each of our business segments. Compensation     and benefits expenses within our segments reflect, among other     factors, the overall performance of Goldman Sachs as well as the     performance of individual businesses. Consequently,     pre-tax     margins in one segment of our business may be significantly     affected by the performance of our other business segments.

Net revenues in Investment     Banking were $4.81 billion for 2010, 3% lower than 2009.         Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $2.06 billion, 9%     higher than 2009, primarily reflecting an increase in client     activity. Net revenues in our Underwriting business were     $2.75 billion, 11% lower than 2009, reflecting lower net     revenues in equity underwriting, principally due to a decline in     client activity in comparison to 2009, which included     significant capital-raising activity by financial institution     clients. Net revenues in debt underwriting were essentially     unchanged compared with 2009.             Our investment banking transaction backlog decreased compared     with the end of 2009. Our investment banking transaction backlog     represents an estimate of our future net revenues from     investment banking transactions where we believe that future     revenue realization is more likely than not. The decrease     compared with the end of 2009 reflected a decline in estimated     net revenues from potential debt and equity underwriting     transactions, primarily related to client mandates to underwrite     leveraged finance transactions and common stock offerings. This     decrease was partially offset by an increase in estimated net     revenues from potential advisory transactions.         Operating expenses were $3.51 billion for 2010, essentially     unchanged from 2009.     Pre-tax     earnings were $1.30 billion in 2010, 14% lower than 2009.            53       Table of Contents         2009 versus 2008.  Net revenues in Investment     Banking were $4.98 billion for 2009, 9% lower than 2008.         Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $1.90 billion for     2009, 29% lower than 2008, reflecting a decline in     industry-wide     completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in our     Underwriting business were $3.09 billion, 11% higher than     2008, due to higher net revenues in equity underwriting,     primarily reflecting an increase in     industry-wide     equity and     equity-related     offerings, including significant     capital-raising     activity by financial institution clients during 2009. Net     revenues in debt underwriting were lower than 2008, primarily     reflecting significantly lower net revenues from leveraged     finance activity, partially offset by significantly higher net     revenues from     investment-grade     and municipal activity.         Our investment banking transaction backlog increased     significantly during the twelve months ended December 2009.     The increase was primarily due to potential equity and debt     underwriting transactions from client mandates to underwrite     initial public offerings and, to a lesser extent, leveraged     finance transactions, principally due to increased levels of     client activity. The advisory backlog also increased, but was     not a material contributor to the change.         Operating expenses were $3.48 billion for 2009, 7% higher     than 2008, due to increased compensation and benefits expenses.     Pre-tax     earnings were $1.50 billion in 2009, 31% lower than 2008.         One Month Ended December 2008.  Net     revenues in Investment Banking were $138 million for the     month of December 2008. Net revenues in Financial Advisory     were $73 million, reflecting very low levels of     industry-wide     completed mergers and acquisitions activity. Net revenues in our     Underwriting business were $65 million, reflecting     continued challenging market conditions across equity and     leveraged finance markets.         Our investment banking transaction backlog decreased during the     one month ended December 2008. The decrease in backlog was     primarily due to a decline in potential advisory transactions,     principally due to a decline in client activity.         Operating expenses were $170 million for the month of     December 2008.     Pre-tax loss     was $32 million for the month of December 2008.     Institutional     Client Services       Our Institutional Client Services segment is comprised of:     Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client     Execution.

Net revenues in     Institutional Client Services were $21.80 billion for 2010,     33% lower than 2009.         Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client     Execution were $13.71 billion for 2010, 37% lower than a     particularly strong 2009. During 2010, Fixed Income, Currency     and Commodities Client Execution operated in a challenging     environment characterized by lower client activity levels, which     reflected broad market concerns including European sovereign     debt risk and uncertainty over regulatory reform, as well as     tighter bid/offer spreads. The decrease in net revenues compared     with 2009 primarily reflected significantly lower results in     interest rate products, credit products, commodities and, to a     lesser extent, currencies. These decreases were partially offset     by higher net revenues in mortgages, as 2009 included     approximately $1 billion of losses on commercial     mortgage-related     products.         Certain unfavorable conditions emerged during the second quarter     of 2010 that made the environment more challenging for our     businesses, resulting in lower client activity levels. These     conditions included broad market concerns, such as European     sovereign debt risk and uncertainty regarding financial     regulatory reform, sharply higher equity volatility levels,     lower global equity prices and wider corporate credit spreads.     In addition, a more competitive environment drove tighter     bid/offer spreads. During the second half of 2010, some of these     conditions reversed as equity volatility levels decreased,     global equity prices recovered and corporate credit spreads     narrowed. However, lower client activity levels, reflecting     broad market concerns, including European sovereign debt risk     and uncertainty over regulatory reform, continued to negatively     impact our results. If these concerns were to continue over the     long term, net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and     Commodities Client Execution would likely continue to be     negatively impacted.         Net revenues in Equities were $8.09 billion for 2010, 25%     lower than 2009, primarily reflecting significantly lower net     revenues in equities client execution, principally due to     significantly lower results in derivatives and shares.     Commissions and fees were also lower than 2009, primarily     reflecting lower client activity levels. In addition, securities     services net revenues were significantly lower compared with     2009, primarily reflecting tighter securities lending spreads,     principally due to the impact of changes in the composition of     customer balances, partially offset by the impact of higher     average customer balances. During 2010, although equity markets     were volatile during the first half of the year, equity prices     generally improved and volatility levels declined in the second     half of the year.             Operating expenses were $14.29 billion for 2010, 4% higher     than 2009, due to the impact of the U.K. bank payroll tax, as     well as an impairment of our NYSE DMM rights of     $305 million. These increases were partially offset by     lower compensation and benefits expenses, resulting from lower     levels of discretionary compensation.     Pre-tax     earnings were $7.51 billion in 2010, 61% lower than 2009.     2009 versus 2008.  Net revenues in     Institutional Client Services were $32.72 billion for 2009,     46% higher compared with 2008.         Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client     Execution were $21.88 billion for 2009, significantly     higher compared with 2008. During 2009, Fixed Income, Currency     and Commodities Client Execution operated in an environment     characterized by strong client-driven activity, particularly in     more liquid products. In addition, asset values generally     improved and corporate credit spreads tightened significantly     for most of the year. The increase in net revenues compared with     2008 reflected particularly strong performances in credit     products, mortgages and interest rate products, which were each     significantly higher than 2008. Net revenues in commodities were     also particularly strong and were higher than 2008, while net     revenues in currencies were strong, but lower than a     particularly strong 2008. During 2009, mortgages included     approximately $1 billion of losses on commercial     mortgage-related     products. Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client     Execution results in 2008 included a loss of approximately     $3.1 billion (net of hedges) related to     non-investment-grade     credit origination activities. In addition, results in mortgages     in 2008 included net losses of approximately $900 million     on residential     mortgage-related     products and approximately $600 million on commercial     mortgage-related     products.         Net revenues in Equities were $10.84 billion for 2009, 17%     lower than a particularly strong 2008, reflecting significant     decreases in securities services and commissions and fees. The     decrease in securities services primarily reflected the impact     of lower customer balances, reflecting lower hedge fund industry     assets and reduced leverage. The decrease in commissions and     fees primarily reflected lower average market levels in Europe     and Asia, as well as lower transaction volumes compared with     2008. These decreases were partially offset by strong results in     equities client execution, primarily reflecting higher net     revenues in derivatives and shares. During 2009, Equities     operated in an environment characterized by a significant     increase in global equity prices and a significant decline in     volatility levels.            55       Table of Contents             Operating expenses were $13.69 billion for 2009, 33% higher     than 2008, due to increased compensation and benefits expenses,     resulting from higher net revenues. This increase was partially     offset by lower brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution     fees, principally reflecting lower transaction volumes in     Equities.     Pre-tax     earnings were $19.03 billion in 2009, 58% higher than 2008.     One Month Ended     December 2008.  Institutional Client Services     net revenues were $1.33 billion for the month of     December 2008.         Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution recorded     net revenues of $446 million for the month of     December 2008. During the month of December, market     opportunities were favorable for certain of our Fixed Income,     Currency and Commodities Client Execution product areas, as     interest rate products, commodities and currencies each produced     strong results. However, the environment for Fixed Income,     Currency and Commodities Client Execution also reflected     continued weakness in the broader credit markets, as results in     credit products included a loss of approximately $1 billion     (net of hedges) related to     non-investment-grade     credit origination activities, primarily reflecting a writedown     of approximately $850 million related to the bridge and     bank loan facilities held in LyondellBasell Finance Company. In     addition, results in mortgages included a loss of approximately     $400 million on commercial     mortgage-related     products.             Net revenues in Equities were $886 million for the month of     December 2008. These results reflected lower commission     volumes, as well as lower client execution net revenues from     derivatives compared with average monthly levels in 2008. Net     revenues in securities services were also lower compared with     average monthly levels in 2008, reflecting a decline in total     average customer balances, partially offset by the impact of     favorable changes in the composition of securities lending     balances. During the month of December, Equities operated in an     environment characterized by continued weakness in global equity     markets and continued high levels of volatility.         Operating expenses were $736 million for the month of     December 2008.     Pre-tax     earnings were $596 million for the month of     December 2008.

Investing &     Lending recorded net revenues of $7.54 billion for 2010.     During 2010, an increase in global equity markets and tighter     credit spreads provided a favorable backdrop for our     Investing & Lending business. Results for 2010     primarily reflected a gain of $747 million from our     investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC, a net gain of     $2.69 billion from other equity securities and a net gain     of $2.60 billion from debt securities and loans.             Operating expenses were $3.36 billion for 2010, 5% lower     than 2009, due to the impact of significantly higher real estate     impairment charges during 2009 related to consolidated entities     held for investment purposes, as well as decreased compensation     and benefits expenses, resulting from lower levels of     discretionary compensation.     Pre-tax     earnings were $4.18 billion in 2010, compared with a     pre-tax loss     of $660 million for 2009.            56       Table of Contents         2009 versus 2008.  Investing &     Lending recorded net revenues of $2.86 billion for 2009.     These results primarily reflected a gain of $1.58 billion     from our investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC, a net gain     of $1.05 billion from debt securities and loans and a net     loss of $596 million from other equity securities. During     2009, our Investing & Lending results reflected a     recovery in global credit and equity markets following     significant weakness during 2008. However, continued weakness in     commercial real estate markets negatively impacted our results     during 2009. In 2008, results in Investing & Lending     primarily reflected a loss of $446 million from our     investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC, a net loss of     $6.33 billion from debt securities and loans and a net loss     of $5.95 billion from other equity securities.         Operating expenses were $3.52 billion for 2009, 30% higher     than 2008, due to increased compensation and benefits expenses,     resulting from higher net revenues.     Pre-tax loss     was $660 million in 2009 compared with a     pre-tax loss     of $13.54 billion in 2008.     One Month Ended     December 2008.  Investing & Lending     recorded negative net revenues of $1.63 billion for the     month of December 2008. During the month of December,     continued weakness in global equity and credit markets     negatively impacted results in our Investing & Lending     business. Results for December 2008 primarily reflected net     losses of $1.08 billion from equity securities (excluding     ICBC)           and $856 million from debt securities and loans, partially     offset by a gain of $228 million from our investment in the     ordinary shares of ICBC.         Operating expenses were $204 million for the month of     December 2008.     Pre-tax loss     was $1.83 billion for the month of December 2008.

Includes market appreciation of $13 billion and net inflows     of $6 billion during the calendar month of     December 2008.              2010 versus 2009.  Net revenues in Investment     Management were $5.01 billion for 2010, 9% higher than     2009, primarily reflecting higher incentive fees across our     alternative investment products. Management and other fees also     increased, reflecting favorable changes in the mix of assets     under management, as well as the impact of appreciation in the     value of client assets. During 2010, assets under management     decreased 4% to $840 billion, primarily           reflecting outflows in money market assets, consistent with     industry trends.         Operating expenses were $4.05 billion for 2010, 10% higher     than 2009, primarily reflecting increased staff levels and the     impact of growth initiatives.     Pre-tax     earnings were $963 million in 2010, 3% higher than 2009.            58       Table of Contents         2009 versus 2008.  Net revenues in Investment     Management were $4.61 billion for 2009, 12% lower than     2008, primarily reflecting the impact of changes in the     composition of assets managed, principally due to equity market     depreciation during the fourth quarter of 2008, as well as lower     incentive fees. During 2009, assets under management increased     $73 billion to $871 billion, due to $76 billion     of market appreciation, primarily in fixed income and equity     assets, partially offset by $3 billion of net outflows.     Outflows in money market assets were offset by inflows in fixed     income assets.         Operating expenses were $3.67 billion for 2009, 4% higher     than 2008, due to higher levels of discretionary compensation.     Pre-tax     earnings were $934 million in 2009, 46% lower than 2008.     One Month Ended December 2008.  Net     revenues in Investment Management were $343 million for the     month of December 2008. During the calendar month of     December, assets under management increased $19 billion to     $798 billion, due to $13 billion of market     appreciation, primarily in fixed income and equity assets, and     $6 billion of net inflows. Net inflows reflected inflows in     money market assets, partially offset by outflows in fixed     income, equity and alternative investment assets.         Operating expenses were $263 million for the month of     December 2008.     Pre-tax     earnings were $80 million for the month of     December 2008.     Geographic     Data       See Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     for a summary of our total net revenues,     pre-tax     earnings and net earnings by geographic region.     Regulatory     Reform       On July 21, 2010, the     U.S. Dodd-Frank     Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act)     was enacted. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly restructures the     financial regulatory regime under which we operate. The     implications of the     Dodd-Frank     Act for our businesses will depend to a large extent on the     provisions of required future rulemaking by the Board of     Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board),     the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the SEC, the     U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and other     agencies, as well as the development of market practices and     structures under the regime established by the legislation and     the rules adopted           pursuant to it. However, we expect that there will be two     principal areas of impact for us:                      the prohibition on proprietary trading and the     limitation on the sponsorship of, and investment in, hedge funds     and private equity funds by banking entities, including bank     holding companies; and                  increased regulation of and restrictions on     over-the-counter     (OTC) derivatives markets and transactions.           In addition, the legislation creates a new systemic risk     oversight body to oversee and coordinate the efforts of the     primary U.S. financial regulatory agencies in establishing     regulations to address financial stability concerns, including     more stringent supervisory requirements and prudential standards     applicable to systemically important financial institutions.     Legal and regulatory changes under consideration in other     jurisdictions could also have an impact on our activities in     markets outside the United States. See     Business  Regulation in Part I,     Item 1 of this     Form 10-K     for more information.         In light of the Dodd-Frank Act, during 2010, we liquidated     substantially all of the positions that had been held within     Principal Strategies in our former Equities operating segment,     as this was a proprietary trading business. In addition, during     the first quarter of 2011, we commenced the liquidation of the     positions that had been held by the global macro proprietary     trading desk in our former Fixed Income, Currency and     Commodities operating segment. Net revenues from Principal     Strategies and our global macro proprietary trading desk were     not material for the year ended December 2010. The full     impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and other regulatory reforms on our     businesses, our clients and the markets in which we operate will     depend on the manner in which the relevant authorities develop     and implement the required rules and the reaction of market     participants to these regulatory developments over the next     several years. We will continue to assess our business, risk     management, and compliance practices to conform to developments     in the regulatory environment.            59       Table of Contents             Balance Sheet and     Funding Sources      Balance Sheet     Management            One of our most important risk management disciplines is our     ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet.     While our asset base changes due to client activity, market     fluctuations and business opportunities, the size and     composition of our balance sheet reflect (i) our overall     risk tolerance, (ii) our ability to access stable funding     sources and (iii) the amount of equity capital we hold.         Although our balance sheet fluctuates on a     day-to-day     basis, our total assets and adjusted assets at quarterly and     year-end dates are generally not materially different from those     occurring within our reporting periods.         In order to ensure appropriate risk management, we seek to     maintain a liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to     dynamically manage our assets and liabilities which include:                      quarterly planning;                  business-specific limits;                  monitoring of key metrics; and                  scenario analyses.       Quarterly Planning.  We prepare a quarterly     balance sheet plan that combines our projected total assets and     composition of assets with our expected funding sources and     capital levels for the upcoming quarter. The objectives of this     quarterly planning process are:                      to develop our near-term balance sheet projections, taking into     account the general state of the financial markets and expected     client-driven and firm-driven activity levels;                  to ensure that our projected assets are supported by an adequate     level and tenor of funding and that our projected capital and     liquidity metrics are within management guidelines; and                  to allow business risk managers and managers from our     independent control and support functions to objectively     evaluate balance sheet limit requests from business managers in     the context of the firms overall balance sheet     constraints. These constraints include the firms liability     profile and equity capital levels, maturities and plans for new     debt and equity issuances, share repurchases, deposit trends and     secured funding transactions.               To prepare our quarterly balance sheet plan, business risk     managers and managers from our independent control and support     functions meet with business managers to review current and     prior period metrics and discuss expectations for the upcoming     quarter. The specific metrics reviewed include asset and     liability size and composition, aged inventory, limit     utilization, risk and performance measures and capital usage.         Our consolidated quarterly plan, including our balance sheet     plans by business, funding and capital projections, and     projected capital and liquidity metrics, is reviewed by the     Finance Committee. See Overview and Structure of Risk     Management.     Business-Specific Limits.  The Finance     Committee sets asset and liability limits for each business and     aged inventory limits for certain financial instruments as a     disincentive to hold inventory over longer periods of time.     These limits are set at levels which are close to actual     operating levels in order to ensure prompt escalation and     discussion among business managers and managers in our     independent control and support functions on a routine basis.     The Finance Committee reviews and approves balance sheet limits     on a quarterly basis and may also approve changes in limits on     an ad hoc basis in response to changing business needs or market     conditions.            60       Table of Contents         Monitoring of Key Metrics.  We monitor key     balance sheet metrics daily both by business and on a     consolidated basis, including asset and liability size and     composition, aged inventory, limit utilization, risk measures     and capital usage. In our consolidated balance sheet, we     allocate assets to businesses and review and analyze movements     resulting from new business activity as well as market     fluctuations.     Scenario Analyses.  We conduct scenario     analyses to determine how we would manage the size and     composition of our balance sheet and maintain appropriate     funding, liquidity and capital positions in a variety of     situations:                      These scenarios cover     one-year and     two-year time horizons using various macro-economic and     firm-specific     assumptions. We use these analyses to assist us in developing     longer-term funding plans, including the level of unsecured debt     issuances, the size of our secured funding program and the     amount and composition of our equity capital. We also consider     any potential future constraints, such as limits on our ability     to grow our asset base in the absence of appropriate funding.                  Through our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP)     and our resolution and recovery planning, we further analyze how     we would manage our balance sheet through the duration of a     severe crisis and we develop plans for mitigating actions to     access funding, generate liquidity,     and/or     redeploy equity capital, as appropriate.           Balance Sheet     Allocation       In addition to preparing our consolidated statement of financial     condition in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we prepare a     balance sheet that generally allocates assets to our businesses.     We believe that presenting our assets on this basis is     meaningful because it is consistent with the way management     views and manages risks associated with the firms assets     and better enables investors to assess the liquidity of the     firms assets. The table below presents a summary of this     balance sheet allocation.

Excess Liquidity and Cash.  We maintain     substantial excess liquidity to meet a broad range of potential     cash outflows and collateral needs in the event of a stressed     environment. See Liquidity Risk below for details on     the composition and sizing of our excess liquidity pool or     Global Core Excess (GCE). In addition to our excess     liquidity, we maintain other operating cash balances, primarily     for use in specific currencies, entities, or jurisdictions where     we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity.     Secured Client Financing.  We provide     collateralized financing for client positions, including margin     loans secured by client collateral, securities borrowed, and     resale agreements primarily collateralized by government     obligations. As a result of client activities, we are required     to segregate cash and securities to satisfy regulatory     requirements. Our secured client financing arrangements, which     are generally     short-term,     are accounted for at fair value or at amounts that approximate     fair value, and include daily margin requirements to mitigate     counterparty credit risk.     Institutional Client Services.  In     Institutional Client Services, we maintain inventory positions     to facilitate market-making in fixed income, equity, currency     and commodity products. Additionally, as part of client     market-making     activities, we enter into resale or           securities borrowing arrangements to obtain securities which we     can use to cover transactions in which we or our clients have     sold securities that have not yet been purchased. The     receivables in Institutional Client Services primarily relate to     securities transactions.     Investing & Lending.  In     Investing & Lending, we make investments and originate     loans to provide financing to clients. These investments and     loans are typically longer-term in nature. We make investments,     directly and indirectly through funds that we manage, in debt     securities, loans, public and private equity securities, real     estate and other investments.     Other Assets.  Other assets are generally less     liquid,     non-financial     assets, including property, leasehold improvements and     equipment, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, income     tax-related receivables,     equity-method     investments and miscellaneous receivables.         The table below presents the reconciliation of this balance     sheet allocation to our U.S. GAAP balance sheet. In the     tables below, total assets for Institutional Client Services and     Investing & Lending represent the inventory and     related assets. These amounts differ from total assets by     business segment disclosed in Note 27 to the consolidated     financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     because total assets disclosed in Note 27 include     allocations of our excess liquidity and other cash, secured     client financing and other assets.

We seek to     maintain a liquid balance sheet comprised of assets that can be     readily funded on a secured basis. However, we do hold certain     financial instruments that may be more difficult to fund on a     secured basis, especially during times of market stress. We     focus on funding these assets with longer contractual maturities     to reduce the need to refinance in periods of market stress and     generally hold higher levels of total capital for these assets     than for more liquid types of financial instruments. The table     below presents our aggregate holdings in these categories of     financial instruments.

Balance Sheet     Analysis and Metrics       As of December 2010, total assets on our consolidated     statement of financial condition were $911.33 billion, an     increase of $62.39 billion from December 2009. This     increase is primarily due to (i) an increase in     collateralized agreements of $20.44 billion and an increase     in cash and securities segregated for regulatory and other     purposes of $17.07 billion, both primarily due to an     increase in client-driven activity, and (ii) an increase in     financial instruments owned, at fair value of     $14.55 billion, primarily due to increases in physical     commodities and U.S. government and federal agency     obligations.         As of December 2010, total liabilities on our consolidated     statement of financial condition were $833.98 billion, an     increase of $55.75 billion from December 2009. This     increase is primarily due to (i) an increase in securities     sold under agreements to repurchase of $33.99 billion,     primarily due to an increase in secured funding of our financial     instruments owned, at fair value, and an increase in     client-driven activity, (ii) an increase in other secured     financings of $14.24 billion, primarily due to     client-driven     activity and (iii) an increase in financial instruments     sold, but not yet purchased, at fair value of     $11.70 billion, primarily due to increases in     non-U.S. government     obligations and equities and convertible debentures.         As of December 2010, our total securities sold under     agreements to repurchase, accounted for as collateralized     financings, were $162.35 billion, which was 2% higher and     10% higher than the daily average amount of repurchase     agreements during the quarter ended and year ended     December 2010, respectively. As of December 2010, the     increase in our repurchase agreements relative to the daily     average during the quarter and year was due to an increase in     client-driven     activity at the end of the year and an increase in firm     financing activities. As of December 2009 our total     securities sold under agreements to repurchase, accounted for as     collateralized financings, were $128.36 billion, which was     2% lower and 8% lower than the daily average amount of     repurchase agreements during the quarter ended and year ended     December 2009, respectively. The level of our repurchase     agreements fluctuates between and within periods, primarily due     to providing clients with access to highly liquid collateral,     such as U.S. government, federal agency and     investment-grade     sovereign obligations through collateralized financing     activities.            63       Table of Contents             The table below presents information on our assets,     shareholders equity and leverage ratios.

Adjusted assets equals total     assets less     (i) low-risk     collateralized assets generally associated with our secured     client financing transactions and federal funds sold and     (ii) cash and securities we segregate for regulatory and     other purposes.

The leverage ratio equals     total assets divided by total shareholders equity and     measures the proportion of equity and debt the firm is using to     finance assets. This ratio is different from the Tier 1     leverage ratio included in Equity     Capital  Consolidated     Regulatory Capital Ratios below, and further described in     Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K.     Adjusted leverage ratio.  The adjusted leverage     ratio equals adjusted assets divided by total shareholders     equity. We believe that the adjusted leverage ratio is a more     meaningful measure of our capital adequacy than the leverage     ratio because it excludes certain     low-risk     collateralized assets that are generally supported with little     or no capital.             Our adjusted leverage ratio decreased to 7.6x as of     December 2010 from 7.8x as of December 2009 primarily     because our total shareholders equity grew at a higher     rate than our adjusted assets. Although total assets increased     by 7% during the period, this growth was principally comprised     of increases in     low-risk     assets (primarily securities purchased under agreements to     resell and cash and securities segregated for regulatory and     other purposes), which do not impact our adjusted assets.     Debt to equity ratio.  The debt to equity ratio     equals unsecured     long-term     borrowings divided by total shareholders equity.     Funding     Sources       Our primary sources of funding are secured financings, unsecured     long-term     and     short-term     borrowings, and deposits. We seek to maintain broad and     diversified funding sources globally.         We raise funding through a number of different products,     including:                      collateralized financings, such as repurchase agreements,     securities loaned and other secured financings;               long-term     unsecured debt through syndicated U.S. registered     offerings, U.S. registered and 144A     medium-term     note programs, offshore     medium-term     note offerings and other debt offerings;               short-term     unsecured debt through U.S. and     non-U.S. commercial     paper and promissory note issuances and other methods; and                  demand and savings deposits through cash sweep programs and time     deposits through internal and     third-party     broker networks.           We generally distribute our funding sources through our own     sales force to a large, diverse creditor base in a variety of     markets in the Americas, Europe and Asia. We believe that our     relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity.     Our creditors include banks, governments, securities lenders,     pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and     individuals. We have imposed various internal guidelines to     monitor creditor concentration across our primary funding     programs.            64       Table of Contents         Secured Funding.  We fund a significant amount     of our inventory on a secured basis. We believe secured funding     is more stable than unsecured financing because it is less     sensitive to changes in our credit quality due to the nature of     the collateral we post to our lenders. However, because the     terms or availability of secured funding, particularly     short-dated     funding, can deteriorate rapidly in a difficult environment, we     generally do not rely on     short-dated     secured funding unless it is collateralized with highly liquid     securities such as government obligations.         Substantially all of our other secured funding is executed for     tenors of one month or greater. Additionally, we monitor     counterparty concentration and hold a portion of our GCE for     refinancing risk associated with all secured funding     transactions. We seek longer terms for secured funding     collateralized by lower-quality assets because these funding     transactions may pose greater refinancing risk.             The weighted average maturity of our secured funding, excluding     funding collateralized by highly liquid securities eligible for     inclusion in our GCE, exceeded 100 days as of     December 2010.         A majority of our secured funding for securities not eligible     for inclusion in the GCE is executed through term repurchase     agreements and securities lending contracts. We also raise     financing through other types of collateralized financings, such     as secured loans and notes.     Unsecured     Long-Term     Borrowings.  We issue unsecured     long-term     borrowings as a source of capital to meet our     long-term     financing requirements and to finance a portion of our GCE. We     issue in different tenors, currencies, and products to maximize     the diversification of our investor base. The table below     presents our quarterly unsecured     long-term     borrowings maturity profile through 2016 as of     December 2010.        Unsecured     Long-Term Borrowings Maturity Profile   ($ in millions)                      65       Table of Contents           The weighted average maturity of our unsecured     long-term     borrowings as of December 2010 was approximately seven     years. To mitigate refinancing risk, we seek to limit the     principal amount of debt maturing on any one day or during any     week or year. We enter into interest rate swaps to convert a     substantial portion of our     long-term     borrowings into floating-rate obligations in order to minimize     our exposure to interest rates.     Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program     (TLGP).  As of December 2010, we had     $19.01 billion of senior unsecured debt outstanding     (comprised of $10.43 billion of     short-term     and $8.58 billion of     long-term)     guaranteed by the FDIC under the TLGP, all of which will mature     on or prior to June 15, 2012. We have not issued     long-term     debt under the TLGP since March 2009 and the program has     expired for new issuances.     Unsecured     Short-Term     Borrowings.  A significant portion of our     short-term     borrowings were originally     long-term     debt that is scheduled to mature within one year of the     reporting date. We use     short-term     borrowings to finance liquid assets and for other cash     management purposes. We primarily issue commercial paper,     promissory notes, and other hybrid instruments. We prefer     issuing promissory notes, in which we do not make a market, over     commercial paper, which we may repurchase prior to maturity     through the ordinary course of business as a market maker.         As of December 2010, our unsecured     short-term     borrowings, including the current portion of unsecured     long-term     borrowings, were $47.84 billion. See Note 15 to the     consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8     of this     Form 10-K     for further information about our unsecured     short-term     borrowings.     Deposits.  As of December 2010, our bank     depository institution subsidiaries had $38.57 billion in     customer deposits, including $8.50 billion of certificates     of deposit and other time deposits with a weighted average     maturity of three years, and $30.07 billion of other     deposits, substantially all of which were from cash sweep     programs. We utilize deposits to finance lending activities in     our bank subsidiaries and to support potential outflows, such as     lending commitments.             Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank USA) has access to funding     through the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. While we do     not rely on this funding in our liquidity planning and stress     testing, we maintain policies and procedures necessary to access     this funding and test discount window borrowing procedures.      Equity     Capital          The level and composition of our equity capital are determined     by multiple factors including our consolidated regulatory     capital requirements and ICAAP, and may also be influenced by     other factors such as rating agency guidelines, subsidiary     capital requirements, the business environment, conditions in     the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses     due to adverse changes in our business and market environments.     In addition, we maintain a contingency capital plan which     provides a framework for analyzing and responding to an actual     or perceived capital shortfall.         Our consolidated regulatory capital requirements are determined     by the Federal Reserve Board, as described below. Our ICAAP     incorporates an internal     risk-based     capital assessment designed to identify and measure material     risks associated with our business activities, including market     risk, credit risk and operational risk, in a manner that is     closely aligned with our risk management practices. Our internal     risk-based     capital assessment is supplemented with the results of stress     tests.         As of December 2010, our total shareholders equity     was $77.36 billion (consisting of common shareholders     equity of $70.40 billion and preferred stock of     $6.96 billion). As of December 2009, our total     shareholders equity was $70.71 billion (consisting of     common shareholders equity of $63.76 billion and     preferred stock of $6.96 billion). In addition to total     shareholders equity, we consider our $5.00 billion of     junior subordinated debt issued to trusts to be part of our     equity capital, as it qualifies as capital for regulatory and     certain rating agency purposes. See      Consolidated Regulatory Capital Ratios     below for information regarding the impact of regulatory     developments.            66       Table of Contents         Consolidated     Regulatory Capital       The Federal Reserve Board is the primary regulator of     Group Inc., a bank holding company and a financial holding     company under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. As     a bank holding company, we are subject to consolidated     regulatory capital requirements that are computed in accordance     with the Federal Reserve Boards capital adequacy     regulations currently applicable to bank holding companies     (Basel 1). These capital requirements, which are based on the     Capital Accord of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision     (Basel Committee), are expressed as capital ratios that compare     measures of capital to     risk-weighted     assets (RWAs). See Note 20 to the consolidated financial     statements in Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     for additional information regarding the firms RWAs. The     firms capital levels are also subject to qualitative     judgments by its regulators about components, risk weightings     and other factors.         Federal Reserve Board regulations require bank holding companies     to maintain a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 4% and a     minimum total capital ratio of 8%. The required minimum     Tier 1 capital ratio and total capital ratio in order to be     considered a well-capitalized bank holding company     under the Federal Reserve Board guidelines are 6% and 10%,     respectively. Bank holding companies may be expected to maintain     ratios well above the minimum levels, depending upon their     particular condition, risk profile and growth plans. The minimum     Tier 1 leverage ratio is 3% for bank holding companies that     have received the highest supervisory rating under Federal     Reserve Board guidelines or that have implemented the Federal     Reserve Boards     risk-based     capital measure for market risk. Other bank holding companies     must have a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.         Consolidated     Regulatory Capital Ratios       The table below presents information about our regulatory     capital ratios.

Principally includes equity investments in     non-financial     companies and the cumulative change in the fair value of our     unsecured borrowings attributable to the impact of changes in     our own credit spreads, disallowed deferred tax assets, and     investments in certain nonconsolidated entities.          2.        Substantially all of our subordinated debt qualifies as     Tier 2 capital for Basel 1 purposes.          3.        See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     for additional information about the firms RWAs and     Tier 1 leverage ratio.          4.        The Tier 1 common ratio equals Tier 1 common capital     divided by RWAs. We believe that the Tier 1 common ratio is     meaningful because it is one of the measures that we and     investors use to assess capital adequacy.           Our Tier 1 capital ratio increased to 16.0% as of     December 2010 from 15.0% as of December 2009. The     growth in our Tier 1 capital during the year ended     December 2010 was principally due to an increase in our     shareholders equity, which was partially offset by an     increase in our RWAs. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio increased     to 8.0% as of December 2010 from 7.6% as of     December 2009, reflecting an increase in our Tier 1     capital, principally due to an increase in our     shareholders equity, which was partially offset by an     increase in average adjusted total assets.            67       Table of Contents             We are currently working to implement the requirements set out     in the Federal Reserve Boards Capital Adequacy Guidelines     for Bank Holding Companies: Internal Ratings-Based and Advanced     Measurement Approaches, which are based on the advanced     approaches under the Revised Framework for the International     Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards issued     by the Basel Committee as applicable to us as a bank holding     company (Basel 2). U.S. banking regulators have     incorporated the Basel 2 framework into the existing     risk-based     capital requirements by requiring that internationally active     banking organizations, such as us, transition to Basel 2     following the successful completion of a parallel run.         In addition, the Basel Committee has undertaken a program of     substantial revisions to its capital guidelines. In particular,     the changes in the Basel 2.5 guidelines will result     in increased capital requirements for market risk; additionally,     the Basel 3 guidelines issued by the Basel Committee in     December 2010 revise the definition of Tier 1 capital,     introduce Tier 1 common equity as a regulatory metric, set     new minimum capital ratios (including a new capital     conservation buffer, which must be composed exclusively of     Tier 1 common equity and will be in addition to the other     capital ratios), introduce a Tier 1 leverage ratio within     international guidelines for the first time, and make     substantial revisions to the computation of RWAs for credit     exposures. Implementation of the new requirements is expected to     take place over an extended transition period, starting at the     end of 2011 (for Basel 2.5) and end of 2012 (for Basel 3).     Although the U.S. federal banking agencies have now issued     proposed rules that are intended to implement certain aspects of     the Basel 2.5 guidelines, they have not yet addressed all     aspects of those guidelines or the Basel 3 changes. In addition,     both the Basel Committee and U.S. banking regulators     implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have indicated that they will     impose more stringent capital standards on systemically     important financial institutions. Although the criteria for     treatment as a systemically important financial institution have     not yet been determined, it is probable that they will apply to     us. Therefore, the regulations ultimately applicable to us may     be substantially different from those that have been published     to date.             The Dodd-Frank Act will subject us at a firmwide level to the     same leverage and     risk-based     capital requirements that apply to depository institutions and     directs banking regulators to impose additional capital     requirements as disclosed above. The Federal Reserve Board will     be required to begin implementing the new leverage and     risk-based     capital regulation by January 2012. As a consequence of     these changes, Tier 1 capital treatment for our junior     subordinated debt issued to trusts and our cumulative preferred     stock will be phased out over a three-year period beginning on     January 1, 2013. The interaction between the     Dodd-Frank     Act and the Basel Committees proposed changes adds further     uncertainty to our future capital requirements.         A number of other governmental entities and regulators,     including the U.S. Treasury, the European Union and the     Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom, have also     proposed or announced changes which will result in increased     capital requirements for financial institutions.         As a consequence of these developments, we expect minimum     capital ratios required to be maintained under Federal Reserve     Board regulations will be increased and changes in the     prescribed calculation methodology are expected to result in     higher RWAs and lower capital ratios than those currently     computed.         See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     for additional information about our regulatory capital ratios     and the related regulatory requirements.     Internal Capital     Adequacy Assessment Process       We perform an ICAAP with the objective of ensuring that the firm     is appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our     business.         As part of our ICAAP, we perform an internal     risk-based     capital assessment. Our internal     risk-based     capital assessment incorporates market risk, credit risk and     operational risk. Market risk is calculated by using     Value-at-Risk     (VaR) calculations supplemented by     risk-based     add-ons which include risks related to rare events (tail risks).     Credit risk utilizes assumptions about our counterparties     probability of default, the size of our losses in the event of a     default and the maturity of our counterparties contractual     obligations to us. Operational risk is calculated based on     scenarios incorporating multiple types of operational failures.     Backtesting is used to gauge the effectiveness of models at     capturing and measuring relevant risks.            68       Table of Contents             We evaluate capital adequacy based on the result of our internal     risk-based     capital assessment, supplemented with the results of stress     tests which measure the firms performance under various     market conditions. Our goal is to hold sufficient capital, under     our internal     risk-based     capital framework, to ensure we remain adequately capitalized     after experiencing a severe stress event. Our assessment of     capital adequacy is viewed in tandem with our assessment of     liquidity adequacy and integrated into the overall risk     management structure, governance and policy framework of the     firm.         We attribute capital usage to each of our businesses based upon     our internal     risk-based     capital and regulatory frameworks and manage the levels of usage     based upon the balance sheet and risk limits established.     Rating Agency     Guidelines       The credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the     obligations of Group Inc., which directly issues or     guarantees substantially all of the firms senior unsecured     obligations. GS Bank USA has also been assigned     long-term     issuer ratings as well as ratings on its     long-term     and     short-term     bank deposits. In addition, credit rating agencies have assigned     ratings to debt obligations of certain other subsidiaries of     Group Inc.         The level and composition of our equity capital are among the     many factors considered in determining our credit ratings. Each     agency has its own definition of eligible capital and     methodology for evaluating capital adequacy, and assessments are     generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single     calculation. See Liquidity Risk  Credit     Ratings for further information about our credit ratings.     Subsidiary     Capital Requirements       Many of our subsidiaries, including GS Bank USA and our     broker-dealer     subsidiaries, are subject to separate regulation and capital     requirements in jurisdictions throughout the world. For purposes     of assessing the adequacy of its capital, GS Bank USA has     established an ICAAP which is similar to that used by     Group Inc. GS Bank USAs capital levels and     prompt corrective action classification are subject to     qualitative judgments by its regulators about components, risk     weightings and other factors.             We expect that the capital requirements of several of our     subsidiaries will be impacted in the future by the various     developments arising from the Basel Committee, the Dodd-Frank     Act, and other governmental entities and regulators.         See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     for information about GS Bank USAs capital ratios     under Basel 1 as implemented by the Federal Reserve Board, and     for further information about the capital requirements of our     other regulated subsidiaries and the potential impact of     regulatory reform.         Subsidiaries not subject to separate regulatory capital     requirements may hold capital to satisfy local tax guidelines,     rating agency requirements (for entities with assigned credit     ratings) or internal policies, including policies concerning the     minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based on its     underlying level of risk. In certain instances, Group Inc.     may be limited in its ability to access capital held at certain     subsidiaries as a result of regulatory, tax or other     constraints. As of December 2010 and December 2009,     Group Inc.s equity investment in subsidiaries was     $71.30 billion and $65.74 billion, respectively,     compared with its total shareholders equity of     $77.36 billion and $70.71 billion, respectively.         Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of     GS&Co., GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs Bank (Europe) PLC     and GSEC subject to certain exceptions. In November 2008,     we contributed subsidiaries into GS Bank USA, and     Group Inc. agreed to guarantee certain losses, including     credit-related     losses, relating to assets held by the contributed entities. In     connection with this guarantee, Group Inc. also agreed to     pledge to GS Bank USA certain collateral, including     interests in subsidiaries and other illiquid assets.         Our capital invested in     non-U.S. subsidiaries     is generally exposed to foreign exchange risk, substantially all     of which is managed through a combination of derivatives and     non-U.S. denominated     debt.            69       Table of Contents         Preferred Stock.  In October 2008, we     issued to Berkshire Hathaway and certain affiliates     50,000 shares of 10% Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock,     Series G (Series G Preferred Stock), and a five-year     warrant to purchase up to 43.5 million shares of common     stock at an exercise price of $115.00 per share, for aggregate     proceeds of $5.00 billion. The allocated carrying values of     the warrant and the Series G Preferred Stock (based on     their relative fair values on the date of issuance) were     $1.14 billion and $3.86 billion, respectively. The     Series G Preferred Stock is redeemable at the firms     option, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, at     a redemption value of $5.50 billion, plus accrued and     unpaid dividends. Accordingly, upon a redemption in full at any     time in the future of the Series G Preferred Stock, we     would recognize a     one-time     preferred dividend of $1.64 billion (calculated as the     difference between the carrying value and redemption value of     the preferred stock), which would be recorded as a reduction to     our earnings applicable to common shareholders and to our common     shareholders equity in the period of redemption. Based on     our December 2010 average diluted common shares outstanding     and basic shares outstanding, the estimated impact to earnings     per common share and book value per common share would be a     reduction of approximately $2.80 and $3.00, respectively, in the     period in which the redemption occurs in the future.     Contingency     Capital Plan       Our contingency capital plan outlines the appropriate     communication procedures to follow during a crisis period,     including internal dissemination of information as well as     ensuring timely communication with external stakeholders. It     also provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a     perceived or actual capital deficiency, including, but not     limited to, identification of drivers of a capital deficiency,     as well as mitigants and potential actions.     Equity Capital     Management       Our objective is to maintain a sufficient level and optimal     composition of equity capital. We principally manage our capital     through issuances and repurchases of our common stock. We may     also, from time to time, issue or repurchase our preferred     stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and other     subordinated debt as business conditions warrant and subject to     any regulatory approvals. We manage our capital requirements     principally by setting limits on balance sheet assets     and/or     limits on risk, in each case both at the consolidated and     business levels. We attribute capital usage to each of our     businesses based upon our internal     risk-based     capital and regulatory frameworks           and manage the levels of usage based upon the balance sheet and     risk limits established.     Share Repurchase Program.  We seek to use our     share repurchase program to substantially offset increases in     share count over time resulting from employee     share-based     compensation and to help maintain the appropriate level of     common equity. The repurchase program is effected primarily     through regular     open-market     purchases, the amounts and timing of which are determined     primarily by our issuance of shares resulting from employee     share-based     compensation as well as our current and projected capital     position (i.e., comparisons of our desired level of capital     to our actual level of capital), but which may also be     influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price     and trading volumes of our common stock.         As of December 2010, under the Boards existing share     repurchase program, we can repurchase up to 35.6 million     additional shares of common stock; however, any such repurchases     are subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. See     Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related     Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity     Securities in Part II, Item 5 and Note 19     to the consolidated financial statements in Part II,     Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     for additional information on our repurchase program.

Other Capital     Metrics       The table below presents information on our shareholders     equity and book value per common share.

Tangible common shareholders equity     equals total shareholders equity less preferred stock,     goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Tangible book value     per common share is computed by dividing tangible common     shareholders equity by the number of common shares     outstanding, including restricted stock units (RSUs) granted to     employees with no future service requirements. We believe that     tangible common shareholders equity and tangible book     value per common share are meaningful because they are measures     that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy.         The table below presents the reconciliation of total     shareholders equity to tangible common shareholders     equity.

Book value and tangible book value per     common share are based on common shares outstanding, including     RSUs granted to employees with no future service requirements,     of 546.9 million and 542.7 million as of     December 2010 and December 2009, respectively.      Off-Balance-Sheet     Arrangements     and Contractual Obligations      Off-Balance-Sheet     Arrangements       We have various types of     off-balance-sheet     arrangements that we enter into in the ordinary course of     business. Our involvement in these arrangements can take many     different forms, including:                      purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in special     purpose entities such as     mortgage-backed     and other     asset-backed     securitization vehicles;                            holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and     general partnerships, and preferred and common stock in other     nonconsolidated vehicles;                  entering into interest rate, foreign currency, equity, commodity     and credit derivatives, including total return swaps;                  entering into operating leases; and                  providing guarantees, indemnifications, loan commitments,     letters of credit and representations and warranties.           We enter into these arrangements for a variety of business     purposes, including securitizations. The securitization vehicles     that purchase mortgages, corporate bonds, and other types of     financial assets are critical to the functioning of several     significant investor markets, including the     mortgage-backed     and other     asset-backed     securities markets, since they offer investors access to     specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization     process.         We also enter into these arrangements to underwrite client     securitization transactions; provide secondary market liquidity;     make investments in performing and nonperforming debt, equity,     real estate and other assets; provide investors with     credit-linked     and     asset-repackaged     notes; and receive or provide letters of credit to satisfy     margin requirements and to facilitate the clearance and     settlement process.         Our financial interests in, and derivative transactions with,     such nonconsolidated entities are accounted for at fair value,     in the same manner as our other financial instruments, except in     cases where we apply the equity method of accounting.         When we transfer a security that has very little, if any,     default risk under an agreement to repurchase the security where     the maturity date of the repurchase agreement matches the     maturity date of the underlying security (such that we     effectively no longer have a repurchase obligation) and we have     relinquished control over the underlying security, we record     such transactions as sales. These transactions are referred to     as repos to maturity. We had no such transactions     outstanding as of December 2010 or December 2009.            71       Table of Contents             The table below presents where a discussion of our various     off-balance-sheet     arrangements may be found in Part II, Items 7 and 8 of     this     Form 10-K.

These contractual obligations include our     unsecured     long-term     borrowings, secured     long-term     financings, time deposits, contractual interest payments and     insurance agreements, all of which are included in our     consolidated statement of financial condition. Our obligations     to make future cash payments also           include certain     off-balance-sheet     contractual obligations such as purchase obligations, minimum     rental payments under noncancelable leases and commitments and     guarantees.

The aggregate contractual principal amount of secured     long-term     financings for which the fair value option was elected,     primarily consisting of debt raised through our William Street     credit extension program, transfers of financial assets     accounted for as financings rather than sales and certain other     nonrecourse financings, exceeded their related fair value by     $352 million.          3.        Includes an increase of $8.86 billion to the carrying     amount of certain of our unsecured     long-term     borrowings related to fair value hedges. In addition, the     aggregate contractual principal amount of unsecured     long-term     borrowings (principal and     non-principal     protected) for which the fair value option was elected exceeded     the related fair value by $349 million.          4.        Represents estimated future interest payments related to     unsecured     long-term     borrowings, secured     long-term     financings and time deposits based on applicable interest rates     as of December 2010. Includes stated coupons, if any, on     structured notes.          5.        Represents estimated undiscounted payments related to future     benefits and unpaid claims arising from policies associated with     our insurance activities, excluding separate accounts and     estimated recoveries under reinsurance contracts.           73       Table of Contents             In the table above:                      Obligations maturing within one year of our financial statement     date or redeemable within one year of our financial statement     date at the option of the holder are excluded and are treated as     short-term     obligations.                  Obligations that are repayable prior to maturity at the option     of Goldman Sachs are reflected at their contractual maturity     dates and obligations that are redeemable prior to maturity at     the option of the holder are reflected at the dates such options     become exercisable.                  Amounts included in the table do not necessarily reflect the     actual future cash flow requirements for these arrangements     because commitments and guarantees represent notional amounts     and may expire unused or be reduced or cancelled at the     counterpartys request.                  Due to the uncertainty of the timing and amounts that will     ultimately be paid, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits     has been excluded. See Note 26 to the consolidated     financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     for further information about our unrecognized tax benefits.           See Notes 15 and 18 to the consolidated financial     statements in Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     for further information about our     short-term     borrowings, and commitments and guarantees.         As of December 2010, our unsecured     long-term     borrowings were $174.40 billion, with maturities extending     to 2060, and consisted principally of senior borrowings. See     Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     for further information about our unsecured     long-term     borrowings.         As of December 2010, our future minimum rental payments net     of minimum sublease rentals under noncancelable leases were     $3.39 billion. These lease commitments, principally for     office space, expire on various dates through 2069. Certain     agreements are subject to periodic escalation provisions for     increases in real estate taxes and other charges. See     Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     for further information about our leases.         Our occupancy expenses include costs associated with office     space held in excess of our current requirements. This excess     space, the cost of which is charged to earnings as incurred, is     being held for potential growth or to replace currently occupied     space that we may exit in the future. We regularly evaluate our     current and future space capacity in relation to current and     projected staffing levels. For the year ended     December 2010, total occupancy expenses for space           held in excess of our current requirements were     $130 million, which includes costs related to the     transition to our new headquarters in New York City. In     addition, in 2010, we incurred exit costs of $28 million,     related to our office space (included in Occupancy     and Depreciation and amortization in the     consolidated statements of earnings). We may incur exit costs in     the future to the extent we (i) reduce our space capacity     or (ii) commit to, or occupy, new properties in the     locations in which we operate and, consequently, dispose of     existing space that had been held for potential growth. These     exit costs may be material to our results of operations in a     given period.      Overview and     Structure of Risk Management      Overview       We believe that effective risk management is of primary     importance to the success of the firm. Accordingly, we have     comprehensive risk management processes through which we     monitor, evaluate and manage the risks we assume in conducting     our activities. These include market, credit, liquidity,     operational, legal, regulatory and reputational risk exposures.     Our risk management framework is built around three core     components: governance, processes and people.     Governance.  Risk management governance starts     with our Board, which plays an important role in reviewing and     approving risk management policies and practices, both directly     and through its Risk Committee, which consists of all of our     independent directors. The Board also receives periodic updates     on firmwide risks from our independent control and support     functions. Next, at the most senior levels of the firm, our     leaders are experienced risk managers, with a sophisticated and     detailed understanding of the risks we take. Our senior managers     lead and participate in     risk-oriented     committees, as do the leaders of our independent control and     support     functions  including     those in internal audit, compliance, controllers, credit risk     management, human capital management, legal, market risk     management, operations, operational risk management, tax,     technology and treasury.         The firms governance structure provides the protocol and     responsibility for decision-making on risk management issues and     ensures implementation of those decisions. We make extensive use     of     risk-related     committees that meet regularly and serve as an important means     to facilitate and foster ongoing discussions to identify, manage     and mitigate risks.            74       Table of Contents             We maintain strong communication about risk and we have a     culture of collaboration in decision-making among the     revenue-producing units, independent control and support     functions, committees and senior management. While we believe     that the first line of defense in managing risk rests with the     managers in our revenue-producing units, we dedicate extensive     resources to independent control and support functions in order     to ensure a strong oversight structure and an appropriate     segregation of duties.     Processes.  We maintain various processes and     procedures that are critical components of our risk management.     First and foremost is our daily discipline of marking     substantially all of the firms inventory to current market     levels. Goldman Sachs carries its inventory at fair value, with     changes in valuation reflected immediately in our risk     management systems and in net revenues. We do so because we     believe this discipline is one of the most effective tools for     assessing and managing risk and that it provides transparent and     realistic insight into our financial exposures.         We also apply a rigorous framework of limits to control risk     across multiple transactions, products, businesses and markets.     This includes setting credit and market risk limits at a variety     of levels and monitoring these limits on a daily basis. Limits     are typically set at levels that will be periodically exceeded,     rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite.     This fosters an ongoing dialogue on risk among     revenue-producing     units, independent control and support functions, committees and     senior management, as well as rapid escalation of     risk-related     matters. See Market Risk Management and Credit     Risk Management for further information on our risk limits.         Active management of our positions is another important process.     Proactive mitigation of our market and credit exposures     minimizes the risk that we will be required to take outsized     actions during periods of stress.         We also focus on the rigor and effectiveness of the firms     risk systems. The goal of our risk management technology is to     get the right information to the right people at the right time,     which requires systems that are comprehensive, reliable and     timely. We devote significant time and resources to our risk     management technology to ensure that it consistently provides us     with complete, accurate and timely information.         People.  Even the best technology serves only     as a tool for helping to make informed decisions in real time     about the risks we are taking. Ultimately, effective risk     management requires our people to make ongoing portfolio     interpretations and adjustments. In both our revenue-producing     units and our independent control and support functions, the     experience of our professionals, and their understanding of the     nuances and limitations of each risk measure, guide the firm in     assessing exposures and maintaining them within prudent levels.     Structure       Ultimate oversight of risk is the responsibility of the     firms Board. The Board oversees risk both directly and     through its Risk Committee. Within the firm, a series of     committees with specific risk management mandates have oversight     or decision-making responsibilities for risk management     activities. Committee membership generally consists of senior     managers from both our revenue-producing units and our     independent control and support functions. We have established     procedures for these committees to ensure that appropriate     information barriers are in place. Our primary risk committees,     most of which also have additional     sub-committees     or working groups, are described below. In addition to these     committees, we have other     risk-oriented     committees which provide oversight for different businesses,     activities, products, regions and legal entities.         Membership of the firms risk committees is reviewed     regularly and updated to reflect changes in the responsibilities     of the committee members. Accordingly, the length of time that     members serve on the respective committees varies as determined     by the relevant committee charter or the committee chairs, and     based on the responsibilities of the members within the firm.         In addition, independent control and support functions, which     report to the chief financial officer, general counsels, chief     administrative officer, or in the case of Internal Audit, to the     Audit Committee of the Board, are responsible for     day-to-day     oversight of risk, as discussed in greater detail in the     following sections.            75       Table of Contents                     The chart below presents an overview of our risk management     governance structure, highlighting the oversight of our Board,     our key     risk-related             committees and the independence of our control and support     functions.                        Management Committee.  The Management Committee     oversees the global activities of the firm, including all of the     firms independent control and support functions. It     provides this oversight directly and through authority delegated     to committees it has established. This committee is comprised of     the most senior leaders of the firm, and is chaired by the     firms chief executive officer. The Management Committee     has established various committees with delegated authority and     appoints the chairpersons of these committees (the chairpersons     then appoint the other members of the committees). All of these     committees (and other committees established by such committees)     report, directly or indirectly, to the Management Committee.     Most members of the Management Committee are also members of     other firmwide, divisional and regional committees. The     following are the committees established by the Management     Committee that are principally involved in firmwide risk     management.         Firmwide Client and Business Standards     Committee.  The Firmwide Client and Business     Standards Committee assesses and makes determinations regarding     business standards and practices, reputational risk management,     client relationships and client service, and is chaired by the     firms president and chief operating officer. This     committee also has responsibility for overseeing the     implementation of the recommendations of the Business Standards     Committee. This committee has established the following two     committees that report to it and is responsible for appointing     the chairpersons of these committees and other committee members:                  Firmwide New Activity Committee.  The Firmwide     New Activity Committee is responsible for reviewing new     activities and establishing a process to identify and review     previously approved activities that are significant and that     have changed in complexity     and/or     structure or present different reputational and suitability     concerns over time to consider whether these activities remain     appropriate. This committee is     co-chaired     by the firms head of operations and the chief     administrative officer of our Investment Management Division.              76       Table of Contents                    Firmwide Suitability Committee.  The Firmwide     Suitability Committee is responsible for setting standards and     policies for product, transaction and client suitability and     providing a forum for consistency across divisions, regions and     products on suitability assessments. This committee also reviews     suitability matters escalated from other firm committees. This     committee is     co-chaired     by the firms international general counsel and the chief     operating officer of our Investment Management Division.       Firmwide Risk Committee.  The Firmwide Risk     Committee is responsible for the ongoing monitoring and control     of the firms global financial risks. Through both direct     and delegated authority, the Firmwide Risk Committee approves     firmwide, product, divisional and business-level limits for both     market and credit risks, approves sovereign credit risk limits     and reviews results of stress tests and scenario analyses. This     committee is co-chaired by the firms chief financial     officer and a senior managing director from the firms     executive office. The Firmwide Risk Committee has established     the Securities Division Risk Committee, the Credit Policy     Committee and the Operational Risk Committee and the Management     Committee established the Firmwide Finance Committee. All four     of these committees report to the Firmwide Risk Committee, which     is responsible for appointing the chairperson of the four     committees, who then appoints the other committee members:                   Securities Division Risk Committee.  The     Securities Division Risk Committee sets market risk limits,     subject to overall firmwide risk limits, for our Fixed Income,     Currency and Commodities Client Execution and Equities Client     Execution businesses based on a number of risk measures,     including VaR, stress tests, scenario analyses, and inventory     levels. This committee is chaired by the chief risk officer of     our Securities Division.               Credit Policy Committee.  The Credit Policy     Committee establishes and reviews broad credit policies and     parameters that are implemented by our Credit Risk Management     department (Credit Risk Management). This committee is chaired     by the firms chief credit officer.               Operational Risk Committee.  The Operational     Risk Committee provides oversight of the ongoing development and     implementation of our operational risk policies, framework and     methodologies, and monitors the effectiveness of operational     risk management. This committee is chaired by the chief risk     officer of GS Bank USA.                        Finance Committee.  The Finance Committee has     oversight of firmwide liquidity, the size and composition of our     balance sheet and capital base, and our credit ratings. This     committee regularly reviews our liquidity, balance sheet,     funding position and capitalization, and makes adjustments in     light of current events, risks and exposures, and regulatory     requirements. This committee is also responsible for reviewing     and approving balance sheet limits and the size of our GCE. This     committee is co-chaired by the firms chief financial     officer and the firms global treasurer.           The following committees report jointly to the Firmwide Risk     Committee and the Firmwide Client and Business Standards     Committee, which also appoint the chairpersons of these     committees (who then appoint the members of the committees).                   Firmwide Capital Committee.  The Firmwide     Capital Committee provides approval and oversight of     debt-related     underwriting transactions, including related commitments of the     firms capital. This committee aims to ensure that business     and reputational standards for underwritings and capital     commitments are maintained on a global basis. This committee is     chaired by the global head of the firms Financing Group     and head of the firms independent control and support     functions in Europe, Middle East and Africa.               Firmwide Commitments Committee.  The Firmwide     Commitments Committee reviews the firms underwriting and     distribution activities with respect to equity and     equity-related     product offerings, and sets and maintains policies and     procedures designed to ensure that legal, reputational,     regulatory and business standards are maintained on a global     basis. In addition to reviewing specific transactions, this     committee periodically conducts general strategic reviews of     sectors and products and establishes policies in connection with     transaction practices. This committee is co-chaired by the head     of our Latin America Group and the head of the firms     independent control and support functions in Europe, Middle East     and Africa.       Investment Management Division Risk     Committee.  The Investment Management     Division Risk Committee is responsible for the ongoing     monitoring and control of global market, counterparty credit and     liquidity risks associated with the activities of our investment     management businesses. The head of Investment Management     Division risk management is the chair of this committee and     appoints the other members.              77       Table of Contents       Liquidity     Risk             Liquidity is of critical importance to financial institutions.     Most of the recent failures of financial institutions have     occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity.     Accordingly, the firm has in place a comprehensive and     conservative set of liquidity and funding policies to address     both firm-specific and broader industry or market liquidity     events. Our principal objective is to be able to fund the firm     and to enable our core businesses to continue to generate     revenues, even under adverse circumstances.         We manage liquidity risk according to the following principles:     Excess Liquidity.  We maintain substantial     excess liquidity to meet a broad range of potential cash     outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment.     Asset-Liability     Management.  We assess anticipated holding periods     for our assets and their potential illiquidity in a stressed     environment. We manage the maturities and diversity of our     funding across markets, products and counterparties; and seek to     maintain liabilities of appropriate tenor relative to our asset     base.     Contingency Funding Plan.  We maintain a     contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing     and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of     market stress. This framework sets forth the plan of action to     fund normal business activity in emergency and stress     situations. These principles are discussed in more detail below.     Excess     Liquidity       Our most important liquidity policy is to     pre-fund our     estimated potential cash needs during a liquidity crisis and     hold this excess liquidity in the form of unencumbered, highly     liquid securities and cash instruments. We believe that this     global core excess would be readily convertible to cash in a     matter of days, through liquidation, by entering into repurchase     agreements or from maturities of reverse repurchase agreements,     and that this cash would allow us to meet immediate obligations     without needing to sell other           assets or depend on additional funding from     credit-sensitive     markets.         As of December 2010 and December 2009, the fair value     of the securities and certain overnight cash deposits included     in our GCE totaled $174.78 billion and     $170.69 billion, respectively. Based on the results of our     internal liquidity risk model, discussed below, as well as our     consideration of other factors including but not limited to a     qualitative assessment of the condition of the financial markets     and the firm, we believe our liquidity position as of     December 2010 was appropriate.         Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2010, our GCE, which was     previously reported at loan value, is now reported at fair     value. The differences between the loan value and fair value     were not material and prior periods are presented on a     comparable basis.         The table below presents the fair value of the securities and     certain overnight cash deposits that are included in our GCE.                                                           Average for the              Year Ended December      in millions       2010           2009                         U.S. dollar-denominated        $   130,072               $       122,083                  Non-U.S. dollar-denominated            37,942                   45,987                              Total        $   168,014               $       168,070                                     The     U.S. dollar-denominated     excess is composed of unencumbered U.S. government     obligations, U.S. agency obligations and highly liquid     U.S. agency     mortgage-backed     obligations, all of which are eligible as collateral in Federal     Reserve open market operations and certain overnight     U.S. dollar cash deposits. The     non-U.S. dollar-denominated     excess is composed of only unencumbered French, German, United     Kingdom and Japanese government obligations and certain     overnight cash deposits in highly liquid currencies. We strictly     limit our excess liquidity to this narrowly defined list of     securities and cash because they are highly liquid, even in a     difficult funding environment. We do not include other potential     sources of excess liquidity, such as lower-quality unencumbered     securities or committed credit facilities, in our GCE.                  78       Table of Contents             The table below presents the fair value of our GCE by asset     class.

Average for the              Year Ended December      in millions       2010           2009                             Group Inc.         $   53,757               $       55,185                      Major     broker-dealer     subsidiaries            69,223                   71,438                      Major bank subsidiaries            45,034                   41,447                              Total        $   168,014           $   168,070                                     Our GCE reflects the following principles:                      The first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most     critical to a companys survival.                  Focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral     outflows, not just disruptions to financing flows. Our     businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are determined     by many factors, including market movements, collateral     requirements and client commitments, all of which can change     dramatically in a difficult funding environment.                  During a liquidity crisis,     credit-sensitive     funding, including unsecured debt and some types of secured     financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms     (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions and tenor) or     availability of other types of secured financing may change.                  As a result of our policy to     pre-fund     liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis, we hold     more unencumbered securities and have larger debt balances than     our businesses would otherwise require. We believe that our     liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid     unencumbered securities, even though it increases our total     assets and our funding costs.               We believe that our GCE provides us with a resilient source of     funds that would be available in advance of potential cash and     collateral outflows and gives us significant flexibility in     managing through a difficult funding environment.         In order to determine the appropriate size of our GCE, we use an     internal liquidity model, referred to as the Modeled Liquidity     Outflow, which captures and quantifies the firms liquidity     risks. We also consider other factors including but not limited     to a qualitative assessment of the condition of the financial     markets and the firm.         We distribute our GCE across subsidiaries, asset types, and     clearing agents to provide us with sufficient operating     liquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major markets, even     in a difficult funding environment.         We maintain our GCE to enable us to meet current and potential     liquidity requirements of our parent company, Group Inc.,     and our major     broker-dealer     and bank subsidiaries. The Modeled Liquidity Outflow     incorporates a consolidated requirement as well as a standalone     requirement for each of our major     broker-dealer     and bank subsidiaries. Liquidity held directly in each of these     subsidiaries is intended for use only by that subsidiary to meet     its liquidity requirements and is assumed not to be available to     Group Inc. unless (i) legally provided for and     (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other     restrictions. We hold a portion of our GCE directly at     Group Inc. to support consolidated requirements not     accounted for in the major subsidiaries. In addition to the GCE     held at our major     broker-dealer     and bank subsidiaries, we maintain operating cash balances in     several of our other operating entities, primarily for use in     specific currencies, entities, or jurisdictions where we do not     have immediate access to parent company liquidity.         In addition to our GCE, we have a significant amount of other     unencumbered cash and financial instruments, including other     government obligations,     high-grade     money market securities, corporate obligations, marginable     equities, loans and cash deposits not included in our GCE. The     fair value of these assets averaged $72.98 billion and     $71.82 billion for the years ended December 2010 and     December 2009, respectively. We do not consider these     assets liquid enough to be eligible for our GCE liquidity pool     and therefore conservatively do not assume we will generate     liquidity from these assets in a     short-term     stress scenario.            79       Table of Contents               Modeled Liquidity Outflow.  Our Modeled     Liquidity Outflow is based on a scenario that includes both a     market-wide     stress and a firm-specific stress, characterized by some or all     of the following elements:                      Global recession, default by a     medium-sized     sovereign, low consumer and corporate confidence, and general     financial instability.                  Severely challenged market environment with material declines in     equity markets and widening of credit spreads.                  Damaging follow-on impacts to financial institutions leading to     the failure of a large bank.                  A firm-specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses,     reputational damage, litigation, executive departure,     and/or a     ratings downgrade.           The following are the critical modeling parameters of the     Modeled Liquidity Outflow:                      Liquidity needs over a     30-day     scenario.                  A two-notch     downgrade of the firms     long-term     senior unsecured credit ratings.                  No support from government funding     facilities.  Although we have access to various     central bank funding programs, we do not assume reliance on them     as a source of funding in a liquidity crisis.                  A combination of contractual outflows, such as upcoming     maturities of unsecured debt, and contingent outflows     (e.g., actions though not contractually required, we may     deem necessary in a crisis). We assume that most contingent     outflows will occur within the initial days and weeks of a     crisis.                  No diversification benefit across liquidity risks. We assume     that liquidity risks are additive.                  Maintenance of our normal business levels. We do not assume     asset liquidation, other than the GCE.           The Modeled Liquidity Outflow is calculated and reported to     senior management on a daily basis. We regularly refine our     model to reflect changes in market or economic conditions and     the firms business mix.         The potential contractual and contingent cash and collateral     outflows covered in our Modeled Liquidity Outflow include:     Unsecured     Funding                    Contractual:  All upcoming maturities of unsecured     long-term     debt, commercial paper, promissory notes and other unsecured     funding products. We assume that we will be unable to issue new     unsecured debt or rollover any maturing debt.                  Contingent:  Repurchases of our outstanding     long-term     debt, commercial paper and hybrid financial instruments in the     ordinary course of business as a market maker.           Deposits                    Contractual:  All upcoming maturities of term     deposits. We assume that we will be unable to raise new term     deposits or rollover any maturing term deposits.                  Contingent:  Withdrawals of bank deposits that have no     contractual maturity. The withdrawal assumptions reflect, among     other factors, the type of deposit, whether the deposit is     insured or uninsured, and the firms relationship with the     depositor.       Secured     Funding                    Contractual:  A portion of upcoming contractual     maturities of secured funding trades due to either the inability     to refinance or the ability to refinance only at wider haircuts     (i.e., on terms which require us to post additional     collateral). Our assumptions reflect, among other factors, the     quality of the underlying collateral and counterparty     concentration.                  Contingent:  A decline in value of financial assets     pledged as collateral for financing transactions, which would     necessitate additional collateral postings under those     transactions.       OTC     Derivatives                    Contingent:  Collateral postings to counterparties due     to adverse changes in the value of our OTC derivatives.                  Contingent:  Other outflows of cash or collateral     related to OTC derivatives, including the impact of trade     terminations, collateral substitutions, collateral disputes,     collateral calls or termination payments required by a     two-notch     downgrade in our credit ratings, and collateral that has not     been called by counterparties, but is available to them.       Exchange-Traded     Derivatives                    Contingent:  Variation margin postings required due to     adverse changes in the value of our outstanding     exchange-traded     derivatives.                  Contingent:  An increase in initial margin and     guaranty fund requirements by derivative clearing houses.       Customer Cash     and Securities                    Contingent:  Liquidity outflows associated with our     prime brokerage business, including withdrawals of customer     credit balances, and a reduction in customer short positions,     which serve as a funding source for long positions.              80       Table of Contents                 Unfunded     Commitments                    Contingent:  Draws on our unfunded commitments. Draw     assumptions reflect, among other things, the type of commitment     and counterparty.       Other                    Other upcoming large cash outflows, such as tax payments.       Asset-Liability     Management       Our liquidity risk management policies are designed to ensure we     have a sufficient amount of financing, even when funding markets     experience persistent stress. We seek to maintain a     long-dated     and diversified funding profile, taking into consideration the     characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets.         Our approach to     asset-liability     management includes:                      Conservatively managing the overall characteristics of our     funding book, with a focus on maintaining     long-term,     diversified sources of funding in excess of our current     requirements. See Balance Sheet and Funding     Sources  Funding Sources for additional details.                  Actively managing and monitoring our asset base, with particular     focus on the liquidity, holding period and our ability to fund     assets on a secured basis. This enables us to determine the most     appropriate funding products and tenors. Less liquid assets are     more difficult to fund and therefore require funding that has     longer tenors with a greater proportion of unsecured debt. For     more detail on our balance sheet management process, please see     Balance Sheet and Funding Sources  Balance     Sheet Management.                  Raising secured and unsecured financing that has a sufficiently     longer term than the anticipated holding period of our assets.     This reduces the risk that our liabilities will come due in     advance of our ability to generate liquidity from the sale of     our assets. Because we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet,     the holding period of certain of our assets may be materially     shorter than their contractual maturity dates.               Our goal is to have sufficient total capital (unsecured     long-term     borrowings plus total shareholders equity) so that we can     avoid reliance on asset sales (other than our GCE). However, we     recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent or necessary     in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis. The target amount of     our total capital is based on an internal funding model which     incorporates the following     long-term     financing requirements:                      The portion of financial instruments owned, at fair value that     we believe could not be funded on a secured basis in periods of     market stress, assuming stressed fair values.                  Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, property, leasehold     improvements and equipment, and other illiquid assets.                  Derivative and other margin and collateral requirements.                  Anticipated draws on our unfunded loan commitments.                  Regulatory requirements to hold capital or other forms of     financing in excess of what we would otherwise hold in regulated     subsidiaries.       Subsidiary Funding Policies.  The majority of     our unsecured funding is raised by Group Inc. which lends     the necessary funds to its subsidiaries, some of which are     regulated, to meet their asset financing, liquidity and capital     requirements. In addition, Group Inc. provides its     regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their     regulatory requirements. The benefits of this approach to     subsidiary funding are enhanced control and greater flexibility     to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries. Funding is     also raised at the subsidiary level through a variety of     products, including secured funding, unsecured borrowings and     deposits.         Our intercompany funding policies assume that, unless legally     provided for, a subsidiarys funds or securities are not     freely available to its parent company or other subsidiaries. In     particular, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that     authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds     from those subsidiaries to Group Inc. Regulatory action of     that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc.     needs to make payments on its obligations. Accordingly, we     assume that the capital provided to our regulated subsidiaries     is not available to Group Inc. or other subsidiaries and     any other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is     not available until the maturity of such financing.            81       Table of Contents           Group Inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and     subordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to its     regulated subsidiaries. For example, as of December 2010,     Group Inc. had $30.80 billion of equity and     subordinated indebtedness invested in GS&Co., its principal     U.S. registered     broker-dealer;     $22.67 billion invested in GSI, a regulated U.K.     broker-dealer;     $2.72 billion invested in Goldman Sachs     Execution & Clearing, L.P., a U.S. registered     broker-dealer;     $3.43 billion invested in Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd., a     regulated Japanese     broker-dealer;     and $23.80 billion invested in GS Bank USA, a     regulated New York State-chartered bank. Group Inc. also     had $81.93 billion of unsubordinated loans and     $12.62 billion of collateral provided to these entities as     of December 2010 and significant amounts of capital     invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries.     Contingency     Funding Plan       The Goldman Sachs contingency funding plan sets out the plan of     action we would use to fund business activity in crisis     situations and periods of market stress. The contingency funding     plan outlines a list of potential risk factors, key reports and     metrics that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in     assessing the severity of, and managing through, a liquidity     crisis     and/or     market           dislocation. The contingency funding plan also describes in     detail the firms potential responses if our assessments     indicate that the firm has entered a liquidity crisis, which     include     pre-funding     for what we estimate will be our potential cash and collateral     needs as well as utilizing secondary sources of liquidity.     Mitigants and action items to address specific risks which may     arise are also described and assigned to individuals responsible     for execution.         The contingency funding plan identifies key groups of     individuals to foster effective coordination, control and     distribution of information, all of which are critical in the     management of a crisis or period of market stress. The     contingency funding plan also details the responsibilities of     these groups and individuals, which include making and     disseminating key decisions, coordinating all contingency     activities throughout the duration of the crisis or period of     market stress, implementing liquidity maintenance activities and     managing internal and external communication.

Credit ratings are also     important when we are competing in certain markets, such as OTC     derivatives, and when we seek to engage in longer-term     transactions. See Certain Risk Factors That May Affect Our     Businesses, and Risk Factors in Part I,     Item 1A of this     Form 10-K     for a discussion of the risks associated with a reduction in our     credit ratings.         We believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit     rating agencies assessment of:                      our liquidity, market, credit and operational risk management     practices;                  the level and variability of our earnings;                  our capital base;                  our franchise, reputation and management;                  our corporate governance; and                  the external operating environment, including the assumed level     of government support.           We allocate a portion of our GCE to ensure we would be able to     make the additional collateral or termination payments that may     be required in the event of a     two-notch     reduction in our     long-term     credit ratings, as well as collateral that has not been called     by counterparties, but is available to them. The table below     presents the additional collateral or termination payments that     could have been called at the reporting date by counterparties     in the event of a     one-notch     and     two-notch     downgrade in our credit ratings.                                                           As of December      in millions       2010           2009                             Additional collateral or termination payments for a     one-notch     downgrade        $   1,353               $       1,117                      Additional collateral or termination payments for a     two-notch     downgrade            2,781                   2,364                                     The Basel Committee on Banking Supervisions international     framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and     monitoring calls for imposition of a liquidity coverage ratio,     designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate     level of unencumbered     high-quality     liquid assets based on expected cash outflows under an acute     liquidity stress scenario, and a net stable funding ratio,     designed to promote more medium- and     long-term     funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a     one-year     time horizon. The liquidity coverage ratio would be implemented     subject to an observation period beginning in 2011, but would     not be introduced as a requirement until     January 1, 2015, and the net           stable funding ratio would not be introduced as a requirement     until January 1, 2018. While the principles behind the     new framework are broadly consistent with our current liquidity     management framework, it is possible that the implementation of     these standards could impact our liquidity and funding     requirements and practices.     Cash     Flows       As a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex     and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets.     Consequently, we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is     less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the     excess liquidity and     asset-liability     management policies described above. Cash flow analysis may,     however, be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and     strategic initiatives in our businesses.     Year Ended December 2010.  Our cash and     cash equivalents increased by $1.50 billion to     $39.79 billion at the end of 2010. We generated     $7.84 billion in net cash from financing activities     primarily from net proceeds from issuances of     short-term     secured financings. We used net cash of $6.34 billion for     operating and investing activities, primarily to fund an     increase in securities purchased under agreements to resell and     an increase in cash and securities segregated for regulatory and     other purposes, partially offset by cash generated from a     decrease in securities borrowed.     Year Ended December 2009.  Our cash and     cash equivalents increased by $24.49 billion to     $38.29 billion at the end of 2009. We generated     $48.88 billion in net cash from operating activities. We     used net cash of $24.39 billion for investing and financing     activities, primarily for net repayments in unsecured and     secured     short-term     borrowings and the repurchases of Series H Preferred Stock     and the related common stock warrant from the     U.S. Treasury, partially offset by an increase in bank     deposits and the issuance of common stock.            83       Table of Contents           Market Risk     Management             Overview       Market risk is the risk of loss in the value of our inventory     due to changes in market prices. We hold inventory primarily for     market making for our clients and for our investing and lending     activities. Our inventory therefore changes based on client     demands and our investment opportunities. Our inventory is     accounted for at fair value and therefore fluctuates on a daily     basis. Categories of market risk include the following:                      Interest rate risk: primarily results from exposures to changes     in the level, slope and curvature of yield curves, the     volatilities of interest rates, mortgage prepayment speeds and     credit spreads.                  Equity price risk: results from exposures to changes in prices     and volatilities of individual equities, baskets of equities and     equity indices.                  Currency rate risk: results from exposures to changes in spot     prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates.                  Commodity price risk: results from exposures to changes in spot     prices, forward prices and volatilities of commodities, such as     electricity, natural gas, crude oil, petroleum products, and     precious and base metals.       Market Risk     Management Process       We manage our market risk by diversifying exposures, controlling     position sizes and establishing economic hedges in related     securities or derivatives. This includes:                      accurate and timely exposure information incorporating multiple     risk metrics;                  a dynamic limit setting framework; and                  constant communication among revenue-producing units, risk     managers and senior management.           Market Risk Management, which is independent of the     revenue-producing units and reports to the firms chief     risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing,     monitoring and managing market risk at the firm. We monitor and     control risks through strong firmwide oversight and independent     control and support functions across the firms global     businesses.             Managers in revenue-producing units are accountable for managing     risk within prescribed limits. These managers have     in-depth     knowledge of their positions, of markets and the instruments     available to hedge their exposures.         Managers in revenue-producing units and Market Risk Management     discuss market information, positions and estimated risk and     loss scenarios on an ongoing basis.     Risk     Measures       Market Risk Management produces risk measures and monitors them     against market risk limits set by our firms risk     committees. These measures reflect an extensive range of     scenarios and the results are aggregated at trading desk,     business and firmwide levels.         We use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of     potential losses for both moderate and more extreme market moves     over both     short-term     and     long-term     time horizons. Risk measures used for shorter-term periods     include VaR and sensitivity metrics. For longer-term horizons,     our primary risk measures are stress tests. Our risk reports     detail key risks, drivers and changes for each desk and     business, and are distributed daily to senior management of both     our revenue-producing units and our independent control and     support functions.     Systems       We have made a significant investment in technology to monitor     market risk including:                      an independent calculation of VaR and stress measures;                  risk measures calculated at individual position levels;                  attribution of risk measures to individual risk factors of each     position;                  the ability to report many different views of the risk measures     (e.g., by desk, business, product type or legal entity); and                  the ability to produce ad hoc analyses in a timely manner.              84       Table of Contents       Value-at-Risk       VaR is the potential loss in value of inventory positions due to     adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a     specified confidence level. We typically employ a     one-day time     horizon with a 95% confidence level. Thus, we would expect to     see reductions in the fair value of inventory positions at least     as large as the reported VaR once per month. The VaR model     captures risks including interest rates, equity prices, currency     rates and commodity prices. As such, VaR facilitates comparison     across portfolios of different risk characteristics. VaR also     captures the diversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide     level.         Inherent limitations to VaR include:                      VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time horizons     where moves may be extreme.                  VaR does not take account of the relative liquidity of different     risk positions.                  Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate     predictions of all future market moves.           The historical data used in our VaR calculation is weighted to     give greater importance to more recent observations and reflect     current asset volatilities. This improves the accuracy of our     estimates of potential loss. As a result, even if our inventory     positions were unchanged, our VaR would increase with increasing     market volatility and vice versa.         Given its reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in     estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no     sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions.         We evaluate the accuracy of our VaR model through daily     backtesting (i.e., comparing daily trading net revenues to     the VaR measure calculated as of the prior business day) at the     firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major     regulated subsidiaries.         VaR does not include:                      positions that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity     measures; and                  the impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads     on derivatives as well as changes in our own credit spreads on     unsecured borrowings for which the fair value option was elected.           Stress     Testing       We use stress testing to examine risks of specific portfolios as     well as the potential impact of significant risk exposures     across the firm. We use a variety of scenarios to calculate the     potential loss from a wide range of market moves on the     firms portfolios. These scenarios include the default of     single corporate or sovereign entities, the impact of a move in     a single risk factor across all positions (e.g., equity     prices or credit spreads) or a combination of two or more risk     factors.         Unlike VaR measures, which have an implied probability because     they are calculated at a specified confidence level, there is     generally no implied probability that our stress test scenarios     will occur. Instead, stress tests are used to model both     moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors.     When estimating potential loss, we generally assume that our     positions cannot be reduced or hedged (although experience     demonstrates that we are generally able to do so).         Stress test scenarios are conducted on a regular basis as part     of the firms routine risk management process and on an ad     hoc basis in response to market events or concerns. Stress     testing is an important part of the firms risk management     process because it allows us to highlight potential loss     concentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, and assess and     mitigate our risk positions.     Limits       We use risk limits at various levels in the firm (including     firmwide, product and business) to govern risk appetite by     controlling the size of our exposures to market risk. Limits are     reviewed frequently and amended on a permanent or temporary     basis to reflect changing market conditions, business conditions     or tolerance for risk.         The Firmwide Risk Committee sets market risk limits at firmwide     and product levels and our Securities Division Risk     Committee sets     sub-limits     for     market-making     and investing activities at a business level. The purpose of the     firmwide limits is to assist senior management in controlling     the firms overall risk profile.     Sub-limits     set the desired maximum amount of exposure that may be managed     by any particular business on a     day-to-day     basis without additional levels of senior management approval,     effectively leaving     day-to-day     trading decisions to individual desk managers and traders.     Accordingly,     sub-limits     are a management tool designed to ensure appropriate escalation     rather than to establish maximum risk tolerance.     Sub-limits     also distribute risk among various businesses in a manner that     is consistent with their level of activity and client demand,     taking into account the relative performance of each area.            85       Table of Contents           Our market risk limits are monitored daily by Market Risk     Management, which is responsible for identifying and escalating,     on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded.     The business-level limits that are set by the Securities     Division Risk Committee are subject to the same scrutiny     and limit escalation policy as the firmwide limits.         When a risk limit has been exceeded (e.g., due to changes     in market conditions, such as increased volatilities or changes     in correlations), it is reported to the appropriate risk     committee and a discussion takes place with the relevant desk     managers, after which either the risk position is reduced or the     risk limit is temporarily or permanently increased.     Metrics       We analyze VaR at the firmwide level and a variety of more     detailed levels, including by risk category, business, and     region. The tables below present average daily VaR and year-end     VaR by risk category.     Average Daily     VaR                                                                       Year Ended     in millions        December            December            November                  Risk Categories       2010           2009           2008                             Interest rates        $   93               $       176               $       142                      Equity prices            68                   66                   72                      Currency rates            32                   36                   30                      Commodity prices            33                   36                   44                      Diversification     effect 1            (92   )               (96       )               (108       )                          Total        $   134           $   218           $   180                                          1.        Equals the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs     for the four risk categories. This effect arises because the     four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated.           Our average daily VaR decreased to $134 million in 2010     from $218 million in 2009, principally due to a decrease in     the interest rates category which was primarily due to reduced     exposures, lower levels of volatility and tighter spreads.         Our average daily VaR increased to $218 million in 2009     from $180 million in 2008, principally due to an increase     in the interest rates category and a reduction in the     diversification benefit across risk categories, partially offset     by a decrease in the commodity prices category. The increase in     the interest rates category was primarily due to wider spreads.     The decrease in the commodity prices category was primarily due     to lower energy prices.

Equals the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs     for the four risk categories. This effect arises because the     four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated.           Our daily VaR decreased to $111 million as of     December 2010 from $153 million as of     December 2009, principally due to a decrease in the equity     prices and interest rates categories, partially offset by a     decrease in the diversification benefit across risk categories.     The decreases in the equity prices and interest rates categories     were primarily due to reduced exposures and lower levels of     volatility.         During the year ended December 2010, the firmwide VaR risk     limit was exceeded on one occasion in order to facilitate a     client transaction and was resolved by a reduction in the risk     position on the following day. Separately, during the year ended     December 2010, the firmwide VaR risk limit was reduced on     one occasion reflecting lower risk utilization.         During the year ended December 2009, the firmwide VaR risk     limit was exceeded on two successive days. It was resolved by a     reduction in the risk position without a permanent or temporary     VaR limit increase. Separately, during the year ended     December 2009, the firmwide VaR risk limit was raised on     one occasion and reduced on two occasions as a result of changes     in the risk utilization and the market environment.            86       Table of Contents              The chart below reflects the VaR over the last four quarters.                         The chart below presents the frequency distribution of our daily     trading net revenues for substantially all           inventory positions included in VaR for the year ended     December 2010.                            As noted above, daily trading net revenues are compared with VaR     calculated as of the end of the prior business day. Trading     losses incurred on a single day exceeded our 95%     one-day VaR     on two           occasions during 2010. Trading losses incurred on a single day     did not exceed our 95%     one-day VaR     during 2009.                  87       Table of Contents    Sensitivity     Measures          As noted above, certain portfolios and individual positions are     not included in VaR because VaR is not the most appropriate risk     measure. The market risk of these positions is determined by     estimating the potential reduction in net revenues of a 10%     decline in asset value. The market risk related to our     investment           in the ordinary shares of ICBC excludes interests held by     investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs.         The table below presents market risk for positions that are not     included in VaR. These measures do not reflect diversification     benefits across asset categories and therefore have not been     aggregated.

Relates to private and restricted public equity securities,     including interests in firm-sponsored funds that invest in     corporate equities and real estate and interests in     firm-sponsored hedge funds.          2.        Relates to corporate bank debt, loans backed by commercial and     residential real estate, and other corporate debt, including     acquired portfolios of distressed loans and interests in our     firm-sponsored funds that invest in corporate mezzanine and     senior debt instruments.                  As noted above, VaR excludes the impact of changes in     counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives as well     as changes in our own credit spreads on unsecured borrowings for     which the fair value option was elected. The estimated     sensitivity of our net revenues to a one basis point increase in     credit spreads (counterparty and our own) on derivatives was a     $5 million gain as of December 2010. In addition, the     estimated sensitivity of our net revenues to a one basis point     increase in our own credit spreads on unsecured borrowings for     which the fair value option was elected was an $8 million     gain (including hedges) as of December 2010.         In addition to the positions included in VaR and the sensitivity     measures described above, as of December 2010, we held     $3.67 billion of securities accounted for as     available-for-sale,     primarily consisting of $1.69 billion of corporate debt     securities, the majority of which will mature after five years,     with an average yield of 6%, $670 million of mortgage and     other     asset-backed     loans and securities, which will mature after ten years with an     average yield of 11%, and $637 million of     U.S. government and federal agency obligations, the     majority of which will mature after ten years with an average     yield of 4%. As of December 2009, we held     $3.86 billion of securities accounted for as       available-for-sale,     primarily consisting of $1.64 billion of corporate debt     securities, the majority of which will mature after five years,     with an average yield of 6%, $950 million of     U.S. government and federal agency obligations, the     majority of which will mature after ten years with an average     yield of 4%, and $638 million of mortgage and other     asset-backed     loans and securities, the majority of which will mature after     ten years with an average yield of 15%.         In addition, as of December 2010, we held money market     instruments, commitments and loans under the William Street     credit extension program. See Note 18 to the consolidated     financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     for further information about our William Street credit     extension program.         Additionally, we make investments accounted for under the equity     method and we also make direct investments in real estate, both     of which are included in Other assets in the     consolidated statements of financial condition. Direct     investments in real estate are accounted for at cost less     accumulated depreciation. See Note 12 to the consolidated     financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     for information on Other assets.                  88       Table of Contents       Credit Risk     Management         Overview       Credit risk represents the potential for loss due to the default     or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty     (e.g., an OTC derivatives counterparty or a borrower) or an     issuer of securities or other instruments we hold. Our exposure     to credit risk comes mostly from client transactions in OTC     derivatives and loans and lending commitments. Credit risk also     comes from cash placed with banks, securities financing     transactions (i.e., resale and repurchase agreements and     securities borrowing and lending activities) and receivables     from brokers, dealers, clearing organizations, customers and     counterparties.         Credit Risk Management, which is independent of the     revenue-producing     units and reports to the firms chief risk officer, has     primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing     credit risk at the firm. The Credit Policy Committee and the     Firmwide Risk Committee establish and review credit policies and     parameters. In addition, we hold other positions that give rise     to credit risk (e.g., bonds held in our inventory and     secondary bank loans). These credit risks are captured as a     component of market risk measures, which are monitored and     managed by Market Risk Management, consistent with other     inventory positions.         Policies authorized by the Firmwide Risk Committee and the     Credit Policy Committee prescribe the level of formal approval     required for the firm to assume credit exposure to a     counterparty across all product areas, taking into account any     enforceable netting provisions, collateral or other credit risk     mitigants.     Credit Risk     Management Process       Effective management of credit risk requires accurate and timely     information, a high level of communication and knowledge of     customers, countries, industries and products. Our process for     managing credit risk includes:                      approving transactions and setting and communicating credit     exposure limits;                  monitoring compliance with established credit exposure limits;                  assessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default on its     payment obligations;                  measuring the firms current and potential credit exposure     and losses resulting from counterparty default;                  reporting of credit exposures to senior management, the Board     and regulators;                            use of credit risk mitigants, including collateral and hedging;     and                  communication and collaboration with other independent control     and support functions such as operations, legal and compliance.           As part of the risk assessment process, Credit Risk Management     performs credit reviews which include initial and ongoing     analyses of our counterparties. A credit review is an     independent judgment about the capacity and willingness of a     counterparty to meet its financial obligations. For     substantially all of our credit exposures, the core of our     process is an annual counterparty review. A counterparty review     is a written analysis of a counterpartys business profile     and financial strength resulting in an internal credit rating     which represents the probability of default on financial     obligations to the firm. The determination of internal credit     ratings incorporates assumptions with respect to the     counterpartys future business performance, the nature and     outlook for the counterpartys industry, and the economic     environment. Senior personnel within Credit Risk Management,     with expertise in specific industries, inspect and approve     credit reviews and internal credit ratings.         Our global credit risk management systems capture credit     exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis     to counterparties and their subsidiaries (economic groups).     These systems also provide management with comprehensive     information on our aggregate credit risk by product, internal     credit rating, industry, country and region.     Risk Measures and     Limits       We measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in an     event of     non-payment     by a counterparty. For derivatives and securities financing     transactions, the primary measure is potential exposure, which     is our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the     life of a transaction based on market movements within a     specified confidence level. Potential exposure takes into     account netting and collateral arrangements. For loans and     lending commitments, the primary measure is a function of the     notional amount of the position. We also monitor credit risk in     terms of current exposure, which is the amount presently owed to     the firm after taking into account applicable netting and     collateral.            89       Table of Contents           We use credit limits at various levels (counterparty, economic     group, industry, country) to control the size of our credit     exposures. Limits for counterparties and economic groups are     reviewed regularly and revised to reflect changing appetites for     a given counterparty or group of counterparties. Limits for     industries and countries are based on the firms risk     tolerance and are designed to allow for regular monitoring,     review, escalation and management of credit risk concentrations.     Stress     Tests/Scenario Analysis       We use regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures,     including potential concentrations that would result from     applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk     factors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates, equity     prices). These shocks include a wide range of moderate and more     extreme market movements. Some of our stress tests include     shocks to multiple risk factors, consistent with the occurrence     of a severe market or economic event. Unlike potential exposure,     which is calculated within a specified confidence level, with a     stress test there is generally no assumed probability of these     events occurring.         We run stress tests on a regular basis as part of our routine     risk management processes and conduct tailored stress tests on     an ad hoc basis in response to market developments. Stress tests     are regularly conducted jointly with the firms market and     liquidity risk functions.     Risk     Mitigants       To reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securities     financing transactions, we may enter into netting agreements     with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and     payables with such counterparties. We may also reduce credit     risk with counterparties by entering into agreements that enable     us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent     basis and/or     to terminate transactions if the counterpartys credit     rating falls below a specified level.             For loans and lending commitments, we typically employ a variety     of potential risk mitigants, depending on the credit quality of     the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction. Risk     mitigants include: collateral provisions, guarantees, covenants,     structural seniority of the bank loan claims and, for certain     lending commitments, provisions in the legal documentation that     allow the firm to adjust loan amounts, pricing, structure and     other terms as market conditions change. The type and structure     of risk mitigants employed can significantly influence the     degree of credit risk involved in a loan.         When we do not have sufficient visibility into a     counterpartys financial strength or when we believe a     counterparty requires support from its parent company, we may     obtain     third-party     guarantees of the counterpartys obligations. We may also     mitigate our credit risk using credit derivatives or     participation agreements.     Credit     Exposures       The firms credit exposures are described further below.     Cash and Cash Equivalents.  Cash and cash     equivalents include both interest-bearing and     non-interest     bearing deposits. To mitigate the risk of credit loss, we place     substantially all of our deposits with highly rated banks and     central banks.     OTC Derivatives.  Derivatives are reported on a     net-by-counterparty     basis (i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative     assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) when a legal     right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement.         Derivatives are accounted for at fair value net of cash     collateral received or posted under credit support agreements.     As credit risk is an essential component of fair value, the firm     includes a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) in the fair value     of derivatives to reflect counterparty credit risk, as described     in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K.     CVA is a function of the present value of expected exposure, the     probability of counterparty default and the assumed recovery     upon default.            90       Table of Contents           The tables below present the distribution of our exposure to OTC     derivatives by tenor, based on expected duration for     mortgage-related     credit derivatives and generally on remaining contractual           maturity for other derivatives, both before and after the effect     of collateral and netting agreements. The categories shown     reflect our internally determined public rating agency     equivalents.                                                                                                                    in millions       As of December 2010                                     5 Years                                                Exposure                          0-12            1-5            or                                                Net of                  Credit Rating Equivalent       Months           Years           Greater           Total           Netting     1           Exposure           Collateral                             AAA/Aaa        $   504           $   728           $   2,597           $   3,829           $   (491   )       $   3,338           $   3,088                      AA/Aa2            5,234               8,875               15,579               29,688               (18,167   )           11,521               6,935                      A/A2            13,556               38,522               49,568               101,646               (74,650   )           26,996               16,839                      BBB/Baa2            3,818               18,062               19,625               41,505               (27,832   )           13,673               8,182                      BB/Ba2 or lower            3,583               5,382               3,650               12,615               (4,553   )           8,062               5,439                      Unrated            709               1,081               332               2,122               (20   )           2,102               1,539                              Total        $   27,404           $   72,650           $   91,351           $   191,405           $   (125,713   )       $   65,692           $   42,022                                                                                                                                           in millions       As of December 2009                                     5 Years                                                Exposure                          0-12            1-5            or                                                Net of                  Credit Rating Equivalent       Months           Years           Greater           Total           Netting     1           Exposure           Collateral                             AAA/Aaa            $       2,020               $       3,157               $       5,917               $       11,094               $       (5,446       )           $       5,648               $       5,109                      AA/Aa2                5,285                   10,745                   14,686                   30,716                   (18,295       )               12,421                   8,735                      A/A2                22,707                   47,891                   58,332                   128,930                   (104,804       )               24,126                   20,111                      BBB/Baa2                4,402                   8,300                   10,231                   22,933                   (10,441       )               12,492                   6,202                      BB/Ba2 or lower                4,444                   9,438                   2,979                   16,861                   (4,804       )               12,057                   7,381                      Unrated                484                   977                   327                   1,788                   (110       )               1,678                   1,161                              Total        $   39,342           $   80,508           $   92,472           $   212,322           $   (143,900   )       $   68,422           $   48,699                                          1.        Represents the netting of receivable balances with payable     balances for the same counterparty across tenor categories under     enforceable netting agreements, and the netting of cash     collateral received under credit support agreements. Receivable     and payable balances with the same counterparty in the same     tenor category are netted within such tenor category.           91       Table of Contents         Lending Activities.  We manage the firms     traditional credit origination activities, including funded     loans, lending commitments and the William Street credit     extension program, using the credit risk process, measures and     limits described above. Other lending positions, including     secondary trading positions, are     risk-managed     as a component of market risk.     Resale Agreements and Securities Borrowed.  The     firm bears credit risk related to resale agreements and     securities borrowed only to the extent that cash advanced to the     counterparty exceeds the value of the collateral received.     Therefore, the firms credit exposure on these transactions     is significantly lower than the amounts recorded on the     consolidated statement of financial condition (which represent     fair value or contractual value before consideration of     collateral received). The firm also has credit exposure on     repurchase agreements and securities loaned, which are     liabilities on our consolidated statement of financial     condition, to the extent that the value of collateral pledged to     the counterparty for these transactions exceeds the amount of     cash received.     Other Credit Exposures.  The firm is exposed to     credit risk from its receivables from brokers, dealers and     clearing organizations and customers and counterparties.     Receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations are     primarily comprised of initial margin placed with clearing     organizations and receivables related to sales of securities     which have traded, but not yet settled. These receivables have     minimal credit risk due to the low probability of clearing     organization default and the     short-term     nature of receivables related to securities settlements.     Receivables from customers and counterparties are generally     comprised of collateralized receivables related to customer     securities transactions and have minimal credit risk due to both     the value of the collateral received and the     short-term     nature of these receivables.         Credit     Exposures       The tables below present the firms credit exposures     related to cash, OTC derivatives, loans and lending commitments     associated with traditional credit origination activities, and     securities financing transactions, broken down by industry,     region and internal credit rating.         During the year ended December 2010, total credit exposures     increased by $10.51 billion reflecting an increase in loans     and lending commitments. This increase was primarily     attributable to an increase in lending activity and a modest     increase in average commitment size. During the year ended     December 2010, incidence of counterparty default and the     associated credit losses have declined compared with the year     ended December 2009. The credit quality of the overall     portfolio as of December 2010 is relatively unchanged     although OTC derivative exposure to     non-investment-grade     counterparties declined approximately 25% from     December 2009.                92       Table of Contents

EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa).           93       Table of Contents       Operational     Risk         Overview       Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate     or failed internal processes, people and systems or from     external events. Our exposure to operational risk arises from     routine processing errors as well as extraordinary incidents,     such as major systems failures. Potential types of loss events     related to internal and external operational risk include:                      clients, products and business practices;                  execution, delivery and process management;                  business disruption and system failures;                  employment practices and workplace safety;                  damage to physical assets;                  internal fraud; and                  external fraud.           The firm maintains a comprehensive control framework designed to     provide a well-controlled environment to minimize operational     risks. The Firmwide Operational Risk Committee provides     oversight of the ongoing development and implementation of our     operational risk policies and framework. Our Operational Risk     Management department (Operational Risk Management) is a risk     management function independent of our     revenue-producing     units and is responsible for developing and implementing     policies, methodologies and a formalized framework for     operational risk management with the goal of minimizing our     exposure to operational risk.     Operational Risk     Management       Managing operational risk requires timely and accurate     information as well as a strong control culture. We seek to     manage our operational risk through:                      the training, supervision and development of our people;                  the active participation of senior management in identifying and     mitigating key operational risks across the firm;                  independent control and support functions that monitor     operational risk on a daily basis and have instituted extensive     policies and procedures and implemented controls designed to     prevent the occurrence of operational risk events;                  proactive communication between our     revenue-producing     units and our independent control and support functions; and                  a network of systems throughout the firm to facilitate the     collection of data used to analyze and assess our operational     risk exposure.               We combine top-down and     bottom-up     approaches to manage and measure operational risk. From a     top-down     perspective, the firms senior management assesses firmwide     and business level operational risk profiles. From a     bottom-up     perspective,     revenue-producing     units and independent control and support functions are     responsible for risk management on a     day-to-day     basis, including identifying, mitigating, and escalating     operational risks to senior management.         Our operational risk framework is in part designed to comply     with the operational risk measurement rules under Basel 2 and     has evolved based on the changing needs of our businesses and     regulatory guidance. Our framework includes the following     practices:                      Risk identification and reporting;                  Risk measurement; and                  Risk monitoring.           Internal Audit performs a review of our operational risk     framework, including our key controls, processes and     applications, on an annual basis to ensure the effectiveness of     our framework.     Risk     Identification and Reporting       The core of our operational risk management framework is risk     identification and reporting. We have a comprehensive data     collection process, including firmwide policies and procedures,     for operational risk events.         We have established policies that require managers in our     revenue-producing units and our independent control and support     functions to escalate operational risk events. When operational     risk events are identified, our policies require that the events     be documented and analyzed to determine whether changes are     required in the firms systems     and/or     processes to further mitigate the risk of future events.         In addition, our firmwide systems capture internal operational     risk event data, key metrics such as transaction volumes, and     statistical information such as performance trends. We use an     internally-developed     operational risk management application to aggregate and     organize this information. Managers from both revenue-producing     units and independent control and support functions analyze the     information to evaluate operational risk exposures and identify     businesses, activities or products with heightened levels of     operational risk. We also provide operational risk reports to     senior management, risk committees and the Board periodically.            94       Table of Contents                 Risk     Measurement       We measure the firms operational risk exposure over a     twelve-month time horizon using scenario analyses, together with     qualitative assessments of the potential frequency and extent of     potential operational risk losses, for each of the firms     businesses. Operational risk measurement incorporates     qualitative and quantitative assessments of factors including:                      internal and external operational risk event data;                  assessments of the firms internal controls;                  evaluations of the complexity of the firms business     activities;                  the degree of and potential for automation in the firms     processes;                  new product information;                  the legal and regulatory environment;                  changes in the markets for the firms products and     services, including the diversity and sophistication of the     firms customers and counterparties; and                  the liquidity of the capital markets and the reliability of the     infrastructure that supports the capital markets.           The results from these scenario analyses are used to monitor     changes in operational risk and to determine business lines that     may have heightened exposure to operational risk. These analyses     ultimately are used to determine the appropriate level of     operational risk capital to hold.     Risk     Monitoring       We evaluate changes in the operational risk profile of the firm     and its businesses, including changes in business mix or     jurisdictions in which the firm operates, by monitoring these     factors at a firmwide, entity and business level. The firm has     both detective and preventive internal controls, which are     designed to reduce the frequency and severity of operational     risk losses and the probability of operational risk events. We     monitor the results of assessments and independent internal     audits of these internal controls.      Recent Accounting     Developments          See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in     Part II, Item 8 of this     Form 10-K     for information about Recent Accounting Developments.          Certain Risk     Factors That May Affect   Our     Businesses          We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in     our businesses, including market, liquidity, credit,     operational, legal, regulatory and reputational risks. For a     discussion of how management seeks to manage some of these     risks, see Overview and Structure of Risk     Management. A summary of the more important factors that     could affect our businesses follows. For a further discussion of     these and other important factors that could affect our     businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash     flows and liquidity, see Risk Factors in     Part I, Item 1A of this     Form 10-K.                      Our businesses have been and may continue to be adversely     affected by conditions in the global financial markets and     economic conditions generally.                  Our businesses have been and may be adversely affected by     declining asset values. This is particularly true for those     businesses in which we have net long positions,     receive fees based on the value of assets managed, or receive or     post collateral.                  Our businesses have been and may be adversely affected by     disruptions in the credit markets, including reduced access to     credit and higher costs of obtaining credit.                  Our     market-making     activities have been and may be affected by changes in the     levels of market volatility.                  Our investment banking, client execution and investment     management businesses have been adversely affected and may     continue to be adversely affected by market uncertainty or lack     of confidence among investors and CEOs due to general declines     in economic activity and other unfavorable economic,     geopolitical or market conditions.                  Our investment management business may be affected by the poor     investment performance of our investment products.                  We may incur losses as a result of ineffective risk management     processes and strategies.                  Our liquidity, profitability and businesses may be adversely     affected by an inability to access the debt capital markets or     to sell assets or by a reduction in our credit ratings or by an     increase in our credit spreads.                  Conflicts of interest are increasing and a failure to     appropriately identify and address conflicts of interest could     adversely affect our businesses.              95       Table of Contents                                  Group Inc. is a holding company and is dependent for     liquidity on payments from its subsidiaries, many of which are     subject to restrictions.                  Our businesses, profitability and liquidity may be adversely     affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults     by, third parties who owe us money, securities or other assets     or whose securities or obligations we hold.                  Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant     losses in our     market-making,     underwriting, investing and lending activities.                  The financial services industry is highly competitive.                  We face enhanced risks as new business initiatives lead us to     transact with a broader array of clients and counterparties and     expose us to new asset classes and new markets.                  Derivative transactions and delayed settlements may expose us to     unexpected risk and potential losses.                  Our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to     hire and retain qualified employees.                  Our businesses and those of our clients are subject to extensive     and pervasive regulation around the world.                  We may be adversely affected by increased governmental and     regulatory scrutiny or negative publicity.                  A failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, or those     of third parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our     businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential     information, damage our reputation and cause losses.                            Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action     against us could have material adverse financial effects or     cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could     seriously harm our business prospects.                  The growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new     trading technology may adversely affect our business and may     increase competition.                  Our commodities activities, particularly our power generation     interests and our physical commodities activities, subject us to     extensive regulation, potential catastrophic events and     environmental, reputational and other risks that may expose us     to significant liabilities and costs.                  In conducting our businesses around the world, we are subject to     political, economic, legal, operational and other risks that are     inherent in operating in many countries.                  We may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic     events, including the emergence of a pandemic, terrorist attacks     or natural disasters.

The firms internal control over     financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision     of the firms principal executive and principal financial     officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the     reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the     firms financial statements for external reporting purposes     in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting     principles.         As of the end of the firms 2010 fiscal year, management     conducted an assessment of the firms internal control over     financial reporting based on the framework established in     Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued     by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway     Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has     determined that the firms internal control over financial     reporting as of December 31, 2010 was effective.             Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies     and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that,     in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions     and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that     transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of     financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally     accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and     expenditures are being made only in accordance with     authorizations of management and the directors of the firm; and     provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely     detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the     firms assets that could have a material effect on our     financial statements.         The firms internal control over financial reporting as of     December 31, 2010 has been audited by     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public     accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on     page 99, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the     effectiveness of the firms internal control over financial     reporting as of December 31, 2010.                98       Table of Contents       Report of     Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm            To the Board of Directors and the Shareholders of       The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.:            In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in     the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,     the financial position of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and its     subsidiaries (the Company) at December 31, 2010 and     December 31, 2009, and the results of its operations     and its cash flows for the fiscal years ended     December 31, 2010, December 31, 2009 and     November 28, 2008 and for the     one-month     period ended December 26, 2008 in conformity with     accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of     America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all     material respects, effective internal control over financial     reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria     established in Internal Control  Integrated     Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring     Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The     Companys management is responsible for these financial     statements, for maintaining effective internal control over     financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness     of internal control over financial reporting, included in     Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial     Reporting appearing on page 98. Our responsibility is to     express opinions on these financial statements and on the     Companys internal control over financial reporting based     on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the     standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board     (United States). Those standards require that we plan and     perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether     the financial statements are free of material misstatement and     whether effective internal control over financial reporting was     maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial     statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence     supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial     statements, assessing the accounting principles used and     significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the     overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal     control over financial reporting included obtaining an     understanding of internal control over financial reporting,     assessing the risk that a material           weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and     operating effectiveness of internal control based on the     assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other     procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We     believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our     opinions.         A companys internal control over financial reporting is a     process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the     reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of     financial statements for external purposes in accordance with     generally accepted accounting principles. A companys     internal control over financial reporting includes those     policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance     of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly     reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the     company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that     transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of     financial statements in accordance with generally accepted     accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the     company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of     management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide     reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of     unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the     companys assets that could have a material effect on the     financial statements.         Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over     financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.     Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future     periods are subject to the risk that controls may become     inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree     of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.         /s/     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP              New York, New York       February 28, 2011                  99       Table of

Description     of Business           The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc.), a Delaware     corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries     (collectively, the firm), is a leading global investment     banking, securities and investment management firm that provides     a wide range of financial services to a substantial and     diversified client base that includes corporations, financial     institutions, governments and     high-net-worth     individuals. Founded in 1869, the firm is headquartered in New     York and maintains offices in all major financial centers around     the world.         In the fourth quarter of 2010, consistent with managements     view of the firms activities, the firm reorganized its     three previous business segments into four new business     segments: Investment Banking, Institutional Client Services,     Investing & Lending and Investment Management. Prior     periods are presented on a comparable basis.     Investment     Banking       The firm provides a broad range of investment banking services     to a diverse group of corporations, financial institutions,     investment funds and governments. Services include advisory     assignments with respect to mergers and acquisitions,     divestitures, corporate defense activities, risk management,     restructurings and     spin-offs,     and debt and equity underwriting of public offerings and private     placements, as well as derivative transactions directly related     to these activities.     Institutional     Client Services       The firm facilitates client transactions and makes markets in     fixed income, equity, currency and commodity products, primarily     with institutional clients such as corporates, financial     institutions, investment funds and governments. The firm also     makes markets and clears client transactions on major stock,     options and futures exchanges worldwide and provides financing,     securities lending and prime brokerage services to institutional     clients.     Investing &     Lending       The firm invests in and originates loans to provide financing to     clients. These investments and loans are typically longer-term     in nature. The firm makes investments, directly and indirectly     through funds that the firm manages, in debt securities, loans,     public and private equity securities, real estate, consolidated     investment entities and power generation facilities.         Investment     Management       The firm provides investment management services and offers     investment products (primarily through separately managed     accounts and commingled vehicles, such as mutual funds and     private investment funds) across all major asset classes to a     diverse set of institutional and individual clients. The firm     also offers wealth advisory services, including portfolio     management and financial counseling, and brokerage and other     transaction services to     high-net-worth     individuals and families.       Note 2.  Basis     of Presentation          These consolidated financial statements are prepared in     accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the     United States (U.S. GAAP) and include the accounts of     Group Inc. and all other entities in which the firm has a     controlling financial interest. Intercompany transactions and     balances have been eliminated.         In connection with becoming a bank holding company, the firm was     required to change its fiscal year-end from November to     December. This change in the firms fiscal year-end     resulted in a     one-month     transition period that began on November 29, 2008 and     ended on December 26, 2008. In April 2009, the     Board approved a change in the firms fiscal year-end from     the last Friday of December to December 31. Fiscal 2009     began on December 27, 2008 and ended on     December 31, 2009.         All references to 2010, 2009 and 2008, unless specifically     stated otherwise, refer to the firms fiscal years ended,     or the dates, as the context requires,     December 31, 2010, December 31, 2009 and     November 28, 2008, respectively. Any reference to a     future year refers to a fiscal year ending on December 31     of that year. All references to December 2008, unless     specifically stated otherwise, refer to the firms fiscal     one month ended, or the date, as the context requires,     December 26, 2008. Certain reclassifications have been     made to previously reported amounts to conform to the current     presentation.             106       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                Note 3.

The firm determines whether it     has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first     evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a     variable interest entity.     Voting Interest Entities.  Voting interest     entities are entities in which (i) the total equity     investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance     its activities independently and (ii) the equity holders     have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most     significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to     absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the     residual returns of the entity. The usual condition for a     controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is     ownership of a majority voting interest. If the firm has a     majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity     is consolidated.      Variable Interest Entities (VIE).  A VIE is an     entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting     interest entity. The firm has a controlling financial interest     in a VIE when the firm has a variable interest or interests that     provide it with (i) the power to direct the activities of     the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic     performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the     VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could     potentially be significant to the VIE. See Note 11 for     further information about VIEs.       Equity-Method     Investments.  When the firm does not have a     controlling financial interest in an entity but can exert     significant influence over the entitys operating and     financial policies, the investment is accounted for either     (i) under the equity method of accounting or (ii) at     fair value by electing the fair value option available under     U.S. GAAP. Significant influence generally exists when the     firm owns 20% to 50% of the entitys common stock or     in-substance     common stock.         In general, the firm accounts for investments acquired     subsequent to November 24, 2006, when the fair value     option became available, at fair value. In certain cases, the     firm applies the equity method of accounting to new investments     that are strategic in nature or closely related to the     firms principal business activities, when the firm has a     significant degree of involvement in the cash flows or     operations of the investee or when     cost-benefit     considerations are less significant. See Note 12 for     further information about     equity-method     investments.             107       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                   Investment Funds.  The firm has formed numerous     investment funds with     third-party     investors. These funds are typically organized as limited     partnerships or limited liability companies for which the firm     acts as general partner or manager. Generally, the firm does not     hold a majority of the economic interests in these funds. These     funds are usually voting interest entities and generally are not     consolidated because     third-party     investors typically have rights to terminate the funds or to     remove the firm as general partner or manager. Investments in     these funds are included in Financial instruments owned,     at fair value. See Notes 6, 18 and 22 for further     information about investments in funds.       Use of     Estimates       Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires     management to make certain estimates and assumptions, the most     important of which relate to fair value measurements, accounting     for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets and the     provision for losses that may arise from litigation, regulatory     proceedings and tax audits. These estimates and assumptions are     based on the best available information but actual results could     be materially different.       Revenue     Recognition   Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities at Fair     Value.  Financial instruments owned, at fair value     and Financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased, at fair     value are recorded at fair value either under the fair value     option or in accordance with other U.S. GAAP. In addition, the     firm has elected to account for certain of its other financial     assets and financial liabilities at fair value by electing the     fair value option. The fair value of a financial instrument is     the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to     transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market     participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are     marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to     offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction     costs. Fair value gains or losses are generally included in     Market making for positions in Institutional Client     Services and Other principal transactions for     positions in Investing & Lending. See Notes 5     through 8 for further information about fair value measurements.     Investment Banking.  Fees from financial     advisory assignments and underwriting revenues are recognized in     earnings when the services related to the underlying transaction     are completed under the           terms of the assignment. Expenses associated with such     transactions are deferred until the related revenue is     recognized or the assignment is otherwise concluded. Expenses     associated with financial advisory assignments are recorded as     non-compensation     expenses, net of client reimbursements. Underwriting revenues     are presented net of related expenses.     Investment Management.  The firm earns     management fees and incentive fees for investment management     services. Management fees are calculated as a percentage of net     asset value, invested capital or commitments, and are recognized     over the period that the related service is provided. Incentive     fees are calculated as a percentage of a funds or     separately managed accounts return, or excess return above     a specified benchmark or other performance target. Incentive     fees are generally based on investment performance over a     12-month     period or over the life of a fund. Fees that are based on     performance over a     12-month     period are subject to adjustment prior to the end of the     measurement period. For fees that are based on investment     performance over the life of the fund, future investment     underperformance may require fees previously distributed to the     firm to be returned to the fund. Incentive fees are recognized     only when all material contingencies have been resolved.     Management and incentive fee revenues are included in     Investment management revenues.     Commissions and Fees.  The firm earns     Commissions and fees from executing and clearing     client transactions on stock, options and futures markets.     Commissions and fees are recognized on the day the trade is     executed.       Transfers of Assets       Transfers of assets are accounted for as sales when the firm has     relinquished control over the assets transferred. For transfers     of assets accounted for as sales, any related gains or losses     are recognized in net revenues. Assets or liabilities that arise     from the firms continuing involvement with transferred     assets are measured at fair value. For transfers of assets that     are not accounted for as sales, the assets remain in     Financial instruments owned, at fair value and the     transfer is accounted for as a collateralized financing, with     the related interest expense recognized over the life of the     transaction. See Note 9 for further information about     transfers of assets accounted for as collateralized financings     and Note 10 for further information about transfers of     assets accounted for as sales.             108       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)            Receivables from     Customers and Counterparties       Receivables from customers and counterparties generally consist     of collateralized receivables, primarily customer margin loans,     related to client transactions. Certain of the firms     receivables from customers and counterparties are accounted for     at fair value under the fair value option, with changes in fair     value generally included in Market making revenues.     See Note 8 for further information about the fair values of     these receivables. Receivables from customers and counterparties     not accounted for at fair value are accounted for at amortized     cost net of estimated uncollectible amounts, which generally     approximates fair value. Interest on receivables from customers     and counterparties is recognized over the life of the     transaction and included in Interest income.       Insurance     Activities       Certain of the firms insurance and reinsurance contracts     are accounted for at fair value under the fair value option,     with changes in fair value included in Market making     revenues. See Note 8 for further information about the fair     values of these insurance and reinsurance contracts.         Revenues from variable annuity and life insurance and     reinsurance contracts not accounted for at fair value generally     consist of fees assessed on contract holder account balances for     mortality charges, policy administration fees and surrender     charges. These revenues are recognized in earnings over the     period that services are provided and are included in     Market making revenues. Interest credited to     variable annuity and life insurance and reinsurance contract     account balances and changes in reserves are recognized in     Other expenses.             Premiums earned for underwriting property catastrophe     reinsurance are recognized in earnings over the coverage period,     net of premiums ceded for the cost of reinsurance, and are     included in Market making revenues. Expenses for     liabilities related to property catastrophe reinsurance claims,     including estimates of losses that have been incurred but not     reported, are included in Other expenses.       Foreign Currency     Translation       Assets and liabilities denominated in     non-U.S. currencies     are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the date of     the consolidated statements of financial condition and revenues     and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange for the     period. Foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses on     transactions in nonfunctional currencies are recognized in     earnings. Gains or losses on translation of the financial     statements of a     non-U.S. operation,     when the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar,     are included, net of hedges and taxes, in the consolidated     statements of comprehensive income.       Cash and Cash     Equivalents       The firm defines cash equivalents as highly liquid overnight     deposits held in the ordinary course of business. As of     December 2010 and December 2009, Cash and cash     equivalents included $5.75 billion and     $4.45 billion, respectively, of cash and due from banks and     $34.04 billion and $33.84 billion, respectively, of     interest-bearing deposits with banks.                 109       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                   Recent Accounting     Developments        Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable     Interest Entities (Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 860     and 810).  In June 2009, the FASB issued     amended accounting principles that changed the accounting for     securitizations and VIEs. These principles were codified as ASU     No. 2009-16,     Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860)  Accounting     for Transfers of Financial Assets and ASU     No. 2009-17,     Consolidations (Topic 810)  Improvements to     Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable     Interest Entities in December 2009.         ASU     No. 2009-16     eliminates the concept of a qualifying     special-purpose     entity (QSPE), changes the requirements for derecognizing     financial assets and requires additional disclosures about     transfers of financial assets, including securitization     transactions and continuing involvement with transferred     financial assets. ASU     No. 2009-17     changes the accounting and requires additional disclosures for     VIEs. Under ASU     No. 2009-17,     the determination of whether to consolidate a VIE is based on     the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most     significantly impact the VIEs economic performance     together with either the obligation to absorb losses or the     right to receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE,     as well as the VIEs purpose and design. ASU     No. 2009-17     also requires entities previously classified as QSPEs to be     evaluated for consolidation and disclosure as VIEs.         ASU Nos.     2009-16 and     2009-17 were     effective for fiscal years beginning after     November 15, 2009. In February 2010, the FASB     issued ASU     No. 2010-10,     Consolidations (Topic 810)  Amendments For     Certain Investment Funds, which defers the requirements of     ASU     No. 2009-17     for certain interests in investment funds and certain similar     entities.             The firm adopted these amendments as of     January 1, 2010 and reassessed whether it was the     primary beneficiary of any VIEs in which it had variable     interests (including VIEs that were formerly QSPEs) as of that     date. Adoption resulted in an increase to the firms total     assets of approximately $3 billion as of     March 31, 2010, principally in Financial     instruments owned, at fair value. In addition, Other     assets increased by $545 million as of     March 31, 2010, with a corresponding decrease in     Financial instruments owned, at fair value, as a     result of the consolidation of an entity which holds intangible     assets. See Note 13 for further information about     intangible assets.         Upon adoption, the firm elected the fair value option for all     eligible assets and liabilities of newly consolidated VIEs,     except for (i) those VIEs where the financial assets and     financial liabilities are accounted for either at fair value or     in a manner that approximates fair value under other     U.S. GAAP, and (ii) those VIEs where the election     would have caused volatility in earnings as a result of using     different measurement attributes for financial instruments and     nonfinancial assets. Adoption did not have a material impact on     the firms results of operations or cash flows.     Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements (ASC     820).  In January 2010,     the     FASB issued ASU No.     2010-06,     Fair Value     Measurements and     Disclosures     (Topic 820)  Improving     Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements. ASU     No. 2010-06     provides amended disclosure requirements related to fair value     measurements. Certain of these disclosure requirements were     effective for the firm beginning in the first quarter of 2010,     while others are effective for financial statements issued for     reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010.     Since these amended principles require only additional     disclosures concerning fair value measurements, adoption did not     and will not affect the firms financial condition, results     of operations or cash flows.                   110       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)             Note 4.

See Note 8 for     further information about the fair value option. The table below     presents the firms financial instruments owned, at fair     value, including those           pledged as collateral, and financial instruments sold, but not     yet purchased, at fair value.

See Note 18 for further information     about the William Street credit extension program.          3.        Consists of acquired portfolios of distressed loans, primarily     backed by commercial and residential real estate.          4.        Includes the fair value of unfunded commitments to extend     credit. The fair value of partially funded commitments is     primarily included in Financial instruments owned, at fair     value.                  111       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)           Gains and Losses     from Market Making and     Other Principal Transactions       The table below presents, by major product type, the firms     Market making and Other principal     transactions revenues. These gains/(losses) are primarily     related to the firms financial instruments owned, at fair     value and financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased, at     fair value, including both derivative and nonderivative     financial instruments. These gains/(losses) exclude related     interest income and interest expense. See Note 23 for     further information about interest income and interest expense.         The gains/(losses) in the table are not representative of the     manner in which the firm manages its business activities because     many of the firms market making, client facilitation, and     investing and lending strategies utilize financial instruments     across various product types. Accordingly, gains or losses in     one product type frequently offset gains or losses in other     product types.         For example, most of the firms longer-term derivatives are     sensitive to changes in interest rates and may be economically     hedged with interest rate swaps. Similarly, a significant     portion of the firms cash instruments and derivatives has     exposure to foreign currencies and may be economically hedged     with foreign currency contracts.

Fair     Value Measurements            The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that     would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a     liability in an orderly transaction between market participants     at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid     prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices.     Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs.         The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an active     market. If listed prices or quotations are not available, fair     value is determined by reference to prices for similar     instruments, quoted prices or recent transactions in less active     markets, or internally developed models that primarily use, as     inputs,     market-based     or independently sourced parameters, including but not limited     to interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign     exchange rates, commodities prices and credit curves.         U.S. GAAP has a three-level fair value hierarchy for     disclosure of fair value measurements. The fair value hierarchy     prioritizes inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure     fair value, giving the highest priority to level 1 inputs     and the lowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial     instruments level in the fair value hierarchy is based on     the lowest level of any input that is significant to its fair     value measurement.         The fair value hierarchy is as follows:     Level 1.  Inputs are unadjusted quoted     prices in active markets to which the firm had access at the     measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or     liabilities.     Level 2.  Inputs to valuation techniques     are observable, either directly or indirectly.     Level 3.  One or more inputs to valuation     techniques are significant and unobservable.         See Notes 6 and 7 for further information about fair value     measurements of cash instruments and derivatives, respectively.         The fair value of certain level 2 and level 3     financial assets and financial liabilities may include valuation     adjustments for counterparty and the firms credit quality,     transfer restrictions, large     and/or     concentrated positions, illiquidity and bid/offer inputs. See     Notes 6 and 7 for further information about valuation     adjustments.             112       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)               Level 3 financial assets are summarized below.

Level 3 cash     instruments are frequently economically hedged with level 1     and level 2 cash instruments     and/or     level 1, level 2 and level 3 derivatives.

These unrealized gains were substantially offset by unrealized     losses on currency, interest rate and credit derivatives     categorized in level 2, which economically hedge     level 3 derivatives.       Year Ended     December 2009                      A net unrealized loss on cash instruments of $4.31 billion,     primarily consisting of unrealized losses on private equity     investments and real estate fund investments, and loans and     securities backed by commercial real estate, reflecting weakness     in the markets for these less liquid asset classes.                  A net unrealized loss on derivatives of $1.02 billion,     primarily attributable to tighter credit spreads on the     underlying instruments and increases in underlying equity index     prices.

Year Ended     November 2008                      A net unrealized loss on cash instruments of     $12.36 billion, primarily consisting of unrealized losses     on loans and securities backed by commercial real estate,     certain bank loans and bridge loans, private equity investments     and real estate fund investments.                  A net unrealized gain on derivatives of $5.58 billion,     primarily attributable to changes in observable credit spreads     (which are level 2 inputs) on the underlying instruments.           One Month Ended     December 2008                      A net unrealized loss on cash instruments of $3.19 billion,     primarily consisting of unrealized losses on certain bank loans     and bridge loans, private equity investments and real estate     fund investments, and loans and securities backed by commercial     real estate. Losses during December 2008 reflected the     weakness in the global credit and equity markets.                  A net unrealized loss on derivatives of $210 million,     primarily attributable to changes in observable prices on the     underlying instruments (which are level 2 inputs).       Level 3     Rollforward       If a financial asset or financial liability was transferred to     level 3 during a reporting period, its entire gain or loss     for the period is included in level 3.

Substantially all of these borrowings were     level 3.                  Other liabilities and accrued expenses: net transfer into     level 3 of $587 million, principally due to an     increase in subordinated liabilities issued by certain     consolidated VIEs.                     117       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                                                                                                              Level 3 Financial Assets at Fair Value for the Year Ended     December 2009                                     Net unrealized                                                                                      gains/(losses)            Net            Net                                                  Net            relating to            purchases,            transfers                                      Balance,            realized            instruments            issuances            in     and/or            Balance,                          beginning            gains/            still held at year            and            (out) of            end of                  in millions       of year           (losses)           end           settlements           level 3           year                             Total cash instruments  assets            $       49,652               $       1,736        1           $       (4,781       ) 1           $       (8,627       )           $       (3,101       )           $       34,879                      Total derivatives  net                3,315                   759        2               (1,018       ) 2,      3               2,333                   (193       )               5,196                                          1.

Cash     Instruments               Cash instruments include U.S. government and federal agency     obligations,     non-U.S. government     obligations, bank loans and bridge loans, corporate debt     securities, equities and convertible debentures, and other     non-derivative     financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold, but     not yet purchased. See below for the types of cash instruments     included in each level of the fair value hierarchy and the     valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine     their fair values. See Note 5 for an overview of the     firms fair value measurement policies and the fair value     hierarchy.     Level 1 Cash     Instruments       Level 1 cash instruments include U.S. government     obligations and most     non-U.S. government     obligations, actively traded listed equities and certain money     market instruments. These instruments are valued using quoted     prices for identical unrestricted instruments in active markets.         The firm defines active markets for equity instruments based on     the average daily trading volume both in absolute terms and     relative to the market capitalization for the instrument. The     firm defines active markets for debt instruments based on both     the average daily trading volume and the number of days with     trading activity.         The fair value of a level 1 instrument is calculated as     quantity held multiplied by quoted market price. U.S. GAAP     prohibits valuation adjustments being applied to level 1     instruments even in situations where the firm holds a large     position and a sale could impact the quoted price.         Level 2 Cash     Instruments       Level 2 cash instruments include commercial paper,     certificates of deposit, time deposits, most government agency     obligations, most corporate debt securities, commodities,     certain     mortgage-backed     loans and securities, certain bank loans and bridge loans, less     liquid publicly listed equities, certain state and municipal     obligations and certain money market instruments and lending     commitments.         Valuations of level 2 cash instruments can be verified to     quoted prices, recent trading activity for identical or similar     instruments, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing     sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.     Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations     (e.g., indicative or firm) and the relationship of recent     market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing     sources.         Valuation adjustments are typically made to level 2 cash     instruments (i) if the cash instrument is subject to     transfer restrictions,     and/or     (ii) for other premiums and discounts that a market     participant would require to arrive at fair value. Valuation     adjustments are generally based on market evidence.     Level 3 Cash     Instruments       Level 3 cash instruments have one or more significant     valuation inputs that are not observable. Absent evidence to the     contrary, level 3 cash instruments are initially valued at     transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial     estimate of fair value. Subsequently, the firm uses other     methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the     type of instrument. Valuation inputs and assumptions are changed     when corroborated by substantive observable evidence, including     values realized on sales of level 3 assets.         The table below presents the valuation techniques and the nature     of significant inputs generally used to determine the fair     values of each class of level 3 cash instrument.            119       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                                  Level 3 Cash Instrument           Valuation Techniques and Significant Inputs             Loans and securities backed by commercial real estate     Collateralized by a single commercial real estate property or a portfolio of properties         May include tranches of varying levels of subordination             Valuation techniques vary by instrument, but are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques.   Significant inputs for these valuations include:      Transaction prices in both the underlying collateral and instruments with the same or similar underlying collateral         Current levels and changes in market indices such as the CMBX (an index that tracks the performance of commercial mortgage bonds)         Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets         Current performance of the underlying collateral         Capitalization rates and multiples                   Loans and securities backed by residential real estate     Collateralized by portfolios of residential real estate         May include tranches of varying levels of subordination             Valuation techniques vary by instrument, but are generally based on relative value analyses, discounted cash flow techniques or a combination thereof.   Significant inputs are determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons to instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles, including relevant indices such as the ABX (an index that tracks the performance of subprime residential mortgage bonds).  Significant inputs include:      Home price projections, residential property liquidation timelines and related costs         Underlying loan prepayment, default and cumulative loss expectations         Transaction prices in both the underlying collateral and instruments with the same or similar underlying collateral         Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets                   Loan portfolios     Acquired portfolios of distressed loans         Primarily backed by commercial and residential real estate collateral             Valuations are based on discounted cash flow techniques.   Significant inputs are determined based on relative value analyses which incorporate comparisons to recent auction data for other similar loan portfolios. Significant inputs include:      Amount and timing of expected future cash flows         Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets                   Bank loans and bridge loansCorporate debt securitiesState and municipal obligationsOther debt obligations             Valuation techniques vary by instrument, but are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques.   Significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons both to prices of credit default swaps that reference the same or similar underlying credit risk and to other debt instruments for the same issuer for which observable prices or broker quotations are available.  Significant inputs include:      Amount and timing of expected future cash flows         Current levels and trends of market indices such as CDX, LCDX and MCDX (indices that track the performance of corporate credit, loans and municipal obligations, respectively)         Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets         Current performance and recovery assumptions and, where we use credit default swaps to value the related cash instrument, the cost of borrowing the underlying reference obligation                       Equities and convertible debentures        Private equity investments                Recent third-party investments or pending transactions are     considered to be the best evidence for any change in fair     value.

Transfers between levels are reported     at the beginning of the reporting period in which they occur.     Accordingly, the tables do not include gains or losses that were     reported in level 3           in prior periods for cash instruments that were transferred out     of level 3 prior to the end of the period.

Investments in     Funds That Calculate   Net Asset Value Per Share          Cash instruments at fair value include investments in funds that     are valued based on the net asset value per share (NAV) of the     investment fund. The firm uses NAV as its measure of fair value     for fund investments when (i) the fund investment does not     have a readily determinable fair value and (ii) the NAV of     the investment fund is calculated in a manner consistent with     the measurement principles of investment company accounting,     including measurement of the underlying investments at fair     value.         The firms investments in funds that calculate NAV     primarily consist of investments in firm-sponsored funds where     the firm co-invests with     third-party     investors. The private equity, private debt and real           estate funds are primarily closed-end funds in which the     firms investments are not eligible for redemption.     Distributions will be received from these funds as the     underlying assets are liquidated and it is estimated that     substantially all of the underlying assets of existing funds     will be liquidated over the next 10 years. The firms     investments in hedge funds are generally redeemable on a     quarterly basis with 91 days notice, subject to a maximum     redemption level of 25% of the firms initial investments     at any quarter-end.

Derivatives     and Hedging Activities       Derivative     Activities          Derivatives are instruments that derive their value from     underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates and other     inputs, or a combination of these factors. Derivatives may be     privately negotiated contracts, which are usually referred to as     over-the-counter     (OTC) derivatives, or they may be listed and traded on an     exchange     (exchange-traded).     Market-Making.  As     a market maker, the firm enters into derivative transactions     with clients and other market participants to provide liquidity     and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of risk. In this     capacity, the firm typically acts as principal and is     consequently required to commit capital to provide execution. As     a market maker, it is essential to maintain an inventory of     financial instruments sufficient to meet expected client and     market demands.     Risk Management.  The firm also enters into     derivatives to actively manage risk exposures that arise from     market-making     and investing and lending activities in derivative and cash     instruments. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives     designated as hedges under U.S. GAAP. These derivatives are     used to manage foreign currency exposure on the net investment     in certain     non-U.S. operations     and to manage interest rate exposure in certain fixed-rate     unsecured     long-term     and     short-term     borrowings, and certificates of deposit.         The firm enters into various types of derivatives, including:                  Futures and Forwards.  Contracts that commit     counterparties to purchase or sell financial instruments,     commodities or currencies in the future.                         Swaps.  Contracts that require counterparties     to exchange cash flows such as currency or interest payment     streams. The amounts exchanged are based on the specific terms     of the contract with reference to specified rates, financial     instruments, commodities, currencies or indices.               Options.  Contracts in which the option     purchaser has the right but not the obligation to purchase from     or sell to the option writer financial instruments, commodities     or currencies within a defined time period for a specified price.           Derivatives are accounted for at fair value, net of cash     collateral received or posted under credit support agreements.     Derivatives are reported on a     net-by-counterparty     basis (i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative     assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) when a legal     right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement.     Derivative assets and liabilities are included in     Financial instruments owned, at fair value and     Financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased, at fair     value, respectively.         Substantially all gains and losses on derivatives not designated     as hedges under U.S. GAAP, are included in Market     making and Other principal transactions.                      126       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)            The table below presents the fair value of     exchange-traded     and OTC derivatives on a     net-by-counterparty     basis.

Level 1     Derivatives   Exchange-traded     derivatives fall within level 1 if they are actively traded     and are valued at their quoted market price.     Level 2     Derivatives       Level 2 derivatives include     exchange-traded     derivatives that are not actively traded and OTC derivatives for     which all significant valuation inputs are corroborated by     market evidence.         Level 2 exchange-traded derivatives are valued using models     that calibrate to market-clearing levels of OTC derivatives.     Inputs to the valuations of level 2 OTC derivatives can be     verified to     market-clearing     transactions, broker or dealer quotations or other alternative     pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.     Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations     (e.g., indicative or firm) and the relationship of recent     market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing     sources.         Where models are used, the selection of a particular model to     value an OTC derivative depends on the contractual terms of and     specific risks inherent in the instrument, as well as the     availability of pricing information in the market. Valuation     models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms,     market prices, yield curves, credit curves, measures of     volatility, prepayment rates, loss severity rates and     correlations of such inputs. For OTC derivatives that trade in     liquid markets, model selection does not involve significant     management judgment because outputs of models can be calibrated     to     market-clearing     levels.         Price transparency of OTC derivatives can generally be     characterized by product type.     Interest Rate.  In general, the prices and     other inputs used to value interest rate derivatives are     transparent, even for     long-dated     contracts. Interest rate swaps and options denominated in the     currencies of leading industrialized nations are characterized     by high           trading volumes and tight bid/offer spreads. Interest rate     derivatives that reference indices, such as an inflation index,     or the shape of the yield curve     (e.g., 10-year     swap rate vs.     2-year swap     rate), are more complex and are therefore less transparent, but     the prices and other inputs are generally observable.     Credit.  Price transparency for credit default     swaps, including both single names and baskets of credits,     varies by market and underlying reference entity or obligation.     Credit default swaps that reference indices, large corporates     and major sovereigns generally exhibit the most price     transparency. For credit default swaps with other underliers,     price transparency varies based on credit rating, the cost of     borrowing the underlying reference obligations, and the     availability of the underlying reference obligations for     delivery upon the default of the issuer. Credit default swaps     that reference loans,     asset-backed     securities and emerging market debt instruments tend to be less     transparent than those that reference corporate bonds. In     addition, more complex credit derivatives, such as those     sensitive to the correlation between two or more underlying     reference obligations, generally have less price transparency.     Currency.  Prices for currency derivatives     based on the exchange rates of leading industrialized nations,     including those with longer tenors, are generally transparent.     The primary difference between the transparency of developed and     emerging market currency derivatives is that emerging markets     tend to be observable for contracts with shorter tenors.     Commodity.  Commodity derivatives include     transactions referenced to energy (e.g., oil and natural     gas), metals (e.g., precious and base) and soft commodities     (e.g., agricultural). Price transparency varies based on     the underlying commodity, delivery location, tenor and product     quality (e.g., diesel fuel compared to unleaded gasoline).     In general, price transparency for commodity derivatives is     greater for contracts with shorter tenors and contracts that are     more closely aligned with major     and/or     benchmark commodity indices.                  128       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)           Equity.  Price transparency for equity     derivatives varies by market and underlier. Options on indices     and the common stock of corporates included in major equity     indices exhibit the most price transparency.     Exchange-traded     and OTC equity derivatives generally have observable market     prices, except for contracts with long tenors or reference     prices that differ significantly from current market prices.     More complex equity derivatives, such as those sensitive to the     correlation between two or more individual stocks, generally     have less price transparency.         Liquidity is essential to observability of all product types. If     transaction volumes decline, previously transparent prices and     other inputs may become unobservable. Conversely, even highly     structured products may at times have trading volumes large     enough to provide observability of prices and other inputs.     Level 3     Derivatives       Level 3 OTC derivatives are valued using models which     utilize observable level 1     and/or     level 2 inputs, as well as unobservable level 3 inputs.                      For the majority of the firms interest rate and currency     derivatives classified within level 3, the significant     unobservable inputs are correlations of certain currencies and     interest rates (e.g., the correlation of Japanese yen     foreign exchange rates to U.S. dollar interest rates).                  For credit derivatives classified within level 3,     significant level 3 inputs include     long-dated     credit                           and funding spreads as well as certain correlation inputs     required to value credit and mortgage derivatives     (e.g., the likelihood of default of the underlying     reference obligations relative to one another).                  For level 3 equity derivatives, significant level 3     inputs generally include equity volatility inputs for options     that are very     long-dated and/or have     strike prices that differ significantly from current market     prices. In addition, the valuation of certain structured trades     requires the use of level 3 inputs for the correlation of     the price performance for two or more individual stocks.                  For level 3 commodity derivatives, significant level 3     inputs include volatilities for options with strike prices that     differ significantly from current market prices and prices for     certain products for which the product quality is not aligned     with benchmark indices.           Subsequent to the initial valuation of a level 3 OTC     derivative, the firm updates the level 1 and level 2     inputs to reflect observable market changes and any resulting     gains and losses are recorded in level 3. Level 3     inputs are changed when corroborated by evidence such as similar     market transactions,     third-party     pricing services     and/or     broker or dealer quotations or other empirical market data. In     circumstances where the firm cannot verify the model value by     reference to market transactions, it is possible that a     different valuation model could produce a materially different     estimate of fair value.                  129       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)           Valuation     Adjustments       Valuation adjustments are integral to determining the fair value     of derivatives and are used to adjust the mid-market valuations,     produced by derivative pricing models, to the appropriate exit     price valuation. These adjustments incorporate bid/offer     spreads, the cost of liquidity on large or illiquid positions     and credit valuation adjustments (CVA) which account for the     credit risk inherent in derivative portfolios. Market-based     inputs are generally used when calibrating valuation adjustments     to     market-clearing     levels.         In addition, for derivatives that include significant     unobservable inputs, the firm makes model or exit           price adjustments to account for the valuation uncertainty     present in the transaction.      Fair Value of     Derivatives by Level       The tables below present the fair value of derivatives on a     gross basis by level and major product type. Gross fair values     in the tables below exclude the effects of both netting under     enforceable netting agreements and netting of cash received or     posted under credit support agreements both in and across levels     of the fair value hierarchy, and therefore are not     representative of the firms exposure.

Transfers between levels are reported     at the beginning of the reporting period in which they occur.     Accordingly, the table does not include gains or losses that     were reported in level 3           in prior periods for derivatives that were transferred out of     level 3 prior to the end of the period.

Primarily attributable to lower interest rates, which are     level 2 inputs, underlying certain credit derivatives.     These unrealized gains were substantially offset by unrealized     losses on currency, interest rate and credit derivatives     categorized in level 2, which economically hedge     level 3 derivatives.                   Significant transfers in and out of level 3 during the year     ended December 2010 included:                      Interest rates  net and Currencies  net:     net transfer into level 3 of $306 million and     $539 million, respectively, principally due to reduced     transparency of the correlation inputs used to value these     financial instruments.                  Credit  net: net transfer out of level 3 of     $1.06 billion, principally due to improved transparency of     correlation inputs used to value certain mortgage derivatives.           There were no significant transfers in and out of level 3     during the year ended December 2009.     Impact of Credit     Spreads on Derivatives       On an ongoing basis, the firm realizes gains or losses relating     to changes in credit risk on derivatives through changes in     credit mitigants or the sale or unwind of the contracts.         The net gain/(loss) attributable to the impact of changes in     credit exposure and credit spreads on derivatives           were $68 million, $572 million, $(137) million,     and $(188) million for the years ended December 2010,     December 2009, November 2008 and one month ended     December 2008, respectively.     Bifurcated     Embedded Derivatives       The table below presents derivatives, primarily equity and     interest rate products, that have been bifurcated from their     related borrowings. These derivatives are recorded at fair value     and included in Unsecured     short-term     borrowings and Unsecured     long-term     borrowings. See Note 8 for further information.

The table below     presents the aggregate fair value of net derivative liabilities     under such agreements (excluding application of collateral     posted to reduce these liabilities), the related aggregate fair     value of the assets posted as collateral, and the additional     collateral or termination payments that could have been called     at the reporting date by counterparties in the event of a     one-notch     and     two-notch     downgrade in the firms credit ratings.                                                            As of December     in millions       2010           2009                             Net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements        $   23,843               $       20,848                      Collateral posted            16,640                   14,475                      Additional collateral or termination payments for a     one-notch     downgrade            1,353                   1,117                      Additional collateral or termination payments for a     two-notch     downgrade            2,781                   2,364                                  Credit     Derivatives       The firm enters into a broad array of credit derivatives in     locations around the world to facilitate client transactions and     to manage the credit risk associated with market-making and     investing and lending activities. Credit derivatives are     actively managed based on the firms net risk position.         Credit derivatives are individually negotiated contracts and can     have various settlement and payment conventions. Credit events     include failure to pay, bankruptcy, acceleration of     indebtedness, restructuring, repudiation and dissolution of the     reference entity.         Credit Default Swaps.  Single-name credit     default swaps protect the buyer against the loss of principal on     one or more bonds, loans or mortgages (reference obligations) in     the event the issuer (reference entity) of the reference     obligations suffers a credit event. The buyer of protection pays     an initial or periodic premium to the seller and receives     protection for the period of the contract. If there is no credit     event, as defined in the contract, the seller of protection     makes no payments to the buyer of protection. However, if a     credit event occurs, the seller of protection is required to     make a payment, which is calculated in accordance with the terms     of the contract, to the buyer of protection.     Credit Indices, Baskets and Tranches.  Credit     derivatives may reference a basket of single-name credit default     swaps or a     broad-based     index. If a credit event occurs in one of the underlying     reference obligations, the protection seller pays the protection     buyer. The payment is typically a     pro-rata     portion of the transactions total notional amount based on     the underlying defaulted reference obligation. In certain     transactions, the credit risk of a basket or index is separated     into various portions (tranches) each having different levels of     subordination. The most junior tranches cover initial defaults     and once losses exceed the notional amount of these junior     tranches, any excess loss is covered by the next most senior     tranche in the capital structure.     Total Return Swaps.  A total return swap     transfers the risks relating to economic performance of a     reference obligation from the protection buyer to the protection     seller. Typically, the protection buyer receives from the     protection seller a floating-rate of interest and protection     against any reduction in fair value of the reference obligation,     and in return the protection seller receives the cash flows     associated with the reference obligation, plus any increase in     the fair value of the reference obligation.            135       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                   Credit Options.  In a credit option, the option     writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell a reference     obligation at a specified price or credit spread. The option     purchaser buys the right but not the obligation to sell the     reference obligation to, or purchase it from, the option writer.     The payments on credit options depend either on a particular     credit spread or the price of the reference obligation.         The firm economically hedges its exposure to written credit     derivatives primarily by entering into offsetting purchased     credit derivatives with identical underlyings. Substantially all     of the firms purchased credit derivative transactions are     with financial institutions and are subject to stringent     collateral thresholds. In addition, upon the occurrence of a     specified trigger event, the firm may take possession of the     reference obligations underlying a particular written credit     derivative, and consequently may, upon liquidation of the     reference obligations, recover amounts on the underlying     reference obligations in the event of default.         As of December 2010, written and purchased credit     derivatives had total gross notional amounts of     $2.05 trillion and $2.19 trillion, respectively, for     total           net notional purchased protection of $140.63 billion. As of     December 2009, written and purchased credit derivatives had     total gross notional amounts of $2.54 trillion and     $2.71 trillion, respectively, for total net notional     purchased protection of $164.13 billion.         The table below presents certain information about credit     derivatives.

To qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative hedge must be     highly effective at reducing the risk from the exposure being     hedged. Additionally, the firm must formally document the     hedging relationship at inception and test the hedging     relationship at least on a quarterly basis to ensure the     derivative hedge continues to be highly effective over the life     of the hedging relationship.     Interest Rate     Hedges       The firm designates certain interest rate swaps as fair value     hedges. These interest rate swaps hedge changes in fair value     attributable to the relevant benchmark interest rate     (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)), effectively     converting a substantial portion of fixed-rate obligations into     floating-rate obligations.         The firm applies the     long-haul     method in assessing the effectiveness of its fair value     hedging relationships in achieving offsetting changes in the     fair values of the hedging instrument and the risk being hedged     (i.e., interest rate risk).         During the three months ended March 2010, the firm changed     its method of prospectively and retrospectively assessing the     effectiveness of all of its fair value hedging relationships     from a     dollar-offset     method, which is a     non-statistical     method, to regression analysis, which is a statistical method.         An interest rate swap is considered highly effective in     offsetting changes in fair value attributable to changes in the     hedged risk when the regression analysis results in a     coefficient of determination of 80% or greater and a slope     between 80% and 125%.             The     dollar-offset     method compared the change in the fair value of the hedging     instrument to the change in the fair value of the hedged item,     excluding the effect of the passage of time. The prospective     dollar-offset     assessment used scenario analyses to test hedge effectiveness     through simulations of numerous parallel and slope shifts of the     relevant yield curve. Parallel shifts changed the interest rate     of all maturities by identical amounts. Slope shifts changed the     curvature of the yield curve. For both the prospective     assessment, in response to each of the simulated yield curve     shifts, and the retrospective assessment, a hedging relationship     was considered effective if the fair value of the hedging     instrument and the hedged item changed inversely within a range     of 80% to 125%.         For qualifying fair value hedges, gains or losses on derivatives     are included in Interest expense. The change in fair     value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged     is reported as an adjustment to its carrying value and is     subsequently amortized into interest expense over its remaining     life. Gains or losses resulting from hedge ineffectiveness are     included in Interest expense. See Note 23 for     further information about interest income and interest expense.          For the years ended December 2010 and December 2009     and one month ended December 2008, the gain/(loss)     recognized on interest rate derivatives accounted for as hedges     was $1.62 billion, $(10.07) billion and     $3.59 billion, respectively, and the related gain/(loss)     recognized on the hedged borrowings and bank deposits was     $(3.45) billion, $9.95 billion and     $(3.53) billion, respectively. The hedge ineffectiveness     recognized on these derivatives for the year ended     December 2010 was a loss of $1.84 billion. This loss     consisted primarily of the amortization of prepaid credit     spreads, and was not material for the year ended     December 2009 and one month ended December 2008. The     gain/(loss) excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness     was not material for the year ended December 2010 and one     month ended December 2008 and was a loss of     $1.23 billion for the year ended December 2009.            137       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)            Net Investment     Hedges       The firm seeks to reduce the impact of fluctuations in foreign     exchange rates on its net investment in certain     non-U.S. operations     through the use of foreign currency forward contracts and     foreign     currency-denominated     debt. For foreign currency forward contracts designated as     hedges, the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed based on the     overall changes in the fair value of the forward contracts     (i.e., based on changes in forward rates). For foreign     currency-denominated     debt designated as a hedge, the effectiveness of the hedge is     assessed based on changes in spot rates.         For qualifying net investment hedges, the gains or losses on the     hedging instruments, to the extent effective, are included in     the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.          The table below presents the gains/(losses) from net investment     hedging. The gains/(losses) below are included in Currency     translation adjustment, net of tax in the consolidated     statements of comprehensive income/(loss).

As of December 2010 and December 2009, the firm had     designated $3.88 billion and $3.38 billion,     respectively, of foreign     currency-denominated     debt, included in Unsecured     long-term     borrowings and Unsecured     short-term     borrowings, as hedges of net investments in     non-U.S. subsidiaries.           Note 8.  Fair     Value Option        Other Financial     Assets and Financial     Liabilities at Fair Value       In addition to all cash and derivative instruments included in     Financial instruments owned, at fair value and     Financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased, at fair     value, the firm has elected to account for certain of its     other financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value     under the fair value option.         The primary reasons for electing the fair value option are to:                      reflect economic events in earnings on a timely basis;                  mitigate volatility in earnings from using different measurement     attributes (e.g., transfers of financial instruments owned     accounted for as financings are recorded at fair value whereas     the related secured financing would be recorded on an accrual     basis absent electing the fair value option); and                  address simplification and     cost-benefit     considerations (e.g., accounting for hybrid financial     instruments at fair value in their entirety versus bifurcation     of embedded derivatives and hedge accounting for debt hosts).           Hybrid financial instruments are instruments that contain     bifurcatable embedded derivatives and do not require settlement     by physical delivery of     non-financial     assets (e.g., physical commodities). If the firm elects to     bifurcate the embedded derivative from the associated debt, the     derivative is accounted for at fair value and the host contract     is accounted for at amortized cost, adjusted for the effective     portion of any fair value hedges. If the firm does not elect to     bifurcate, the entire hybrid financial instrument is accounted     for at fair value under the fair value option.            138       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                       Other financial assets and financial liabilities accounted for     at fair value under the fair value option include:                      resale and repurchase agreements;                  securities borrowed and loaned within Fixed Income, Currency and     Commodities Client Execution;                  certain other secured financings, primarily transfers of assets     accounted for as financings rather than sales, debt raised     through the firms William Street credit extension program     and certain other nonrecourse financings;                  certain unsecured     short-term     borrowings, consisting of all promissory notes and commercial     paper and certain hybrid financial instruments;                  certain unsecured     long-term     borrowings, including prepaid commodity transactions and certain     hybrid financial instruments;                  certain receivables from customers and counterparties, including     certain margin loans, transfers of assets accounted for as     secured loans rather than purchases and prepaid variable share     forwards;                  certain insurance and reinsurance contract assets and     liabilities and certain guarantees;                  certain deposits issued by the firms bank subsidiaries, as     well as securities held by Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank     USA);                  certain subordinated liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs; and                  in general, investments acquired after     November 24, 2006, when the fair value option became     available, where the firm has significant influence over the     investee and would otherwise apply the equity method of     accounting.             These financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value     are generally valued based on discounted cash flow techniques,     which incorporate inputs with reasonable levels of price     transparency, and are generally classified as level 2     because the inputs are observable. Valuation adjustments may be     made for counterparty and the firms credit quality.         Significant inputs for each category of other financial assets     and financial liabilities at fair value are as follows:         Resale and Repurchase Agreements and Securities Borrowed and     Loaned.  The significant inputs to the valuation     of resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and     loaned are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows,     interest rates and collateral funding spreads. See Note 9     for further information.     Other Secured Financings.  The significant     inputs to the valuation of other secured financings at fair     value are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows,     interest rates, the fair value of the collateral delivered by     the firm (which is determined using the amount and timing of     expected future cash flows, market yields and recovery     assumptions), the frequency of additional collateral calls and     the credit spreads of the firm. See Note 9 for further     information.     Unsecured     Short-term     and     Long-term     Borrowings.  The significant inputs to the     valuation of unsecured     short-term     and     long-term     borrowings at fair value are the amount and timing of expected     future cash flows, interest rates, the credit spreads of the     firm, as well as commodity prices in the case of prepaid     commodity transactions and, for certain hybrid financial     instruments, equity prices, inflation rates and index levels.     See Notes 15 and 16 for further information.     Receivables from Customers and     Counterparties.  The significant inputs to the     valuation of certain receivables from customers and     counterparties are commodity prices, interest rates and the     amount and timing of expected future cash flows.     Insurance and Reinsurance Contracts.  Insurance     and reinsurance contracts at fair value are included in     Receivables from customers and counterparties and     Other liabilities and accrued expenses. These     contracts are valued using market transactions and other market     evidence where possible, including     market-based     inputs to models, calibration to     market-clearing     transactions or other alternative pricing sources with     reasonable levels of price transparency. Significant     level 2 inputs typically include interest rates and     inflation risk. Significant level 3 inputs typically     include mortality or funding benefit assumptions. When     unobservable inputs to a valuation model are significant to the     fair value measurement of an instrument, the instrument is     classified in level 3.            139       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                   Deposits.

Gains and Losses     on Other Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities at Fair     Value       The Fair Value Option columns in the table below     present the gains and losses recognized as a result of the firm     electing to apply the fair value option to certain financial     assets and financial liabilities. These gains and losses are     included in Market making and Other principal     transactions revenues.         The amounts in the table exclude contractual interest, which is     included in Interest income and Interest     expense, for all instruments other than hybrid financial     instruments. See Note 23 for further information about     interest income and interest expense. The table also excludes     gains and losses related to financial instruments owned, at fair     value and financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased, at     fair value.         Included in the Other columns in the table below are:                      Gains and losses on the embedded derivative component of hybrid     financial instruments included                           in unsecured     short-term     borrowings and unsecured     long-term     borrowings. These gains and losses would have been recognized     under other U.S. GAAP even if the firm had not elected to     account for the entire hybrid instrument at fair value.                  Gains and losses on secured financings related to transfers of     assets accounted for as financings rather than sales. These     gains and losses are offset by gains and losses on the related     instruments included in Financial instruments owned, at     fair value and Receivables from customers and     counterparties.                  Gains and losses on receivables from customers and     counterparties related to transfers of assets accounted for as     receivables rather than purchases. These gains and losses are     offset by gains and losses on the related financial instruments     included in Other secured financings.                  Gains and losses on subordinated liabilities issued by     consolidated VIEs. These gains and losses are offset by gains     and losses on the financial assets held by the consolidated VIEs.

The aggregate contractual principal exceeds the related fair     value primarily because the firm regularly purchases loans, such     as distressed loans, at values significantly below contractual     principal amounts.                   As of December 2010 and December 2009, the fair value     of unfunded lending commitments for which the fair value option     was elected was a liability of $1.26 billion and     $879 million, respectively, and the related total     contractual amount of these lending commitments was     $51.20 billion and $44.05 billion, respectively.     Long-term     Debt Instruments       The aggregate contractual principal amount of     long-term     debt instruments (principal and     non-principal     protected) for which the fair value option was elected exceeded     the related fair value by $701 million and     $752 million as of December 2010 and     December 2009, respectively. Of these amounts,     $349 million and $672 million as of December 2010     and December 2009, respectively, related to unsecured     long-term     borrowings and the remainder related to     long-term     other secured financings.         Impact of Credit     Spreads on Loans and     Lending Commitments       The net gains/(losses) attributable to changes in     instrument-specific credit spreads on loans and lending     commitments for which the fair value option was elected were     $1.85 billion, $1.65 billion, $(4.61) billion and     $(2.06) billion for the years ended December 2010,     December 2009 and November 2008 and one month ended     December 2008, respectively. Changes in the fair value of     floating-rate loans and lending commitments are attributable to     changes in instrument-specific credit spreads. For fixed-rate     loans and lending commitments the firm allocates changes in fair     value between interest rate-related changes and credit     spread-related changes based on changes in interest rates.     Impact of Credit     Spreads on Borrowings       The table below presents the net gains/(losses) attributable to     the impact of changes in the firms own credit spreads on     borrowings for which the fair value option was elected. The firm     calculates the fair value of borrowings by discounting future     cash flows at a rate which incorporates the firms credit     spreads.

Collateralized     Agreements and Financings                Collateralized agreements are securities purchased under     agreements to resell (resale agreements or reverse repurchase     agreements) and securities borrowed. Collateralized financings     are securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase     agreements), securities loaned and other secured financings. The     firm enters into these transactions in order to, among other     things, facilitate client activities, invest excess cash,     acquire securities to cover short positions and finance certain     firm activities.          Collateralized agreements and financings are presented on a     net-by-counterparty     basis when a legal right of setoff exists. Interest on     collateralized agreements and collateralized financings is     recognized over the life of the transaction and included in     Interest income and Interest expense,     respectively. See Note 23 for further information about     interest income and interest expense.          The table below presents the carrying value of resale and     repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and loaned     transactions.                                                            As of December     in millions       2010           2009                             Securities purchased under agreements to     resell 1        $   188,355               $       144,279                      Securities     borrowed 2            166,306                   189,939                      Securities sold under agreements to     repurchase 1            162,345                   128,360                      Securities     loaned 2            11,212                   15,207                                          1.        Resale and repurchase agreements are carried at fair value under     the fair value option. See Note 8 for further information     about the valuation techniques and significant inputs used to     determine fair value.          2.        As of December 2010 and December 2009,     $48.82 billion and $66.33 billion of securities     borrowed and $1.51 billion and $6.19 billion of     securities loaned were at fair value, respectively.        Resale and     Repurchase Agreements       A resale agreement is a transaction in which the firm purchases     financial instruments from a seller, typically in exchange for     cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to resell the     same or substantially the same financial instruments to the     seller at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date.             A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the firm sells     financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for     cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase     the same or substantially the same financial instruments from     the buyer at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future     date.         The financial instruments purchased or sold in resale and     repurchase agreements typically include U.S. government and     federal agency, and     investment-grade     sovereign obligations.         The firm receives financial instruments purchased under resale     agreements, makes delivery of financial instruments sold under     repurchase agreements, monitors the market value of these     financial instruments on a daily basis, and delivers or obtains     additional collateral due to changes in the market value of the     financial instruments, as appropriate. For resale agreements,     the firm typically requires delivery of collateral with a fair     value approximately equal to the carrying value of the relevant     assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition.          Even though repurchase and resale agreements involve the legal     transfer of ownership of financial instruments, they are     accounted for as financing arrangements because they require the     financial instruments to be repurchased or resold at the     maturity of the agreement. However, repos to     maturity are accounted for as sales. A repo to maturity is     a transaction in which the firm transfers a security that has     very little, if any, default risk under an agreement to     repurchase the security where the maturity date of the     repurchase agreement matches the maturity date of the underlying     security. Therefore, the firm effectively no longer has a     repurchase obligation and has relinquished control over the     underlying security and, accordingly, accounts for the     transaction as a sale. The firm had no such     transactions outstanding as of December 2010 or     December 2009.            142       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)           Securities     Borrowed and Loaned Transactions       In a securities borrowed transaction, the firm borrows     securities from a counterparty in exchange for cash. When the     firm returns the securities, the counterparty returns the cash.     Interest is generally paid periodically over the life of the     transaction.         In a securities loaned transaction, the firm lends securities to     a counterparty typically in exchange for cash or securities, or     a letter of credit. When the counterparty returns the     securities, the firm returns the cash or securities posted as     collateral. Interest is generally paid periodically over the     life of the transaction.         The firm receives securities borrowed, makes delivery of     securities loaned, monitors the market value of these securities     on a daily basis, and delivers or obtains additional collateral     due to changes in the market value of the securities, as     appropriate. For securities borrowed transactions, the firm     typically requires delivery of collateral with a fair value     approximately equal to the carrying value of the securities     borrowed transaction.          Securities borrowed and loaned within Fixed Income, Currency and     Commodities Client Execution, are recorded at fair value under     the fair value option.         Securities borrowed and loaned within Securities Services are     recorded based on the amount of cash collateral advanced or     received plus accrued interest. As these arrangements generally     can be terminated on demand, they exhibit little, if any,     sensitivity to changes in interest rates.          As of December 2010 and December 2009, the firm had     $12.86 billion and $3.95 billion, respectively, of     securities received under resale agreements and securities     borrowed transactions that were segregated to satisfy certain     regulatory requirements. These securities are included in     Cash and securities segregated for regulatory and other     purposes.          Other Secured     Financings       In addition to repurchase agreements and securities lending     transactions, the firm funds certain assets through the use of     other secured financings and pledges financial instruments and     other assets as collateral in these transactions. These other     secured financings consist of:                      debt raised through the firms William Street credit     extension program;                  liabilities of consolidated VIEs;                  transfers of assets accounted for as financings rather than     sales (primarily collateralized central bank financings, pledged     commodities, bank loans and mortgage whole loans); and                  other structured financing arrangements.           Other secured financings include arrangements that are     nonrecourse. As of December 2010 and December 2009,     nonrecourse other secured financings were $8.42 billion and     $10.63 billion, respectively.         The firm has elected to apply the fair value option to the     following other secured financings because the use of fair value     eliminates     non-economic     volatility in earnings that would arise from using different     measurement attributes:                      debt raised through the firms William Street credit     extension program;                  transfers of assets accounted for as financings rather than     sales; and                  certain other nonrecourse financings.           See Note 8 for further information about other secured     financings that are accounted for at fair value. Other secured     financings that are not recorded at fair value are recorded     based on the amount of cash received plus accrued interest,     which generally approximates fair value.               143       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)               The table below presents information about other secured     financings.

Securitization     Activities           The firm securitizes residential and commercial mortgages,     corporate bonds, loans and other types of financial assets by     selling these assets to securitization vehicles     (e.g., trusts, corporate entities, and limited liability     companies) and acts as underwriter of the beneficial interests     that are sold to investors. The firms residential mortgage     securitizations are substantially all in connection with     government agency securitizations.         Beneficial interests issued by securitization entities are debt     or equity securities that give the investors rights to receive     all or portions of specified cash inflows to a securitization     vehicle and include senior and subordinated shares of principal,     interest     and/or other     cash inflows. The proceeds from the sale of beneficial interests     are used to pay the transferor for the financial assets sold to     the securitization vehicle or to purchase securities which serve     as collateral.          The firm accounts for a securitization as a sale when it has     relinquished control over the transferred assets. Prior to     securitization, the firm accounts for assets pending transfer at     fair value and therefore does not typically recognize gains or     losses upon the transfer of assets. Net revenues from     underwriting activities are recognized in connection with the     sales of the underlying beneficial interests to investors.         For transfers of assets that are not accounted for as sales, the     assets remain in Financial instruments owned, at fair     value and the transfer is accounted for as a     collateralized financing, with the related interest expense     recognized over the life of the transaction. See Notes 9     and 23 for further information about collateralized financings     and interest expense, respectively.          The firm generally receives cash in exchange for the transferred     assets but may also have continuing involvement with transferred     assets, including beneficial interests in securitized financial     assets, primarily in the form of senior or subordinated     securities, and servicing rights that the firm retains at the     time of securitization. The firm may also purchase senior or     subordinated securities issued by securitization vehicles (which     are typically VIEs) in connection with secondary     market-making     activities.            145       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)               Beneficial interests and other interests from the firms     continuing involvement with securitization vehicles are     accounted for at fair value and are included in Financial     instruments owned, at fair value and are generally     classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See     Notes 5 through 8 for further information about fair value     measurements.         The table below presents the amount of financial assets     securitized and the cash flows received on retained interests in     securitization entities in which the firm had continuing     involvement.

During the     year ended November 2008, cash flows received on retained     interests were $505 million.             During the one month ended December 2008, the firm     securitized $604 million of financial assets in which the     firm had continuing involvement, including $557 million of     residential mortgages and $47 million of other financial     assets. During the one month ended December 2008, cash     flows received on retained interests were $26 million.

The carrying value of these derivatives and guarantees was a net     liability of $98 million and $87 million as of     December 2010 and December 2009, respectively. The     notional amounts of these derivatives and guarantees are     included in           maximum exposure to loss in the nonconsolidated VIE tables in     Note 11.

Due to the nature and current fair value of certain of these     retained interests, the weighted average assumptions for     constant prepayment and discount rates and the related     sensitivity to adverse changes are not meaningful as of     December 2010 and December 2009. The firms     maximum exposure to adverse changes in the value of these     interests is the carrying value of $62 million and     $93 million as of December 2010 and     December 2009, respectively.          2.        Constant prepayment rate is included only for positions for     which constant prepayment rate is a key assumption in the     determination of fair value.          3.        The majority of     mortgage-backed     retained interests are U.S. government     agency-issued     collateralized mortgage obligations, for which there is no     anticipated credit loss. For the remainder of retained     interests, the expected credit loss assumptions are reflected in     the discount rate.                   The preceding table does not give effect to the offsetting     benefit of other financial instruments that are held to mitigate     risks inherent in these retained interests. Changes in fair     value based on an adverse variation in assumptions generally     cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in     assumptions to the change in fair value is not usually             linear. In addition, the impact of a change in a particular     assumption in the preceding table is calculated independently of     changes in any other assumption. In practice, simultaneous     changes in assumptions might magnify or counteract the     sensitivities disclosed above.                  147       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)          Note 11.  Variable     Interest Entities              VIEs generally finance the purchase of assets by issuing debt     and equity securities that are either collateralized by or     indexed to the assets held by the VIE. The debt and equity     securities issued by a VIE may include tranches of varying     levels of subordination. The firms involvement with VIEs     includes securitization of financial assets, as described in     Note 10, and investments in and loans to other types of     VIEs, as described below. See Note 10 for additional     information about securitization activities, including the     definition of beneficial interests. See Note 3 for the     firms consolidation policies, including the definition of     a VIE.         The firm is principally involved with VIEs through the following     business activities:     Mortgage-Backed     VIEs and Corporate CDO and CLO VIEs.  The firm     sells residential and commercial mortgage loans and securities     to     mortgage-backed     VIEs and corporate bonds and loans to corporate CDO and CLO VIEs     and may retain beneficial interests in the assets sold to these     VIEs. The firm purchases and sells beneficial interests issued     by     mortgage-backed     and corporate CDO and CLO VIEs in connection with     market-making     activities. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives     with certain of these VIEs, primarily interest rate swaps, which     are typically not variable interests. The firm generally enters     into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk     from derivatives with these VIEs.         Certain     mortgage-backed     and corporate CDO and CLO VIEs, usually referred to as synthetic     CDOs or     credit-linked     note VIEs, synthetically create the exposure for the     beneficial interests they issue by entering into credit     derivatives, rather than purchasing the underlying assets. These     credit derivatives may reference a single asset, an index, or a     portfolio/basket of assets or indices. See Note 7 for     further information on credit derivatives. These VIEs use the     funds from the sale of beneficial interests and the premiums     received from credit derivative counterparties to purchase     securities which serve to collateralize the beneficial interest     holders     and/or the     credit derivative counterparty. These VIEs may enter into other     derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps, which are typically     not variable interests. The firm may be a counterparty to     derivatives with these VIEs and generally enters into     derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk.         Real Estate,     Credit-Related     and Other Investing VIEs.  The firm purchases     equity and debt securities issued by and makes loans to VIEs     that hold real estate, performing and nonperforming debt,     distressed loans and equity securities.     Other     Asset-Backed     VIEs.  The firm structures VIEs that issue notes     to clients and purchases and sells beneficial interests issued     by other     asset-backed     VIEs in connection with     market-making     activities. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives     with certain other     asset-backed     VIEs, primarily total return swaps on the collateral assets held     by these VIEs under which the firm pays the VIE the return due     to the note holders and receives the return on the collateral     assets owned by the VIE. The firm generally can be removed as     the total return swap counterparty. The firm generally enters     into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk     from derivatives with these VIEs. The firm typically does not     sell assets to the other     asset-backed     VIEs it structures.     Power-Related VIEs.  The firm purchases debt     and equity securities issued by and may provide guarantees to     VIEs that hold power-related assets. The firm typically does not     sell assets to or enter into derivatives with these VIEs.     Investment Funds.  The firm purchases equity     securities issued by and may provide guarantees to certain of     the investment funds it manages. The firm typically does not     sell assets to or enter into derivatives with these VIEs.     Principal-Protected Note VIEs.  The firm     structures VIEs that issue principal-protected notes to clients.     These VIEs own portfolios of assets, principally with exposure     to hedge funds. Substantially all of the principal protection on     the notes issued by these VIEs is provided by the asset     portfolio rebalancing that is required under the terms of the     notes. The firm enters into total return swaps with these VIEs     under which the firm pays the VIE the return due to the     principal-protected note holders and receives the return on the     assets owned by the VIE. The firm may enter into derivatives     with other counterparties to mitigate the risk it has from the     derivatives it enters into with these VIEs. The firm also     obtains funding through these VIEs. These VIEs were consolidated     by the firm upon adoption of changes to U.S. GAAP on     January 1, 2010. See Recent Accounting     Developments in Note 3 for further information.            148       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                   Municipal Bond Securitizations.  The firm sells     municipal securities to VIEs that issue     short-term     qualifying     tax-exempt     securities. The firm consolidates these VIEs because it owns the     residual interests, which allows the firm to make decisions that     significantly impact the economic performance of these VIEs.     VIE Consolidation     Analysis       A variable interest in a VIE is an investment (e.g., debt     or equity securities) or other interest (e.g., derivatives     or loans and lending commitments) in a VIE that will absorb     portions of the VIEs expected losses or receive portions     of the VIEs expected residual returns.         The firms variable interests in VIEs include senior and     subordinated debt in residential and commercial     mortgage-backed     and other     asset-backed     securitization entities, CDOs and CLOs; loans and lending     commitments; limited and general partnership interests;     preferred and common equity; derivatives that may include     foreign currency, equity     and/or     credit risk; guarantees; and certain of the fees the firm     receives from investment funds. Certain interest rate, foreign     currency and credit derivatives the firm enters into with VIEs     are not variable interests because they create rather than     absorb risk.          The enterprise with a controlling financial interest in a VIE is     known as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. The     firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE     by performing an analysis that principally considers:                      which variable interest holder has the power to direct the     activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the     VIEs economic performance;                  which variable interest holder has the obligation to absorb     losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could     potentially be significant to the VIE;                  the VIEs purpose and design, including the risks the VIE     was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest     holders;                  the VIEs capital structure;                  the terms between the VIE and its variable interest holders and     other parties involved with the VIE; and                  related party relationships.           The firm reassesses its initial evaluation of whether an entity     is a VIE when certain reconsideration events occur. The firm     reassesses its determination of whether it is the primary     beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on current facts     and circumstances.          Nonconsolidated     VIEs       The firms exposure to the obligations of VIEs is generally     limited to its interests in these entities. In certain     instances, the firm provides guarantees, including derivative     guarantees, to VIEs or holders of variable interests in VIEs.         The tables below present information about nonconsolidated VIEs     in which the firm holds variable interests. Nonconsolidated VIEs     are aggregated based on principal business activity. The nature     of the firms variable interests can take different forms,     as described in the rows under maximum exposure to loss. In the     tables below:                      The maximum exposure to loss excludes the benefit of offsetting     financial instruments that are held to mitigate the risks     associated with these variable interests.                  For retained and purchased interests and loans and investments,     the maximum exposure to loss is the carrying value of these     interests.                  For commitments and guarantees, and derivatives, the maximum     exposure to loss is the notional amount, which does not     represent anticipated losses and also has not been reduced by     unrealized losses already recorded. As a result, the maximum     exposure to loss exceeds liabilities recorded for commitments     and guarantees, and derivatives provided to VIEs.           For December 2010, the table includes nonconsolidated VIEs     in which the firm holds variable interests (and to which the     firm sold assets and has continuing involvement as of     December 2010) that were formerly considered to be     QSPEs prior to the changes in U.S. GAAP on     January 1, 2010.

The aggregate amounts include $4.52 billion and     $4.66 billion as of December 2010 and     December 2009, respectively, related to guarantees and     derivative transactions with VIEs to which the firm transferred     assets.          2.        Assets in VIE and maximum exposure to loss include     $6.14 billion and $3.25 billion, respectively, related     to CDOs backed by mortgage obligations as of December 2010.          3.        Assets in VIE, carrying value of liabilities and maximum     exposure to loss exclude $3.97 billion associated with     guarantees related to the firms performance under     borrowings from these VIEs, which are recorded as liabilities.     Substantially all of the $1.36 billion of liabilities     relate to additional borrowings from these VIEs.            150       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)        Consolidated     VIEs          The tables below present the carrying amount and classification     of assets and liabilities in consolidated VIEs, excluding the     benefit of offsetting financial instruments that are held to     mitigate the risks associated with the firms variable     interests. Consolidated VIEs are aggregated based on principal     business activity and their assets and liabilities are presented     net of intercompany eliminations. The majority of the assets in     principal-protected notes VIEs are intercompany and are     eliminated in consolidation.         Substantially all the assets in consolidated VIEs can only be     used to settle obligations of the VIE.         For December 2010, the table below excludes VIEs in which     the firm holds a majority voting interest if (i) the VIE     meets the definition of a business and (ii) the VIEs     assets can be used for purposes other than the           settlement of its obligations. For December 2009, prior to     the changes in U.S. GAAP, the table below excludes VIEs in     which the firm holds a majority voting interest unless the     activities of the VIE are primarily related to securitization,     asset-backed     financings or single-lessee leasing arrangements. The increase     in total assets of consolidated VIEs from December 2009 to     December 2010 is primarily related to (i) VIEs that     are required to be disclosed in accordance with ASU     No. 2009-17     but that were not required to be disclosed under previous     U.S. GAAP, and (ii) VIEs that were consolidated by the     firm upon adoption of changes in U.S. GAAP. See     Recent Accounting Developments in Note 3 for     further information. The liabilities of real estate,     credit-related     and other investing VIEs and CDOs,     mortgage-backed     and other     asset-backed     VIEs do not have recourse to the general credit of the firm.

The reorganization of the firms segments in 2010 resulted     in the reallocation of assets, including goodwill, and     liabilities across reporting units. See Note 27 for further     information on segments.          Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if     events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment     may exist.         The goodwill impairment test consists of two steps.                      The first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit     with its estimated net book value (including goodwill and     identified intangible assets). If the reporting units fair     value exceeds its estimated net book value, goodwill is not     impaired.                  If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its     estimated net book value, the second step of the goodwill     impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment     loss, if any. An impairment loss is equal to the excess of the     carrying amount of goodwill over its fair value.            Goodwill was tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of     2010 and no impairment was identified.         To estimate the fair value of each reporting unit, both relative     value and residual income valuation techniques are used because     the firm believes market participants would use these techniques     to value the firms reporting units.         Relative value techniques apply average observable     price-to-earnings     multiples of comparable competitors to certain reporting     units net earnings. For other reporting units, fair value     is estimated using     price-to-book     multiples based on residual income techniques, which compare     excess reporting unit returns on equity to the firms cost     of equity capital over a     long-term     stable growth period. The net book value of each reporting unit     reflects the estimated amount of shareholders equity     required to support the activities of the reporting unit.                  153       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)        Identifiable     Intangible Assets          The table below presents the gross carrying amount, accumulated     amortization and net carrying amount of           identifiable intangible assets and their weighted average     remaining lives.

Amortization expense for identifiable intangible     assets is included in Depreciation and amortization.          The table below presents amortization expense for identifiable     intangible assets for the periods presented, and the estimated     future amortization expense through 2015 for identifiable     intangible assets as of December 2010.                                        in millions                                Amortization expense:                                   One month ended December 2008            $       39                      2008                240                      2009                96                      2010 1            520                  Estimated future amortization expense:                                   2011            258                      2012            246                      2013            231                      2014            202                      2015            169                                          1.        Includes an impairment loss of $305 million on the     firms NYSE DMM rights.             Identifiable intangible assets are tested for recoverability     whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an     assets or asset groups carrying value may not be     recoverable.             If a recoverability test is necessary, the carrying value of an     asset or asset group is compared to the total of the     undiscounted cash flows expected to be received over the     remaining useful life and from the disposition of the asset or     asset group.                      If the total of the undiscounted cash flows exceeds the carrying     value, the asset or asset group is not impaired.                  If the total of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the     carrying value, the asset or asset group is not fully     recoverable and an impairment loss is recognized as the     difference between the carrying amount of the asset or asset     group and its estimated fair value.            During the fourth quarter of 2010, as a result of continuing     weak operating results in the firms NYSE DMM business, the     firm tested its NYSE DMM rights for impairment in accordance     with ASC 360. Because the carrying value of the firms NYSE     DMM rights exceeded the projected undiscounted cash flows over     the estimated remaining useful life of the firms NYSE DMM     rights, the firm determined that the rights were impaired. The     firm recorded an impairment loss of $305 million, which was     included in Depreciation and amortization in the     firms Institutional Client Services segment in the fourth     quarter of 2010. This impairment loss represented the excess of     the carrying value of the firms NYSE DMM rights over their     estimated fair value. The firm estimated this fair value, which     is a level 3 measurement, using a relative value analysis     which incorporated a comparison to another DMM portfolio that     was transacted between third parties.                  155       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)          Note 14.

In the table below:                      unsecured     long-term     borrowings maturing within one year of the financial statement     date and unsecured     long-term     borrowings that are redeemable within one year of the financial     statement date at the option of the holder are included as     unsecured     short-term     borrowings;                  unsecured     long-term     borrowings that are repayable prior to maturity at the option of     the firm are reflected at their contractual maturity dates; and                            unsecured     long-term     borrowings that are redeemable prior to maturity at the option     of the holder are reflected at the dates such options become     exercisable.           The aggregate contractual principal amount of unsecured     long-term     borrowings (principal and     non-principal     protected) for which the fair value option was elected exceeded     the related fair value by $349 million and     $672 million as of December 2010 and     December 2009, respectively.

Amount includes an increase of $8.86 billion to the     carrying amount of certain unsecured     long-term     borrowings related to hedge accounting. The amounts related to     the carrying value of unsecured     long-term     borrowings associated with the effect of hedge accounting by     year of maturity are as follows: $532 million in 2012,     $750 million in 2013, $839 million in 2014,     $382 million in 2015, $6.36 billion in 2016 and     thereafter.                   The firm designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges to     effectively convert a substantial portion of its fixed-rate     unsecured     long-term     borrowings which are not accounted for at fair value into     floating-rate obligations. Accordingly, excluding the cumulative     impact of changes in the firms credit spreads, the     carrying value of unsecured     long-term     borrowings approximated fair value as of December 2010 and     December 2009. For unsecured     long-term     borrowings for which the firm did not elect the fair value     option, the           cumulative impact due to changes in the firms own credit     spreads would be a reduction in the carrying value of total     unsecured     long-term     borrowings of less than 1% as of both December 2010 and     December 2009. See Note 7 for further information     about hedging activities.         The table below presents unsecured     long-term     borrowings, after giving effect to hedging activities that     converted a substantial portion of fixed-rate obligations to     floating-rate obligations.

As of December 2010, the par amount and carrying amount     include $13.81 billion and $16.44 billion,     respectively, of subordinated debt issued by Group Inc. As     of December 2009, the par amount and carrying amount     include $13.78 billion and $15.30 billion,     respectively, of subordinated debt issued by Group Inc.        Junior     Subordinated Debt          Junior Subordinated Debt Issued to APEX     Trusts.  In 2007, Group Inc. issued a total     of $2.25 billion of remarketable junior subordinated debt     to Goldman Sachs Capital II and Goldman Sachs     Capital III (APEX Trusts), Delaware statutory trusts. The     APEX Trusts issued $2.25 billion of guaranteed perpetual     Normal Automatic Preferred Enhanced Capital Securities (APEX) to     third parties and a de minimis amount of common securities to     Group Inc. Group Inc. also entered into contracts with     the APEX Trusts to sell $2.25 billion of Group Inc.     perpetual     non-cumulative     preferred stock (the stock purchase contracts).         The APEX Trusts are wholly owned finance subsidiaries of the     firm for regulatory and legal purposes but are not consolidated     for accounting purposes.         The firm accounted for the stock purchase contracts as equity     instruments and, accordingly, recorded the cost of the stock     purchase contracts as a reduction to additional     paid-in     capital. See Note 19 for information           on the preferred stock that Group Inc. will issue in     connection with the stock purchase contracts.         The firm pays interest     semi-annually     on $1.75 billion of junior subordinated debt issued to     Goldman Sachs Capital II at a fixed annual rate of 5.59%     and the debt matures on June 1, 2043. The firm pays     interest quarterly on $500 million of junior subordinated     debt issued to Goldman Sachs Capital III at a rate per     annum equal to     three-month     LIBOR plus 0.57% and the debt matures on     September 1, 2043. In addition, the firm makes     contract payments at a rate of 0.20% per annum on the stock     purchase contracts held by the APEX Trusts.         The firm has the right to defer payments on the junior     subordinated debt and the stock purchase contracts, subject to     limitations, and therefore cause payment on the APEX to be     deferred. During any such extension period, the firm will not be     permitted to, among other things, pay dividends on or make     certain repurchases of its common or preferred stock.                  159       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)               In connection with the APEX issuance, the firm covenanted in     favor of certain of its debtholders, who were initially and are     currently the holders of Group Inc.s 6.345% Junior     Subordinated Debentures due February 15, 2034, that,     subject to certain exceptions, the firm would not redeem or     purchase (i) Group Inc.s junior subordinated     debt issued to the APEX Trusts prior to the applicable stock     purchase date or (ii) APEX or shares of     Group Inc.s perpetual     Non-Cumulative     Preferred Stock, Series E (Series E Preferred Stock)     or perpetual     Non-Cumulative     Preferred Stock, Series F (Series F Preferred Stock)     prior to the date that is ten years after the applicable stock     purchase date, unless the applicable redemption or purchase     price does not exceed a maximum amount determined by reference     to the aggregate amount of net cash proceeds that the firm has     received from the sale of qualifying equity securities during     the 180-day     period preceding the redemption or purchase.     Junior Subordinated Debt Issued in Connection with     Trust Preferred Securities.  Group Inc.     issued $2.84 billion of junior subordinated debentures in     2004 to Goldman Sachs Capital I (Trust), a Delaware     statutory trust. The Trust issued $2.75 billion of     guaranteed preferred beneficial interests to third           parties and $85 million of common beneficial interests to     Group Inc. and used the proceeds from the issuances to     purchase the junior subordinated debentures from Group Inc.     The Trust is a wholly owned finance subsidiary of the firm for     regulatory and legal purposes but is not consolidated for     accounting purposes.         The firm pays interest     semi-annually     on the debentures at an annual rate of 6.345% and the debentures     mature on February 15, 2034. The coupon rate and the     payment dates applicable to the beneficial interests are the     same as the interest rate and payment dates for the debentures.     The firm has the right, from time to time, to defer payment of     interest on the debentures, and, therefore, cause payment on the     Trusts preferred beneficial interests to be deferred, in     each case up to ten consecutive     semi-annual     periods.

Separate account     assets are included in Cash and securities segregated for     regulatory and other purposes.         Liabilities for future benefits and unpaid claims include     liabilities arising from reinsurance provided by the firm to     other insurers. The firm had a receivable of $1.26 billion     and $1.29 billion as of December 2010 and     December 2009, respectively, related to such reinsurance     contracts, which is reported in Receivables from customers     and counterparties. In addition, the firm has ceded risks     to reinsurers related to certain of its liabilities for future     benefits and unpaid claims and had a receivable of     $839 million and $870 million as of December 2010     and December 2009,             respectively, related to such reinsurance contracts, which is     reported in Receivables from customers and     counterparties. Contracts to cede risks to reinsurers do     not relieve the firm of its obligations to contract holders.     Liabilities for future benefits and unpaid claims include     $2.05 billion and $1.84 billion carried at fair value     under the fair value option as of December 2010 and     December 2009, respectively.         Reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits     represent a liability for the expected value of guaranteed     benefits in excess of projected annuity account balances. These     reserves are based on total payments expected to be made less     total fees expected to be assessed over the life of the contract.                  161       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)          Note 18.

Commitments to extend credit are presented net of amounts     syndicated to third parties.          2.        These agreements generally settle within three business days.          3.        Consists of commitments under letters of credit issued by     various banks which the firm provides to counterparties in lieu     of securities or cash to satisfy various collateral and margin     deposit requirements.            Commitments to     Extend Credit            The firms commitments to extend credit are agreements to     lend with fixed termination dates and depend on the satisfaction     of all contractual conditions to borrowing. The total commitment     amount does not necessarily reflect actual future cash flows     because the firm may syndicate all or substantial portions of     these commitments and commitments can expire unused or be     reduced or cancelled at the counterpartys request.          The firm generally accounts for commitments to extend credit at     fair value. Losses, if any, are generally recorded, net of any     fees in Other principal transactions.      Commercial Lending.  The firms commercial     lending commitments are generally extended in connection with     contingent acquisition financing and other types of corporate     lending as well as commercial real estate financing. Commitments     that are extended for contingent acquisition financing are often     intended to be     short-term     in nature, as borrowers often seek to replace them with other     funding sources.         William Street Credit Extension     Program.  Substantially all of the commitments     provided under the William Street credit extension program are     to     investment-grade     corporate borrowers. Commitments under the program are     principally extended by William Street Commitment Corporation     (Commitment Corp.), a consolidated wholly owned subsidiary of     GS Bank USA, GS Bank USA, and other subsidiaries of     GS Bank USA. The commitments extended by Commitment Corp.     are supported, in part, by funding raised by William Street     Funding Corporation (Funding Corp.), another consolidated wholly     owned subsidiary of GS Bank USA.         The assets and liabilities of Commitment Corp. and Funding Corp.     are legally separated from other assets and liabilities of the     firm. The assets of Commitment Corp. and of Funding Corp. will     not be available to their respective shareholders until the     claims of their respective creditors have been paid. In     addition, no affiliate of either Commitment Corp. or Funding     Corp., except in limited cases as expressly agreed in writing,     is responsible for any obligation of either entity.            162       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)               Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG) provides the firm     with credit loss protection that is generally limited to 95% of     the first loss the firm realizes on approved loan commitments,     up to a maximum of approximately $950 million, with respect     to most of the William Street commitments. In addition, subject     to the satisfaction of certain conditions, upon the firms     request, SMFG will provide protection for 70% of additional     losses on such commitments, up to a maximum of     $1.13 billion, of which $375 million of protection had     been provided as of both December 2010 and     December 2009. The firm also uses other financial     instruments to mitigate credit risks related to certain William     Street commitments not covered by SMFG.     Warehouse Financing.  The firm provides     financing to clients who warehouse financial assets. These     arrangements are secured by the warehoused assets, primarily     consisting of residential and commercial mortgages.     Contingent and     Forward Starting Resale and Securities Borrowing     Agreements/Forward Starting Repurchase and Securities Lending     Agreements       The firm enters into resale and securities borrowing agreements     and repurchase and securities lending agreements that settle at     a future date. The firm also enters into commitments to provide     contingent financing to its clients through resale agreements.     The firms funding of these commitments depends on the     satisfaction of all contractual conditions to the resale     agreement and these commitments can expire unused.         Investment     Commitments       The firms investment commitments consist of commitments to     invest in private equity, real estate and other assets directly     and through funds that the firm raises and manages. These     commitments include $1.97 billion and $2.46 billion as     of December 2010 and December 2009, respectively,     related to real estate private investments and     $9.12 billion and $10.78 billion as of     December 2010 and December 2009, respectively, related     to corporate and other private investments. Of these amounts,     $10.10 billion and $11.38 billion as of     December 2010 and December 2009, respectively, relate     to commitments to invest in funds managed by the firm, which     will be funded at market value on the date of investment.     Leases       The firm has contractual obligations under     long-term     noncancelable lease agreements, principally for office space,     expiring on various dates through 2069. Certain agreements are     subject to periodic escalation provisions for increases in real     estate taxes and other charges. The table below presents future     minimum rental payments, net of minimum sublease rentals.                                                As of                  in millions       December 2010                             2011        $   528                      2012            412                      2013            340                      2014            311                      2015            279                      2016-thereafter            1,520                              Total        $   3,390                                      Rent charged to operating expense for the years ended     December 2010, December 2009 and December 2008     was $508 million, $434 million and $438 million,     respectively.          Operating leases include office space held in excess of current     requirements. Rent expense relating to space held for growth is     included in Occupancy in the consolidated statements     of earnings. The firm records a liability, based on the fair     value of the remaining lease rentals reduced by any potential or     existing sublease rentals, for leases where the firm has ceased     using the space and management has concluded that the firm will     not derive any future economic benefits. Costs to terminate a     lease before the end of its term are recognized and measured at     fair value on termination.             163       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)              Contingencies        Legal Proceedings.  See Note 30 for     information on legal proceedings, including certain     mortgage-related     matters.     Certain     Mortgage-Related     Contingencies.  There are multiple areas of focus     by regulators, governmental agencies and others within the     mortgage market that may impact originators, issuers, servicers     and investors. There remains significant uncertainty surrounding     the nature and extent of any potential exposure for participants     in this market.                  Representations and Warranties.  The firm was     not a significant originator of residential mortgage loans. The     firm did purchase loans originated by others and generally     received     loan-level     representations of the type described below from the     originators. During the period 2005 through 2008, the firm sold     approximately $10 billion of loans to government-sponsored     enterprises and approximately $11 billion of loans to other     third parties. In addition, the firm transferred loans to trusts     and other mortgage securitization vehicles. As of     December 2010, the outstanding balance of the loans     transferred to trusts and other mortgage securitization vehicles     during the period 2005 through 2008 was approximately     $49 billion. This amount reflects paydowns and cumulative     losses of approximately $76 billion ($14 billion of     which are cumulative losses). A small number of these Goldman     Sachs-issued securitizations with an outstanding principal     balance of $739 million and total paydowns and cumulative     losses of $1.32 billion ($410 million of which are     cumulative losses) were structured with credit protection     obtained from monoline insurers. In connection with both sales     of loans and securitizations, the firm provided loan level     representations of the type described below     and/or     assigned the loan level representations from the party from whom     the firm purchased the loans.           The loan level representations made in connection with the sale     or securitization of mortgage loans varied among transactions     but were generally detailed representations applicable to each     loan in the portfolio and addressed matters relating to the     property, the borrower and the note. These representations     generally included, but were not limited to, the following:     (i) certain attributes of the borrowers financial     status;     (ii) loan-to-value     ratios,           owner occupancy status and certain other characteristics of the     property; (iii) the lien position; (iv) the fact that     the loan was originated in compliance with law; and     (v) completeness of the loan documentation.         To date, repurchase claims and actual repurchases of residential     mortgage loans based upon alleged breaches of representations     have not been significant and have mainly involved     government-sponsored     enterprises. During the year ended December 2010, the firm     incurred an immaterial loss on the repurchase of less than     $50 million of loans. As of December 2010, outstanding     repurchase claims were not material.         Ultimately, the firms exposure to claims for repurchase of     residential mortgage loans based on alleged breaches of     representations will depend on a number of factors including the     following: (i) the extent to which these claims are     actually made; (ii) the extent to which there are     underlying breaches of representations that give rise to valid     claims for repurchase; (iii) in the case of loans     originated by others, the extent to which the firm could be held     liable and, if it is, the firms ability to pursue and     collect on any claims against the parties who made     representations to the firm;     (iv) macro-economic     factors, including developments in the residential real estate     market; and (v) legal and regulatory developments.         Based upon the large number of defaults in residential     mortgages, including those sold or securitized by the firm,     there is a potential for increasing claims for repurchases.     However, the firm is not in a position to make a meaningful     estimate of that exposure at this time.                  Foreclosure and Other Mortgage Loan Servicing Practices and     Procedures.  The firm has received a number of     requests for information from regulators and other agencies,     including state attorneys general and banking regulators, as     part of an     industry-wide     focus on the practices of lenders and servicers in connection     with foreclosure proceedings and other aspects of mortgage loan     servicing practices and procedures. The requests seek     information about the foreclosure and servicing protocols and     activities of Litton Loan Servicing LP (Litton), the firms     residential mortgage servicing subsidiary, and any deviations     therefrom. The firm is cooperating with the requests and is     reviewing                 164       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                             Littons practices in this area. These inquiries may result     in the imposition of fines or other regulatory action. Litton     temporarily suspended evictions and foreclosure and real estate     owned sales in a number of states, including those with judicial     foreclosure procedures. Litton has recently resumed some of     these activities. As of the date of this filing, the firm is not     aware of foreclosures where the underlying foreclosure decision     was not warranted. As of December 2010, the value of the     firms mortgage servicing rights was not material and any     impact on their value would not be material to the firm.     Similarly, at this time the firm does not expect the suspension     of evictions and foreclosure and real estate owned sales to lead     to a material increase in its mortgage servicing-related     advances.       Guaranteed Minimum Death and Income     Benefits.  In connection with its insurance     business, the firm is contingently liable to provide guaranteed     minimum death and income benefits to certain contract holders     and has established a reserve related to $6.11 billion and     $6.35 billion of contract holder account balances as of     December 2010 and December 2009, respectively, for     such benefits. The weighted average attained age of these     contract holders was 69 years and 68 years as of     December 2010 and December 2009, respectively.         The net amount at risk, representing guaranteed minimum death     and income benefits in excess of contract holder account     balances, was $1.60 billion and $1.96 billion as of     December 2010 and December 2009, respectively. See     Note 17 for further information about insurance liabilities.     Guarantees       The firm enters into various derivatives that meet the     definition of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP, including     written equity and commodity put options, written currency     contracts and interest rate caps, floors and swaptions.     Disclosures about derivatives are not required if they may be     cash settled and the firm has           no basis to conclude it is probable that the counterparties held     the underlying instruments at inception of the contract. The     firm has concluded that these conditions have been met for     certain large, internationally active commercial and investment     bank counterparties and certain other counterparties.     Accordingly, the firm has not included such contracts in the     table below.         The firm, in its capacity as an agency lender, indemnifies most     of its securities lending customers against losses incurred in     the event that borrowers do not return securities and the     collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the     securities borrowed.         In the ordinary course of business, the firm provides other     financial guarantees of the obligations of third parties     (e.g., standby letters of credit and other guarantees to     enable clients to complete transactions and fund-related     guarantees). These guarantees represent obligations to make     payments to beneficiaries if the guaranteed party fails to     fulfill its obligation under a contractual arrangement with that     beneficiary.         The table below presents certain information about derivatives     that meet the definition of a guarantee and certain other     guarantees. The maximum payout in the table below is based on     the notional amount of the contract and therefore does not     represent anticipated losses. See Note 7 for further     information about credit derivatives that meet the definition of     a guarantee which are not included below.         Because derivatives are accounted for at fair value, carrying     value is considered the best indication of payment/performance     risk for individual contracts. However, the carrying values     below exclude the effect of a legal right of setoff that may     exist under an enforceable netting agreement and the effect of     netting of cash collateral posted under credit support     agreements.            165       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                                                                                                                           Maximum Payout/Notional Amount by Period of     Expiration              As of December 2010             Carrying                                                                                      Value of                        2012-            2014-            2016-                              in millions       Net Liability           2011           2013           2015           Thereafter           Total                             Derivatives 1        $   8,264           $   278,204           $   262,222           $   42,063           $   57,413           $   639,902                      Securities lending     indemnifications 2                           27,468                                                            27,468                      Other financial     guarantees 3            28               415               1,372               299               788               2,874                                          1.        These derivatives are risk managed together with derivatives     that do not meet the definition of a guarantee and, therefore,     these amounts do not reflect the firms overall risk     related to its derivative activities.          2.        Collateral held by the lenders in connection with securities     lending indemnifications was $28.21 billion as of     December 2010. Because the contractual nature of these     arrangements requires the firm to obtain collateral with a     market value that exceeds the value of the securities lent to     the borrower, there is minimal performance risk associated with     these guarantees.          3.        Other financial guarantees excludes certain commitments to issue     standby letters of credit that are included in Commitments     to extend credit. See table in Commitments     above for a summary of the firms commitments.               As of December 2009, the carrying value of the net     liability related to derivative guarantees and other financial     guarantees was $7.22 billion and $207 million,     respectively.     Guarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts.  The     firm has established trusts, including Goldman Sachs     Capital I, II and III, and other entities for the limited     purpose of issuing securities to third parties, lending the     proceeds to the firm and entering into contractual arrangements     with the firm and third parties related to this purpose. The     firm does not consolidate these entities. See Note 16 for     further information about the transactions involving Goldman     Sachs Capital I, II and III.         The firm effectively provides for the full and unconditional     guarantee of the securities issued by these entities. Timely     payment by the firm of amounts due to these entities under the     borrowing, preferred stock and related contractual arrangements     will be sufficient to cover payments due on the securities     issued by these entities.         Management believes that it is unlikely that any circumstances     will occur, such as nonperformance on the part of paying agents     or other service providers, that would make it necessary for the     firm to make payments related to these entities other than those     required under the terms of the borrowing, preferred stock and     related contractual arrangements and in connection with certain     expenses incurred by these entities.         Indemnities and Guarantees of Service     Providers.  In the ordinary course of business,     the firm indemnifies and guarantees certain service providers,     such as clearing and custody agents, trustees and     administrators, against specified potential losses in connection     with their acting as an agent of, or providing services to, the     firm or its affiliates.         The firm also indemnifies some clients against potential losses     incurred in the event specified     third-party     service providers, including     sub-custodians     and     third-party     brokers, improperly execute transactions. In addition, the firm     is a member of payment, clearing and settlement networks as well     as securities exchanges around the world that may require the     firm to meet the obligations of such networks and exchanges in     the event of member defaults.         In connection with its prime brokerage and clearing businesses,     the firm agrees to clear and settle on behalf of its clients the     transactions entered into by them with other brokerage firms.     The firms obligations in respect of such transactions are     secured by the assets in the clients account as well as     any proceeds received from the transactions cleared and settled     by the firm on behalf of the client. In connection with joint     venture investments, the firm may issue loan guarantees under     which it may be liable in the event of fraud, misappropriation,     environmental liabilities and certain other matters involving     the borrower.            166       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)               The firm is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout     under these guarantees and indemnifications. However, management     believes that it is unlikely the firm will have to make any     material payments under these arrangements, and no material     liabilities related to these guarantees and indemnifications     have been recognized in the consolidated statements of financial     condition as of December 2010 and December 2009.     Other Representations, Warranties and     Indemnifications.  The firm provides     representations and warranties to counterparties in connection     with a variety of commercial transactions and occasionally     indemnifies them against potential losses caused by the breach     of those representations and warranties. The firm may also     provide indemnifications protecting against changes in or     adverse application of certain U.S. tax laws in connection     with ordinary-course transactions such as securities issuances,     borrowings or derivatives.         In addition, the firm may provide indemnifications to some     counterparties to protect them in the event additional taxes are     owed or payments are withheld, due either to a change in or an     adverse application of certain     non-U.S. tax     laws.         These indemnifications generally are standard contractual terms     and are entered into in the ordinary course of business.     Generally, there are no stated or notional amounts included in     these indemnifications, and the contingencies triggering the     obligation to indemnify are not expected to occur. The firm is     unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these     guarantees and indemnifications. However, management believes     that it is unlikely the firm will have to make any material     payments under these arrangements, and no material liabilities     related to these arrangements have been recognized in the     consolidated statements of financial condition as of     December 2010 and December 2009.         Guarantees of Subsidiaries.  Group Inc.     fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by GS     Finance Corp., a wholly owned finance subsidiary of the firm.         Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of     Goldman, Sachs & Co. (GS&Co.), GS Bank USA,     GS Bank Europe and Goldman Sachs Execution &     Clearing, L.P. (GSEC), subject to certain exceptions.         In November 2008, the firm contributed subsidiaries into     GS Bank USA, and Group Inc. agreed to guarantee     certain losses, including     credit-related     losses, relating to assets held by the contributed entities. In     connection with this guarantee, Group Inc. also agreed to     pledge to GS Bank USA certain collateral, including     interests in subsidiaries and other illiquid assets.         In addition, Group Inc. guarantees many of the obligations     of its other consolidated subsidiaries on a     transaction-by-transaction     basis, as negotiated with counterparties. Group Inc. is     unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under its     subsidiary guarantees; however, because these guaranteed     obligations are also obligations of consolidated subsidiaries     included in the table above, Group Inc.s liabilities     as guarantor are not separately disclosed.            167       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                Note 19.  Shareholders     Equity                        Common     Equity       Dividends declared per common share were $1.40 in 2010, $1.05 in     2009 and $1.40 in 2008. On January 18, 2011,     Group Inc. declared a dividend of $0.35 per common share to     be paid on March 30, 2011 to common shareholders of     record on March 2, 2011. On     December 15, 2008, the Board declared a dividend of     $0.4666666 per common share to be paid on     March 26, 2009 to common shareholders of record on     February 24, 2009. The dividend of $0.4666666 per     common share is reflective of a four-month period     (December 2008 through March 2009), due to the change     in the firms fiscal year-end.         During 2010 and 2009, the firm repurchased 25.3 million and     19,578 shares of its common stock at an average cost per     share of $164.48 and $80.83, for a total cost of     $4.16 billion and $2 million, respectively. In     addition, to satisfy minimum statutory employee tax withholding     requirements related to the delivery of common stock underlying     restricted stock units (RSUs), the firm cancelled     6.2 million and 11.2 million of RSUs with a total     value of $972 million and $863 million in 2010 and     2009, respectively.             The firms share repurchase program is intended to     substantially offset increases in share count over time     resulting from employee     share-based     compensation and to help maintain the appropriate level of     common equity. The repurchase program is effected primarily     through regular     open-market     purchases, the amounts and timing of which are determined     primarily by the firms issuance of shares resulting from     employee     share-based     compensation as well as its current and projected capital     position (i.e., comparisons of the firms desired     level of capital to its actual level of capital), but which may     also be influenced by general market conditions and the     prevailing price and trading volumes of the firms common     stock. Any repurchase of the firms common stock requires     approval by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System     (Federal Reserve Board).     Preferred     Equity       The table below presents perpetual preferred stock issued and     outstanding.

Each share of 10% Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock,     Series G (Series G Preferred Stock) issued and     outstanding has a par value of $0.01, has a liquidation     preference of $100,000 and is redeemable at the firms     option, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, at     a redemption price equal to $110,000 plus accrued and unpaid     dividends. In connection with the issuance of the Series G     Preferred Stock, the firm issued a five-year warrant to purchase     up to 43.5 million shares of common stock at an exercise     price of $115.00 per share. The warrant is exercisable at any     time until October 1, 2013 and the number of shares of     common stock underlying the warrant and the exercise price are     subject to adjustment for certain dilutive events.         All series of preferred stock are pari passu and have a     preference over the firms common stock on liquidation.     Dividends on each series of preferred stock, if declared, are     payable quarterly in arrears. The firms ability to declare     or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire,     its common stock is subject to certain restrictions in the event     that the firm fails to pay or set aside full dividends on the     preferred stock for the latest completed dividend period.         In 2007, the Board authorized 17,500.1 shares of     Series E Preferred Stock, and 5,000.1 shares of     Series F Preferred Stock, in connection with the APEX     Trusts. See Note 16 for further information.         Under the stock purchase contracts with the APEX Trusts,     Group Inc. will issue on the relevant stock purchase dates     (on or before June 1, 2013 and     September 1, 2013 for Series E and Series F     Preferred Stock, respectively) one share of Series E and     Series F Preferred Stock to Goldman Sachs Capital II     and III, respectively, for each $100,000 principal amount of     subordinated debt held by these trusts. When issued, each share     of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock will have a     par value of $0.01 and a liquidation preference of $100,000 per     share.             Dividends on Series E Preferred Stock, if declared, will be     payable     semi-annually     at a fixed annual rate of 5.79% if the stock is issued prior to     June 1, 2012 and quarterly thereafter, at a rate per     annum equal to the greater of     (i) three-month     LIBOR plus 0.77% and (ii) 4.00%.         Dividends on Series F Preferred Stock, if declared, will be     payable quarterly at a rate per annum equal to     three-month     LIBOR plus 0.77% if the stock is issued prior to     September 1, 2012 and quarterly thereafter, at a rate     per annum equal to the greater of     (i) three-month     LIBOR plus 0.77% and (ii) 4.00%.         The preferred stock may be redeemed at the option of the firm on     the stock purchase dates or any day thereafter, subject to     approval from the Federal Reserve Board and certain covenant     restrictions governing the firms ability to redeem or     purchase the preferred stock without issuing common stock or     other instruments with     equity-like     characteristics.         In June 2009, Group Inc. repurchased from the     U.S. Treasury the 10.0 million shares of the     Companys Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock,     Series H (Series H Preferred Stock), that were issued     to the U.S. Treasury pursuant to the     U.S. Treasurys TARP Capital Purchase Program. The     repurchase resulted in a     one-time     preferred dividend of $426 million, which is included in     the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended     December 2009. This     one-time     preferred dividend represented the difference between the     carrying value and the redemption value of the Series H     Preferred Stock. In connection with the issuance of the     Series H Preferred Stock in October 2008, the firm     issued a     10-year     warrant to the U.S. Treasury to purchase up to     12.2 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of     $122.90 per share.

Regulation     and Capital Adequacy              The Federal Reserve Board is the primary regulator of     Group Inc., a bank holding company and a financial holding     company under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. As     a bank holding company, the firm is subject to consolidated     regulatory capital requirements that are computed in accordance     with the Federal Reserve Boards capital adequacy     regulations currently applicable to bank holding companies     (Basel 1). These capital requirements, which are based on the     Capital Accord of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision     (Basel Committee), are expressed as capital ratios that compare     measures of capital to     risk-weighted     assets (RWAs). The firms bank depository institution     subsidiaries, including GS Bank USA, are subject to similar     capital requirements.         Under the Federal Reserve Boards capital adequacy     requirements and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective     action that is applicable to GS Bank USA, the firm and its     bank depository institution subsidiaries must meet specific     capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of     assets, liabilities and certain     off-balance-sheet     items as calculated under regulatory reporting practices. The     firm and its bank depository institution subsidiaries     capital amounts, as well as GS Bank USAs prompt     corrective action classification, are also subject to     qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk     weightings and other factors.         Many of the firms subsidiaries, including GS&Co. and     the firms other     broker-dealer     subsidiaries, are subject to separate regulation and capital     requirements as described below.     Group Inc.       Federal Reserve Board regulations require bank holding companies     to maintain a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 4% and a     minimum total capital ratio of 8%. The required minimum     Tier 1 capital ratio and total capital ratio in order to be     considered a well-capitalized bank holding company     under the Federal Reserve Board guidelines are 6% and 10%,     respectively. Bank holding companies may be expected to maintain     ratios well above the minimum           levels, depending on their particular condition, risk profile     and growth plans. The minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio is 3%     for bank holding companies that have received the highest     supervisory rating under Federal Reserve Board guidelines or     that have implemented the Federal Reserve Boards     risk-based     capital measure for market risk. Other bank holding companies     must have a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.         The table below presents information regarding     Group Inc.s regulatory capital ratios.                                                            As of December     $ in millions       2010           2009                             Tier 1 capital        $   71,233               $       64,642                      Tier 2 capital            13,660                   13,828                      Total capital            84,893                   78,470                  Risk-weighted     assets            444,290                   431,890                      Tier 1 capital ratio            16.0%                   15.0%                      Total capital ratio            19.1%                   18.2%                      Tier 1 leverage ratio            8.0%                   7.6%                                      RWAs under the Federal Reserve Boards     risk-based     capital guidelines are calculated based on the amount of market     risk and credit risk. RWAs for market risk are determined by     reference to the firms Value-at-Risk (VaR) models,     supplemented by other measures to capture risks not reflected in     VaR models. Credit risk for on-balance sheet assets is based on     the balance sheet value. For off-balance sheet exposures,     including OTC derivatives and commitments, a credit equivalent     amount is calculated based on the notional amount of each trade.     All such assets and amounts are then assigned a risk weight     depending on, among other things, whether the counterparty is a     sovereign, bank or qualifying securities firm or other entity     (or if collateral is held, depending on the nature of the     collateral).         Tier 1 leverage ratio is defined as Tier 1 capital     under Basel 1 divided by average adjusted total assets (which     includes adjustments for disallowed goodwill and intangible     assets, and the carrying value of equity investments in     non-financial     companies that are subject to deductions from Tier 1     capital).                  171       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)        Regulatory     Reform          The firm is currently working to implement the requirements set     out in the Federal Reserve Boards Capital Adequacy     Guidelines for Bank Holding Companies: Internal-Ratings-Based     and Advanced Measurement Approaches, which are based on the     advanced approaches under the Revised Framework for the     International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital     Standards issued by the Basel Committee as applicable to     Group Inc. as a bank holding company (Basel 2).     U.S. banking regulators have incorporated the Basel 2     framework into the existing     risk-based     capital requirements by requiring that internationally active     banking organizations, such as Group Inc., transition to     Basel 2 following the successful completion of a parallel run.         In addition, the Basel Committee has undertaken a program of     substantial revisions to its capital guidelines. In particular,     the changes in the Basel 2.5 guidelines will     result in increased capital requirements for market risk;     additionally, the Basel 3 guidelines issued by the Basel     Committee in December 2010 revise the definition of     Tier 1 capital, introduce Tier 1 common equity as a     regulatory metric, set new minimum capital ratios (including a     new capital conservation buffer, which must be     composed exclusively of Tier 1 common equity and will be in     addition to the other capital ratios), introduce a Tier 1     leverage ratio within international guidelines for the first     time, and make substantial revisions to the computation of     risk-weighted     assets for credit exposures. Implementation of the new     requirements is expected to take place over an extended     transition period, starting at the end of 2011 (for Basel 2.5)     and end of 2012 (for Basel 3). Although the U.S. federal     banking agencies have now issued proposed rules that are     intended to implement certain aspects of the Basel 2.5     guidelines, they have not yet addressed all aspects of those     guidelines or the Basel 3 changes. In addition, both the Basel     Committee and U.S. banking regulators implementing the     Dodd-Frank Act have indicated that they will impose more     stringent capital standards on systemically important financial           institutions. Although the criteria for treatment as a     systemically important financial institution have not yet been     determined, it is probable that they will apply to the firm.     Therefore, the regulations ultimately applicable to the firm may     be substantially different from those that have been published     to date.         The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act     (Dodd-Frank Act) will subject the firm at a firmwide level to     the same leverage and     risk-based     capital requirements that apply to depository institutions and     directs banking regulators to impose additional capital     requirements as disclosed above. The Federal Reserve Board will     be required to begin implementing the new leverage and     risk-based     capital regulation by January 2012. As a consequence of     these changes, Tier 1 capital treatment for the firms     junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and the firms     cumulative preferred stock will be phased out over a three-year     period beginning on January 1, 2013. The interaction     between the Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel Committees     proposed changes adds further uncertainty to the firms     future capital requirements.         A number of other governmental entities and regulators,     including the U.S. Treasury, the European Union and the     U.K.s Financial Services Authority (FSA), have also     proposed or announced changes which will result in increased     capital requirements for financial institutions.         As a consequence of these developments, the firm expects minimum     capital ratios required to be maintained under Federal Reserve     Board regulations will be increased and changes in the     prescribed calculation methodology are expected to result in     higher RWAs and lower capital ratios than those currently     computed.         The capital requirements of several of the firms     subsidiaries will also be impacted in the future by the various     proposals from the Basel Committee, the     Dodd-Frank     Act, and other governmental entities and regulators.                172       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)           Bank     Subsidiaries       GS Bank USA, an FDIC-insured, New York State-chartered     bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC, is     regulated by the Federal Reserve Board and the New York State     Banking Department and is subject to minimum capital     requirements (described further below) that are calculated in a     manner similar to those applicable to bank holding companies.     GS Bank USA computes its capital ratios in accordance with     the regulatory capital guidelines currently applicable to state     member banks, which are based on Basel 1 as implemented by the     Federal Reserve Board, for purposes of assessing the adequacy of     its capital. In order to be considered a     well-capitalized depository institution under the     Federal Reserve Board guidelines, GS Bank USA must maintain     a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6%, a total capital     ratio of at least 10% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at     least 5%. In November 2008, the firm contributed     subsidiaries into GS Bank USA. In connection with this     contribution, GS Bank USA agreed with the Federal Reserve     Board to minimum capital ratios in excess of these     well-capitalized levels. Accordingly, for a period     of time, GS Bank USA is expected to maintain a Tier 1     capital ratio of at least 8%, a total capital ratio of at least     11% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 6%.         The table below presents information regarding GS Bank     USAs regulatory capital ratios under Basel 1 as     implemented by the Federal Reserve Board.                                                            As of December             2010           2009                             Tier 1 capital ratio            18.8%                   14.9%                      Total capital ratio            23.9%                   19.3%                      Tier 1 leverage ratio            19.5%                   15.4%                                      Effective January 18, 2011, upon receiving regulatory     approval, GS Bank USA declared a dividend of $1.00 billion     to Group, Inc. In conjunction with the approval of this     dividend, GS Bank USA also received approval to repay     $4.00 billion in subordinated debt to Group, Inc. The     dividend and subordinated debt repayments took place on     February 1, 2011, and would have reduced GS Bank USAs     Tier 1 and total capital ratios as of December 2010 by     1.0% and 5.1%, respectively.         GS Bank USA is currently working to implement the Basel 2     framework. Similar to the firms requirement as a bank     holding company, GS Bank USA is required to transition to     Basel 2 following the successful completion           of a parallel run. In addition, the capital requirements for     GS Bank USA are expected to be impacted by changes to the     Basel Committees capital guidelines and by the Dodd-Frank     Act, as outlined above.         The deposits of GS Bank USA are insured by the FDIC to the     extent provided by law. The Federal Reserve Board requires     depository institutions to maintain cash reserves with a Federal     Reserve Bank. The amount deposited by the firms depository     institution subsidiaries held at the Federal Reserve Bank was     approximately $28.12 billion and $27.43 billion as of     December 2010 and December 2009, respectively, which     exceeded required reserve amounts by $27.45 billion and     $25.86 billion as of December 2010 and     December 2009, respectively. GS Bank Europe, a wholly     owned credit institution, is regulated by the Central Bank of     Ireland and is subject to minimum capital requirements. As of     December 2010 and December 2009, GS Bank USA and     GS Bank Europe were both in compliance with all regulatory     capital requirements.         Transactions between GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries and     Group Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (other than,     generally, subsidiaries of GS Bank USA) are regulated by     the Federal Reserve Board. These regulations generally limit the     types and amounts of transactions (including loans to and     borrowings from GS Bank USA) that may take place and     generally require those transactions to be on an     arms-length basis.     Broker-Dealer     Subsidiaries       The firms U.S. regulated     broker-dealer     subsidiaries include GS&Co. and GSEC. GS&Co. and GSEC     are registered     U.S. broker-dealers     and futures commission merchants, and are subject to regulatory     capital requirements, including those imposed by the SEC, the     Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Chicago Mercantile     Exchange, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.     (FINRA) and the National Futures Association.     Rule 15c3-1     of the SEC and Rule 1.17 of the Commodity Futures Trading     Commission specify uniform minimum net capital requirements, as     defined, for their registrants, and also effectively require     that a significant part of the registrants assets be kept     in relatively liquid form. GS&Co. and GSEC have elected to     compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with     the Alternative Net Capital Requirement as permitted     by     Rule 15c3-1.            173       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                       As of December 2010, GS&Co. had regulatory net     capital, as defined by     Rule 15c3-1,     of $11.14 billion, which exceeded the amount required by     $9.21 billion. As of December 2010, GSEC had     regulatory net capital, as defined by     Rule 15c3-1,     of $1.96 billion, which exceeded the amount required by     $1.83 billion.         In addition to its alternative minimum net capital requirements,     GS&Co. is also required to hold tentative net capital in     excess of $1 billion and net capital in excess of     $500 million in accordance with the market and credit risk     standards of Appendix E of     Rule 15c3-1.     GS&Co. is also required to notify the SEC in the event that     its tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. As of     December 2010 and December 2009, GS&Co. had     tentative net capital and net capital in excess of both the     minimum and the notification requirements.     Insurance     Subsidiaries       The firm has U.S. insurance subsidiaries that are subject     to state insurance regulation and oversight in the states in     which they are domiciled and in the other states in which they     are licensed. In addition, certain of the firms insurance     subsidiaries outside of the U.S. are regulated by the FSA     and certain are regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority. The     firms insurance subsidiaries were in compliance with all     regulatory capital requirements as of December 2010 and     December 2009.         Other     Non-U.S. Regulated     Subsidiaries       The firms principal     non-U.S. regulated     subsidiaries include Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and     Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL). GSI, the firms     regulated U.K.     broker-dealer,     is subject to the capital requirements of the FSA. GSJCL, the     firms regulated Japanese     broker-dealer,     is subject to the capital requirements imposed by Japans     Financial Services Agency. As of December 2010 and     December 2009, GSI and GSJCL were in compliance with their     local capital adequacy requirements. Certain other     non-U.S. subsidiaries     of the firm are also subject to capital adequacy requirements     promulgated by authorities of the countries in which they     operate. As of December 2010 and December 2009, these     subsidiaries were in compliance with their local capital     adequacy requirements.     Restrictions on     Payments       The regulatory requirements referred to above restrict     Group Inc.s ability to withdraw capital from its     regulated subsidiaries. As of December 2010 and     December 2009, approximately $24.70 billion and     $23.49 billion, respectively, of net assets of regulated     subsidiaries were restricted as to the payment of dividends to     Group Inc. In addition to limitations on the payment of     dividends imposed by federal and state laws, the Federal Reserve     Board, the FDIC and the New York State Banking Department have     authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by     the banking organizations they supervise (including GS Bank     USA) if, in the relevant regulators opinion, payment of a     dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in the     light of the financial condition of the banking organization.            174       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                Note 21.  Earnings     Per Common Share     (EPS)                             Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net earnings applicable to     common shareholders by the weighted average number of common     shares outstanding. Common shares outstanding includes common     stock and RSUs for which no future service is required as a     condition to the delivery of the underlying common stock.     Diluted EPS includes the determinants of basic EPS and, in     addition reflects the dilutive effect of the common stock     deliverable for stock warrants and options and for RSUs for     which future service is required as a condition to the delivery     of the underlying common stock.             In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the firm adopted amended     accounting principles related to determining whether instruments     granted in     share-based     payment transactions are participating securities. Accordingly,     the firm treats unvested     share-based     payment awards that have     non-forfeitable     rights to dividends or dividend equivalents as a separate class     of securities in calculating EPS.          The table below presents the computations of basic and diluted     EPS.

The impact of     applying this methodology was a reduction to basic EPS of $0.08     and $0.06 for the years ended December 2010 and           December 2009, respectively, and an increase in basic and     diluted loss per common share of $0.03 for the one month ended     December 2008. EPS for the year ended November 2008     has not been restated due to immateriality.                  175       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)          Note 22.  Transactions     with Affiliated Funds              The firm has formed numerous nonconsolidated investment funds     with     third-party     investors. The firm generally acts as the investment manager for     these funds and, as such, is entitled to receive management fees     and, in certain cases, advisory fees or incentive fees from     these funds. Additionally, the firm invests alongside the     third-party     investors in certain funds.             The tables below present fees earned from affiliated funds, fees     receivable from affiliated funds and the aggregate carrying     value of the firms interests in affiliated funds.

As of December 2010, the firm     had exposure to these funds in the form of loans and guarantees     of $253 million, primarily related to certain real estate     funds. In addition, as of December 2010, the firm had     outstanding commitments to extend credit to these funds of     $160 million.             The firm may provide additional voluntary financial support to     these funds if they were to experience significant financial     distress; however, such amounts are not expected to be material     to the firm. In the ordinary course of business, the firm may     also engage in other activities with these funds, including,     among others, securities lending, trade execution, market     making, custody, and acquisition and bridge financing. See     Note 18 for the firms investment commitments related     to these funds.                  176       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)          Note 23.

Employee     Benefit Plans              The firm sponsors various pension plans and certain other     postretirement benefit plans, primarily healthcare and life     insurance. The firm also provides certain benefits to former or     inactive employees prior to retirement.     Defined Benefit     Pension Plans and Postretirement Plans       Employees of certain     non-U.S. subsidiaries     participate in various defined benefit pension plans. These     plans generally provide benefits based on years of credited     service and a percentage of the employees eligible     compensation. The firm maintains a defined benefit pension plan     for most U.K. employees. As of April 2008, the U.K. defined     benefit plan was closed to new participants, but will continue     to accrue benefits for existing participants. These plans do not     have a material impact on the firms consolidated results     of operations.         The firm also maintains a defined benefit pension plan for     substantially all U.S. employees hired prior to     November 1, 2003. As of November 2004, this plan     was closed to new participants and frozen such that existing     participants would not accrue any additional benefits. In     addition, the firm maintains unfunded           postretirement benefit plans that provide medical and life     insurance for eligible retirees and their dependents covered     under these programs. These plans do not have a material impact     on the firms consolidated results of operations.         The firm recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit     pension and postretirement plans, measured as the difference     between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit     obligation, in the consolidated statements of financial     condition. As of December 2010, Other assets     and Other liabilities and accrued expenses included     $164 million (related to an overfunded pension plan) and     $641 million, respectively, related to these plans. As of     December 2009, Other liabilities and accrued     expenses included $769 million related to these plans.     Defined     Contribution Plans       The firm contributes to employer-sponsored U.S. and     non-U.S. defined     contribution plans. The firms contribution to these plans     was $193 million, $178 million and $208 million     for the years ended December 2010, December 2009 and     November 2008, respectively.                  178       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)          Note 25.  Employee     Incentive Plans                 The cost of employee services received in exchange for a     share-based     award is generally measured based on the grant-date fair value     of the award.     Share-based     awards that do not require future service (i.e., vested     awards, including awards granted to retirement-eligible     employees) are expensed immediately.     Share-based     employee awards that require future service are amortized over     the relevant service period. Expected forfeitures are included     in determining     share-based     employee compensation expense.         The firm pays cash dividend equivalents on outstanding RSUs.     Dividend equivalents paid on RSUs are generally charged to     retained earnings. Dividend equivalents paid on RSUs expected to     be forfeited are included in compensation expense.         In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the firm adopted amended     accounting principles related to income tax benefits of     dividends on     share-based     payment awards. These amended principles require the tax benefit     related to dividend equivalents paid on RSUs to be accounted for     as an increase to additional     paid-in     capital. Previously, the firm accounted for this tax benefit as     a reduction to income tax expense.         In certain cases, primarily related to the death of an employee     or conflicted employment (as outlined in the applicable award     agreements), the firm may cash settle     share-based     compensation awards. For awards accounted for as equity     instruments, additional     paid-in     capital is adjusted to the extent of the difference between the     current value of the award and the grant-date value of the award.     Stock Incentive     Plan       The firm sponsors a stock incentive plan, The Goldman Sachs     Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (SIP), which provides     for grants of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock     options, stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights,     restricted stock, RSUs, awards with performance conditions and     other     share-based     awards. In the second quarter of 2003, the SIP was approved by     the firms shareholders, effective for grants after     April 1, 2003. The SIP was further amended and     restated, effective December 31, 2008.              The total number of shares of common stock that may be delivered     pursuant to awards granted under the SIP through the end of the     2008 fiscal year could not exceed 250 million shares. The     total number of shares of common stock that may be delivered for     awards granted under the SIP in the 2009 fiscal year and each     fiscal year thereafter cannot exceed 5% of the issued and     outstanding shares of common stock, determined as of the last     day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, increased by the     number of shares available for awards in previous years but not     covered by awards granted in such years. As of     December 2010 and December 2009, 139.2 million     and 140.6 million shares, respectively, were available for     grant under the SIP.     Restricted Stock     Units       The firm issues RSUs to employees under the SIP, primarily in     connection with year-end compensation and acquisitions. RSUs are     valued based on the closing price of the underlying shares on     the date of grant after taking into account a liquidity discount     for any applicable post-vesting transfer restrictions. Year-end     RSUs generally vest and deliver as outlined in the applicable     RSU agreements. Employee RSU agreements generally provide that     vesting is accelerated in certain circumstances, such as on     retirement, death and extended absence. Delivery of the     underlying shares of common stock is conditioned on the grantees     satisfying certain vesting and other requirements outlined in     the award agreements. The table below presents the activity     related to RSUs.            179       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                                                                                                         Weighted Average Grant-Date              Restricted Stock            Fair Value of Restricted              Units Outstanding           Stock Units Outstanding                         No Future                        No Future                          Future Service            Service            Future Service            Service                          Required           Required           Required           Required                             Outstanding, December 2009            16,655,194               28,065,587           $   121.50           $   158.91                      Granted 1,      2            18,808,320               16,703,719               135.42               129.52                      Forfeited            (1,460,512   )           (303,582   )           117.42               160.75                      Delivered 3                            (17,475,516   )                           147.13                      Vested 2            (12,547,209   )           12,547,209               138.27               138.27                              Outstanding, December 2010            21,455,793               39,537,417           $   124.17           $   145.13                                          1.        The weighted average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted     during the years ended December 2010, December 2009,     November 2008 and one month ended December 2008 was     $132.64, $151.31, $154.31, and $67.60, respectively. The fair     value of the RSUs granted during the year ended     December 2010 and one month ended December 2008     includes a liquidity discount of 13.2% and 14.3%, respectively,     to reflect post-vesting transfer restrictions of up to     4 years.          2.        The aggregate fair value of awards that vested during the years     ended December 2010, December 2009, November 2008     and one month ended December 2008 was $4.07 billion,     $2.18 billion, $1.03 billion and $41 million,     respectively.          3.        Includes RSUs that were cash settled.                      In January 2011, the firm granted to its employees     15.3 million year-end RSUs, of which 8.4 million RSUs     require future service as a condition of delivery. These awards     are subject to additional conditions as outlined in the award     agreements. Generally, shares underlying these awards, net of     required withholding tax, deliver over a three-year period but     are subject to post-vesting transfer restrictions through     January 2016. These grants are not included in the above     table.      Stock     Options       Stock options generally vest as outlined in the applicable stock     option agreement. Options granted in February 2010 will     generally become exercisable in     one-third     installments in January 2011, January 2012           and January 2013 and will expire in February 2014.     Employee stock option agreements provide that vesting is     accelerated in certain circumstances, such as on retirement,     death and extended absence. In general, options granted prior to     February 2010 expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant     date, although they may be subject to earlier termination or     cancellation under certain circumstances in accordance with the     terms of the SIP and the applicable stock option agreement.

These temporary differences result in     taxable or deductible amounts in future years and are measured     using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such     differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are     established to reduce deferred tax assets to the           amount that more likely than not will be realized. Tax assets     and liabilities are presented as a component of Other     assets and Other liabilities and accrued     expenses, respectively. See Notes 12 and 17 for     further information.          The table below presents the significant components of deferred     tax assets and liabilities.

Relates to depreciation and amortization.                   The firm has recorded deferred tax assets of $250 million     and $184 million as of December 2010 and     December 2009, respectively, in connection with     U.S. federal, state and local and foreign net operating     loss carryforwards. The firm also recorded a valuation allowance     of $42 million and $46 million as of     December 2010 and December 2009, respectively, related     to these net operating loss carryforwards. As of     December 2010, the U.S. federal, state and local, and     foreign net operating loss carryforwards were $341 million,     $1.54 billion and $240 million, respectively. If not     utilized, the U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward     will begin to expire in 2016 and the state and local net     operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2012. The     foreign net operating loss carryforwards can be carried forward     indefinitely.             The firm had foreign tax credit carryforwards of     $11 million and $277 million as of December 2010     and December 2009, respectively. The firm recorded a     related net deferred income tax asset of $5 million and     $271 million as of December 2010 and     December 2009, respectively. These carryforwards will begin     to expire in 2013.         The firm had capital loss carryforwards of $12 million and     $99 million as of December 2010 and     December 2009, respectively. The firm recorded a related     net deferred income tax asset of $2 million and     $35 million as of December 2010 and     December 2009, respectively. These carryforwards expire in     2014.         During 2010 and 2009, the valuation allowance was decreased by     $24 million and $19 million, respectively, primarily     due to the utilization of losses previously considered more     likely than not to expire unused.            183       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)               The firm permanently reinvests eligible earnings of certain     foreign subsidiaries and, accordingly, does not accrue any     U.S. income taxes that would arise if such earnings were     repatriated. As of December 2010 and December 2009,     this policy resulted in an unrecognized net deferred tax     liability of $2.67 billion and $2.34 billion,     respectively, attributable to reinvested earnings of     $17.70 billion and $16.21 billion, respectively.         The firm adopted amended principles related to accounting for     uncertainty in income taxes as of December 1, 2007 and     recorded a transition adjustment resulting in a reduction of     $201 million to beginning retained earnings.          Unrecognized Tax     Benefits       The firm recognizes tax positions in the financial statements     only when it is more likely than not that the position will be     sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based     on the technical merits of the position. A position that meets     this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that     will more likely than not be realized on settlement. A liability     is established for differences between positions taken in a tax     return and amounts recognized in the financial statements.          The table below presents the changes in the liability for     unrecognized tax benefits, which is recorded in Other     liabilities and accrued expenses. See Note 17 for     further information.

Included in Other assets. See Note 12.          2.        If recognized, the net tax benefit would reduce the firms     effective income tax rate.          3.        Includes $175 million recorded in the one month ended     December 2008.            184       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)               As of December 2010 and December 2009, the accrued     liability for interest expense related to income tax matters and     income tax penalties was $213 million and     $194 million, respectively. The firm recognized     $28 million, $62 million, $37 million and     $3 million of interest and income tax penalties for the     years ended December 2010, December 2009,     November 2008 and one month ended December 2008,     respectively. It is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax     benefits could change significantly during the twelve months     subsequent to December 2010 due to potential audit     settlements. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the     change or its impact on the firms effective tax rate over     the next twelve months.     Regulatory Tax     Examinations       The firm is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal     Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing authorities in     jurisdictions where the firm has significant business     operations, such as the United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong, Korea     and various states, such as New York. The tax years under     examination vary by jurisdiction. The firm believes that during     2011, certain audits have a reasonable possibility of being     completed. The firm does not expect completion of these audits     to have a material impact on the firms financial condition     but it may be material to operating results for a particular     period, depending, in part, on the operating results for that     period.         The table below presents the earliest tax years that remain     subject to examination by major jurisdiction.                                                As of                  Jurisdiction       December 2010                             U.S. Federal 1                2005                      New York State and     City 2                2004                      United Kingdom                2007                      Japan 3                2005                      Hong Kong                2004                      Korea                2008                                          1.        IRS examination of fiscal 2005, 2006 and 2007 began during 2008.     IRS examination of fiscal 2003 and 2004 has been completed but     the liabilities for those years are not yet final.          2.        New York State and City examination of fiscal 2004, 2005 and     2006 began in 2008.          3.        Japan National Tax Agency examination of fiscal 2005 through     2009 began during the first quarter of 2010.                All years subsequent to the above remain open to examination by     the taxing authorities. The firm believes that the liability for     unrecognized tax benefits it has established is adequate in     relation to the potential for additional assessments.       Note 27.  Business     Segments           In the fourth quarter of 2010, the firm reorganized its three     previous reportable business segments into four new reportable     business segments: Investment Banking, Institutional Client     Services, Investing & Lending and Investment     Management. Prior periods are presented on a comparable basis.     Basis of     Presentation       In reporting segments, certain of the firms business lines     have been aggregated where they have similar economic     characteristics and are similar in each of the following areas:     (i) the nature of the services they provide,     (ii) their methods of distribution, (iii) the types of     clients they serve and (iv) the regulatory environments in     which they operate.         The cost drivers of the firm taken as a     whole  compensation,     headcount and levels of business activity  are     broadly similar in each of the firms business segments.     Compensation and benefits expenses in the firms segments     reflect, among other factors, the overall performance of the     firm as well as the performance of individual businesses.     Consequently,     pre-tax     margins in one segment of the firms business may be     significantly affected by the performance of the firms     other business segments.         The firm allocates revenues and expenses among the four     reportable business segments. Due to the integrated nature of     these segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating     certain revenue and expense items. Transactions between segments     are based on specific criteria or approximate     third-party     rates. Total operating expenses include corporate items that     have not been allocated to individual business segments. The     allocation process is based on the manner in which management     views the business of the firm.            185       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                       The segment information presented in the table below is prepared     according to the following methodologies:                      Revenues and expenses directly associated with each segment are     included in determining     pre-tax     earnings.                  Net revenues in the firms segments include allocations of     interest income and interest expense to specific securities,     commodities and other positions in relation to the cash     generated by, or funding requirements of, such underlying                           positions. Net interest is included in segment net revenues as     it is consistent with the way in which management assesses     segment performance.                  Overhead expenses not directly allocable to specific segments     are allocated ratably based on direct segment expenses.

The methodology for     allocating profitability to geographic regions is dependent on     estimates and management judgment because a significant portion     of the firms activities require cross-border coordination     in order to facilitate the needs of the firms clients.         Geographic results are generally allocated as follows:                      Investment Banking: location of the client and investment     banking team.                  Institutional Client Services:  Fixed Income, Currency     and Commodities Client Execution, and Equities (excluding     Securities Services): location of                           the     market-making     desk; Securities Services: location of the primary market for     the underlying security.                  Investing & Lending:  Investing: location of     the investment; Lending: location of the client.                  Investment Management:  location of the sales team.

Credit     Concentrations              Credit concentrations may arise from market making, client     facilitation, investing, underwriting, lending and     collateralized transactions and may be impacted by changes in     economic, industry or political factors. The firm seeks to     mitigate credit risk by actively monitoring exposures and     obtaining collateral from counterparties as deemed appropriate.         While the firms activities expose it to many different     industries and counterparties, the firm routinely executes a     high volume of transactions with asset managers, investment     funds, commercial banks,           brokers and dealers, clearing houses and exchanges, which     results in significant credit concentrations.         In the ordinary course of business, the firm may also be subject     to a concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty,     borrower or issuer, including sovereign issuers, or to a     particular clearing house or exchange.         The table below presents the credit concentrations in assets     held by the firm. As of December 2010 and     December 2009, the firm did not have credit exposure to any     other counterparty that exceeded 2% of total assets.

Legal     Proceedings                            The firm is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and     arbitration proceedings (including those described below)     concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of the     firms businesses. Many of these proceedings are at     preliminary stages, and many of these cases seek an     indeterminate amount of damages.         With respect to matters described below, management has     estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss     as being equal to (i) the amount of money damages claimed,     where applicable, (ii) the amount of securities that the     firm sold in cases involving underwritings where the firm is     being sued by purchasers and is not being indemnified by a party     that the firm believes will pay any judgment, or (iii) in     cases where the purchasers are demanding that the firm     repurchase securities, the price that purchasers paid for the     securities less the estimated value, if any, as of     December 2010 of the relevant securities. As of     December 2010, the firm has estimated the aggregate amount     of reasonably possible losses for these matters to be     approximately $3.4 billion.         Under ASC 450 an event is reasonably possible     if the chance of the future event or events occurring is     more than remote but less than likely and an event is     remote if the chance of the future event or     events occurring is slight. Thus, references to the upper     end of the range of reasonably possible loss for cases in which     the firm is able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss     mean the upper end of the range of loss for cases for which the     firm believes the risk of loss is more than slight. The amounts     reserved against such matters are not significant as compared to     the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss.         Management is unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible     loss for cases described below in which damages have not been     specified and (i) the proceedings are in early stages,     (ii) there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class     being certified or the ultimate size of the class,     (iii) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending     appeals or motions, (iv) there are significant factual     issues to be resolved, and/or (v) there are novel legal     issues presented. However, for these cases, management does not     believe, based on currently available information, that the     outcomes of these proceedings will have a material adverse     effect on the firms financial condition, though the     outcomes could be material to the firms operating results     for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the     operating results for such period.         IPO Process Matters.  Group Inc. and     GS&Co. are among the numerous financial services companies     that have been named as defendants in a variety of lawsuits     alleging improprieties in the process by which those companies     participated in the underwriting of public offerings in recent     years.         GS&Co. has, together with other underwriters in certain     offerings as well as the issuers and certain of their officers     and directors, been named as a defendant in a number of related     lawsuits filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern     District of New York alleging, among other things, that the     prospectuses for the offerings violated the federal securities     laws by failing to disclose the existence of alleged     arrangements tying allocations in certain offerings to higher     customer brokerage commission rates as well as purchase orders     in the aftermarket, and that the alleged arrangements resulted     in market manipulation. On October 5, 2009, the     district court approved a settlement agreement entered into by     the parties. The firm has paid into a settlement fund the full     amount that GS&Co. would contribute in the proposed     settlement. On October 23, 2009, certain objectors     filed a petition in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the     Second Circuit seeking review of the district courts     certification of a class for purposes of the settlement, and     various objectors appealed certain aspects of the     settlements approval. Certain of the appeals have been     withdrawn, and on December 8, 2010,     January 14, 2011 and February 3, 2011,     plaintiffs moved to dismiss the remaining appeals.         GS&Co. is among numerous underwriting firms named as     defendants in a number of complaints filed commencing     October 3, 2007, in the U.S. District Court for     the Western District of Washington alleging violations of     Section 16 of the Exchange Act in connection with offerings     of securities for 15 issuers during 1999 and 2000. The     complaints generally assert that the underwriters, together with     each issuers directors, officers and principal     shareholders, entered into purported agreements to tie     allocations in the offerings to increased brokerage commissions     and aftermarket purchase orders. The complaints further allege     that, based upon these and other purported agreements, the     underwriters violated the reporting provisions of, and are     subject to     short-swing     profit recovery under, Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The     district court granted defendants motions to dismiss by a     decision dated March 12, 2009. On     December 2, 2010, the appellate court affirmed in part     and reversed in part, upholding the dismissal of               191       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)               seven of the actions in which GS&Co. is a defendant but     remanding the remaining eight actions in which GS&Co. is a     defendant for consideration of other bases for dismissal. On     December 16, 2010, the underwriters and the plaintiff     filed petitions for rehearing     and/or     rehearing en banc, which were denied on     January 18, 2011. The issuance of the mandate has been     stayed to permit the parties to seek Supreme Court review.         GS&Co. has been named as a defendant in an action commenced     on May 15, 2002 in New York Supreme Court, New York     County, by an official committee of unsecured creditors on     behalf of eToys, Inc., alleging that the firm intentionally     underpriced eToys, Inc.s initial public offering. The     action seeks, among other things, unspecified compensatory     damages resulting from the alleged lower amount of offering     proceeds. The court granted GS&Co.s motion to dismiss     as to five of the claims; plaintiff appealed from the dismissal     of the five claims, and GS&Co. appealed from the denial of     its motion as to the remaining claim. The New York Appellate     Division, First Department affirmed in part and reversed in part     the lower courts ruling on the firms motion to     dismiss, permitting all claims to proceed except the claim for     fraud, as to which the appellate court granted leave to replead,     and the New York Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed     in part, dismissing claims for breach of contract, professional     malpractice and unjust enrichment, but permitting claims for     breach of fiduciary duty and fraud to continue. On remand to the     lower court, GS&Co. moved to dismiss the surviving claims     or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, but the motion was     denied by a decision dated March 21, 2006, and the     court subsequently permitted plaintiff to amend the complaint     again. On November 8, 2010, GS&Co.s motion     for summary judgment was granted by the lower court; plaintiff     has appealed.         Group Inc. and certain of its affiliates have, together     with various underwriters in certain offerings, received     subpoenas and requests for documents and information from     various governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations     in connection with investigations relating to the public     offering process. Goldman Sachs has cooperated with these     investigations.     World Online Litigation.  In March 2001, a     Dutch shareholders association initiated legal proceedings for     an unspecified amount of damages against GSI and others in     Amsterdam District Court in connection with the initial public     offering of World Online in March 2000, alleging     misstatements and omissions in           the offering materials and that the market was artificially     inflated by improper public statements and stabilization     activities. Goldman Sachs and ABN AMRO Rothschild served as     joint global coordinators of the approximately     2.9 billion offering. GSI underwrote     20,268,846 shares and GS&Co. underwrote     6,756,282 shares for a total offering price of     approximately 1.16 billion.         The district court rejected the claims against GSI and ABN AMRO,     but found World Online liable in an amount to be determined. On     appeal, the Netherlands Court of Appeals affirmed in part and     reversed in part the decision of the district court holding that     certain of the alleged disclosure deficiencies were actionable     as to GSI and ABN AMRO. On further appeal, the Netherlands     Supreme Court on November 27, 2009 affirmed the     rulings of the Court of Appeals, except found certain additional     aspects of the offering materials actionable and held that GSI     and ABN AMRO could potentially be held responsible for certain     public statements and press releases by World Online and its     former CEO. On November 18, 2010, the parties reached     a settlement in principle, subject to documentation, pursuant to     which GSI will contribute up to 48 million to a     settlement fund. The firm has reserved the full amount of     GSIs proposed contribution to the settlement.     Research Matters.  GS&Co. is one of     several investment firms that have been named as defendants in     substantively identical purported class actions filed in the     U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York     alleging violations of the federal securities laws in connection     with research coverage of certain issuers and seeking     compensatory damages.  One such action,     relating to coverage of RSL Communications, Inc., commenced on     July 15, 2003. The parties entered into a settlement     agreement on August 23, 2010, which received final     court approval on February 23, 2011. Under the settlement     agreement, GS&Co. paid approximately $3.38 million.         Group Inc. and GS&Co. were named as defendants in a     purported class action filed on July 18, 2003 on     behalf of purchasers of Group Inc. stock from     July 1, 1999 through May 7, 2002. The     complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern     District of New York, alleged that defendants breached their     fiduciary duties and violated the federal securities laws in     connection with the firms research activities and sought,     among other things, unspecified compensatory damages and/or     rescission. On July 12, 2010, the parties entered into     a settlement agreement pursuant to which the settlement has               192       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)               been funded by the firms insurers. The settlement received     court approval on December 15, 2010 and has become     final.         Group Inc. and certain of its affiliates are subject to a     number of investigations and reviews by various governmental and     regulatory bodies and     self-regulatory     organizations relating to research practices, including     communications among research analysts, sales and trading     personnel and clients. Goldman Sachs is cooperating with the     investigations and reviews.     Adelphia Communications Fraudulent Conveyance     Litigation.  GS&Co. is among numerous     entities named as defendants in two adversary proceedings     commenced in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern     District of New York, one on July 6, 2003 by a     creditors committee, and the second on or about     July 31, 2003 by an equity committee of Adelphia     Communications, Inc. Those proceedings have now been     consolidated in a single amended complaint filed by the Adelphia     Recovery Trust on October 31, 2007. The complaint     seeks, among other things, to recover, as fraudulent     conveyances, payments made allegedly by Adelphia Communications,     Inc. and its affiliates to certain brokerage firms, including     approximately $62.9 million allegedly paid to GS&Co.,     in respect of margin calls made in the ordinary course of     business on accounts owned by members of the family that     formerly controlled Adelphia Communications, Inc. By a decision     dated June 15, 2009, the district court required     plaintiff to amend its complaint to specify the source of the     margin payments to GS&Co. By a decision dated     July 30, 2009, the district court held that the     sufficiency of the amended claim would be determined at the     summary judgment stage. On March 2, 2010, GS&Co.     moved for summary judgment.     Specialist Matters.  Spear, Leeds &     Kellogg Specialists LLC (SLKS) and certain affiliates have     received requests for information from various governmental     agencies and self-regulatory organizations as part of an     industry-wide     investigation relating to activities of floor specialists in     recent years. Goldman Sachs has cooperated with the requests.             On March 30, 2004, certain specialist firms on the     NYSE, including SLKS, without admitting or denying the     allegations, entered into a final global settlement with the SEC     and the NYSE covering certain activities during the years 1999     through 2003. The SLKS settlement involves, among other things,     (i) findings by the SEC and the NYSE that SLKS violated     certain federal securities laws and NYSE rules, and in some     cases failed to supervise certain individual specialists, in     connection with trades that allegedly disadvantaged customer     orders, (ii) a cease and desist order against SLKS,     (iii) a censure of SLKS, (iv) SLKS agreement to     pay an aggregate of $45.3 million in disgorgement and a     penalty to be used to compensate customers, (v) certain     undertakings with respect to SLKS systems and procedures,     and (vi) SLKS retention of an independent consultant     to review and evaluate certain of SLKS compliance systems,     policies and procedures. Comparable findings were made and     sanctions imposed in the settlements with other specialist     firms. The settlement did not resolve the related private civil     actions against SLKS and other firms or regulatory     investigations involving individuals or conduct on other     exchanges.         SLKS, Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, L.P. and Group Inc.     are among numerous defendants named in purported class actions     brought beginning in October 2003 on behalf of investors in     the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New     York alleging violations of the federal securities laws and     state common law in connection with NYSE floor specialist     activities. The actions, which have been consolidated, seek     unspecified compensatory damages, restitution and disgorgement     on behalf of purchasers and sellers of unspecified securities     between October 17, 1998 and     October 15, 2003. By a decision dated     March 14, 2009, the district court granted     plaintiffs motion for class certification. The     defendants petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals     for the Second Circuit seeking review of the certification     ruling was denied by an order dated October 1, 2009.     The specialist defendants petition for a rehearing     and/or     rehearing en banc was denied on February 24, 2010.              193       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)           Treasury Matters.  GS&Co. has been named     as a defendant in a purported class action filed on     March 10, 2004 in the U.S. District Court for the     Northern District of Illinois on behalf of holders of short     positions in     30-year     U.S. Treasury futures and options on the morning of     October 31, 2001. The complaint alleges that the firm     purchased     30-year     bonds and futures prior to a forthcoming Treasury refunding     announcement that morning based on     non-public     information about that announcement, and that such purchases     increased the costs of covering such short positions. The     complaint also names as defendants the Washington, D.C.-based     political consultant who allegedly was the source of the     information, a former GS&Co. economist who allegedly     received the information, and another company and one of its     employees who also allegedly received and traded on the     information prior to its public announcement. The complaint     alleges violations of the federal commodities and antitrust     laws, as well as Illinois statutory and common law, and seeks,     among other things, unspecified damages including treble damages     under the antitrust laws. The district court dismissed the     antitrust and Illinois state law claims but permitted the     federal commodities law claims to proceed. Plaintiffs     motion for class certification was denied by a decision dated     August 22, 2008. GS&Co. moved for summary     judgment, and the district court granted the motion but only     insofar as the claim relates to the trading of treasury bonds.     On October 13, 2009, the parties filed an offer of     judgment and notice of acceptance with respect to     plaintiffs individual claim. On     December 11, 2009, the plaintiff purported to appeal     with respect to the district courts prior denial of class     certification, and GS&Co. moved to dismiss the appeal on     January 25, 2010. By an order dated     April 13, 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the     Seventh Circuit ruled that GS&Co.s motion would be     entertained together with the merits of the appeal.     Mutual Fund Matters.  GS&Co. and     certain mutual fund affiliates have received subpoenas and     requests for information from various governmental agencies and     self-regulatory organizations including the SEC as part of the     industry-wide     investigation relating to the practices of mutual funds and     their customers. GS&Co. and its affiliates have cooperated     with such requests.         Refco Securities Litigation.  GS&Co. and     the other lead underwriters for the August 2005 initial     public offering of 26.5 million shares of common stock     of Refco Inc. are among the defendants in various putative class     actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern     District of New York beginning in October 2005 by investors     in Refco Inc. in response to certain publicly reported events     that culminated in the October 17, 2005 filing by     Refco Inc. and certain affiliates for protection under     U.S. bankruptcy laws. The actions, which have been     consolidated, allege violations of the disclosure requirements     of the federal securities laws and seek compensatory damages. In     addition to the underwriters, the consolidated complaint names     as defendants Refco Inc. and certain of its affiliates, certain     officers and directors of Refco Inc., Thomas H. Lee Partners,     L.P. (which held a majority of Refco Inc.s equity through     certain funds it manages), Grant Thornton (Refco Inc.s     outside auditor), and BAWAG P.S.K. Bank fur Arbeit und     Wirtschaft und Osterreichische Postsparkasse Aktiengesellschaft     (BAWAG). Lead plaintiffs entered into a settlement with BAWAG,     which was approved following certain amendments on     June 29, 2007. GS&Co. underwrote     5,639,200 shares of common stock at a price of $22 per     share for a total offering price of approximately     $124 million. On April 20, 2010, certain     underwriting defendants including GS&Co. entered into a     settlement of the action, pursuant to which they will contribute     $49.5 million to a settlement fund. The settlement received     court approval on October 27, 2010 and has become     final.         GS&Co. has, together with other underwriters of the Refco     Inc. initial public offering, received requests for information     from various governmental agencies and self-regulatory     organizations. GS&Co. has cooperated with those requests.     Fannie Mae Litigation.  GS&Co. was added     as a defendant in an amended complaint filed on     August 14, 2006 in a purported class action pending in     the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The     complaint asserts violations of the federal securities laws     generally arising from allegations concerning Fannie Maes     accounting practices in connection with certain Fannie     Mae-sponsored REMIC transactions that were allegedly arranged by     GS&Co. The complaint does not specify a dollar amount of     damages. The other defendants include Fannie Mae, certain of its     past and present officers and directors, and accountants. By a     decision dated May 8, 2007, the               194       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)               district court granted GS&Co.s motion to dismiss the     claim against it. The time for an appeal will not begin to run     until disposition of the claims against other defendants.         Beginning in September 2006, Group Inc.     and/or     GS&Co.  were named as defendants in four Fannie     Mae shareholder derivative actions in the U.S. District     Court for the District of Columbia. The complaints generally     allege that the Goldman Sachs defendants aided and abetted a     breach of fiduciary duty by Fannie Maes directors and     officers in connection with certain Fannie Mae-sponsored REMIC     transactions and one of the complaints also asserts a breach of     contract claim. The complaints also name as defendants certain     former officers and directors of Fannie Mae as well as an     outside accounting firm. The complaints seek, inter alia,     unspecified damages. The Goldman Sachs defendants were dismissed     without prejudice from the first filed of these actions, and the     remaining claims in that action were dismissed for failure to     make a demand on Fannie Maes board of directors. That     dismissal has been affirmed on appeal. The district court     dismissed the remaining three actions on     July 28, 2010. The plaintiffs filed motions for     reconsideration, which were denied on     October 22, 2010, and have revised their notices of     appeal in these actions.     Compensation-Related Litigation.  On     January 17, 2008, Group Inc., its Board,     executive officers and members of its management committee were     named as defendants in a purported shareholder derivative action     in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New     York predicting that the firms 2008 Proxy Statement will     violate the federal securities laws by undervaluing certain     stock option awards and alleging that senior management received     excessive compensation for 2007. The complaint seeks, among     other things, an injunction against the distribution of the 2008     Proxy Statement, the voiding of any election of directors in the     absence of an injunction and an equitable accounting for the     allegedly excessive compensation. On January 25, 2008,     the plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the     2008 Proxy Statement from using options valuations that the     plaintiff alleges are incorrect and to require the amendment of     SEC Form 4s filed by certain of the executive officers     named in the complaint to reflect the stock option valuations     alleged by the plaintiff. Plaintiffs motion for a     preliminary injunction was denied, and plaintiffs appeal     from this denial was dismissed. On February 13, 2009,     the plaintiff filed an           amended complaint, which added purported direct     (i.e., non-derivative)     claims based on substantially the same theory. The plaintiff     filed a further amended complaint on March 24, 2010,     and the defendants motion to dismiss this further amended     complaint was granted on September 30, 2010. On     October 22, 2010, the plaintiff filed a notice of     appeal from the dismissal of his complaint.         On March 24, 2009, the same plaintiff filed an action     in New York Supreme Court, New York County against     Group Inc., its directors and certain senior executives     alleging violation of Delaware statutory and common law in     connection with substantively similar allegations regarding     stock option awards. On April 14, 2009,     Group Inc. removed the action to the U.S. District     Court for the Southern District of New York and has moved to     transfer to the district court judge presiding over the other     actions described in this section and to dismiss. The action was     transferred on consent to the U.S. District Court for the     Eastern District of New York, where defendants moved to dismiss     on April 23, 2009. On July 10, 2009,     plaintiff moved to remand the action to state court, and this     motion was granted on July 29, 2010. On     January 7, 2011, the plaintiff filed an amended     complaint.         Purported shareholder derivative actions have been commenced in     New York Supreme Court, New York County and Delaware Court of     Chancery beginning on December 14, 2009, alleging that     the Board breached its fiduciary duties in connection with     setting compensation levels for the year 2009 and that such     levels are excessive. The complaints name as defendants     Group Inc., the Board and certain senior executives. The     complaints seek, inter alia, unspecified damages,     restitution of certain compensation paid, and an order requiring     the firm to adopt corporate reforms. In the actions in New York     state court, on April 8, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a     motion indicating that they no longer intend to pursue their     claims but are seeking an award of attorneys fees in     connection with bringing the suit, which the defendants have     opposed. In the actions brought in the Delaware Court of     Chancery, the defendants moved to dismiss on     March 9, 2010, and the plaintiffs amended their     complaint on April 28, 2010 to include, among other     things, the allegations included in the SECs action     described in the     Mortgage-Related     Matters section below. The defendants moved to dismiss     this amended complaint on May 12, 2010. In lieu of     responding to defendants motion, plaintiffs moved on     December 8, 2010 for permission to file a further               195       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)               amended complaint, which the defendants had opposed. The court     granted plaintiffs motion to amend on     January 19, 2011, and the defendants moved to dismiss     the second amended complaint on February 4, 2011.         Group Inc. and certain of its affiliates are subject to a     number of investigations and reviews from various governmental     agencies and self-regulatory organizations regarding the     firms compensation processes. The firm is cooperating with     the investigations and reviews.     Mortgage-Related     Matters.  On April 16, 2010, the SEC     brought an action (SEC Action) under the U.S. federal     securities laws in the U.S. District Court for the Southern     District of New York against GS&Co. and Fabrice Tourre, one     of its employees, in connection with a CDO offering made in     early 2007 (ABACUS     2007-AC1     transaction), alleging that the defendants made materially false     and misleading statements to investors and seeking, among other     things, unspecified monetary penalties. Investigations of     GS&Co. by FINRA and of GSI by the U.K. Financial Services     Authority (FSA) were subsequently initiated, and Group Inc.     and certain of its affiliates have received requests for     information from other regulators, regarding CDO offerings,     including the ABACUS     2007-AC1     transaction, and related matters.         On July 14, 2010, GS&Co. entered into a consent     agreement with the SEC, settling all claims made against     GS&Co. in the SEC Action (SEC Settlement), pursuant to     which, GS&Co. paid $550 million of disgorgement and     civil penalties, and which was approved by the U.S. District     Court for the Southern District of New York on July 20,     2010.         On September 9, 2010, the FSA announced a settlement     with GSI pursuant to which the FSA found that GSI violated     certain FSA principles by failing to (i) provide     notification about the SEC Wells Notice issued to     Mr. Tourre (who worked on the ABACUS     2007-AC1     transaction but subsequently transferred to GSI and became     registered with the FSA) and (ii) have procedures and     controls to ensure that GSIs Compliance Department would     be alerted to various aspects of the SEC investigation so as to     be in a position to determine whether any aspects were     reportable to the FSA. The FSA assessed a fine of     £17.5 million.         On November 9, 2010, FINRA announced a settlement with     GS&Co. relating to GS&Co.s failure to file     Form U4 updates within 30 days of learning of the     receipt of Wells           Notices by Mr. Tourre and another employee as well as     deficiencies in the firms systems and controls for such     filings. FINRA assessed a fine of $650,000 and GS&Co.     agreed to undertake a review and remediation of the applicable     systems and controls.         On January 6, 2011, ACA Financial Guaranty     Corp.  filed an action against GS&Co. in respect     of the ABACUS     2007-AC1     transaction in New York Supreme Court, New York County. The     complaint includes allegations of fraudulent inducement,     fraudulent concealment and unjust enrichment and seeks at least     $30 million in compensatory damages, at least     $90 million in punitive damages and unspecified     disgorgement.         Since April 22, 2010, a number of putative shareholder     derivative actions have been filed in New York Supreme Court,     New York County, and the U.S. District Court for the     Southern District of New York against Group Inc., the Board     and certain officers and employees of Group Inc. and its     affiliates in connection with     mortgage-related     matters between 2004 and 2007, including the ABACUS     2007-AC1     transaction and other CDO offerings. These derivative complaints     generally include allegations of breach of fiduciary duty,     corporate waste, abuse of control, mismanagement, unjust     enrichment, misappropriation of information, securities fraud     and insider trading, and challenge the accuracy and adequacy of     Group Inc.s disclosure. These derivative complaints     seek, among other things, declaratory relief, unspecified     compensatory damages, restitution and certain corporate     governance reforms. The New York Supreme Court has consolidated     the two actions pending in that court. Certain plaintiffs in the     federal court cases have moved to consolidate these actions and     to appoint lead plaintiff and lead counsel. In addition, as     described in the Compensation-Related Litigation     section above, the plaintiffs in the compensation-related     Delaware Court of Chancery actions have amended their complaint     to assert, among other things, allegations similar to those in     the derivative claims referred to above, the defendants moved to     dismiss this amended complaint, and the plaintiffs then sought     permission to amend further, which the court granted on     January 19, 2011. The defendants moved to dismiss the     second amended complaint on February 4, 2011.            196       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)                 Since April 23, 2010, the Board has received letters     from shareholders demanding that the Board take action to     address alleged misconduct by GS&Co., the Board and certain     officers and employees of Group Inc. and its affiliates.     The demands generally allege misconduct in connection with the     ABACUS     2007-AC1     transaction, the alleged failure by Group Inc. to     adequately disclose the SEC investigation that led to the SEC     Action, and Group Inc.s 2009 compensation practices.     The demands include a letter from a Group Inc. shareholder,     which previously made a demand that the Board investigate and     take action in connection with auction products matters, and has     now expanded its demand to address the foregoing matters. The     Board previously rejected the demands relating to auction     products matters.         In addition, beginning April 26, 2010, a number of     purported securities law class actions have been filed in the     U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York     challenging the adequacy of Group Inc.s public     disclosure of, among other things, the firms activities in     the CDO market and the SEC investigation that led to the SEC     Action. The purported class action complaints, which name as     defendants Group Inc. and certain officers and employees of     Group Inc. and its affiliates, generally allege violations     of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and seek     unspecified damages. On June 25, 2010, certain     shareholders and groups of shareholders moved to consolidate     these actions and to appoint lead plaintiffs and lead counsel.         GS&Co., Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company and GS Mortgage     Securities Corp. and three current or former Goldman Sachs     employees are defendants in a putative class action commenced on     December 11, 2008 in the U.S. District Court for     the Southern District of New York brought on behalf of     purchasers of various mortgage pass-through certificates and     asset-backed     certificates issued by various securitization trusts in 2007 and     underwritten by GS&Co. The second amended complaint     generally alleges that the registration statement and prospectus     supplements for the certificates violated the federal securities     laws, and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and rescission     or recessionary damages. Defendants motion to dismiss the     second amended complaint was granted on     January 28, 2010 with leave to replead certain claims.     On March 31, 2010, the plaintiff filed a third amended     complaint relating to two offerings, which the defendants moved     to dismiss on June 22, 2010. This motion to dismiss     was denied as           to the plaintiffs Section 12(a)(2) claims on     September 22, 2010, and granted as to the     plaintiffs Section 11 claims on     October 15, 2010, and the plaintiffs motion for     reconsideration was denied on November 17, 2010. On     December 9, 2010, the plaintiff filed a motion for     entry of final judgment or certification of an interlocutory     appeal as to plaintiffs Section 11 claims, which was     denied on January 11, 2011. On June 3, 2010,     another investor (who had unsuccessfully sought to intervene in     the action) filed a separate putative class action asserting     substantively similar allegations relating to an additional     offering pursuant to the 2007 registration statement. The     defendants moved to dismiss this separate action on     November 1, 2010. GS&Co. underwrote approximately     $951 million principal amount of certificates to all     purchasers in the offerings at issue in the complaint (excluding     those offerings for which the claims have been dismissed).         Group Inc., GS&Co., Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company and     GS Mortgage Securities Corp. are among the defendants in a     separate putative class action commenced on     February 6, 2009 in the U.S. District Court for     the Southern District of New York brought on behalf of     purchasers of various mortgage pass-through certificates and     asset-backed     certificates issued by various securitization trusts in 2006 and     underwritten by GS&Co. The other defendants include three     current or former Goldman Sachs employees and various rating     agencies. The second amended complaint generally alleges that     the registration statement and prospectus supplements for the     certificates violated the federal securities laws, and seeks     unspecified compensatory and rescissionary damages. Defendants     moved to dismiss the second amended complaint. On     January 12, 2011, the district court granted the     motion to dismiss with respect to offerings in which plaintiff     had not purchased securities, but denied the motion to dismiss     with respect to a single offering in which the plaintiff     allegedly purchased securities. GS&Co. underwrote     approximately $698 million principal amount of certificates     to all purchasers in the offerings at issue in the complaint     (excluding those offerings for which the claims have been     dismissed).         On September 30, 2010, a putative class action was     filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District     of New York against GS&Co., Group Inc. and two former     GS&Co. employees on behalf of investors in notes issued in     2006 and 2007 by two synthetic CDOs (Hudson Mezzanine     2006-1 and     2006-2). The               197       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)               complaint, which was amended on February 4, 2011, asserts     federal securities law and common law claims, and seeks     unspecified compensatory, punitive and other damages.         Various alleged purchasers of, and counterparties involved in     transactions relating to, mortgage     pass-through     certificates, CDOs and other     mortgage-related     products (including the Federal Home Loan Banks of Seattle,     Chicago and Indianapolis, the Charles Schwab Corporation,     Cambridge Place Investment Management Inc., Basis Yield Alpha     Fund (Master) and Landesbank     Baden-Württemberg,     among others) have filed complaints in state and federal court     against firm affiliates, generally alleging that the offering     documents for the securities that they purchased contained     untrue statements of material facts and material omissions and     generally seeking rescission and damages. Certain of these     complaints also name other firms as defendants. Additionally,     the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) has stated that     it intends to pursue similar claims on behalf of certain credit     unions for which it acts as conservator, and the firm and the     NCUA have entered into an agreement tolling the relevant     statutes of limitation. A number of other entities have     threatened to assert claims against the firm in connection with     various mortgage-related offerings, and the firm has entered     into agreements with a number of these entities to toll the     relevant statute of limitations. The firm estimates, based on     currently available information, that the aggregate cumulative     losses experienced by the plaintiffs with respect to the     securities at issue in active cases brought against the firm     where purchasers are seeking rescission of mortgage-related     securities was approximately $457 million as of     December 2010. This amount was calculated as the aggregate     amount by which the initial purchase price for the securities     allegedly purchased by the plaintiffs exceeds the estimated     December 2010 value of those securities. This estimate does     not include the potential NCUA claims or any claims by other     purchasers in the same or other mortgage-related offerings that     have not actually brought claims against the firm.         The firm has also received requests for information from     regulators relating to the     mortgage-related     securitization process, subprime mortgages, CDOs, synthetic     mortgage-related     products, particular transactions, and servicing and foreclosure     activities, and is cooperating with the requests.         The firm expects to be the subject of additional putative     shareholder derivative actions, purported class actions,     rescission and put back claims and other litigation,           additional investor and shareholder demands, and additional     regulatory and other investigations and actions with respect to     mortgage-related     offerings, loan sales, CDOs, and servicing and foreclosure     activities. See Note 18 for further information regarding     mortgage-related     contingencies.         GS&Co., along with numerous other financial institutions,     is a defendant in an action brought by the City of Cleveland     alleging that the defendants activities in connection with     securitizations of subprime mortgages created a public     nuisance in Cleveland. The action is pending in the     U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, and     the complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified     compensatory damages. The district court granted     defendants motion to dismiss by a decision dated     May 15, 2009. The City appealed on     May 18, 2009. The appellate court affirmed the     complaints dismissal by a decision dated     July 27, 2010 and, on October 14, 2010,     denied the Citys petition for rehearing en banc. On     January 12, 2011, the City filed a petition for writ     of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court.     Auction Products Matters.  On     August 21, 2008, GS&Co. entered into a settlement     in principle with the Office of the Attorney General of the     State of New York and the Illinois Securities Department (on     behalf of the North American Securities Administrators     Association) regarding auction rate securities. Under the     agreement, Goldman Sachs agreed, among other things, (i) to     offer to repurchase at par the outstanding auction rate     securities that its private wealth management clients purchased     through the firm prior to February 11, 2008, with the     exception of those auction rate securities where auctions are     clearing, (ii) to continue to work with issuers and other     interested parties, including regulatory and governmental     entities, to expeditiously provide liquidity solutions for     institutional investors, and (iii) to pay a     $22.5 million fine. The settlement is subject to definitive     documentation and approval by the various states. On     June 2, 2009, GS&Co. entered into an Assurance of     Discontinuance with the New York State Attorney General. On     March 19, 2010, GS&Co. entered into an     Administrative Consent Order with the Illinois Secretary of     State, Securities Department, which had conducted an     investigation on behalf of states other than New York.     GS&Co has entered into similar consent orders with most     states and is in the process of doing so with the remaining     states.         On August 28, 2008, a putative shareholder derivative     action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the     Southern District of New York naming as defendants     Group Inc., the Board, and certain senior officers. The     complaint alleges generally that the Board breached its               198       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)               fiduciary duties and committed mismanagement in connection with     its oversight of auction rate securities marketing and trading     operations, that certain individual defendants engaged in     insider selling by selling shares of Group Inc., and that     the firms public filings were false and misleading in     violation of the federal securities laws by failing to     accurately disclose the alleged practices involving auction rate     securities. The complaint seeks damages, injunctive and     declaratory relief, restitution, and an order requiring the firm     to adopt corporate reforms. On May 19, 2009, the     district court granted defendants motion to dismiss, and     on July 20, 2009 denied plaintiffs motion for     reconsideration. Following the dismissal of the shareholder     derivative action, the named plaintiff in such action sent the     Board a letter demanding that the Board investigate the     allegations set forth in the complaint, and the Board ultimately     rejected the demand.         On September 4, 2008, Group Inc. was named as a     defendant, together with numerous other financial services     firms, in two complaints filed in the U.S. District Court     for the Southern District of New York alleging that the     defendants engaged in a conspiracy to manipulate the auction     securities market in violation of federal antitrust laws. The     actions were filed, respectively, on behalf of putative classes     of issuers of and investors in auction rate securities and seek,     among other things, treble damages in an unspecified amount.     Defendants motion to dismiss was granted on     January 26, 2010. On March 1, 2010, the     plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the dismissal of their     complaints.     Private Equity-Sponsored Acquisitions     Litigation.  Group Inc. and GS Capital     Partners are among numerous private equity firms and     investment banks named as defendants in a federal antitrust     action filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of     Massachusetts in December 2007. As amended, the complaint     generally alleges that the defendants have colluded to limit     competition in bidding for private     equity-sponsored     acquisitions of public companies, thereby resulting in lower     prevailing bids and, by extension, less consideration for     shareholders of those companies in violation of Section 1     of the U.S. Sherman Antitrust Act and common law. The     complaint seeks, among other things, treble damages in an     unspecified amount. Defendants moved to dismiss on     August 27, 2008. The district court dismissed claims     relating to certain transactions that were the subject of     releases as part of the settlement of shareholder actions     challenging such transactions, and by an order dated     December 15, 2008 otherwise denied the motion to     dismiss. On           April 26, 2010, the plaintiffs moved for leave to     proceed with a second phase of discovery encompassing additional     transactions. On August 18, 2010, the court permitted     discovery on eight additional transactions, and the plaintiffs     filed a fourth amended complaint on October 7, 2010.     The defendants filed a motion to dismiss certain aspects of the     fourth amended complaint on October 21, 2010, and the     court granted that motion on January 13, 2011.     Washington Mutual Securities     Litigation.  GS&Co. is among numerous     underwriters named as defendants in a putative securities class     action amended complaint filed on August 5, 2008 in     the U.S. District Court for the Western District of     Washington. As to the underwriters, plaintiffs allege that the     offering documents in connection with various securities     offerings by Washington Mutual, Inc. failed to describe     accurately the companys exposure to     mortgage-related     activities in violation of the disclosure requirements of the     federal securities laws. The defendants include past and present     directors and officers of Washington Mutual, the companys     former outside auditors, and numerous underwriters. By a     decision dated May 15, 2009, the district court     granted in part and denied in part the underwriter     defendants motion to dismiss, with leave to replead and,     on June 15, 2009, plaintiffs filed an amended     complaint. By a decision dated October 27, 2009, the     federal district court granted and denied in part the     underwriters motion to dismiss. On     October 12, 2010, the court granted class     certification (except as to one transaction). On     December 1, 2010, the defendants moved for partial     judgment on the pleadings as to two of the offerings. By a     decision dated January 28, 2011, the district court     denied the defendants motion for partial judgment on the     pleadings.         GS&Co. underwrote approximately $520 million principal     amount of securities to all purchasers in the offerings at issue     in the complaint (excluding those offerings for which the claims     have been dismissed).         On September 25, 2008, the FDIC took over the primary     banking operations of Washington Mutual, Inc. and then sold     them. On September 27, 2008, Washington Mutual, Inc.     filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. bankruptcy     court in Delaware.            199       Table of Contents    THE GOLDMAN SACHS     GROUP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)             IndyMac Pass-Through Certificates     Litigation.  GS&Co. is among numerous     underwriters named as defendants in a putative securities class     action filed on May 14, 2009 in the U.S. District     Court for the Southern District of New York. As to the     underwriters, plaintiffs allege that the offering documents in     connection with various securitizations of     mortgage-related     assets violated the disclosure requirements of the federal     securities laws. The defendants include     IndyMac-related     entities formed in connection with the securitizations, the     underwriters of the offerings, certain ratings agencies which     evaluated the credit quality of the securities, and certain     former officers and directors of IndyMac affiliates. On     November 2, 2009, the underwriters moved to dismiss     the complaint. The motion was granted in part on     February 17, 2010 to the extent of dismissing claims     based on offerings in which no plaintiff purchased, and the     court reserved judgment as to the other aspects of the motion.     By a decision dated June 21, 2010, the district court     formally dismissed all claims relating to offerings in which no     named plaintiff purchased certificates (including all offerings     underwritten by GS&Co.), and both granted and denied the     defendants motions to dismiss in various other respects.     On May 17, 2010, four additional investors filed a     motion seeking to intervene in order to assert claims based on     additional offerings (including two underwritten by     GS&Co.). On July 6, 2010, another additional     investor filed a motion to intervene in order to assert claims     based on additional offerings (none of which were underwritten     by GS&Co.).         GS&Co. underwrote approximately $751 million principal     amount of securities to all purchasers in the offerings at issue     in the May 2010 motion to intervene. On     July 11, 2008, IndyMac Bank was placed under an FDIC     receivership, and on July 31, 2008, IndyMac Bancorp,     Inc. filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the     U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles, California.     Employment-Related Matters.  On     May 27, 2010, a putative class action was filed in the     U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York     by several contingent technology workers who were employees of     third-party     vendors. The plaintiffs are seeking overtime pay for alleged     hours worked in excess of 40 per work week. The complaint     alleges that the plaintiffs were de facto employees of     GS&Co. and that GS&Co. is responsible for the overtime     pay under federal and state overtime laws. The complaint seeks     class action status and unspecified damages.             On September 15, 2010, a putative class action was     filed in the U.S. District for the Southern District of New     York by three former female employees alleging that     Group Inc. and GS&Co. have systematically     discriminated against female employees in respect of     compensation, promotion, assignments, mentoring and performance     evaluations. The complaint alleges a class consisting of all     female employees employed at specified levels by Group Inc.     and GS&Co. since July 2002, and asserts claims under     federal and New York City discrimination laws. The complaint     seeks class action status, injunctive relief and unspecified     amounts of compensatory, punitive and other damages. On     November 22, 2010, Group Inc. and GS&Co.     filed a motion to stay the claims of one of the named plaintiffs     and to compel individual arbitration with that individual, based     on an arbitration provision contained in an employment agreement     between Group Inc. and the individual.

Goldman Sachs is     cooperating with the investigations and reviews.         Group Inc., Goldman Sachs Mitsui Marine Derivative     Products, L.P. (GSMMDP) and GS Bank USA are among numerous     financial services firms that have been named as defendants in     numerous substantially identical individual antitrust actions     filed beginning on November 12, 2009 that have been     coordinated with related antitrust class action litigation and     individual actions, in which no Goldman Sachs affiliate is     named, for     pre-trial     proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Southern     District of New York. The plaintiffs include individual     California municipal entities and three New York     non-profit     entities. On April 26, 2010, the Goldman Sachs     defendants motion to dismiss complaints filed by           several individual California municipal plaintiffs was denied.     All of these complaints against Group Inc., GSMMDP and     GS Bank USA generally allege that the Goldman Sachs     defendants participated in a conspiracy to arrange bids, fix     prices and divide up the market for derivatives used by     municipalities in refinancing and hedging transactions from 1992     to 2008. The complaints assert claims under the federal     antitrust laws and either Californias Cartwright Act or     New Yorks Donnelly Act, and seek, among other things,     treble damages under the antitrust laws in an unspecified amount     and injunctive relief.

Item 9A.  Controls     and Procedures          As of the end of the period covered by this report, an     evaluation was carried out by Goldman Sachs management,     with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief     Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure     controls and procedures (as defined in     Rule 13a-15(e)     under the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief     Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that     these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of     the end of the period covered by this report. In addition, no     change in our internal control over financial reporting (as     defined in     Rule 13a-15(f)     under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fourth quarter of     our fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 that has     materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially     affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The Goldman Sachs Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan     (SIP) was approved by the shareholders of Goldman Sachs at our     2003 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and is a successor plan     to The Goldman Sachs 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (1999 Plan),     which was approved by our shareholders immediately prior to our     initial public offering in May 1999 and under which no     additional awards have been granted since approval of the SIP.          2.        Includes: (i) 55,247,865 shares of common stock that     may be issued upon exercise of outstanding options;     (ii) 60,780,875 shares that may be issued pursuant to     outstanding restricted stock units; and     (iii) 69,063 shares that may be issued pursuant to     outstanding performance-based units granted under the SIP. These     awards are subject to vesting and other conditions to the extent     set forth in the respective award agreements, and the underlying     shares will be delivered net of any required tax withholding.          3.        This weighted-average exercise price relates only to the options     described in footnote 2. Shares underlying restricted stock     units and performance-based units are deliverable without the     payment of any consideration, and therefore these awards have     not been taken into account in calculating the weighted-average     exercise price.          4.        Represents shares remaining to be issued under the SIP,     excluding shares reflected in the second column. The total     number of shares of common stock that may be delivered pursuant     to awards granted under the SIP through the end of our 2008     fiscal year could not exceed 250 million shares. The total     number of shares of common stock that may be delivered pursuant     to awards granted under the SIP in our 2009 fiscal year and each     fiscal year thereafter cannot exceed 5% of the issued and     outstanding shares of common stock, determined as of the last     day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, increased by the     number of shares available for awards in previous years but not     covered by awards granted in such years. There are no shares     remaining to be issued under the 1999 Plan other than those     reflected in the second column.               Item 13.
