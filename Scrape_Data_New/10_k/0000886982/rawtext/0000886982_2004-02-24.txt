Business  Overview        Goldman Sachs is a leading global investment banking, securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of services worldwide to a substantial and diversified client base.

Business Segments        Our activities are divided into three segments:               Investment Banking;                 Trading and Principal Investments; and                 Asset Management and Securities Services.        2    Table of Contents        During 2003, we made certain changes to our segment reporting structure. These changes included:               reclassifying equity commissions and clearing and     execution fees from the Commissions component of the Asset     Management and Securities Services segment to the Equities     component of the Trading and Principal Investments segment;                 reclassifying merchant banking overrides from the     Commissions component of the Asset Management and Securities     Services segment to the Principal Investments component of the     Trading and Principal Investments segment; and                 reclassifying the matched book businesses from     the Securities Services component of the Asset Management and     Securities Services segment to the Fixed Income, Currency and     Commodities (FICC) component of the Trading and Principal     Investments segment.               These reclassifications did not affect our previously reported consolidated results of operations. Prior period segment operating results have been changed to conform to the new segment reporting structure.         The following table sets forth the net revenues, operating expenses and pre-tax earnings of our segments:   Operating Results by Segment  (in millions)                                          Year Ended November          2003  2002  2001             Investment Banking:                               Net revenues         $ 2,711     $ 2,830     $ 3,836         Operating expenses           2,504       2,454       3,117                                  Pre-tax earnings         $ 207     $ 376     $ 719                                Trading and Principal Investments:                                Net revenues         $ 10,443     $ 8,647     $ 9,570         Operating expenses           6,938       6,505       7,310                                  Pre-tax earnings         $ 3,505     $ 2,142     $ 2,260                                Asset Management and Securities     Services:                                Net revenues         $ 2,858     $ 2,509     $ 2,405         Operating expenses           1,890       1,562       1,325                                  Pre-tax earnings         $ 968     $ 947     $ 1,080                                Total                                     Net revenues         $ 16,012     $ 13,986     $ 15,811         Operating expenses(1)           11,567       10,733       12,115                                  Pre-tax earnings         $ 4,445     $ 3,253     $ 3,696                                        (1)   Includes the following expenses that have not     been allocated to our segments: (i) the amortization of     employee initial public offering awards of $80 million,     $212 million and $363 million for the years ended     November 2003, November 2002 and November 2001, respectively,     and (ii) provisions for a number of litigation and     regulatory proceedings of $155 million for the year ended     November 2003.        3    Table of Contents        These segments consist of various products and activities that are set forth in the following chart:                     Business Segment/Component  Primary Products and Activities          Investment Banking:              Financial Advisory     Mergers and acquisitions advisory     services                Financial restructuring advisory     services               Underwriting     Equity and debt underwriting                Trading and Principal Investments:              FICC     Commodities and commodity     derivatives, including our power generation business              Credit products  including     investment-grade corporate securities, high-yield securities,     bank loans, municipal securities, emerging market debt and     credit derivatives              Currencies and currency derivatives              Interest rate products      including interest rate derivatives and global government     securities              Money market instruments, including     the matched book              Mortgage-backed securities and loans               Equities     Equity securities and derivatives              Securities, futures and options     clearing services              Specialist and market-making services     in securities and options               Principal Investments     Principal investments in connection     with merchant banking activities                Investment in the convertible     preferred stock of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc.

We provide a broad range of investment banking services to a diverse group of corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals and seek to develop and maintain long-term relationships with these clients as their lead investment bank.         Our current structure, which is organized by regional, industry and product groups, seeks to combine client-focused investment bankers with execution and industry expertise. Because our businesses are global, we have adapted our organization to meet the demands of our clients in each geographic region. Through our commitment to teamwork, we believe that we provide services in an integrated fashion for the benefit of our clients.         Our Investment Banking segment is divided into two components:               Financial Advisory.     Financial Advisory includes     advisory assignments with respect to mergers and acquisitions,     divestitures, corporate defense activities, restructurings and     spin-offs; and                 Underwriting.     Underwriting includes public     offerings and private placements of equity and debt instruments.                  Financial Advisory          Goldman Sachs is a leading investment bank in worldwide mergers and acquisitions. Our mergers and acquisitions capabilities are evidenced by our significant share of assignments in large, complex transactions for which we provide multiple services, including one-stop acquisition financing and cross-border structuring expertise, as well as services in other areas of the firm, such as currency hedging.            Underwriting          We underwrite a wide range of securities and other financial instruments, including common and preferred stock, convertible and exchangeable securities, investment-grade debt, high-yield debt, sovereign and emerging market debt, municipal debt, bank loans, asset-backed securities and real estate-related securities, such as mortgage-backed securities and the securities of real estate investment trusts.         Equity Underwriting. Equity underwriting has been a long-term core strength of Goldman Sachs. As with mergers and acquisitions, we have been particularly successful in winning mandates for large, complex equity underwritings. We believe our leadership in worldwide initial public offerings and worldwide public common stock offerings reflects our expertise in complex transactions, prior experience and distribution capabilities.         Debt Underwriting. We engage in the underwriting and origination of various types of debt instruments, including investment-grade debt securities, high-yield debt securities, bank and bridge loans and emerging market debt securities, which instruments may be issued by, among others, corporate, sovereign and agency issuers. In addition, we underwrite and originate structured securities, which include asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations. We have employed a focused approach in debt underwriting, emphasizing high value-added areas in servicing our clients.   Trading and Principal Investments        Trading and Principal Investments represented 65% of 2003 net revenues. Trading and Principal Investments facilitates customer transactions with a diverse group of corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals and takes proprietary positions through market making in, and trading of, fixed income and equity products, currencies, commodities and  5    Table of Contents  derivatives on such products. In addition, we engage in floor-based and electronic market making as a specialist on U.S. equities and options exchanges and we clear customer transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide. In connection with our merchant banking and other investment activities, we make principal investments directly and through funds that we raise and manage.          In order to meet the needs of our clients, Trading and Principal Investments is diversified across a wide range of products. We believe our willingness and ability to take risk distinguishes us from many of our competitors and substantially enhances our client relationships.         Our Trading and Principal Investments segment is divided into three components:               Fixed Income, Currency and     Commodities. We make markets in     and trade interest rate and credit products, mortgage-backed     securities and loans, currencies and commodities, structure and     enter into a wide variety of derivative transactions, and engage     in proprietary trading;                 Equities. We     make markets in, act as a specialist for, and trade equities and     equity-related products, structure and enter into equity     derivative transactions, and engage in proprietary trading. We     also execute and clear customer transactions on major stock,     options and futures exchanges worldwide; and                 Principal     Investments. Principal Investments     primarily represents net revenues from our merchant banking     investments, including the increased share of the income and     gains derived from our merchant banking funds when the return on     a funds investments exceeds certain threshold returns     (merchant banking overrides), as well as unrealized gains or     losses on our investment in the convertible preferred stock of     Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG).                  Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities and     Equities          FICC and Equities are large and diversified operations through which we engage in a variety of customer-driven and proprietary trading activities.         In their customer-driven businesses, FICC and Equities strive to deliver high-quality service by offering broad market-making and market knowledge to our clients on a global basis. In addition, we use our expertise to take positions in markets, often by committing capital and taking risk, to facilitate customer transactions and provide liquidity. Our willingness to make markets in a broad range of fixed income, currency, commodity and equity products and their derivatives is crucial both to our client relationships and to support our underwriting business by providing secondary market liquidity.         We generate trading net revenues from our customer-driven businesses in three ways.               First, in large, highly liquid markets, we     undertake a high volume of transactions for modest spreads and     fees.                 Second, by capitalizing on our strong market     relationships and capital position, we undertake transactions in     less liquid markets where spreads and fees are generally larger.                 Finally, we generate net revenues from     structuring and executing transactions that address complex     client needs.               In our proprietary activities in both FICC and Equities, we assume a variety of risks and devote resources to identify, analyze and benefit from these exposures. We leverage our strong proprietary research capabilities and capitalize on our analytical models to analyze information and make informed trading judgments. For example, as part of our FICC credit and mortgage products businesses, we have expanded and expect to continue to expand the extent to which we make principal investments in portfolios and single issues of distressed debt as well as other  6    Table of Contents  special situation investments. In our proprietary activities, we seek to benefit from perceived disparities in the value of assets in the trading markets and from macroeconomic and company-specific trends.          Although FICC and Equities involve distinct product areas, we have recently increased coordination among their businesses. Among the steps we have taken are to integrate, to an increasing extent, management of FICC and Equities and to integrate the facilities and personnel of some of our FICC and Equities businesses, especially in Europe and Asia. We have also merged substantially all of our risk management functions for FICC and Equities. We expect to continue to increase the integration and coordination of these businesses in the future, as we respond to what we believe is client demand for more centralized services and as we attempt to take advantage of perceived synergies.         We believe that our trading and market-making capabilities are key ingredients to our success. While these businesses have generally earned attractive returns, we have in the past incurred significant trading losses in periods of market turbulence, such as in 1994 and the second half of 1998, and from time to time in connection with large block trades.         In both our customer-driven and proprietary activities in FICC and Equities, we manage our exposure to credit and other financial risks on a global basis across all our products. Our trading risk management process seeks to balance our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential losses. As part of this process, we analyze not only market risk but also credit and other financial risks. Risk management includes input from all levels of Goldman Sachs, from the trading desks to the Firmwide Risk Committee. For a further discussion of our risk management policies and procedures, see Managements Discussion and Analysis  Risk Management in the 2003 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated by reference in Part II, Items 7 and 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.         FICC. FICCs principal businesses are:               Commodities and commodity derivatives, including     our power generation business;                 Credit products, including investment-grade     corporate securities, high-yield securities, bank loans,     municipal securities, credit derivatives and emerging market     debt;                 Currencies and currency derivatives;                 Interest rate products, including interest rate     derivatives and global government securities;                 Money market instruments, including the matched     book; and                 Mortgage-backed securities and loans.               A core activity in FICC is market making in a broad array of securities and products. For example, we are a primary dealer in many of the largest government bond markets around the world, including the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom. We are a member of the major futures exchanges, and also have interbank dealer status in the currency markets in New York, London, Tokyo and Hong Kong.         Our FICC research capabilities enhance our ability to provide high-quality products and service to our clients and include quantitative and qualitative analyses of global economic, currency and financial market trends, as well as credit analyses of corporate and sovereign fixed income securities.         As part of our commodities business, we recently acquired equity interests in East Coast Power L.L.C. and Cogentrix Energy, Inc., companies engaged in the power generation business. As of February 1, 2004, we indirectly owned interests in 26 power plants located in the United States and one plant located outside of the United States.  7    Table of Contents        Equities. In 2003, we reorganized certain of our Equities businesses. Our Equities principal businesses are:               Equities Products Group;                 Exchange-Based Trading; and                 Principal Strategies.               Equities Products Group. Our equities products group (EPG) includes primarily customer-driven activities in the shares, convertible securities and derivatives businesses of the firm. These activities also include clearing client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide.         We trade equity securities and equity-related products (such as convertible securities, options, futures and over-the counter (OTC) derivative instruments) on a global basis as an agent, as a market maker or otherwise as a principal. As a principal, we facilitate customer transactions, often by committing capital and taking risk, to provide liquidity to clients with large blocks of stocks or options. For example, we are active in the execution of large block trades (trades of 50,000 or more shares).         We are a member of most of the worlds major stock, options and futures exchanges, including those located in New York, Chicago, London, Paris, Frankfurt, Tokyo and Hong Kong. We are a designated market maker in over 3,000 stocks traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market.         In the options and futures markets, we structure, distribute and execute derivatives on market indices, industry groups and individual company stocks to facilitate customer transactions and our proprietary activities. We develop quantitative strategies and render advice with respect to portfolio hedging and restructuring and asset allocation transactions. We also create specially tailored instruments to enable sophisticated investors to undertake hedging strategies and establish or liquidate investment positions. We are one of the leading participants in the trading and development of equity derivative instruments. We are an active participant in the trading of futures and options on most of the major exchanges in the United States, Europe and Asia.         Exchange-Based Trading. Our exchange-based trading business includes our stock, option and exchange traded funds (ETF) specialist businesses. We engage in floor-based and electronic market making as a specialist on U.S. equities and options exchanges. In the United States, for stocks, we are one of the leading specialists on the NYSE. For options, we are a specialist on the American Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the International Securities Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. For ETFs, we are a specialist on the American Stock Exchange and the NYSE.         Principal Strategies. Our equities principal strategies business includes equity arbitrage, as well as other proprietary trading in equity and related securities, including convertible securities and derivatives. Equity arbitrage includes, among other strategies, relative value trading (which involves trading strategies to take advantage of perceived discrepancies in the relative value of financial instruments, including debt and equity instruments), statistical arbitrage (which involves trading strategies based on analyses of historical price relationships among sectors of the equities markets) and risk arbitrage (which focuses on event-oriented special situations such as corporate restructurings, recapitalizations, mergers and acquisitions and legal and regulatory events).            Principal Investments          In connection with our merchant banking activities, we invest by making principal investments directly and through funds that we raise and manage. Principal investments also includes our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG, which we acquired on February 7, 2003.  8    Table of Contents        As of November 2003, we managed private investment funds with total equity capital commitments from our clients and from Goldman Sachs of $39.05 billion, including funded amounts; Goldman Sachs also had outstanding commitments to invest up to $1.38 billion. The funds investments generate capital appreciation or depreciation and, upon disposition, realized gains or losses. See  Asset Management and Securities Services  Asset Management  Merchant Banking for a discussion of our merchant banking funds. As of November 2003, the aggregate carrying value of our principal investments held directly or through our merchant banking funds was approximately $3.76 billion. These carrying values were comprised of corporate principal investments with an aggregate carrying value of approximately $1.27 billion, real estate investments with an aggregate carrying value of approximately $799 million and our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG with a carrying value of $1.68 billion. Principal Investments includes revenues from the increased share of the income and gains derived from our merchant banking funds when the return on a funds investments exceeds certain threshold returns (typically referred to as an override).   Asset Management and Securities Services        The components of the Asset Management and Securities Services segment, which represented 18% of 2003 net revenues, are set forth below:               Asset Management.     Asset Management provides     investment advisory and financial planning services to a diverse     client base of institutions and individuals and generates     revenues in the form of management and incentive fees; and                 Securities Services.     Securities Services includes prime     brokerage, financing services and securities lending, all of     which generate revenues primarily in the form of interest rate     spreads or fees.                  Asset Management          We offer a broad array of investment strategies, advice and planning across all major asset classes: equity, fixed income (including money markets) and currency and alternative investment products (i.e., investment vehicles with non-traditional investment strategies and techniques).         Assets under management typically generate fees based on a percentage of their value or on their performance and include our mutual funds, separate accounts managed for institutional and individual investors, our merchant banking funds and other alternative investment funds. We also earn trading commissions on assets in brokerage accounts of high-net-worth individuals (which revenues are included in the Equities component of our Trading and Principal Investments segment), although the trend in our private wealth management business has been away from traditional brokerage accounts that generate commission revenue to accounts that pay fees based on the assets under management.  9    Table of Contents        The amount of assets under management is set forth in the graph below. In the following graph, as well as in the following tables, substantially all assets under management are valued as of calendar month end.   Assets Under Management  (in billions)            The following table sets forth assets under management by asset class:   Assets Under Management by Asset Class  (in billions)                                         As of November          2003(2)  2002  2001              Asset Class                              Money markets         $ 89     $ 108     $ 122       Fixed income and currency           115       96       71       Equity           98       86       96       Alternative investments(1)           71       58       62                                Total         $ 373     $ 348     $ 351                                        (1)   Includes merchant banking funds,     quantitatively-driven investment funds and other funds with     non-traditional investment strategies and techniques that we     manage, as well as funds where we recommend one or more     subadvisors for our clients.            (2)   Includes $4 billion in non-money-market     assets acquired in our combination with The Ayco Company, L.P.,     a leading provider of sophisticated, fee-based financial     counseling in the United States that we acquired on July 1,     2003.               Clients. Our clients are institutions, high-net-worth individuals and retail investors. We access institutional and high-net-worth clients through both direct and third-party channels and retail clients through third-party channels. Our institutional clients include pension funds, governmental organizations, corporations, insurance companies, foundations and endowments. In the third-party distribution channels, we distribute our mutual funds and separate managed accounts through brokerage firms, banks, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries. Our clients are located worldwide.  10    Table of Contents        The table below sets forth the amount of assets under management by distribution channel and client category as of November 2003:   Assets Under Management by Distribution Channel  (in billions)                        Assets Under       Management(1)  Primary Investment Vehicles             Directly Distributed                              Institutional         $ 134      Separate managed accounts                 High-net-worth individuals           105      Commingled vehicles, such     as  mutual funds and  private     investment funds     Brokerage accounts     Separate managed accounts           Third-party distributed                              Institutional,     high-net-worth and retail           116      Commingled vehicles     Separate managed accounts                         Total         $ 355                                  (1)   Excludes $18.47 billion in certain of our     merchant banking funds.               Merchant Banking. Goldman Sachs has sponsored private investment funds in the corporate and real estate merchant banking business with $39.05 billion of committed capital as of November 2003, of which $27.23 billion has been funded. We have provided a portion of those amounts. See  Trading and Principal Investments  Principal Investments above. Our clients, including pension plans, endowments, charitable institutions and high-net-worth individuals, have provided the remainder.         Our strategy with respect to our merchant banking funds generally is to invest opportunistically to build a portfolio of investments that is diversified by industry, product type, geographic region and transaction structure and type. Some of these investment funds pursue, on a global basis, long-term investments in equity and debt securities in privately negotiated transactions, leveraged buyouts and acquisitions. As of November 2003, our corporate merchant banking funds had total committed capital of $26.96 billion. Other funds, with total committed capital of $12.09 billion as of November 2003, invest in real estate operating companies, debt and equity interests in real estate assets, and other real estate-related investments.         Merchant banking activities generate three revenue streams. First, we receive a management fee that is generally a percentage of a funds committed capital, invested capital, total gross acquisition cost or asset value. These annual management fees are included in our Asset Management revenues. Second, Goldman Sachs, as a substantial investor in these funds, is allocated its proportionate share of the funds unrealized appreciation or depreciation arising from changes in fair value as well as gains and losses upon realization. Third, after the fund has achieved a minimum return for fund investors, we receive an increased share of the funds income and gains that is a percentage of the income and gains from the funds investments. The second and third of these revenue streams are included in net revenues of the Principal Investments component of our Trading and Principal Investments segment.  11    Table of Contents           Securities Services          Securities Services activities include prime brokerage, financing services and securities lending. We provide these services to a diversified U.S. and international customer base, including mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, foundations, endowments and high-net-worth individuals.         We offer prime brokerage services to our clients, allowing them the flexibility to trade with most brokers while maintaining a single source for financing and consolidated portfolio reports. Our prime brokerage activities provide clearing and custody in 50 markets (with revenues from clearing and custody included in the Equities component of the Trading and Principal Investments segment), consolidated multi-currency accounting and reporting and offshore fund administration. Additionally, we provide financing to our clients for their securities trading activities through margin and securities loans that are collateralized by securities, cash or other acceptable collateral held in the clients account.         Securities lending activities principally involve the borrowing and lending of equity securities to cover customer and Goldman Sachs short sales and otherwise to make deliveries into the market. In addition, we are an active participant in the broker-to-broker securities lending business and the third-party agency lending business.   Global Investment Research        Our Global Investment Research Division provides fundamental research on companies, industries, economies, currencies, commodities and portfolio and quantitative strategy on a worldwide basis.         Global Investment Research employs a team approach that as of November 2003 provided research coverage of approximately 1,750 companies worldwide, over 50 economies and 25 stock markets. This is accomplished by six departments:               the Americas Equity Research Department, the     Europe Equity Research Department and the Asia Equity Research     Department all provide fundamental analysis, forecasts and     investment opinions for companies and industries in their     respective regions. Equity research analysts are organized     regionally by industry teams, which allows for extensive     collaboration and knowledge sharing among analysts on important     investment themes;                 the Economic Research Department, which has a     presence in the Americas, Europe and Asia, formulates     macroeconomic forecasts for economic activity, foreign exchange     and interest rates based on the globally coordinated views of     its regional economists;                 the Commodities Research Department, which has a     presence in London and New York, provides research on the global     commodity markets; and                 the Strategy Department, which includes Portfolio     and Quantitative Strategy and has a presence in the Americas,     Europe and Asia, formulates equity market forecasts and provides     opinions on both asset and industry sector allocation.               Further information regarding research at Goldman Sachs is provided under  Regulation  Regulations applicable in and outside the United States,  Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business  Legal and Regulatory and Legal Proceedings  Research Independence Matters in Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  12    Table of Contents  Technology Strategy        Goldman Sachs is committed to the ongoing development, maintenance and use of technology throughout the organization. Our technology initiatives can be broadly categorized into four efforts:               enhancing client service through increased     connectivity and the provision of value-added, tailored products     and services;                 improving our trading, execution and clearing     capabilities;                 risk management; and                 overall efficiency, productivity and control.               We have tailored our services to our clients by providing them with electronic access to our products and services. In particular, we have extended our global electronic trading and information distribution capabilities to our clients via the Internet and other forms of electronic connectivity. These capabilities cover many of our fixed income, currency, commodity, equity and mutual fund products around the world. We have also used the Internet to improve the ease and quality of communication with our institutional and high-net-worth clients.         Internet technology and electronic commerce have changed and will continue to change the ways that securities and other financial products are traded, distributed and settled. This creates both opportunities and challenges for our businesses. We remain committed to being at the forefront of technological innovation in the global capital markets.         We have developed software that enables us to monitor and analyze our market and credit risks. This risk management software not only analyzes market risk on firmwide, divisional and trading desk levels, but also breaks down our risk into its underlying exposures, permitting management to evaluate exposures on the basis of specific interest rate, currency exchange rate, equity price or commodity price changes. To assist further in the management of our credit exposures, data from many sources are aggregated daily into credit management systems that give senior management and professionals in the Credit and Controllers departments the ability to receive timely information with respect to credit exposures worldwide, including netting information, and the ability to analyze complex risk situations effectively. Our software accesses this data, allows for quick analysis at the level of individual trades, and interacts with other Goldman Sachs systems.         Technology has also been a significant factor in improving the overall efficiency of many areas of Goldman Sachs. By automating many trading procedures and operational and accounting processes, we have substantially increased our efficiency and accuracy.   Employees        Management believes that one of the strengths and principal reasons for the success of Goldman Sachs is the quality and dedication of its people and the shared sense of being part of a team. We strive to maintain a work environment that fosters professionalism, excellence, diversity and cooperation among our employees worldwide.         Instilling the Goldman Sachs culture in all employees is a continuous process, in which training plays an important part. All employees are offered the opportunity to participate in education and periodic seminars that we sponsor at various locations throughout the world. Another important part of instilling the Goldman Sachs culture is our employee review process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors, co-workers and employees they supervise in a 360-degree review process that is integral to our team approach.         As of November 2003, we had 19,476 employees, which excludes employees of Goldman Sachs property management subsidiaries. Substantially all of the costs of the property  13    Table of Contents  management employees are reimbursed to Goldman Sachs by the real estate investment funds to which these subsidiaries provide property management services.    Competition        The financial services industry  and all of our businesses  are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. Our competitors are other brokers and dealers, investment banking firms, insurance companies, investment advisors, mutual funds, hedge funds, commercial banks and merchant banks. We compete with some of our competitors globally and with others on a regional, product or niche basis. Our competition is based on a number of factors, including transaction execution, our products and services, innovation, reputation and price.         We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees.         In recent years, there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry, due in part to U.S. federal legislation that has expanded the activities permissible for firms affiliated with a U.S. bank. In particular, a number of large commercial banks, insurance companies and other broad-based financial services firms have established or acquired broker-dealers or have merged with other financial institutions. Many of these firms have the ability to offer a wide range of products, from loans, deposit-taking and insurance to brokerage, asset management and investment banking services, which may enhance their competitive position. They also have the ability to support investment banking and securities products with commercial banking, insurance and other financial services revenues in an effort to gain market share, which could result in pricing pressure in our businesses.         Moreover, we have faced, and expect to continue to face, pressure to retain market share by committing capital to businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may not be commensurate with their risks. In particular, corporate clients sometimes seek to require such commitments from financial services firms in connection with investment banking assignments. In 2003, we established the William Street entities, through which we have issued commitments to lend to counterparties, primarily investment grade clients. Substantially all of the credit risk associated with these commitments has been hedged through credit loss protection provided to Goldman Sachs by SMFG. These arrangements may not be sufficient, however, to fully satisfy our clients desire for capital commitments. In addition, the credit loss protection is limited generally to 95% of the first loss Goldman Sachs realizes on approved investment-grade loan commitments, subject to a maximum of $1 billion, and 70% of the second loss on such commitments, subject to a maximum of $1.125 billion. See Managements Discussion and Analysis and Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the William Street entities, and our Current Report on Form 8-K, dated January 15, 2003, for a description of the credit loss protection provided by SMFG.         The trend toward consolidation and convergence has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitors. This trend has also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions. In order to take advantage of some of our most significant challenges and opportunities, we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions that are larger and better-capitalized and that may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history outside the United States.         We have experienced intense price competition in some of our businesses in recent years. There has been considerable pressure in the pricing of large block trades, including situations where the bidding dealers may not have been able to pre-market the securities. Also, equity and debt underwriting discounts, as well as trading spreads, have been under pressure for a number of years and the ability to execute trades electronically, through the Internet and through other  14    Table of Contents  alternative trading systems, has increased the pressure on trading commissions. It appears that this trend toward alternative trading systems will continue. We own interests in and participate in a number of these trading systems. Moreover, the introduction of decimalization has led to a reduction in the revenues of our specialist business and to the implementation of a fee-based pricing structure in our Nasdaq trading business. We believe that we will experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices.          The trading of futures on single stocks commenced in November 2002. It is too early to tell whether the introduction of single stock futures contracts will have a long-term adverse impact on the businesses of Goldman Sachs. While commissions and clearing fees may increase, other aspects of our business, in particular, our OTC derivative business, may be adversely affected.   Regulation        Goldman Sachs, as a participant in the securities and commodity futures and options industries, is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and elsewhere. As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies in the United States and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of customers participating in those markets. They are not, however, charged with protecting the interests of Goldman Sachs shareholders or creditors.         Broker-dealers, in particular, are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of customers funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping, the financing of customers purchases, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. A number of our affiliates are regulated by investment advisory laws in and outside the United States. Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, either in the United States or elsewhere, may directly affect the operation and profitability of Goldman Sachs.         Regulation in the United States        In the United States, the SEC is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws. Our principal broker-dealer in the United States is Goldman, Sachs & Co., which is registered as a broker-dealer and as an investment adviser with the SEC and as a broker-dealer in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Self-regulatory organizations, such as the NYSE and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., adopt rules that apply to, and examine, broker-dealers such as Goldman, Sachs & Co. In addition, state securities and other regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over Goldman, Sachs & Co. Similarly, our businesses are also subject to regulation by various non-U.S. governmental and regulatory bodies and self-regulatory authorities in virtually all countries where we have offices. Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, L.P. and certain of its affiliates are registered U.S. broker-dealers and are regulated by the SEC, the NYSE and the NASD. Goldman Sachs Financial Markets, L.P. is registered with the SEC as an OTC derivatives dealer and conducts certain OTC derivatives businesses previously conducted by other affiliates.         The commodity futures and commodity options industry in the United States is subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is the federal agency charged with the administration of the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder. Several of Goldman Sachs subsidiaries, including Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, L.P., are registered with the CFTC and act as futures commission merchants, commodity pool operators or commodity trading advisors and are subject to the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder. The rules and regulations of various self-regulatory organizations, such as the Chicago Board of Trade, other futures  15    Table of Contents  exchanges and the National Futures Association, also govern the commodity futures and commodity options businesses of these entities.          As a registered broker-dealer and member of various self-regulatory organizations, Goldman, Sachs & Co. is subject to the SECs uniform net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1. This rule specifies the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a significant part of its assets be kept in relatively liquid form. Goldman, Sachs & Co. is also subject to the net capital requirements of the CFTC and various securities and commodity exchanges. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.         The SEC and various self-regulatory organizations impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, limit the ratio of subordinated debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the SECs uniform net capital rule imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the SEC for certain withdrawals of capital.         Goldman Sachs has established The Goldman Sachs Trust Company, N.A., a national bank limited to fiduciary activities, in order to provide personal trust and estate administration and related services to its high-net-worth clients on a nationwide basis. GSTC maintains collective investment funds for eligible pension and profit sharing plan clients. As a national bank, GSTC is subject to regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and is a member bank of the Federal Reserve System. GSTC will not accept deposits or make loans and, as a result, it is not considered to be a bank for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act. It also does not carry FDIC insurance and is not subject to the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act.         The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, enacted in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various new regulations applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services companies, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities. Through these and other provisions, the USA PATRIOT Act seeks to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. Anti-money-laundering laws outside of the United States contain some similar provisions. The increased obligations of financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, to identify their customers, watch for and report suspicious transactions, respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and share information with other financial institutions, requires the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls which have increased, and may continue to increase, our costs and may subject us to liability.         In addition, our power generation business is subject to extensive and evolving energy, environmental and other governmental laws and regulations, as discussed under  Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business  Investments in the Power Generation Industry.         Regulation Outside of the United States        Goldman Sachs is an active participant in the international fixed income and equities markets. Many of our affiliates that participate in these markets are subject to comprehensive regulations that include some form of capital adequacy rules and other customer protection rules. Goldman Sachs provides investment services in and from the United Kingdom under the regulation of the Financial Services Authority (FSA). Various Goldman Sachs entities are regulated by the banking and regulatory authorities of the other European countries in which Goldman Sachs operates, including, among others, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority  16    Table of Contents  (BaFin) and the Bundesbank in Germany, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers and Banque de France in France, the Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa (CONSOB) in Italy and the Swiss Federal Banking Commission. Goldman Sachs entities are also regulated by the European securities, derivatives and commodities exchanges of which they are members. The investment services that are subject to oversight by the FSA and other European regulators are regulated in accordance with European Union directives requiring, among other things, compliance with certain capital adequacy standards, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. These standards, requirements and rules are similarly implemented, under the same directives, throughout the European Union and are broadly comparable in scope and purpose to the regulatory capital and customer protection requirements imposed under the SEC and CFTC rules. European Union directives also permit local regulation in each jurisdiction, including those in which we operate, to be more restrictive than the requirements of such directives and these local requirements can result in certain competitive disadvantages to Goldman Sachs.          In addition, the Financial Services Agency, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Osaka Securities Exchange, The Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange and the Japan Securities Dealers Association in Japan, the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, among others, regulate various of our subsidiaries in Asia and also have capital standards and other requirements comparable to the rules of the SEC.         The European Financial Groups Directive (Directive 2002/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council) introduced certain changes to the way in which financial conglomerates and other financial services organizations operating in Europe will be regulated, with the changes to be implemented by member states for fiscal years beginning in 2005. These changes may affect the regulation of our European subsidiaries, and may have the effect of causing activities that are currently conducted in unregulated entities to become subject to certain forms of regulation, including consolidated supervision and capital adequacy requirements.         The SEC proposed new rules in October 2003 that would establish voluntary regulatory frameworks for the supervision of broker-dealers and their affiliates on a consolidated basis and, to comply with the requirements of the European Financial Groups Directive, it is possible that we may elect to become subject to such consolidated supervision by the SEC. If we become subject to such a framework, we will be required to comply with stringent rules regarding, among others, our group-wide internal risk management control system, recordkeeping and periodic reporting, including reporting of consolidated computations of allowable capital and risk allowances consistent with the standards adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which standards are currently being revised.         We continue to work with our regulators to understand the impact of these changes. We cannot fully predict the practical effect that any of these actions by the European Union, the SEC and the Basel Committee will have on our business. However, these rules, to the extent they ultimately apply to our businesses, may impose additional costs, affect our decisions with respect to raising and using capital and adversely affect our business.         Regulations Applicable in and Outside the United States        The U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies, regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the United States, are empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer or its directors, officers or employees. Occasionally, our subsidiaries have been subject to investigations and proceedings, and sanctions have been imposed for infractions of various regulations relating to our activities, none of which has had a material adverse effect on us or our businesses.  17    Table of Contents        Compliance with the net capital requirements of U.S. and non-U.S. regulators could limit those operations of our subsidiaries that require the intensive use of capital, such as underwriting and trading activities, specialist activities and the financing of customer account balances, and also could restrict our ability to withdraw capital from our regulated subsidiaries, which in turn could limit our ability to repay debt or pay dividends on our common stock.         Our specialist businesses are subject to extensive regulation by a number of securities exchanges. The rules of these exchanges generally require our specialists to maintain orderly markets in the securities in which they are specialists. These requirements, in turn, may require us to commit significant amounts of capital to our specialist businesses. Recently, certain NYSE specialist firms, including our specialist unit, agreed in principle to a global settlement with the SEC and the NYSE to resolve investigations into their activities as NYSE specialists during the years 1999 through 2003. We discuss this global settlement in principle and the related investigations under Legal Proceedings  Specialist Matters in Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and under  Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business  Legal and Regulatory. In addition, changes to the rules and regulations governing stock markets and the conduct of specialists on those markets, including the NYSE, may impose additional costs on us, adversely affect our specialist businesses or impair the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets relating to those businesses.         The research areas of investment banks have been and remain the subject of increased regulatory scrutiny. In 2002 and 2003, acting in part pursuant to a mandate contained in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC, the NYSE and the NASD adopted rules imposing heightened restrictions on the interaction between equity research analysts and investment banking personnel at member securities firms. Various non-U.S. jurisdictions have also changed or proposed to change their requirements with respect to research. In addition, in 2003, several leading securities firms operating in the United States, including Goldman, Sachs & Co., reached a settlement with certain federal and state securities regulators and self-regulatory organizations to resolve investigations into their equity research analysts alleged conflicts of interest pursuant to which the firms have been subject to certain restrictions and undertakings. As part of this settlement, restrictions have been imposed on the interaction between research and investment banking departments and these securities firms are required to fund the provision of independent research to their customers.         In connection with the research settlement, the firm has also subscribed to a voluntary initiative imposing restrictions on the allocation of shares in initial public offerings to executives and directors of public companies. The FSA in the United Kingdom has recently imposed new requirements on the conduct of the allocation process in equity and fixed income securities offerings (including initial public offerings and secondary distributions). We cannot fully predict the practical effect that such restrictions or measures will have on our business, and the SEC, NYSE and NASD and non-U.S. regulators such as the FSA may adopt additional and more stringent rules with respect to offering procedures and the management of conflicts of interest in the future.   Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business        Market Conditions        As an investment banking, securities and investment management firm, our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. Although business conditions improved somewhat in the second half of 2003, in recent years we have been operating in a very challenging environment: the number and size of equity underwritings and mergers and acquisitions transactions have declined significantly; the equities markets in the United States and elsewhere have been volatile and are at levels below their record highs; investors have  18    Table of Contents  exhibited concerns over the integrity of the financial markets as a result of highly publicized financial scandals; and the attention of management of many clients has been diverted from capital-raising transactions and acquisitions and dispositions in part as a result of corporate governance regulations, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and related uncertainty in capital markets.          Adverse or uncertain economic and market conditions have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our business and profitability in many ways, including the following:               We have been committing increasing amounts of     capital in many of our businesses and generally maintain large     trading, specialist and investment positions. Market     fluctuations and volatility may adversely affect the value of     those positions, including our interest rate and credit     products, currency, commodity and equity positions and our     merchant banking investments, or may reduce our willingness to     enter into some new transactions.                 Industry-wide declines in the size and number of     equity underwritings and mergers and acquisitions may continue     to have an adverse effect on our revenues and, because we may be     unable to reduce expenses correspondingly, our profit margins.     In particular, because a significant portion of our investment     banking revenues are derived from our participation in large     transactions, a decrease in the number of large transactions due     to uncertain or unfavorable market conditions may adversely     affect our investment banking business.                 Pricing and other competitive pressures have     continued, even as the volume and number of investment banking     transactions have started to increase. These pressures have been     particularly intense in the context of large block trades. In     addition, the trend (particularly in the equity underwriting     business) toward multiple book runners and co-managers handling     transactions, where previously there would have been a single     book runner, may adversely affect our business and reduce our     revenues.                 Reductions in the level of the equities markets     also tend to reduce the value of our clients portfolios,     which in turn may reduce the fees we earn for managing assets.     Even in the absence of uncertain or unfavorable economic or     market conditions, investment performance by our asset     management business below the performance of benchmarks or     competitors could result in a decline in assets under management     and therefore in the incentive and management fees we receive.                 Concentration of risk in the past has increased     the losses that we have incurred in our market-making,     proprietary trading, block trading, merchant banking,     underwriting and lending businesses and may continue to do so in     the future. This risk may increase to the extent we expand our     proprietary trading businesses or commit capital to facilitate     primarily client-driven business. For example, block trades are     increasingly being effected without an opportunity for Goldman     Sachs to pre-market the transaction, which increases the risk     Goldman Sachs may be unable to resell the purchased securities     at favorable prices. Moreover, because of concentration of risk,     we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions     are generally favorable for others in the industry.                 We have been operating in a low or declining     interest rate market for the past several years. Increasing or     high interest rates and/or widening credit spreads, especially     if such changes are rapid, may create a less favorable     environment for certain of our businesses.                 The volume of transactions that we execute for     our customers and as a specialist may decline, which would     reduce the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads. In     our specialist businesses, we are obligated by stock exchange     rules to maintain an orderly market, including by purchasing     shares in a declining market. This may result in trading losses     and an increased need for liquidity. Further weakness in global     equities        19    Table of Contents            markets, the trading of securities in multiple     markets and on multiple exchanges and the ongoing NYSE and SEC     investigations into the stock specialist business could     adversely impact our trading businesses and impair the value of     our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.                        Risk Management, Liquidity and     Credit          If any of the variety of instruments and strategies we utilize to hedge or otherwise manage our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses. Our hedging strategies and other risk management techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk.         Liquidity (i.e., ready access to funds) is essential to our businesses. Our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access secured and/or unsecured debt markets, an inability to access funds from our subsidiaries, or an inability to sell assets. This situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us. Further, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time.         Our credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain bilateral provisions in some of our trading and collateralized financing contracts. Under such provisions, counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with Goldman Sachs or require us to post additional collateral. Termination of our trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements.         The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a holding company and, therefore, it depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to fund all payments on its obligations, including debt obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including Goldman, Sachs & Co., are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. needs to make payments on obligations, including debt obligations, or dividend payments. In addition, to the extent that The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (or any other entity) holds equity interests in the firms regulated or unregulated subsidiaries, its rights as an equity holder to the assets of such subsidiaries are subject to the satisfaction of the claims of the creditors of such subsidiaries.         We are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money, securities or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. The amount and duration of our credit exposures have been increasing over the past several years, as has the breadth of the entities to which we have credit exposures. As a clearing member firm, we finance our customer positions and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our customers. In addition, we have experienced, due to competitive factors, pressure to extend credit and price more aggressively the credit risks we take. In particular, corporate clients sometimes seek to require credit commitments from us in connection with investment banking and other assignments. Although we regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect Goldman Sachs.  20    Table of Contents        Operations and Infrastructure        Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies, and the transactions we process have become increasingly complex. If any of our financial, accounting or other data processing systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems, we could suffer an impairment to our liquidity, financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses.         We also face the risk of operational failure or termination of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions. Any such failure or termination could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk.         In addition, despite the contingency plans we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by Goldman Sachs or third parties with which we conduct business. These disruptions may occur, for example, as a result of events that affect only the buildings of Goldman Sachs or such third parties, or as a result of events with a broader impact on the cities where those buildings are located. Nearly all of our employees in our primary locations, including New York, London, Frankfurt, Hong Kong and Tokyo, work in close proximity to each other, in one or more buildings. If a disruption occurs in one location and our employees in that location are unable to communicate with or travel to other locations, our ability to service and interact with our clients may suffer and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel.         Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code, and other events that could have a security impact. If one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients or counterparties confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients, our counterparties or third parties operations. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us.         Legal and Regulatory        Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against Goldman Sachs could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to Goldman Sachs, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. We face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial intermediaries have been increasing.         Goldman Sachs, as a participant in the financial services industry, is subject to extensive regulation in jurisdictions around the world. We face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Among other things, we  21    Table of Contents  could be fined, prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities or subject to limitations or conditions on our business activities. New laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our clients may also adversely affect our businesses.          As discussed under Regulation above, the research areas of investment banks have been and remain the subject of increased regulatory scrutiny which has led to increased restrictions on the interaction between equity research analysts and investment banking personnel at securities firms. Various non-U.S. jurisdictions have also changed or proposed changing their requirements with respect to research matters. In addition, several leading securities firms in the United States, including Goldman, Sachs & Co., have reached a global settlement with certain federal and state securities regulators and self-regulatory organizations to resolve investigations into equity research analysts alleged conflicts of interest pursuant to which the firms have been subject to certain restrictions and undertakings. Certain of these requirements and restrictions may impose costs and limitations on the conduct of our businesses. Current or future civil lawsuits implicating investment research analysts conflicts of interest were not settled as part of the global settlement. Goldman Sachs total potential liability in respect of such civil cases cannot be reasonably estimated but could be material to results of operations in a given period. The global settlement also did not resolve potential charges involving individual employees, including supervisors, and regulatory investigations are continuing.         In addition, the SEC and other federal and state regulators have increased their scrutiny of complex, structured finance transactions and have brought enforcement actions against a number of financial institutions in connection with such transactions. In some of the enforcement actions, clients of the financial institutions allegedly engaged in accounting, disclosure or other violations of the securities laws, and the financial institutions allegedly facilitated these improprieties by entering into transactions with the clients. We seek to create innovative solutions to address our clients needs, and we have entered into, and continue to enter into, structured transactions with clients. While we have policies and procedures in place that are intended to ensure that the structured transactions we enter into comply with applicable laws and regulations, it is possible that certain of these transactions could give rise to litigation or enforcement actions. It is possible that the heightened regulatory scrutiny of, and litigation in connection with, structured finance transactions will make our clients less willing to enter into these transactions, and will adversely affect our business in this area.         Recently, there have been industry-wide and other investigations by federal and state authorities concerning market timing, late trading and other activities involving mutual funds. Federal and state authorities have reportedly made informational requests regarding trading practices broadly across all of the major fund companies and broker-dealers. Goldman Sachs has received requests for information and has been fully cooperating with those authorities. While we believe that we have in place reasonable measures to detect and deter disruptive and abusive trading practices and comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, we cannot predict the course that the existing inquiries and areas of focus may take or the impact that any new laws or regulations governing mutual funds may have on our business.         The NYSE and the SEC have also been conducting investigations into certain trading practices of NYSE specialist firms, including our specialist unit. In February 2004, certain of these NYSE specialist firms, including our specialist unit, agreed in principle to a global settlement with the SEC and the NYSE to resolve charges that the firms violated certain federal securities laws and NYSE rules in connection with their activities as NYSE specialists during the years 1999 through 2003. The global settlement, if ultimately consummated, would involve, among others, restitution and penalties, a censure, cease and desist order and an undetermined form of undertaking. The settlement would not resolve the related civil actions discussed under Legal Proceedings  Specialist Matters in Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or potential regulatory charges against individuals. We cannot predict the impact that the final global  22    Table of Contents  settlement, including any restrictions that may be imposed on the activities of our specialist unit, or new laws or regulations governing specialists may have on our specialist businesses. Depending on the ultimate outcome of these investigations and of the global settlement and any related developments, our specialist businesses may be adversely affected and the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets related to these businesses may be impaired.          There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years, and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases.         Regulatory Impact on Capital Markets        Financial scandals in recent years have led to insecurity and uncertainty in the financial markets and contributed to declines in capital markets. In response to these scandals, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules of the SEC, the NYSE and Nasdaq necessitate significant changes to corporate governance and public disclosure. These provisions generally apply to companies with securities listed on U.S. securities exchanges, and some provisions apply to non-U.S. issuers with securities traded on U.S. securities exchanges. To the extent that private companies, in order to avoid becoming subject to these new requirements, decide to forgo initial public offerings, our equity underwriting business may be adversely affected and our ability to successfully exit some of our merchant banking investments may be adversely affected. Similarly, it is possible that the imposition of those provisions on non-U.S. issuers may make these issuers less likely to list their securities in the United States or undertake merger or acquisition transactions that would result in their securities being listed in the United States. If these measures result in less activity by non-U.S. issuers in the United States, the U.S. capital markets and our investment banking business may be adversely affected.         The provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley and the NYSE and Nasdaq corporate governance rules, coupled with existing economic uncertainty, have diverted many companies attention away from capital market transactions, including securities offerings and acquisition and disposition transactions. It is unclear how long this uncertainty and diversion will last, but so long as it does, it will have a negative impact on our investment banking business. In addition, adopted or proposed accounting and disclosure changes, including those relating to off-balance-sheet entities, may have an adverse effect on our financial advisory and other revenues relating to structured finance transactions.         Competition and Conflicts of Interest        The financial services industry  and all of our businesses  are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including transaction execution, our products and services, innovation, reputation and price. We believe that we may experience pricing pressures in the future as some of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices. In recent years, there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry. U.S. federal legislation, which significantly expanded the activities permissible for firms affiliated with a U.S. bank, may accelerate this consolidation and further increase competition. This trend toward consolidation and convergence has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors. This trend has also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions.         Our reputation is one of our most important assets. As we have expanded the scope of our business and our client base, we increasingly have to address conflicts of interest. We have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to address these issues. However,  23    Table of Contents  appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest.          Technology is fundamental to our overall business strategy. The growth of the Internet and electronic trading, and the introduction of new technologies, is changing our business and presenting us with new challenges. Securities, futures and options transactions are now being conducted through the Internet and other alternative, non-traditional trading systems, and it appears that the trend toward alternative trading systems will continue and probably accelerate. Some of these alternative trading systems compete with our trading businesses, including our specialist businesses. A dramatic increase in electronic trading may adversely affect our commission and trading revenues, including our market-making revenues, reduce our participation in the trading markets and associated access to market information and lead to the creation of new and stronger competitors. These developments may also require us to make additional investments in technology or trading systems and may impair the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.         Recruiting and Employee Retention        Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Competition in the financial services industry for qualified employees is intense. In addition, competition with businesses outside the financial services industry for the most highly skilled individuals has become more intense as the economic downturn has lowered average compensation within the financial services industry significantly. Our continued ability to compete effectively in our businesses depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. Changes in the business environment may cause us to move employees from one business to another or to reduce the number of employees in certain businesses; this may cause temporary disruptions as our employees adapt to new roles and may reduce our ability to take advantage of improvements in the business environment. In addition, current and future laws (including laws relating to immigration and outsourcing) may restrict our ability to move responsibilities or personnel from one jurisdiction to another. This may impact our ability to take advantage of business opportunities or potential efficiencies.         Acquisitions        We expect the growth of our core businesses to come through both internal expansion and acquisitions. To the extent we make acquisitions or enter into combinations, we face numerous risks and uncertainties combining the businesses and systems, including the need to combine accounting and data processing systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with customers and business partners. We may not be able to meet these operational and business challenges.         Investments in the Power Generation Industry        We own equity interests in companies engaged in electric power generation, principally East Coast Power L.L.C. and Cogentrix Energy, Inc. As a result of these interests and future investments that we may make in the power generation industry, we face numerous risks and uncertainties.         We are a relatively new entrant to the power generation business. As a result, we have less expertise and experience in owning power generation businesses than many of our competitors. Our management has limited experience in owning and managing companies engaged in power generation and we may not be successful in owning and managing our power generation facilities. In particular, in the future we may be unable to attract and retain qualified independent contractors and employees.  24    Table of Contents        The operation of power generation facilities may be disrupted. The continued operation of power generation facilities involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of power generation equipment, transmission lines or other equipment or processes, and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. Although our facilities contain various redundancies and back-up mechanisms, a breakdown or failure may prevent the affected facilities from performing under applicable power sales agreements or otherwise operating as planned.         We are subject to extensive and evolving energy, environmental and other governmental laws and regulations. In the past several years, intensified scrutiny of the energy market by federal, state and local authorities and the public has resulted in increased regulatory and legal proceedings involving energy companies, including those engaged in power generation. We may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations relating to power generation, and our overall businesses and reputation may be adversely affected by legal and regulatory proceedings arising out of our power generation business. In particular, our power generation operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among others, air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, site remediation, and health and safety. Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations may require us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, payment of emission fees, and application for, and holding of, permits at our facilities. Our failure to comply with environmental laws or regulations may result in the assessment of severe civil or criminal liabilities against us and the need to expend substantial additional capital for compliance or remediation. Insurance covering some of these environmental risks with respect to our power generation facilities may not be available and the proceeds from insurance recovery, if any, may not be adequate to cover our liabilities in a particular incident. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by an environmental problem at one of our facilities.         We are subject to the risk of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including terrorist attacks and other hostile or catastrophic events. We may not have insurance against these risks and, if we do have insurance, the insurance proceeds may be inadequate to cover our losses.         International Operations        In conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our operations around the world, we are subject to political, economic, legal, operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries, including risks of possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market. Our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular foreign market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally. We are also subject to the risk that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in all cases.         In the last several years, various emerging market countries have experienced severe economic and financial disruptions, including significant devaluations of their currencies, capital and currency exchange controls, and low or negative growth rates in their economies. The possible effects of these conditions include an adverse impact on our businesses and increased volatility in financial markets generally.         Shares Available for Sale        A significant amount of our outstanding shares of common stock are held by our former limited partners. A significant number of these shares are subject to restrictions on transfer that lapse in May 2004. In addition, significant amounts of shares are delivered to our employees as  25    Table of Contents  compensation from time to time, and these shares will generally be freely saleable upon delivery. Future sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock.    Cautionary Statement Pursuant to The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995        We have included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and from time to time our management may make, statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent only our belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of our control. These statements include statements other than historical information or statements of current condition and may relate to our future plans and objectives and results, among other things, and may also include our belief regarding the effect of various legal proceedings, as set forth under Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as statements about the objectives and effectiveness of our liquidity policies, statements about trends in our businesses and statements about our investment banking transaction backlog, incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is possible that our actual results may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results indicated in these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements include, among others, those discussed below and under  Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business.         In the case of statements about our investment banking transaction backlog, such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues that we expect to earn from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval.     Item 2.     Properties        Our principal executive offices are located at 85 Broad Street, New York, New York, and comprise approximately 969,000 square feet of leased space, pursuant to a lease agreement expiring in June 2008 (with options to renew for up to 20 additional years). We also occupy over 680,000 square feet at One New York Plaza under lease agreements expiring primarily in 2009 (with options to renew for up to five additional years), and we lease space at various other locations in the New York metropolitan area. In total, we lease over 5.1 million square feet in the New York metropolitan area, including approximately 1 million square feet under leases expiring in 2004. We have additional offices in the United States and elsewhere in the Americas. Together, these offices comprise approximately 2 million square feet of leased space.         We own approximately four acres of land in Jersey City, New Jersey, a portion of which we are using for the construction of an office building. This project is being developed to complement our offices in lower Manhattan. The initial phase of development is expected to include approximately 1.3 million square feet of office space, with occupancy planned in phases beginning in April 2004.         We also have offices in Europe, Asia and Africa. In Europe, we have offices that total approximately 1.9 million square feet. Our European headquarters is located in London at Peterborough Court, pursuant to a lease expiring in 2016 that covers a property in which we also  26    Table of Contents  have a 50% ownership interest. In total, we lease approximately 1.5 million square feet in London through various leases, relating to various properties.          In Asia, we have offices that total approximately 1.3 million square feet. Our headquarters in this region are in Tokyo, at the Roppongi Hills Mori Tower, and in Hong Kong, at the Cheung Kong Center. In Tokyo, we currently lease 290,918 square feet through a lease that expires in 2018 and 96,961 square feet through a lease that expires in 2005 at the Roppongi Hills Mori Tower. In Hong Kong, we currently lease approximately 300,000 square feet under lease agreements, the majority of which expire in fiscal 2012.         Our occupancy expenses include costs associated with office space held in excess of our current requirements. This excess space, the cost of which is charged to earnings as incurred, is being held for potential growth or to replace currently occupied space that we may exit in the future. We continually evaluate our current and future space capacity in relation to current and projected future staffing levels. In 2003, we reduced our global office space and incurred exit costs of $153 million. We may incur additional exit costs in 2004 and thereafter to the extent we (i) further reduce our capacity or (ii) commit to new properties in the locations in which we operate and, consequently, dispose of existing space that had been held for potential growth. Such exit costs may be material to our results of operations in a given period.     Item 3.     Legal Proceedings        We are involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings (including those described below) concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our businesses. We believe, based on currently available information, that the results of such proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but might be material to our operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.         IPO Process Matters        The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. are among the numerous financial services companies that have been named as defendants in a variety of lawsuits alleging improprieties in the process by which those companies participated in the underwriting of public offerings in recent years.         Certain purported class actions have been brought in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by purchasers of securities in public offerings, who claim that the defendants engaged in conspiracies in violation of federal antitrust laws in connection with these offerings. The plaintiffs in each instance seek treble damages as well as injunctive relief. One of the actions, which was commenced on August 21, 1998, alleges that the defendants have conspired to discourage or restrict the resale of securities for a period after the offerings, including by imposing penalty bids. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint in November 1998. The plaintiffs amended their complaint in February 1999, modifying their claims in various ways, including limiting the proposed class to retail purchasers of public offerings. The defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on May 7, 1999, the motion was granted by a decision dated December 7, 2000, and the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration of that decision was denied by an order dated January 22, 2001. Plaintiffs appealed, and by a decision dated December 20, 2002, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal of their complaint. The plaintiffs filed a petition for review by the U.S. Supreme Court of the ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirming dismissal of the complaint, and on October 6, 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court entered an order declining to hear plaintiffs appeal from the ruling.         Several other actions were commenced, beginning on November 3, 1998 by purchasers of securities in public offerings as well as certain purported issuers of such offerings, that allege  27    Table of Contents  that the defendants, many of whom are also named in the other action discussed above, have conspired to fix at 7% the discount that underwriting syndicates receive from issuers of shares in certain offerings. On March 15, 1999, the purchaser plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on April 29, 1999. On February 9, 2001, the federal district court granted with prejudice the defendants motion to dismiss the claims asserted by the purchasers of securities on the ground that they lacked antitrust standing. The plaintiffs in those actions appealed, and by a decision dated December 13, 2002, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the dismissal on the ground that the lower court had engaged in improper fact-finding on the motion and remanded for consideration of other potential bases for dismissal. On September 28, 2001, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaints filed by the issuer plaintiffs on statute of limitations grounds. On September 25, 2002, the federal district court denied the underwriter defendants motion to dismiss. On March 26, 2003, defendants moved to dismiss the claims asserted by both the issuers and the purchasers of securities on preemption grounds, but the motion was denied on June 27, 2003. On June 24, 2003, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the claims asserted by the purchasers of securities on standing grounds.          Goldman, Sachs & Co. is one of numerous financial services firms that have been named as defendants in purported class actions filed beginning on March 9, 2001 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by purchasers of securities in public offerings, who claim that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to tie allocations in certain offerings to higher customer brokerage commission rates as well as purchase orders in the aftermarket, in violation of federal antitrust laws. The plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on January 2, 2002. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on May 24, 2002, the motion was granted by a decision dated November 3, 2003, and the plaintiffs have moved for reconsideration. The plaintiffs have also filed notices of appeal. Goldman, Sachs & Co. has also, together with other underwriters in certain offerings as well as the issuers and certain of their officers and directors, been named as a defendant in a number of related lawsuits alleging, among other things, that the prospectuses for the offerings violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose the existence of the alleged tying arrangements. On July 1, 2002, the underwriter defendants moved to dismiss those complaints. By an opinion and order dated February 19, 2003, the federal district court denied the motion to dismiss in all material respects relating to the underwriter defendants. On June 26, 2003, plaintiffs announced that they had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding regarding a proposed settlement of their claims against the issuer defendants and the issuers present or former officers and directors named in the lawsuits.         Goldman, Sachs & Co. has been named as a defendant in an action commenced on May 15, 2002 in New York Supreme Court, New York County, by an official committee of unsecured creditors on behalf of eToys, Inc., alleging that the firm intentionally underpriced eToys, Inc.s initial public offering. The action seeks, among other things, consequential damages resulting from the alleged lower amount of offering proceeds. On August 1, 2002, Goldman, Sachs & Co. moved to dismiss the complaint. On May 2, 2003, the court granted Goldman, Sachs & Co.s motion to dismiss as to five of the claims; plaintiff has appealed from the dismissal of the five claims, and Goldman, Sachs & Co. has appealed from the denial of its motion as to the remaining claim.         The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. has also been named as a defendant in a purported shareholder derivative action commenced in Delaware Court of Chancery on October 23, 2002 alleging that certain officers and directors of eBay, Inc. (who are also defendants), aided and abetted by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., breached their fiduciary duties and usurped corporate opportunities by receiving allocations of initial public offerings as customers of The  28    Table of Contents  Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on December 23, 2002, but the motions were denied by a decision dated January 23, 2004.          The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. has, together with other underwriters in certain offerings, received subpoenas and requests for documents and information from various governmental agencies and the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services in connection with investigations relating to the public offering process. In particular, the SEC has been conducting an investigation of certain allocation practices employed by Goldman, Sachs & Co. and other firms, and the SEC staff has advised that it is considering recommending disciplinary charges alleging violations of the federal securities laws. Goldman Sachs is cooperating with the investigations.         Stock Options Litigation        Hull Trading Co. L.L.C. and Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, L.P., affiliates of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., are among the numerous market makers in listed equity options which have been named as defendants, together with five national securities exchanges, in a purported class action brought in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of persons who purchased or sold listed equity options. The consolidated class action complaint, filed on October 4, 1999 (which consolidated certain previously pending actions and added Hull Trading Co. L.L.C. and other market makers as defendants), generally alleges that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to preclude the multiple listing of certain equity options on the exchanges and seeks treble damages under the antitrust laws as well as injunctive relief. Certain of the parties, including Hull Trading Co. L.L.C. and Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, L.P., have entered into a stipulation of settlement, subject to court approval, pursuant to which Hull Trading Co. L.L.C. will be required to pay an aggregate of $2.48 million and Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, L.P. an aggregate of $19.59 million. On February 14, 2001, the federal district court granted the motion of certain non-settling defendants for summary judgment. By a decision dated April 24, 2001, the district court ruled that in light of that order granting summary judgment, the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the proposed settlement. Plaintiffs appealed, and by a decision dated January 9, 2003, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the grant of summary judgment, but held that the decision did not divest the lower court of jurisdiction to entertain the proposed settlement, and remanded for further proceedings. By an Order dated March 17, 2003, the U.S. Court of Appeals denied plaintiffs motion for rehearing or rehearing en banc of the Courts January 9, 2003 decision.         AMF Securities Litigation        The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and a Goldman, Sachs & Co. managing director have been named as defendants in several purported class action lawsuits beginning on April 27, 1999 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York brought on behalf of purchasers of stock of AMF Bowling, Inc. in an underwritten initial public offering of 15,525,000 shares of common stock in November 1997 at a price of $19.50 per share. Defendants are AMF Bowling, Inc., certain officers and directors of AMF Bowling, Inc. (including the Goldman, Sachs & Co. managing director), and the lead underwriters of the offering (including Goldman, Sachs & Co.). The consolidated amended complaint alleges violations of the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws and seeks compensatory damages and/or rescission. The complaint also asserts that The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P. and the Goldman, Sachs & Co. managing director are liable as controlling persons of AMF Bowling, Inc. under the federal securities laws because certain merchant banking funds managed by Goldman Sachs owned a majority of the outstanding common stock of AMF Bowling, Inc. and the managing director served as its chairman at the time of the offering. On December 22, 1999, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. By a decision dated March 22, 2001, the federal district court denied the motion. By a decision dated March 25, 2002, the federal district court granted  29    Table of Contents  plaintiffs motion for class certification with respect to a class under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, but denied the motion with respect to a subclass under Section 12 of the Securities Act. By a decision dated May 21, 2002, the federal district court reconsidered its March 25, 2002 decision with respect to plaintiffs motion for class certification and determined that the class includes persons who purchased AMF stock pursuant to the initial public offering prior to February 26, 1999. On January 30, 2004, the defendants moved for summary judgment.          On July 30, 2001, AMF Bowling, Inc. filed for protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws.         Iridium Securities Litigation        Goldman, Sachs & Co. has been named as a defendant in two purported class action lawsuits commenced, beginning on May 26, 1999, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia brought on behalf of purchasers of Class A common stock of Iridium World Communications, Ltd. in a January 1999 underwritten secondary offering of 7,500,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $33.40 per share, as well as in the secondary market. The defendants in the actions include Iridium, certain of its officers and directors, Motorola, Inc. (an investor in Iridium) and the lead underwriters in the offering, including Goldman, Sachs & Co. On May 13, 2002, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint alleging substantively identical claims as the original complaints. On July 15, 2002, the defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint.         The complaints in both actions allege violations of the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws and seek compensatory and/or rescissory damages. Goldman, Sachs & Co. underwrote 996,500 shares of common stock and Goldman Sachs International underwrote 320,625 shares of common stock for a total offering price of approximately $44 million.         On August 13, 1999, Iridium World Communications, Ltd. filed for protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws.         World Online Litigation        Several lawsuits have been commenced in the Netherlands courts based on alleged misstatements and omissions relating to the initial public offering of World Online in March 2000. Goldman Sachs and ABN AMRO Rothschild served as joint global coordinators of the offering, which raised approximately 2.9 billion. Goldman Sachs International underwrote 20,268,846 shares and Goldman, Sachs & Co. underwrote 6,756,282 shares for a total offering price of approximately 1.16 billion.         On September 11, 2000, several Dutch World Online shareholders as well as a Dutch entity purporting to represent the interests of certain World Online shareholders commenced a proceeding in Amsterdam District Court against ABN AMRO Bank N.V., also acting under the name of ABN AMRO Rothschild, alleging misrepresentations and omissions relating to the initial public offering of World Online. The lawsuit seeks, among other things, the return of the purchase price of the shares purchased by the plaintiffs or unspecified damages. By a decision dated May 7, 2003, the court held that the claims failed and dismissed the complaint. The plaintiffs have appealed.         In March 2001, a Dutch shareholders association initiated legal proceedings in Amsterdam District Court in connection with the World Online offering. Goldman Sachs International is named as a defendant in the writ served on its Dutch attorneys on March 14, 2001. The amount of damages sought is not specified in the writ. Goldman Sachs International filed its Statement of Defense on January 16, 2002 and a rejoinder on January 14, 2003. By a decision dated December 17, 2003, the court rejected the claims against Goldman Sachs International, but found World Online liable in an amount to be determined.  30    Table of Contents        Owens Corning Bondholder Litigation        Goldman, Sachs & Co. has been named as a defendant in a purported class action filed on April 27, 2001 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts arising from a 1998 offering by Owens Corning of two series of its notes. The defendants include certain of Owens Cornings officers and directors and the underwriters for the offering (including Goldman, Sachs & Co., which was the lead manager in the offering). The offering included a total of $550 million principal amount of notes, of which Goldman, Sachs & Co. underwrote $275 million.         The lawsuit, brought by certain institutional purchasers of the notes, alleges that the prospectus issued in connection with the offering was false and misleading in violation of the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws. The plaintiffs are seeking, among other things, unspecified damages. The underwriter defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on November 14, 2001. By a decision dated August 26, 2002, the federal district court denied the underwriter defendants motion to dismiss.         On October 5, 2000, Owens Corning filed for protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws.         Research Independence Matters        The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and its affiliates, together with other financial services firms, have received requests for information from various governmental agencies in connection with their review of research independence issues, including the New York State Attorney General, the Utah Attorney General, the NYSE (which has issued a joint inquiry together with the SEC and NASD), the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York, and the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services. Goldman Sachs is cooperating with the requests.         On April 28, 2003, a final global settlement relating to investment research analysts alleged conflicts of interest and involving various of the leading securities firms operating in the United States, including The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.s U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary Goldman, Sachs & Co., was announced. In that connection, without admitting or denying the allegations, findings or conclusions by various federal and state regulators, Goldman Sachs entered into consents, agreements and other definitive documentation with the SEC, the NYSE, the NASD and the Utah Division of Securities, to resolve their investigations of Goldman, Sachs & Co. relating to those matters. Pursuant to the final arrangements, Goldman, Sachs & Co. agreed, among other things, to (i) pay an aggregate of $25 million as penalties, (ii) pay an aggregate of $25 million as disgorgement of commissions and other monies, (iii) contribute an aggregate of $50 million over five years to provide independent third-party research to clients, (iv) contribute an aggregate of $10 million over five years for investor education, (v) adopt various additional policies, systems, procedures and other safeguards to ensure further the integrity of Goldman, Sachs & Co. investment research and (vi) be permanently restrained and enjoined from violating certain rules of the NYSE and the NASD relating to investment research activities. In connection with the global settlement, Goldman, Sachs & Co. also subscribed to a voluntary initiative imposing restrictions on the allocation of shares in initial public offerings to executives and directors of public companies. In connection with effectuation of the global settlement, in a civil action brought by the SEC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the settling firms, including Goldman, Sachs & Co., on October 31, 2003, the court entered a final judgment imposing the permanent restraint and injunction. In addition, Goldman, Sachs & Co. has entered into 50 separate settlement stipulations with states and certain U.S. territories and expects to reach similar arrangements with most or all of the remaining states, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Current or future civil lawsuits implicating investment research analysts conflicts of interest were not settled as part of the global settlement. The global settlement also did not resolve potential charges involving individual employees, including supervisors, and regulatory investigations are continuing.  31    Table of Contents        Goldman, Sachs & Co. is one of several investment firms that have been named as defendants in substantively identical purported class actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging violations of the federal securities laws in connection with research coverage of certain issuers and seeking compensatory damages.

Goldman, Sachs & Co. acted as a co-lead underwriter of both Global Crossing, Ltd. offerings, underwriting 12.9 million shares of common stock and 1,840,000 shares of convertible preferred stock. Goldman, Sachs & Co. underwrote 20,670,000 shares of common stock in the Asia Global Crossing Ltd. offering for a total offering price of approximately $145 million. The claims assert violations of the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws as to such offerings and seek compensatory and/or rescissory damages. The defendants as to such claims include certain officers and directors of the Global Crossing, Ltd. and Asia Global Crossing Ltd., the lead and other underwriters in the offerings, and the companys former outside auditors. On April 21, 2003, the underwriter defendants as to the Global Crossing, Ltd. offerings moved to dismiss the claims relating to such offerings; the motion was denied in significant part by a decision dated December 18, 2003. On October 10, 2003, the underwriter defendants as to the Asia Global Crossing Ltd. offering moved to dismiss the claims relating to that offering.          The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is among numerous defendants named in an adversary proceeding commenced in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York on February 6, 2004 by the Global Crossing, Ltd., as the Liquidating Trustee of the Global Crossing Liquidating Trust. The complaint names as defendants various former officers and directors of the Global Crossing, Ltd., the companys former outside accountants, and various financial services firms that allegedly performed services for the Global Crossing, Ltd. from time to time. With respect to its claims against the financial services defendants, the complaint alleges that such defendants received fraudulent conveyances or preferential transfers in respect of their services, and otherwise aided and abetted misconduct by the former officers and directors thereby contributing to unspecified damage to the Global Crossing, Ltd.         The Global Crossing, Ltd. filed for protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws on January 28, 2002, and Asia Global Crossing Corp. filed for such protection on November 17, 2002.             Adelphia Communications Fraudulent Conveyance Litigation        Goldman, Sachs & Co. is among numerous entities named as defendants in an adversary proceeding commenced in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York on July 6, 2003 by a creditors committee of Adelphia Communications, Inc. The complaint seeks, among other things, to recover, as fraudulent conveyances, payments made by Adelphia Communications, Inc. and its affiliates to certain brokerage firms, including approximately $62.9 million allegedly paid to Goldman, Sachs & Co., in respect of margin calls made in the ordinary course of business on accounts owned by members of the family that formerly controlled Adelphia Communications, Inc.             Specialist Matters        Spear, Leeds & Kellogg Specialists LLC and certain affiliates have received requests for information from the SEC and the NYSE as part of an industry-wide investigation relating to the activities of NYSE floor specialists in recent years. Goldman Sachs is cooperating with the requests. On February 17, 2004, Spear, Leeds & Kellogg Specialists LLC and certain other specialist firms agreed in principle to a global settlement with the SEC and the NYSE to resolve charges that the firms violated certain federal securities laws and NYSE rules in connection with their activities as NYSE specialists during the years 1999 through 2003. The settlement, which would involve no admission or denial of wrongdoing, is subject to, among other things, approval by the SEC and the NYSE as well as negotiation of definitive documentation, and if consummated will involve relief ordered as part of an administrative proceeding that is expected to include restitution and penalties for Spear, Leeds & Kellogg Specialists LLC totaling approximately $45.5 million, a censure, cease and desist order, and an undetermined form of undertaking. The settlement would not resolve the related civil actions discussed below (although a significant  35    Table of Contents  portion of the payment is expected to be committed to restitution for allegedly injured investors), or potential regulatory charges against individuals.          Spear, Leeds & Kellogg Specialists LLC, Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, L.P. and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. are among numerous defendants named in purported class actions brought on behalf of investors beginning in October 2003 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging violations of the federal securities laws in connection with NYSE floor specialist activities. The actions seek unspecified compensatory damages, restitution, and disgorgement on behalf of purchasers and sellers of unspecified securities between October 17, 1998 and October 15, 2003. Spear, Leeds & Kellogg Specialists LLC and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. are also among the defendants in a purported class action filed in December 2003 in California Superior Court, Los Angeles County alleging violation of California law in connection with the same conduct.             Treasury Proceeding        On September 4, 2003, the SEC announced that Goldman, Sachs & Co. had settled an administrative proceeding arising from certain trading in U.S. Treasury bonds over an approximately eight-minute period after Goldman, Sachs & Co. received an October 31, 2001 telephone call from a Washington, D.C.-based political consultant concerning a forthcoming Treasury refunding announcement. The administrative complaint alleged that Goldman, Sachs & Co. (i) violated Section 15(c)(1) and Rule 15c1-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a result of the trading; and (ii) violated Section 15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by failing to maintain policies and procedures specifically addressed to the possible misuse of information obtained by consultants from confidential government sources. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Goldman, Sachs & Co. consented to the entry of an order that, among other things, (i) censured Goldman, Sachs & Co.; (ii) directed Goldman, Sachs & Co. to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 15(c)(1)(A) & (C) and 15(f) of, and Rule 15c1-2 under, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (iii) ordered Goldman, Sachs & Co. to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,742,642, and a civil monetary penalty of $5 million; and (iv) directed Goldman, Sachs & Co. to conduct a review of its policies and procedures and adopt, implement and maintain policies and procedures consistent with the order and that review. Goldman, Sachs & Co. also undertook to pay $2,562,740 in disgorgement and interest relating to certain trading in U.S. Treasury bond futures during the same eight-minute period.             Mutual Fund Investigations        Goldman, Sachs & Co. and certain mutual fund affiliates have received subpoenas and requests for information from various regulators including the SEC as part of the industry-wide investigation relating to the practices of mutual funds and their customers. Goldman, Sachs & Co. and its affiliates are cooperating with such requests.             Corporate Bond Mark-Up Investigation        On December 23, 2003, in connection with an industry-wide investigation relating to corporate bond transactions, the NASD advised that its staff had preliminarily determined that Goldman, Sachs & Co. and certain of its employees had charged undisclosed mark-up or mark-downs on five specific transactions during the years 2000 and 2001 that exceeded permissible levels, in violation of certain NASD rules and the federal securities laws. Goldman, Sachs & Co. has cooperated with the investigation.       Item 4.

NOTES TO CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (PARENT COMPANY ONLY)   Note 1.     Significant Accounting Policies           Basis of Presentation          The condensed nonconsolidated financial statements of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the parent company) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the firm) and notes thereto (the consolidated financial statements), which are incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K.         Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for using the equity method.         These condensed nonconsolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that require management to make estimates and assumptions regarding fair value measurement, accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, the provision for potential losses that may arise from litigations and regulatory proceedings and other matters that affect the condensed nonconsolidated financial statements and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are based on the best available information; nonetheless, actual results could be materially different from these estimates.         Certain reclassifications have been made to previously reported amounts to conform to the current presentation.            Affiliate Transactions          Most of the consolidated unsecured liquidity of the firm is raised by the parent company. The parent company then lends the necessary funds to its subsidiaries and affiliates, as represented by Receivables from affiliates and Subordinated loan receivables from affiliates on the condensed statements of financial condition. Intercompany exposure is managed by generally requiring intercompany loans to have maturities equal to or shorter than the maturities of the aggregate borrowings of the parent company. This policy ensures that the subsidiaries obligations to the parent company will generally mature in advance of the parent companys third-party long-term borrowings. In addition, many of the subsidiaries and affiliates pledge collateral to cover their intercompany borrowings. Equity investments in subsidiaries are generally funded with equity capital.         In addition, the parent company charges certain affiliates for rental and other costs relating to properties occupied by those affiliates.         Interest income is largely generated from loans made to affiliates.  F-6    Table of Contents  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.   NOTES TO CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (PARENT COMPANY ONLY)  (Continued)   Note 2.     Long-Term Borrowings        Long-term borrowings with third parties are set forth below:                                  As of November          2003  2002                 (in millions)     Fixed rate obligations(1)                             U.S. dollar         $ 26,647     $ 18,104         Non-U.S. dollar           8,303       4,124       Floating rate obligations(2)                             U.S. dollar           8,776       9,768         Non-U.S. dollar           5,361       3,127                         Total         $ 49,087     $ 35,123                                 (1)   During 2003 and 2002, interest rates on     U.S. dollar fixed rate obligations ranged from 4.13% to     12.00% and from 5.50% to 12.00%, respectively. During 2003 and     2002, interest rates on non-U.S. dollar fixed rate     obligations ranged from 0.70% to 8.88% and from 1.20% to 8.88%,     respectively.            (2)   Floating interest rates generally are based on     LIBOR, the U.S. Treasury bill rate or the federal funds     rate. Certain equity-linked and indexed instruments are included     in floating rate obligations.               Long-term borrowings with third parties by fiscal maturity date are set forth below:              (1)   Long-term borrowings maturing within one year and     certain long-term borrowings that may be redeemable within one     year at the option of the holder are included as     short-term borrowings in the condensed     non-consolidated statements of financial condition.            (2)   Long-term borrowings repayable at the option of     the parent company are reflected at their contractual maturity     dates. Certain long-term borrowings that may be redeemable prior     to        F-7    Table of Contents  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.   NOTES TO CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (PARENT COMPANY ONLY)  (Continued)           maturity at the option of the holder are     reflected at the date such options first become exercisable.            (3)   Long-term borrowings have maturities that range     from one to 30 years from the date of issue.               The parent company enters into derivative contracts with affiliates, such as interest rate futures contracts, interest rate swap agreements, currency swap agreements and equity-linked contracts, to effectively convert a substantial portion of its long-term borrowings into U.S. dollar-based floating rate obligations. Accordingly, the aggregate carrying value of these long-term borrowings and related hedges approximates fair value.         The effective weighted average interest rates for long-term borrowings, after hedging activities, are set forth below:                                                As of November                 2003  2002            Amount  Rate  Amount  Rate                     ($ in millions)     Fixed rate obligations         $ 637       10.99 %   $ 692       10.85 %     Floating rate obligations           48,450       1.73       34,431       2.23                                       Total         $ 49,087       1.85     $ 35,123       2.40                                             Long-term borrowings with affiliates are set forth below:                                  As of     November          2003  2002                 (in millions)     Fixed rate obligations(1)                             U.S. dollar         $ 682     $ 682         Non-U.S. dollar           485       366       Floating rate obligations(2)                             U.S. dollar           1,796       1,796         Non-U.S. dollar                                           Total         $ 2,963     $ 2,844                                 (1)   During 2003 and 2002, the interest rate on     U.S. dollar fixed rate obligations was 5.78%.

Commitments, Contingencies and     Guarantees             Commitments          The parent company provides letters of credit issued by various banks to counterparties in lieu of securities or cash to satisfy various collateral and margin deposit requirements. Letters of credit outstanding were $119 million and $164 million as of November 2003 and November 2002, respectively.         The parent company acts as an investor in merchant banking transactions, which includes making long-term investments in equity and debt securities in privately negotiated transactions, corporate acquisitions and real estate transactions.

Certain agreements are subject to periodic escalation provisions for increases in real estate taxes and  F-9    Table of Contents  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Future minimum rental payments, which are generally reimbursed by affiliates, are set forth below:                     (in millions)          Minimum rental payments                     2004         $ 135         2005           87         2006           89         2007           90         2008           92         2009-thereafter           911                  Total         $ 1,404                Contingencies          The parent company is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of its businesses. Management believes, based on currently available information, that the results of such proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the firms financial condition, but may be material to the parent companys operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.            Guarantees          The parent company guarantees many of the obligations of its consolidated subsidiaries including its largest operating entities in Europe and Asia and many of its primary derivatives and commodities trading entities as well as certain other subsidiaries. The parent company typically does not guarantee all of the obligations of any particular subsidiary; rather, it guarantees obligations on a transaction-by-transaction basis, as negotiated with the counterparty. The parent company typically does not issue guarantees of the obligations of its U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries, although the parent company is the general partner of Goldman, Sachs & Co. The parent company is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these guarantees. However, because the guaranteed obligations are obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, the parent companys liabilities as guarantor are included in the liabilities of the firm that are already reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.  F-10    Table of Contents  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.   NOTES TO CONDENSED NONCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (PARENT COMPANY ONLY)  (Continued)         The following table sets forth certain information about guarantees issued by the parent company in respect of non-consolidated affiliates and third parties as of November 2003:                                                                Maximum Payout by Period of Expiration(1)          Carrying    2005-  2007-  2009-       Value  2004  2006  2008  Thereafter  Total                         (in millions)     Fund related commitments         $      $ 44     $ 20     $ 2     $ 2     $ 68       Miscellaneous           80       59       18              68       145               (1)   Such amounts do not represent the anticipated     losses in connection with these contracts.               In the normal course of its business, the parent company indemnifies and guarantees certain service providers, such as custody agents, trustees and administrators, against specified potential losses in connection with their acting as an agent of, or providing services to, the parent company or its affiliates. The parent company also indemnifies some clients against potential losses incurred in the event specified third-party service providers, including subcustodians and third-party brokers, improperly execute transactions. The parent company is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these guarantees and indemnifications. However, management believes that it is unlikely the parent company will have to make material payments under these arrangements, and no liabilities related to these guarantees and indemnifications have been recognized in the condensed non-consolidated financial statement as of November 2003.         The parent company provides representations and warranties to counterparties in connection with a variety of commercial transactions and occasionally indemnifies them against potential losses caused by the breach of those representations and warranties. The parent company may also provide indemnifications protecting against changes in or adverse application of certain U.S. tax laws in connection with ordinary-course transactions such as securities issuances, borrowings or derivatives. In addition, the parent company may provide indemnifications to some counterparties to protect them in the event additional taxes are owed or payments are withheld, due either to a change in or an adverse application of certain non-U.S. tax laws. These indemnifications generally are standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business. Generally, there are no stated or notional amounts included in these indemnifications, and the contingencies triggering the obligation to indemnify are not expected to occur. The parent company is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these guarantees. However, management believes that it is unlikely the parent company will have to make material payments under these arrangements, and no liabilities related to these arrangements have been recognized in the condensed non-consolidated financial statements as of November 2003.
