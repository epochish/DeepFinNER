Business Overview       Goldman Sachs is a leading global investment banking and securities firm that provides a wide range of services worldwide to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals. As of November 26, 1999, we operated offices in over 20 countries and 37% of our 15,361 employees were based outside the United States.        Goldman Sachs is the successor to a commercial paper business founded in 1869 by Marcus Goldman. Since then, we have expanded our business as a participant and intermediary in securities and other financial activities to become one of the leading firms in the industry.        In 1989, The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P. was formed to serve as the  parent company of the Goldman Sachs organization. On May 7,  1999, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. succeeded to the business of  The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P. and completed an initial public offering of its common stock.        All references to 1999, 1998 and 1997 refer to our fiscal year ended, or the date, as the context requires, November 26, 1999, November 27, 1998 and November 28, 1997, respectively.        When we use the terms Goldman Sachs, we and our, we mean, prior to our conversion to corporate form, The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P., a Delaware limited  partnership, and its consolidated subsidiaries and, after our conversion to corporate form, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.        Financial information concerning our business segments and geographic regions for each of 1999, 1998 and 1997 is set forth in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in  our 1999 Annual Report to Shareholders, which are incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Business Segments       Our activities are divided into two segments:               Global Capital Markets; and             Asset Management and Securities Services.   2    Table of Contents       These segments consist of various product and service offerings that are set forth in the following chart:  Primary Products and Activities by Business Segment                          Asset Management and   Global Capital Markets  Securities Services          Trading and Principal     Investment Banking  Investments               Equity and debt underwriting   Financial restructuring advisory services   Mergers and acquisitions advisory       services   Real estate advisory services   Bank loans Commodities Currencies Equity and fixed income derivatives Equity and fixed income securities  Principal investments Proprietary arbitrage   Commissions Institutional and high-net- worth asset     management Margin lending Matched book  Merchant banking fees Increased share of merchant banking     fund income and gains Mutual funds Prime brokerage Securities lending    Global Capital Markets       The Global Capital Markets segment, which represented 76% of 1999  net revenues, consists of the following:              Investment Banking. Investment Banking consists of our  Financial Advisory and Underwriting businesses; and            Trading and Principal Investments. Trading and Principal  Investments consists of our Fixed Income, Currency and  Commodities (FICC), Equities and Principal  Investments businesses.     Investment Banking       Investment Banking represented 33% of 1999 net revenues. We provide a broad range of investment banking services to a diverse  group of corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals and seek to develop and maintain long-term relationships with these clients as their lead investment bank.        Our current structure, which is organized along regional, product  and industry groups, seeks to combine client-focused investment bankers with execution and industry expertise. Because our businesses are global, we have adapted our organization to meet the demands of our clients in each geographic region. Through our  commitment to teamwork, we believe that we provide services in an integrated fashion for the benefit of our clients.        Our investment banking activities are divided into two categories:              Financial Advisory. Financial Advisory includes advisory  assignments with respect to mergers and acquisitions,  divestitures, corporate defense activities, restructurings and  spin-offs; and            Underwriting. Underwriting includes public offerings and  private placements of equity and debt securities.         Financial Advisory. Goldman Sachs is a leading investment bank in worldwide mergers and acquisitions. Our mergers and acquisitions capabilities are evidenced by our significant share of  3    Table of Contents  assignments in large, complex transactions for which we provide multiple services, including one-stop acquisition financing, currency hedging and cross-border structuring expertise.        Underwriting. We underwrite a wide range of securities and other instruments, including common and preferred stock, convertible securities, investment-grade debt, high-yield debt, sovereign and emerging markets debt, municipal debt, bank loans, asset-backed securities and real estate-related securities, such as mortgage-backed securities and the securities  of real estate investment trusts.        Equity Underwriting. Equity underwriting has been a long-term core strength of Goldman Sachs. As with mergers and acquisitions, we have been particularly successful in winning mandates for large, complex equity underwritings. We believe our leadership in large initial public offerings reflects our expertise in complex transactions, research strengths, track record and distribution capabilities. We have also acted as lead manager on many of the largest initial public offerings in the international arena.        We believe that a key factor in our equity underwriting success is the close working relationship among the investment bankers, research analysts and sales force as coordinated by our Equity Capital Markets group. With institutional sales professionals and  high-net-worth relationship managers located in every major market around the world, Goldman Sachs has relationships with a large and diverse group of investors.        Debt Underwriting. We engage in the underwriting and origination of various types of debt instruments that we broadly categorize as follows:               investment-grade debt for corporations, governments,  municipalities and agencies;             leveraged finance, which includes high-yield debt and bank loans  for non-investment-grade issuers;             emerging market debt, which includes corporate and sovereign  issues; and             asset-backed securities.         We have employed a focused approach in debt underwriting, emphasizing high value-added areas in servicing our clients.    Trading and Principal Investments       Trading and Principal Investments represented 43% of 1999 net revenues. Our Trading and Principal Investments business facilitates transactions with a diverse group of corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals and takes proprietary positions through market making in and trading of fixed income and equity products, currencies, commodities, and swaps and other derivatives. In order to meet the needs of our clients, our Trading and Principal Investments business is diversified across a wide range of products. For example, we make  markets in traditional investment-grade debt securities, structure complex derivatives and securitize mortgages and insurance risk. We believe our willingness and ability to take risk distinguishes us and substantially enhances our client relationships.        Trading and Principal Investments is divided into three categories:              Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities. Goldman Sachs  makes markets in and trades fixed income products, currencies and   commodities, structures and enters into a wide variety of  derivative transactions, and engages in proprietary trading and  arbitrage activities;            Equities. Goldman Sachs makes markets in and trades  equities and equity-related products, structures and enters into  equity derivative transactions, and engages in proprietary  trading and equity arbitrage; and   4    Table of Contents              Principal Investments. Principal Investments primarily  represents net revenues from our merchant banking investments.         Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities. FICC is a large and diversified operation through which we engage in a variety of customer-driven market-making and proprietary trading and arbitrage activities. FICCs principal products are:               Bank loans             Commodities             Currencies             Derivatives             Emerging market debt             Global government securities             High-yield securities             Investment-grade corporate securities             Money market instruments             Mortgage securities and loans             Municipal securities         We generate trading net revenues from our customer-driven business in three ways. First, in large, highly liquid markets, we undertake a high volume of transactions for modest spreads. Second, by capitalizing on our strong market relationships and capital position, we also undertake transactions in less liquid markets where spreads are generally larger. Finally, we generate net revenues from structuring and executing transactions that address complex client needs.        In our proprietary activities, we assume a variety of risks and devote substantial resources to identify, analyze and benefit from these exposures. We leverage our strong research capabilities and capitalize on our proprietary analytical models to analyze information and make informed trading judgments. We seek to benefit from perceived disparities in the value of assets  in the trading markets and from macroeconomic and company-specific trends.        FICC uses a three-part approach to deliver high quality service to its clients. First, we offer broad market making, research and  market knowledge to our clients on a global basis. Second, we create innovative solutions to complex client problems by drawing  upon our structuring and trading expertise. Third, we use our expertise to take positions in markets when we believe the return  is at least commensurate with the risk.        A core activity in FICC is market making in a broad array of securities and products. For example, we are a primary dealer in many of the largest government bond markets around the world, including the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom and Canada. We are a member of the major futures exchanges, and also have interbank dealer status in the currency markets in New York,  London, Tokyo and Hong Kong. Our willingness to make markets in a broad range of fixed income, currency and commodity products and their derivatives is crucial both to our client relationships  and to support our underwriting business by providing secondary market liquidity. Our research capabilities include quantitative and qualitative analyses of global economic, currency and financial market trends, as well as credit analyses of corporate and sovereign fixed income securities.        Equities. Goldman Sachs engages in a variety of market-making, proprietary trading and arbitrage activities in equity securities and equity-related products (such as convertible securities  5    Table of Contents  and equity derivative instruments) on a global basis. Goldman Sachs makes markets and positions blocks of stock to facilitate customers transactions and to provide liquidity in the marketplace. Goldman Sachs is a member of most of the major stock  exchanges, including New York, London, Frankfurt, Tokyo and Hong  Kong.        As agent, we execute brokerage transactions in equity securities for institutional and individual customers that generate commission revenues. Commissions earned on agency transactions are recorded in Asset Management and Securities Services.        In equity trading, as in FICC, we generate net revenues from our customer-driven business in three ways. First, in large, highly liquid principal markets, such as the over-the-counter market for  equity securities, we undertake a high volume of transactions for modest spreads. Second, by capitalizing on our strong market relationships and capital position, we also undertake large transactions, such as block trades and positions in securities, in which we benefit from spreads that are generally larger. Finally, we also benefit from structuring complex transactions.        Goldman Sachs was a pioneer and is currently active in the execution of large block trades (trades of 50,000 or more shares)  in the United States and abroad. We have been able to capitalize  on our expertise in block trading, our global distribution network and our willingness to commit capital to effect increasingly large and complex customer transactions. We expect corporate consolidation and restructuring and increased demand for certainty and speed of execution by sellers and issuers of securities to increase both the frequency and size of sales of large blocks of equity securities. Block transactions, however, expose us to increased risks, including those arising from holding large and concentrated positions, and decreasing spreads.        We are active in the listed options and futures markets, and we structure, distribute and execute over-the-counter derivatives on  market indices, industry groups and individual company stocks to  facilitate customer transactions and our proprietary activities.  We develop quantitative strategies and render advice with respect to portfolio hedging and restructuring and asset allocation transactions. We also create specially tailored instruments to enable sophisticated investors to undertake hedging strategies and establish or liquidate investment positions. We are one of the leading participants in the trading and development of equity derivative instruments. We are an active participant in the trading of futures and options on most of the major exchanges in the United States, Europe and Asia.        We remain committed to being at the forefront of technological innovation in the global capital markets. To pursue our strategy of expanding our electronic market-making capabilities, on September 24, 1999, Goldman Sachs completed its acquisition of The Hull Group, a leading global electronic market maker in exchange-traded equity derivatives and an active market maker in equity securities worldwide.        In addition, equity arbitrage has long been an important part of our equity franchise. Our strategy is based on making investments  on a global basis through a diversified portfolio across different markets and event categories. This business focuses on event-oriented special situations where we are not acting as an advisor and on relative value trades. These special situations include mergers and acquisitions, corporate restructurings, recapitalizations and legal and regulatory events.        Trading Risk Management. We believe that our trading and market-making capabilities are key ingredients to our  success. While these businesses have generally earned attractive  returns, we have in the past incurred significant trading losses  in periods of market turbulence, such as in 1994 and the second half of 1998.        Our trading risk management process seeks to balance our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential losses. Risk management includes input from all levels of Goldman  Sachs, from the trading desks to the Firmwide Risk Committee. For a further discussion of our risk management policies and procedures, see Managements Discussion and  6    Table of Contents  Analysis  Risk Management in the 1999 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.        Principal Investments. In connection with our merchant banking activities, we invest by making principal investments directly and through funds that we raise and manage. As of November 1999, we had committed $3.06 billion, of which $2.33 billion had been funded, of the $17.27 billion total equity capital committed for our merchant banking funds. The funds investments generate capital appreciation or depreciation and, upon disposition, realized gains or losses. See   Asset Management and Securities Services  Merchant Banking for a discussion of our merchant banking funds. As of November 1999, the aggregate carrying value of our principal investments held directly or through our merchant banking funds was approximately $2.88 billion, which consisted of corporate principal investments with an aggregate carrying value of approximately $1.95 billion and real estate investments with an aggregate carrying value of approximately $928 million.  Asset Management and Securities Services       The components of the Asset Management and Securities Services segment, which represented 24% of 1999 net revenues, are set forth below:              Asset Management. Asset Management generates management  fees by providing investment advisory services to a diverse  client base of institutions and individuals;            Securities Services. Securities Services includes prime  brokerage, financing services and securities lending, and our  matched book businesses, all of which generate revenue primarily  in the form of fees or interest rate spreads; and            Commissions. Commissions includes agency transactions for  clients on major stock and futures exchanges and revenues from  the increased share of the income and gains derived from our  merchant banking funds.     Asset Management       Goldman Sachs is seeking to build a premier global asset management business. We offer a broad array of investment strategies and advice across all major asset classes: global equity; fixed income, including money markets; currency; and alternative investment products (i.e., investment vehicles  with non-traditional investment objectives and/or strategies). Assets under supervision consist of assets under management and other client assets. Assets under management typically generate fees based on a percentage of their value and include our mutual funds, separate accounts managed for institutional and individual  investors, our merchant banking funds and other alternative investment funds. Other client assets consist of assets in brokerage accounts of primarily high-net-worth individuals, on which we earn commissions.  7    Table of Contents       Our growth in assets under supervision is set forth in the graph below:  Assets Under Supervision  (in billions)    [BAR CHART: ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION]           As of November 1999, equities and alternative investments represented 59% of our total assets under management. Since 1996,  these two asset classes have been the primary drivers of our growth in assets under management.        The following table sets forth the amount of assets under management by asset class:  Assets Under Management by Asset Class  (in billions)                                        As of November          1999  1998  1997             Asset Class                  Equity  $ 98   $ 69   $ 52       Fixed income and currency   58    50    36       Money markets   48    46    31       Alternative investment(1)   54    30    17                     Total  $ 258   $ 195   $ 136                             (1)    Includes private equity, real estate, quantitative asset  allocation and other funds that we manage.            Since the beginning of 1996, we have increased the resources devoted to our Asset Management business, including the addition of over 1,000 employees. In addition, Goldman Sachs has made three asset management acquisitions in order to expand its geographic reach and broaden its global equity and alternative investment portfolio management capabilities.        Clients. Our primary clients are institutions, high-net-worth individuals and retail investors. We access clients through both direct and third-party channels. Our institutional clients include corporations, insurance companies, pension funds, foundations and endowments. In the third-party distribution channel, we distribute our mutual funds on a worldwide basis through banks, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries.  8   Table of Contents       The table below sets forth the amount of assets under supervision  by distribution channel and client category as of November 1999:  Assets Under Supervision by Distribution Channel  (in billions)                             Assets Under       Supervision(1)  Primary Investment Vehicles             Directly distributed                Institutional  $ 151    Separate managed accounts         High-net-worth individuals   262    Commingled vehicles           Brokerage accounts           Limited partnerships           Separate managed accounts       Third-party distributed                Institutional and retail   56    Mutual funds                 Total  $ 469                             (1)    Excludes $16 billion in our merchant banking funds.     Merchant Banking       Goldman Sachs has established a successful record in the corporate and real estate merchant banking business, with $17.27 billion of committed capital as of November 1999, of which $13.03 billion has been funded.  We have committed $3.06 billion and funded $2.33 billion of these amounts. Our clients, including pension plans, endowments, charitable institutions and high-net-worth individuals, have provided the remainder.        Our strategy with respect to each merchant banking fund is to invest opportunistically to build a portfolio of investments that  is diversified by industry, product type, geographic region and transaction structure and type. Some of these investment funds pursue, on a global basis, long-term investments in equity and debt securities in privately negotiated transactions, leveraged buyouts and acquisitions. As of November 1999, our corporate  merchant banking funds had total committed capital of $9.50 billion. Other funds, with total committed capital of $7.77 billion as of November 1999, invest in real estate operating companies and debt and equity interests in real estate assets.        Merchant banking activities generate three revenue streams. First, we receive a management fee that is generally a percentage  of a funds committed capital, invested capital, total gross acquisition cost or asset value. These annual management fees are included in our Asset Management revenues. Second, after  that fund has achieved a minimum return for fund investors, we receive an increased share of the funds income and gains that is a percentage, typically 20%, of the capital appreciation and gains from the funds investments. Revenues from the increased share of the funds income and gains are included in Commissions. Finally, Goldman Sachs, as a substantial investor  in these funds, is allocated its proportionate share of the funds unrealized appreciation or depreciation arising from changes in fair value as well as gains and losses upon realization. These items are included in the Trading and Principal Investments component of Global Capital Markets.    Securities Services       Securities Services consists predominantly of Global Securities Services, which provides prime brokerage, financing services and securities lending to a diversified U.S. and international  9    Table of Contents  customer base, including hedge funds, pension funds and high-net-worth individuals. Securities Services also includes our  matched book businesses.        We offer prime brokerage services to our clients, allowing them the flexibility to trade with most brokers while maintaining a single source for financing and portfolio reports. Our prime brokerage activities provide multi-product clearing and custody in 50 markets, consolidated multi-currency accounting and reporting and offshore fund administration and also provide servicing for our most active clients. Additionally, we provide financing to our clients through margin loans collateralized by securities held in the clients account.        Securities lending activities principally involve the borrowing and lending of equity securities to cover customer and Goldman Sachs short sales and to finance Goldman Sachs long positions. In addition, we are an active participant in the securities lending broker-to-broker business and the third-party agency lending business.    Commissions       Goldman Sachs generates commissions by executing agency transactions on major stock and futures exchanges worldwide. We effect agency transactions for clients located throughout the world. In recent years, aggregate commissions have increased as a  result of growth in transaction volume on the major exchanges. As discussed above, Commissions also includes the increased share  of income and gains from merchant banking funds as well as commissions earned from brokerage transactions. For a discussion regarding our increased share of the income and gains from our merchant banking funds, see  Merchant Banking above.        In anticipation of continued growth in electronic connectivity and on-line trading, Goldman Sachs has made strategic investments  in alternative trading systems to gain experience and participate in the development of this market. See  Internet Strategy below for a further discussion of these investments.  Global Investment Research       Our Global Investment Research Department provides fundamental research on economies, debt and equity markets, commodities markets, industries and companies on a worldwide basis. For over two decades, we have committed resources on a global scale to develop a leading position in the industry for our investment research products.        Global Investment Research employs a team approach that as of November 1999 provided research coverage of approximately 2,400 companies worldwide, 52 economies and 26 stock markets. This  is accomplished by four groups:               the Commodities Research group, which provides research on the  global commodity markets;             the Company/Industry group, which provides fundamental analysis,  forecasts and investment recommendations for companies and  industries worldwide. Equity research analysts are organized  regionally by sector and globally into more than 20 industry  teams, which allows for extensive collaboration and knowledge  sharing on important investment themes;             the Economic Research group, which formulates macroeconomic  forecasts for economic activity, foreign exchange and interest  rates based on the globally coordinated views of its regional  economists; and             the Portfolio Strategy group, which forecasts equity market  returns and provides recommendations on both asset allocation and   industry representation.   10   Table of Contents Internet Strategy       We believe that Internet technology and electronic commerce will,  over time, change the ways that securities and other financial products are traded and distributed, creating both opportunities and challenges for our businesses. In response, we have established a program of internal development and external investment.        Internally, we are extending our global electronic trading and information distribution capabilities to our clients via the Internet. These capabilities cover many of our fixed income, currency, commodity, equities and mutual fund products in markets  around the world. We are also using the Internet to improve the ease and quality of communication with our institutional and high-net-worth clients. For example, investors have on-line access to our investment research, mutual fund data and valuation  models. In addition, our high-net-worth clients are increasingly  accessing their portfolio information over the Internet. We have  also recently established GS-OnlineSM, which, in conjunction with Goldman, Sachs & Co., acts as an underwriter of securities offerings via the Internet and other electronic means. GS-OnlineSM will deal initially only  with other underwriters and syndicate members and not with members of the public.        Recently, we established an internal working group to focus primarily on utilizing the Internet to enhance and support our wealth management business. Externally, we have invested in electronic commerce concerns such as Bridge Information Systems, Inc., TradeWeb LLC, Archipelago, L.L.C., The BRASS Utility, L.L.C., OptiMark Technologies, Inc. and Wit Capital Group, Inc. Through these investments, we gain an increased understanding of business developments and opportunities in this emerging sector.  Information Technology       Technology is fundamental to our overall business strategy. Goldman Sachs is committed to the ongoing development, maintenance and use of technology throughout the organization. We  have developed significant software and systems over the past several years. Our technology initiatives can be broadly categorized into three efforts:               enhancing client service through increased connectivity and the  provision of high value-added, tailored services;             risk management; and             overall efficiency and control.         We have tailored our services to our clients by providing them with electronic access to our products and services. For example,  we developed the GS Financial WorkbenchSM, an Internet Web site that clients and employees can use to download research reports, access earnings and valuation models, submit trades, monitor accounts, build and view presentations, calculate  derivative prices and view market data. First made available in 1995, the GS Financial WorkbenchSM represents a  joint effort among all of our business areas to create one comprehensive site for clients and employees to access our products and services.        We have also developed software that enables us to monitor and analyze our market and credit risks. This risk management software not only analyzes market risk on firmwide, divisional and trading desk levels, but also breaks down our risk into its underlying exposures, permitting management to evaluate exposures  on the basis of specific interest rate, currency rate, equity price or commodity price changes. To assist further in the management of our credit exposures, data from many sources are aggregated daily into credit management systems that give senior management and professionals in the Credit and Controllers departments the ability to receive timely information with respect to credit exposures worldwide, including netting information, and the ability to analyze complex risk situations effectively. Our software accesses this data, allows  11    Table of Contents  for quick analysis at the level of individual trades and interacts with other Goldman Sachs systems.        Technology has also been a significant factor in improving the overall efficiency of many areas of Goldman Sachs. By automating many trading procedures and operational and accounting processes,  we have substantially increased our efficiency and accuracy.  Employees       Management believes that one of the strengths and principal reasons for the success of Goldman Sachs is the quality and dedication of its people and the shared sense of being part of a team. We strive to maintain a work environment that fosters professionalism, excellence, diversity and cooperation among our employees worldwide.        Instilling the Goldman Sachs culture in all employees is a continuous process, in which training plays an important part. All employees are offered the opportunity to participate in education and periodic seminars that we sponsor at various locations throughout the world. Another important part of instilling the Goldman Sachs culture is our employee review process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors, co-workers and employees they supervise in a 360-degree review process that is integral to our team approach.        As of November 1999, we had 15,361 employees, which excludes  employees of Goldman Sachs two property management subsidiaries. Substantially all of the costs of these property management employees are reimbursed to Goldman Sachs by the real estate investment funds to which these subsidiaries provide property management services.  Competition       The financial services industry  and all of our businesses  are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. Our competitors are other brokers and dealers,  investment banking firms, insurance companies, investment advisors, mutual funds, hedge funds, commercial banks and merchant banks. We compete with some of our competitors globally and with others on a regional, product or niche basis. Our competition is based on a number of factors, including transaction execution, our products and services, innovation, reputation and price.        We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees.        In recent years, there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry. In particular, a number of large commercial banks, insurance companies and other broad-based financial services firms have established or acquired broker-dealers or have merged with other financial institutions. Many of these firms have the ability to offer a wide range of products, from loans, deposit taking and insurance to brokerage, asset management and investment banking services, which may enhance their competitive position. They also  have the ability to support investment banking and securities products with commercial banking, insurance and other financial services revenues in an effort to gain market share, which could result in pricing pressure in our businesses.        Recently enacted federal financial modernization legislation significantly expands the activities permissible for firms affiliated with a U.S. bank. The legislation, among other things,  enables U.S. banks and insurance firms to affiliate, facilitates  affiliations between U.S. banks and securities firms, and expands the permissible principal investing activities of U.S. banking organizations. This legislation may further accelerate consolidation and increase competition in the financial services industry and will enable banking organizations to compete more effectively across a broad range of activities.  12    Table of Contents       The trend toward consolidation and convergence has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors. This trend has also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result,  we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions.        We believe that some of our most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the United States. In order to take advantage of these opportunities, we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions based in important non-U.S. markets, particularly in Europe. Some of these institutions are larger and better capitalized, and have a stronger local presence and a longer operating history in these markets.        We have experienced intense price competition in some of our businesses in recent years. For example, equity and debt underwriting discounts have been under pressure for a number of years and the ability to execute trades electronically, through the Internet and through other alternative trading systems may increase the pressure on trading commissions. It appears that this trend toward alternative trading systems will continue and probably accelerate. Similarly, underwriting spreads in certain privatizations have been subject to considerable pressure. We believe that we may experience pricing pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices.  Regulation       Goldman Sachs, as a participant in the securities and commodity futures and options industries, is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and elsewhere. As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies in the United States and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of customers participating in those markets. They are not, however, charged with protecting the interests of Goldman Sachs shareholders or creditors. In the United States, the SEC is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws. Goldman, Sachs & Co. is registered as a broker-dealer and as an investment adviser with the SEC and as a broker-dealer in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Self-regulatory organizations, such as the Chicago Board of Trade, the NYSE and the NASD, adopt rules and examine broker-dealers such as Goldman,  Sachs & Co. In addition, state securities and other regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over Goldman, Sachs & Co. Similarly, our businesses are also subject to regulation by various non-U.S. governmental and regulatory bodies and self-regulatory authorities in virtually all countries where we have offices.        Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales methods, trade practices among broker-dealers, use and safekeeping of customers funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping, the financing of customers purchases, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of  existing laws and rules, either in the United States or elsewhere, may directly affect the mode of operation and profitability of Goldman Sachs.        The U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the United States, are empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer or its directors, officers or employees. Occasionally, our subsidiaries have been subject to investigations and proceedings, and sanctions have been imposed for infractions of various regulations relating to our activities, none of which has had a material adverse effect on us  or our businesses.        The commodity futures and options industry in the United States is subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is the federal agency charged with the administration of the Commodity Exchange Act and the  13    Table of Contents  regulations thereunder. Goldman, Sachs & Co. is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a futures commission merchant, commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor.        As a registered broker-dealer and member of various self-regulatory organizations, Goldman, Sachs & Co. is subject to the SECs uniform net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1. This rule specifies the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that part  of its assets be kept in relatively liquid form. Goldman, Sachs & Co. is also subject to the net capital requirements of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and various securities and commodity exchanges. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.        The SEC and various self-regulatory organizations impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, dictate the ratio of subordinated debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the SECs uniform net capital rule imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to  the SEC for certain withdrawals of capital.        In January 1999, the SEC adopted revisions to its uniform net capital rule and related regulations that permit the registration of over-the-counter derivatives dealers as broker-dealers. An over-the-counter derivatives dealer can, upon adoption of a risk management framework in accordance with the new rules, utilize a capital requirement based upon proprietary models for estimating market risk exposures. We have established Goldman Sachs Financial Markets, L.P. and registered this company  with the SEC as an over-the-counter derivatives dealer to conduct in a more capital-efficient manner certain over-the-counter derivative businesses previously conducted in other affiliates.        Goldman Sachs is an active participant in the international fixed  income and equity markets. Many of our affiliates that participate in those markets are subject to comprehensive regulations that include some form of capital adequacy rule and other customer protection rules. Goldman Sachs provides investment services in and from the United Kingdom under a regulatory regime that is undergoing comprehensive restructuring aimed at implementing the Financial Services Authority as the United Kingdoms unified financial services regulator. The relevant Goldman Sachs entities in London are at present regulated by the Securities and Futures Authority Limited in respect of their investment banking, individual asset management,  brokerage and principal trading activities, and the Investment Management Regulatory Organization in respect of their institutional asset management and fund management activities. Some of these Goldman Sachs entities are also regulated by the London Stock Exchange and other U.K. securities and commodities exchanges of which they are members. It is expected, however, that during 2000, the responsibilities of the Securities and Futures Authority Limited and Investment Management Regulatory Organization will be taken over by the Financial Services Authority. The investment services that are subject to oversight by U.K. regulators are regulated in accordance with European Union directives requiring, among other things, compliance with certain capital adequacy standards, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. These standards, requirements and rules are similarly implemented, under the same directives, throughout the European Union and are broadly comparable in scope and purpose to the regulatory capital and customer protection requirements imposed under the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission rules. European Union directives also permit local regulation in each jurisdiction, including those in which we operate, to be more restrictive than the requirements of such directives and these local requirements can result in certain competitive disadvantages to Goldman Sachs.  In addition, the Japanese Ministry of Finance, the Financial Supervisory Agency, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange and the Japan Securities  Dealers Association in Japan, the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong,  14    Table of Contents  the Bundesbank in Germany, as well as French and Swiss banking authorities, among others, regulate various of our subsidiaries and also have capital standards and other requirements comparable  to the rules of the SEC.        Compliance with net capital requirements of these and other regulators could limit those operations of our subsidiaries that require the intensive use of capital, such as underwriting and trading activities and the financing of customer account balances, and also could restrict our ability to withdraw capital  from our regulated subsidiaries, which in turn could limit our ability to repay debt or pay dividends on our common stock.  Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business       As an investment banking and securities firm, our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. The financial markets in the United States and elsewhere have achieved record or near record levels, and the favorable business environment in which we operate will not continue indefinitely. In the event of a change in market conditions, our businesses could be adversely affected in many ways, including the following:               We generally maintain large trading and investment positions,  including merchant banking investments, in the fixed income,  currency, commodity and equity markets, and in real estate and  other assets, and we may incur significant losses if market  fluctuations or volatility adversely affect the value of these  positions.             Unfavorable financial or economic conditions would likely reduce  the number and size of transactions in which we provide  underwriting, mergers and acquisitions advisory, and other  services, and could thereby adversely affect our results of  operations.             A market downturn would likely lead to a decline in the volume of   transactions that we execute for our customers and, therefore,  to a decline in the revenues we receive from commissions and  spreads. A market downturn could also result in a decline in the  fees we earn for managing assets. Moreover, even in the absence  of a market downturn, below-market performance by our mutual  funds could result in a decline in assets under management and  therefore in the fees we receive.             Concentration of risk in the past has increased the losses that  we have incurred in our arbitrage, market-making, block trading,  underwriting and lending businesses and may continue to do so in  the future. In particular, in the case of block trading, we  expect the trend toward an increase in the number and size of  trades we execute to continue.             A prolonged market downturn could impair our operating results  for a long period of time. In such a downturn, our revenues may  decline and, if we were unable to reduce expenses at the same  pace, our profit margins would erode.         If any of the variety of instruments and strategies we utilize to  hedge or otherwise manage our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses. Our hedging strategies and other risk management techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated. Some of our methods of managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior. As a result,  these methods may not predict future risk exposures, which could  be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate. Other risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets, clients or other matters. This information may not in all cases be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated.        The financial services industry  and all of our businesses  are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including  15    Table of Contents  transaction execution, our products and services, innovation, reputation and price. We believe that we may experience pricing pressures in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain  market share by reducing prices. In recent years, there has been  substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the  financial services industry. Recent financial services legislation, which significantly expands the activities permissible for firms affiliated with a U.S. bank, may accelerate  this consolidation and further increase competition. This trend toward consolidation and convergence has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors. This trend has also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions.        Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Competition in the financial services industry for qualified employees is intense. Our continued ability to compete effectively in our businesses depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and  motivate our existing employees. The steps we have taken to encourage the continued service of our employees since our conversion to corporate form may not be effective.        Liquidity, i.e., ready access to funds, is essential to our businesses. Our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the long-term or short-term debt capital markets, an inability to access the repurchase and securities lending markets, or an impairment of our ability to sell assets. Our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time.  In addition, a reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position and increase our borrowing costs.        We are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money, securities or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. The amount and duration of our credit exposures have been increasing over the past several years. In addition, we have  also experienced, due to competitive factors, pressure to extend  credit against less liquid collateral and price more aggressively the credit risks that we take. Although we regularly  review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect Goldman Sachs.        Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on  a daily basis, a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies, and the transactions we process have become increasingly complex. If any of our financial, accounting or other data processing systems do not operate properly or are disabled, we could suffer financial loss,  a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory  intervention or reputational damage. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could  also constrain our ability to expand our businesses.        Substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against Goldman Sachs could have a material adverse financial effect or cause significant reputational harm to Goldman Sachs, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. We face significant legal risks in our businesses and the volume and  amount of damages claimed in litigation against financial intermediaries are increasing. In addition, we would expect legal  claims by customers and clients to increase in a market downturn.        Goldman Sachs, as a participant in the financial services industry, is subject to extensive regulation in jurisdictions around the world. We face the risk of significant intervention by  regulatory authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Among other things, we could be fined or prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities. New laws or  16    Table of Contents  regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our clients may also adversely affect our businesses.        There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years, and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases.        We believe that some of our most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the United States. In order to take advantage of these opportunities, we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions based in important non-U.S. markets, particularly in Europe. Some of these institutions are larger and better capitalized, and have a stronger local presence and a longer operating history in these markets.        In conducting our businesses in major markets around the world, we are subject to political, economic, legal, operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in other countries, including risks of possible nationalization, expropriation, price  controls, exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries are uncertain  and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market. Our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular foreign market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally. We are also subject to the risk that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in all cases.        In the last several years, various emerging market countries have  experienced severe economic and financial disruptions, including  significant devaluations of their currencies and low or negative  growth rates in their economies. The possible effects of these conditions include an adverse impact on our businesses and increased volatility in financial markets generally. As we expand  our businesses in emerging and other markets, our exposure to these risks will increase.        Securities and futures transactions are now being conducted through the Internet and other alternative, non-traditional trading systems, and it appears that the trend toward alternative  trading systems will continue and probably accelerate. A dramatic increase in computer-based or other electronic trading may adversely affect our commission and trading revenues, reduce our participation in the trading markets and associated access to  market information and lead to the creation of new and stronger competitors.    Item 2.  Properties       Our principal executive offices are located at 85 Broad Street, New York, New York, and comprise approximately 969,000 square feet of leased space, pursuant to a lease agreement expiring in June 2008 (with an option to renew for up to 20 additional years). We also occupy over 500,000 square feet at each of 1 New York Plaza and 10 Hanover Square in New York, New York, pursuant to lease agreements expiring in September 2004 (with an option to renew for ten years) and June 2018, respectively. Additionally, we have a 15-year lease for approximately 605,000 square feet at 180 Maiden Lane in New York, New York, that expires in March 2014. In total, we lease over 3.6 million square feet in the New York area. We have additional offices in the United States and elsewhere in the Americas. Together, these offices comprise approximately 680,000 square feet of leased space.        In the first quarter of 2000, we executed a contract to purchase approximately six acres of unimproved land in Jersey City, New Jersey. We expect to develop this land to complement our offices in lower Manhattan. The initial phase of development is expected to include approximately 1.4 million usable square feet of office  space, with occupancy planned for early 2003.        We also have offices in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. In Europe, we have offices that totaled approximately 788,000 square  feet as of the end of January 2000. Our largest presence  17    Table of Contents  in Europe is in London, where we leased approximately 609,000 square feet through various leases as of the end of January 2000, with the principal one for Peterborough Court expiring in 2016. An additional 453,000 square feet of leased space in London is expected to be occupied during 2000 and 2001.        In Asia, we have offices that total approximately 563,000 square feet. Our largest offices in this region are in Tokyo and Hong Kong. In Tokyo, we currently lease approximately 234,000 square feet under renewable leases with current terms extending, in some  cases, to June 2005. In Hong Kong, we currently lease approximately 222,000 square feet under a lease that expires in 2012. There are significant expansion efforts underway in Tokyo and Singapore.        Our space requirements have increased significantly over the last  several years. Currently, Goldman Sachs is at or near capacity at most of its locations. As a result, we have been actively leasing additional space to support our anticipated growth. Based  on our progress to date, we believe that we will be able to acquire additional space to meet our anticipated needs.    Item 3.  Legal Proceedings       We are involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings (including those described below) concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our businesses. We believe, based on currently available information,  that the results of such proceedings, in the aggregate, will not  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but might be material to our operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.    MobileMedia Securities Litigation       Goldman, Sachs & Co. has been named as a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit commenced on December 6, 1996  and pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. This lawsuit was brought on behalf of purchasers of common stock of MobileMedia Corporation in an underwritten offering in 1995 and purchasers of senior subordinated notes of MobileMedia Communications Inc. in a concurrent underwritten offering. Defendants are MobileMedia Corporation, certain of its officers and directors, and the lead underwriters, including Goldman, Sachs & Co. MobileMedia Corporation is currently reorganizing in bankruptcy.        Goldman, Sachs & Co. underwrote 2,242,500 shares of common stock, for a total price of approximately $53 million, and Goldman Sachs International underwrote 718,750 shares, for a total price of approximately $17 million. Goldman, Sachs & Co. underwrote approximately $38 million in principal amount of the senior subordinated notes.        The consolidated class action complaint alleges violations of the  disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws and seeks  compensatory and/or rescissory damages. In light of MobileMedia Corporations bankruptcy, the action against it has been stayed. Defendants motion to dismiss was denied in October 1998.        The parties have entered into a stipulation of settlement, which was approved by the court on February 7, 2000, but the time to appeal has yet to expire.    Antitrust Matters       Goldman, Sachs & Co. is one of numerous financial services companies that have been named as defendants in certain purported  class actions brought in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by purchasers of securities in public offerings, who claim that the defendants engaged in conspiracies in violation of federal antitrust laws in connection  with these offerings. The plaintiffs in each instance seek treble damages as well as injunctive relief. One of the actions, which was commenced on August 21, 1998, alleges that the defendants have conspired to discourage or restrict the resale of  securities for a period after the offerings,  18    Table of Contents  including by imposing penalty bids. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint in November 1998. The plaintiffs amended their complaint in February 1999, modifying their claims in various ways, including limiting the proposed class to retail purchasers of public offerings. On May 7, 1999, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint.        Several other actions were commenced, beginning on November 3, 1998, that allege that the defendants, many of whom are also named in the other action discussed above, have conspired to fix at 7% the discount that underwriting syndicates receive from issuers of shares in certain offerings. On March 15, 1999, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on April 29, 1999.        Goldman, Sachs & Co. received a Civil Investigative Demand on  April 29, 1999 from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting information with respect to its investigation of an alleged conspiracy among securities underwriters to fix underwriting fees.        Hull Trading Co. L.L.C., an affiliate of The Goldman Sachs Group,  Inc., is one of numerous market makers in listed equity options which have been named as defendants, together with five national securities exchanges, in a purported class action brought in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of persons who purchased or sold listed equity options. The consolidated class action complaint, filed on October 4,  1999 (which consolidated certain previously pending actions and added Hull Trading Co. L.L.C. and other market makers as defendants), generally alleges that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to preclude the multiple listing of certain equity options on the exchanges and seeks treble damages under the antitrust laws as well as injunctive relief. On January 28, 2000, the defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated class action complaint.    Rockefeller Center Properties, Inc. Litigation        Several former shareholders of Rockefeller Center Properties, Inc. brought purported class actions in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and the Delaware Court of Chancery arising from the acquisition of Rockefeller Center Properties, Inc. by an investor group in July 1996. The defendants in the actions include, among others, Goldman, Sachs & Co.,  Whitehall Real Estate Partnership V, a fund advised by Goldman, Sachs & Co., a Goldman, Sachs & Co. managing director and other members of the investor group. The federal court actions, which have since been consolidated, were filed beginning on November 15, 1996, and the state court action was filed on May 29, 1998.        The complaints generally allege that the proxy statement disseminated to former Rockefeller Center Properties, Inc. stockholders in connection with the transaction was deficient, in  violation of the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws. The plaintiffs are seeking, among other things, unspecified damages, rescission of the acquisition, and/or disgorgement.        In a series of decisions, the federal district court granted summary judgment dismissing all the claims in the federal action.  The plaintiffs appealed those rulings.        On July 19, 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rendered its decision affirming in part and vacating in part the lower courts entry of summary judgment dismissing the action. With respect to the claim as to which summary judgment was vacated, the appellate court held that the district court had committed a procedural error in converting the defendants motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment and remanded for the district court to reconsider that claim under appropriate standards applicable to motions to dismiss. Plaintiffs have since sought leave to amend the complaint as to the remanded claim. The defendants have moved to dismiss the remanded claim and are opposing the plaintiffs motion to amend it further.        The state action has been stayed pending disposition of the federal action.  19    Table of Contents   Reichhold Chemicals Litigation       Reichhold Chemicals, Inc. and Reichhold Norway ASA brought a claim on March 30, 1998 in the Commercial Court in London against Goldman Sachs International in relation to the plaintiffs 1997 purchase of the polymer division of one of Goldman Sachs Internationals Norwegian clients, Jotun A/S. The plaintiffs claim that they overpaid by $40 million based upon  misrepresentations concerning the financial performance of the polymer division.        In November 1998, the Commercial Court granted Goldman Sachs  Internationals application for a stay of the action pending the outcome of arbitration proceedings between Reichhold Chemicals, Inc. and Reichhold Norway ASA, on the one hand, and Jotun A/S in Norway, on the other. That stay order was upheld by an appellate court on June 28, 1999.    Matters Relating to Municipal Securities        Goldman, Sachs & Co., together with a number of other firms active in the municipal securities area, has received requests beginning in June 1995 for information from the SEC and certain other federal and state agencies and authorities with respect to the pricing of escrow securities sold by Goldman, Sachs & Co. to certain municipal bond issuers in connection with the advanced refunding of municipal securities. Goldman, Sachs & Co. understands that certain municipal bond issuers to which Goldman, Sachs & Co. sold escrow securities have also received such inquiries.        There have been published reports that an action under the Federal False Claims Act was filed in February 1995 alleging  unlawful and undisclosed overcharges in certain advance refunding transactions by a private plaintiff on behalf of the United States and that Goldman, Sachs & Co., together with a number of other firms, is a named defendant in that action. The complaint was reportedly filed under seal while the government determines whether it will pursue the claims directly.        Goldman, Sachs & Co. is also one of many municipal underwriting firms that have been named as defendants in a purported class action brought on November 24, 1998 in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida by the Clerk of Collier County, Florida on behalf of municipal issuers which purchased escrow securities since October 1986 in connection with advance refundings. The amended complaint alleges  that the securities were excessively marked up in violation of the Investment Advisers Act and Florida law, and that the defendants violated the federal antitrust laws in connection with the prices at which escrow securities were sold to municipal issuers. The complaint seeks to recover the difference between the actual and alleged fair prices  of the escrow securities and to treble the alleged damages with respect to the antitrust claim. On October 29, 1999, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.    AMF Securities Litigation       The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and a Goldman, Sachs & Co. managing director have been named  as defendants in several purported class action lawsuits beginning on April 27, 1999 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuits, which have been consolidated, were brought on behalf of purchasers of stock of AMF Bowling, Inc. in an underwritten initial public offering of 15,525,000 shares of common stock in November 1997 at a price of $19.50 per share. Defendants are AMF Bowling, Inc., certain officers and directors of AMF Bowling, Inc. (including the Goldman, Sachs & Co. managing director), and the lead underwriters of the offering (including Goldman, Sachs & Co.). The consolidated amended complaint alleges  violations of the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws and seeks compensatory damages and/or rescission.  The complaint asserts that The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P. and the  Goldman, Sachs & Co. managing director are liable as controlling persons under the federal securities laws because certain funds managed by Goldman Sachs owned a majority of the outstanding common stock of AMF Bowling, Inc. and the  20    Table of Contents  managing director served as its chairman at the time of the offering. On December 22, 1999, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.    Iridium Securities Litigation       Goldman, Sachs & Co. has been named as a defendant in two purported class action lawsuits commenced, beginning on May 26, 1999, in the U.S. District Court for the District of  Columbia. These lawsuits were brought on behalf of purchasers of  Class A common stock of Iridium World Communications, Ltd. in a January 1999 underwritten secondary offering of 7,500,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $33.40 per share, as well as in the secondary market. The defendants in the actions include Iridium, certain of its officers and directors, Motorola, Inc. (an investor in Iridium) and the lead underwriters in the offering, including Goldman, Sachs & Co.        The complaints in both actions allege violations of the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws and seek compensatory and/or rescissory damages. Goldman, Sachs &  Co. underwrote 996,500 shares of common stock and Goldman Sachs International underwrote 320,625 shares of common stock for a total offering price of approximately $44 million.        On August 13, 1999, Iridium World Communications, Ltd. filed  for protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws.    HUD Litigation       In September 1999, Goldman, Sachs & Co. was notified by the civil division of the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Columbia that it is a named defendant, along with other unidentified entities, in a civil action brought by a private party in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia under the qui tam  provisions of the federal False Claims Act in connection with certain auctions of competitive loans on behalf of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Goldman, Sachs & Co. has not been provided with the complaint, which has been filed under seal, but has been informed that the complaint alleges, among other things, that (i) Goldman, Sachs & Co. and its bidding partners improperly directed  approximately $4.7 billion of government-owned notes for prices below that which would have been obtained in full and fair competition, (ii) the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Developments financial advisor in connection with such auctions provided Goldman, Sachs & Co. and its bidding partners with information not available to competing bidders relating to the details of competing bids, the value of the assets being sold and the structure of the sales, and (iii) in one instance, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and its  bidding partners were awarded assets despite not being the highest bidder. Pursuant to the False Claims Act, the complaint remains under seal pending the governments investigation and consideration as to whether to intervene in the action. The complaint does not state a monetary amount of damages. Under the False Claims Act, any damage award could be trebled.    Item 4.

Market for Registrants Common  Equity and Related Stockholder Matters       Information relating to the principal market in which our common stock is traded and the high and low sales prices per share for each full quarterly period since the common stock commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 4, 1999 is set  forth under the caption Stock Price Range on page 74 of the 1999 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated by reference in Item 8 of this Annual Report on  Form 10-K. As of January 17, 2000, there were approximately 591 holders of record of our common stock. There is  no established public trading market for our nonvoting common stock.        During fiscal 1999, dividends of $0.12 per share of common stock and nonvoting common stock were declared on June 23, 1999 and September 20, 1999. The holders of our common stock and nonvoting common stock share proportionately on a per share basis  in all dividends and other distributions declared by our board of directors.        The declaration of dividends by Goldman Sachs is subject to the discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors will  take into account such matters as general business conditions, our financial results, capital requirements, contractual, legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by us to our shareholders or by our subsidiaries to us, the effect on our debt ratings and such other factors as our board of directors may  deem relevant. See Business  Regulation in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of potential regulatory limitations on our receipt of funds from our regulated subsidiaries.        On September 24, 1999, we issued 4,024,637 shares of common stock in connection with our acquisition of The Hull Group. These  shares were issued in a transaction not involving a public offering in reliance on the exemption provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 506  thereunder for transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering (with the recipients representing their intentions to acquire the shares for their own accounts and not with a view to the distribution thereof and acknowledging that the shares were issued in a transaction not registered under the Securities Act of 1933).  24   Table of Contents   Item 6.  Selected Financial Data       The following selected consolidated financial data should be read  in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto on pages 47 to 73 of the 1999 Annual Report to Shareholders.  SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA             (1)    Our pre-tax earnings in 1999 reflect payments for services  rendered by managing directors who, prior to our conversion to  corporate form, were profit participating limited partners. In  prior years, these payments were accounted for as distributions  of partners capital rather than as compensation and  benefits expense. As a result, these payments are not reflected  in operating expenses in 1998, 1997, 1996 or 1995 and, therefore,   the pre-tax earnings in these years are not comparable to 1999.       (2)    Total assets and liabilities were increased as of  November 1999 and November  1998 as a result of certain   provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards  No. 125.   25    Table of Contents        (3)    Represents two quarterly dividends of $0.12 per common share  each.       (4)    Reflects such adjustments as are necessary, in the opinion of  management, for a fair presentation of the results of operations  and average diluted common shares outstanding of Goldman Sachs on   a pro forma basis. For more detailed information concerning  these adjustments, see Managements Discussion and  Analysis  Results of Operations  Pro Forma  Operating Results in the 1999 Annual Report to  Shareholders, which is incorporated by reference in Item 7  of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.       (5)    Excludes employees of Goldman Sachs property management  subsidiaries. Substantially all of the costs of these employees  are reimbursed to Goldman Sachs by the real estate investment  funds to which these subsidiaries provide property management  services.       (6)    Reflects nonrecurring expenses of $2.26 billion associated with  our conversion to corporate form and the charitable contribution  to The Goldman Sachs Foundation of $200 million made at the time  of our initial public offering.
