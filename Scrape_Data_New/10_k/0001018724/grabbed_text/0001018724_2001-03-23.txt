ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K INCLUDES FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. ALL STATEMENTS OTHER THAN STATEMENTS OF HISTORICAL FACT, INCLUDING STATEMENTS REGARDING INDUSTRY PROSPECTS AND FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION, MADE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K ARE FORWARD LOOKING. WE USE WORDS SUCH AS ANTICIPATES, BELIEVES, EXPECTS, FUTURE, AND INTENDS AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS TO IDENTIFY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS REFLECT MANAGEMENT'S CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION INCLUDES FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS REGARDING EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE OPERATING NET PROFIT, NET SALES, GROSS PROFIT, CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES, IMPROVEMENT IN OPERATING LOSS AND CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES, ALL OF WHICH ARE INHERENTLY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, INCLUDING THE RATE OF GROWTH OF THE INTERNET AND ONLINE COMMERCE AND THE U.S AND GLOBAL ECONOMIES IN GENERAL, THE AMOUNT THAT WE INVEST IN NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND THE TIMING OF THOSE INVESTMENTS, CUSTOMER SPENDING PATTERNS, THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD TO CUSTOMERS, THE MIX OF REVENUES DERIVED FROM PRODUCT SALES AS COMPARED TO SERVICES, RISKS OF INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, AND RISKS OF DISTRIBUTION AND FULFILLMENT THROUGHPUT AND PRODUCTIVITY. THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AS WELL AS OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS, ARE DESCRIBED IN GREATER DETAIL IN ITEM 1 OF PART I, "BUSINESS--ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS." RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NET SALES NET SALES INCLUDES THE SELLING PRICE OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS SOLD BY US, LESS PROMOTIONAL GIFT CERTIFICATES AND SALES RETURNS; OUTBOUND SHIPPING CHARGES BILLED TO OUR CUSTOMERS; SERVICE REVENUES EARNED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS ("SERVICE REVENUES"); AND COMMISSIONS EARNED FROM OUR AMAZON MARKETPLACE, AUCTIONS, ZSHOPS, PAYMENTS AND OTHER SERVICE INITIATIVES. NET SALES WERE $2.8 BILLION, $1.6 BILLION AND $610 MILLION FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY. INCREASES IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS OF NET SALES DURING 2000 ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED UNIT SALES IN OUR EXISTING STORES, ENHANCEMENTS AND ADDITIONS TO OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS, AND INCREASES IN OUR SERVICE REVENUES FROM STRATEGIC PARTNERS. INCREASES IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS OF NET SALES DURING 1999 WERE DUE TO FACTORS INCLUDING INCREASED UNIT SALES AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCT LINES. NET SALES FOR OUR U.S. BOOKS, MUSIC AND DVD/VIDEO SEGMENT WERE $1.7 BILLION, $1.3 BILLION AND $588 MILLION FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY. ANNUAL GROWTH RATES FOR THE U.S. BOOKS, MUSIC, AND DVD/VIDEO SEGMENT WERE 30%, 122% AND 298% FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY. DECLINES IN YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH RATES DURING 2000 ARE REFLECTIVE OF SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING THE RELATIVE MATURITY AND INCREASING REVENUE BASE OF THIS SEGMENT, A CURRENT-YEAR FOCUS ON BALANCING REVENUE GROWTH WITH OPERATING EFFICIENCY, A SHIFT IN MARKETING STRATEGY AIMED TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS BEYOND THIS SEGMENT, AND A GENERAL SLOWDOWN IN CONSUMER SPENDING. THE DECLINE IN GROWTH RATE DURING 1999 AS COMPARED TO 1998 WAS DUE TO FACTORS INCLUDING THE RELATIVE MATURITY AND INCREASING REVENUE BASE OF THE SEGMENT. NET SALES FOR OUR EARLY-STAGE BUSINESSES AND OTHER SEGMENT WERE $683 MILLION AND $164 MILLION FOR 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY. OUR EARLY-STAGE BUSINESS AND OTHER SEGMENT COMMENCED OPERATIONS IN 1999 AND, ACCORDINGLY, NO CORRESPONDING AMOUNTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH 1998. INCLUDED IN NET SALES FOR THIS SEGMENT ARE U.S.-BASED CONSUMER PRODUCTS SALES AND RELATED SHIPPING CHARGES PRIMARILY FOR OUR ELECTRONICS AND HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES AS WELL AS SERVICE REVENUES. GROWTH IN NET SALES DURING 2000 REFLECTS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN UNITS SOLD BY OUR ELECTRONICS AND HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES IN COMPARISON WITH 1999, AS WELL AS ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR EXISTING PRODUCT OFFERINGS WITH OUR ADDITION OF KITCHEN AND WIRELESS PRODUCTS. SERVICE 20 <PAGE> REVENUES WERE $167 MILLION AND $9 MILLION FOR 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY. GROWTH IN SERVICE REVENUES DURING 2000 RELATED PRIMARILY TO OUR BUSINESS-TO- BUSINESS STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH TOYSRUS.COM, ASHFORD.COM, DRUGSTORE.COM AND AUDIBLE. SERVICE REVENUES DURING 2000 INCLUDED SALES OF INVENTORY, AT OUR COST, TO TOYSRUS.COM OF $29 MILLION. SERVICE REVENUE RECOGNIZED DURING 2000 CONSISTED OF CONSIDERATION, EITHER RECEIVED DURING THE PERIOD OR AMORTIZED FROM PREVIOUSLY UNEARNED REVENUE, IN THE FORM OF $88 MILLION OF CASH, $73 MILLION OF EQUITY SECURITIES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES AND $6 MILLION OF EQUITY SECURITIES OF PRIVATE COMPANIES. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES, THE FAIR VALUE OF SECURITIES RECEIVED IS GENERALLY DETERMINED AT THE DATE AGREEMENTS ARE CONSUMMATED; REVENUE IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED OVER THE CORRESPONDING SERVICE PERIODS BASED ON INITIAL VALUATIONS, AND IS NOT ADJUSTED DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITIES. HOWEVER, IF THE SECURITIES ARE RECEIVED AFTER MARCH 16, 2000 AND ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE OR VESTING PROVISIONS AND NO SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE COMMITMENT EXISTS UPON SIGNING OF THE AGREEMENTS, THE FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED AS OF THE DATE THE RESPECTIVE FORFEITURE OR VESTING PROVISIONS LAPSE. NET SALES FOR OUR INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT WERE $381 MILLION, $168 MILLION AND $22 MILLION FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY, AND WERE COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF BOOKS, MUSIC AND DVD/VIDEO CONSUMER PRODUCT SALES AND RELATED SHIPPING CHARGES TO OUR CUSTOMERS. THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT INCLUDES SALES FROM OUR WWW.AMAZON.CO.UK, WWW.AMAZON.DE, WWW.AMAZON.FR AND WWW.AMAZON.CO.JP WEB SITES, INCLUDING THEIR EXPORT SALES INTO THE UNITED STATES. GROWTH IN OUR INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT DURING 2000 REFLECTS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN UNITS SOLD BY OUR WWW.AMAZON.DE AND WWW.AMAZON.CO.UK SITES IN COMPARISON WITH 1999 AS WELL AS THE LAUNCH OF OUR NEW WWW.AMAZON.FR AND WWW.AMAZON.CO.JP SITES DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2000. SALES TO CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING EXPORT SALES FROM WWW.AMAZON.COM, REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 22%, 22% AND 20% OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY. SHIPPING REVENUE ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS WAS $339 MILLION, $239 MILLION AND $94 MILLION FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY. INCREASES IN SHIPPING REVENUE IN 2000 AND 1999 CORRESPOND WITH INCREASES IN UNIT SALES, OFFSET ESPECIALLY IN 2000 BY OUR PERIODIC FREE AND REDUCED SHIPPING PROMOTIONS OFFERED DURING THE YEAR. WE EXPECT NET SALES TO BE BETWEEN $650 MILLION AND $700 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER ENDING MARCH 31, 2001, AND NET SALES TO INCREASE BETWEEN 20% AND 30% IN 2001 COMPARED TO 2000. HOWEVER, ANY SUCH PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY. SEE ITEM 1 OF PART I, "BUSINESS--ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS." GROSS PROFIT GROSS PROFIT IS NET SALES LESS THE COST OF SALES, WHICH CONSISTS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS SOLD BY US, INBOUND AND OUTBOUND SHIPPING CHARGES, PACKAGING SUPPLIES AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SERVICE REVENUES AND MARKETPLACE SERVICES BUSINESSES. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SERVICE REVENUES INCLUDE EMPLOYEE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CREATION OF CONTENT FOR CO-BRANDED WEB SITES, FULFILLMENT-RELATED COSTS TO SHIP PRODUCTS ON BEHALF OF OUR SERVICE PARTNERS, AND OTHER ASSOCIATED COSTS. GROSS PROFIT WAS $656 MILLION, $291 MILLION AND $134 MILLION FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY. INCREASES IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS OF GROSS PROFIT DURING 2000 ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED UNIT SALES IN OUR EXISTING STORES, ENHANCEMENTS AND ADDITIONS TO OUR EXISTING PRODUCT OFFERINGS, INCREASES IN OUR SERVICE REVENUES FROM STRATEGIC PARTNERS, AND IMPROVEMENTS IN INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCT SOURCING. INCREASES IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS OF GROSS PROFIT DURING 1999 WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED UNIT SALES AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCT LINES. EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF OUR SERVICE ARRANGEMENTS WITH STRATEGIC PARTNERS, GROSS MARGIN WOULD HAVE BEEN 21% AND 17% AS COMPARED WITH AN OVERALL GROSS MARGIN OF 24% AND 18% FOR 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY. GROSS PROFIT FOR OUR U.S. BOOKS, MUSIC AND DVD/VIDEO SEGMENT WAS $417 MILLION, $263 MILLION AND $129 MILLION FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY. GROSS MARGIN FOR THESE SAME PERIODS WAS 25%, 20% AND 22%, RESPECTIVELY. IMPROVEMENTS IN GROSS MARGIN DURING 2000 WERE LARGELY REFLECTIVE OF OUR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE PRODUCT SOURCING AS WE CONTINUED TO INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF PRODUCTS SOURCED DIRECTLY FROM PUBLISHERS, AS WELL AS FROM A FAVORABLE MIX IN CUSTOMER DISCOUNTS AND LOWER INVENTORY CHARGES AS A PERCENT OF SALES. 21 <PAGE> GROSS PROFIT FOR OUR U.S. EARLY-STAGE BUSINESSES AND OTHER SEGMENT WAS $161 MILLION IN 2000 COMPARED WITH A GROSS LOSS IN 1999 OF $8 MILLION. GROSS PROFIT FROM SERVICES WAS $111 MILLION AND $9 MILLION DURING 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTING SERVICE MARGINS OF 66% AND 100%, RESPECTIVELY. GROSS PROFIT FROM SERVICES CORRESPONDS WITH SERVICE REVENUE OF $167 MILLION RECOGNIZED DURING 2000, WHICH CONSISTED OF CONSIDERATION, EITHER RECEIVED DURING THE PERIOD OR AMORTIZED FROM PREVIOUSLY RECORDED UNEARNED REVENUE, IN THE FORM OF $88 MILLION OF CASH, $73 MILLION OF EQUITY SECURITIES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES AND $6 MILLION OF EQUITY SECURITIES OF PRIVATE COMPANIES. SEE "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--NET SALES," AND "STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS." THE DECLINE IN SERVICE MARGIN DURING 2000 RELATES PRIMARILY TO COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP WITH TOYSRUS.COM, AS WELL AS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PERSONNEL DEDICATED TO GENERATE AND SUPPORT OUR OTHER BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. GROSS PROFIT FOR OUR INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT WAS $77 MILLION, $36 MILLION AND $5 MILLION FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY. GROSS MARGIN FOR THESE SAME PERIODS WAS 20%, 21% AND 23%, RESPECTIVELY. INCREASES DURING 2000 IN OUR ABSOLUTE GROSS PROFIT DOLLARS REFLECTS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN UNITS SOLD BY OUR WWW.AMAZON.DE AND WWW.AMAZON.CO.UK SITES IN COMPARISON WITH 1999, AS WELL AS THE LAUNCH OF OUR NEW WWW.AMAZON.FR AND WWW.AMAZON.CO.JP SITES DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2000. OUR GROSS MARGINS DECREASED DURING 2000 IN COMPARISON WITH 1999 DUE TO FACTORS INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE MIX OF CUSTOMER DISCOUNTS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE IMPACT OF LOWER-MARGIN SALES, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF SHIPPING PROMOTIONS, ASSOCIATED WITH LAUNCHING OUR WWW.AMAZON.FR AND WWW.AMAZON.CO.JP SITES. SHIPPING GROSS LOSS WAS $1 MILLION DURING 2000 IN COMPARISON WITH GROSS PROFIT OF $12 MILLION AND $18 MILLION FOR 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY. THE GROSS LOSS IN SHIPPING WAS DUE TO ADDITIONAL FREE AND REDUCED SHIPPING PROMOTIONS OFFERED DURING 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 AND 1998, AS WELL AS INCREASES IN SPLIT AND LONG-ZONE SHIPMENTS, ESPECIALLY DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000. WE WILL FROM TIME TO TIME CONTINUE OFFERING SHIPPING PROMOTIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE LOW OR EVEN NEGATIVE GROSS PROFIT DOLLARS FROM SHIPPING ACTIVITIES. WE EXPECT OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN TO BE AT LEAST 21% TO 23% OF NET SALES FOR THE QUARTER ENDING MARCH 31, 2001. HOWEVER, ANY SUCH PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY. SEE ITEM 1 OF PART I, "BUSINESS--ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS." MARKETING AND FULFILLMENT MARKETING EXPENSES CONSIST OF ADVERTISING, PROMOTIONAL AND PUBLIC RELATIONS EXPENDITURES, AND PAYROLL AND RELATED EXPENSES FOR PERSONNEL ENGAGED IN MARKETING AND SELLING ACTIVITIES. FULFILLMENT COSTS REPRESENT THOSE COSTS INCURRED IN OPERATING AND STAFFING OUR FULFILLMENT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTERS, INCLUDING COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO RECEIVING, INSPECTING AND WAREHOUSING INVENTORIES; PICKING, PACKAGING AND PREPARING CUSTOMERS' ORDERS FOR SHIPMENT; CREDIT CARD FEES; AND RESPONDING TO INQUIRIES FROM CUSTOMERS. MARKETING AND SALES EXPENSES, NET OF CO-OPERATIVE MARKETING REIMBURSEMENTS, WERE $180 MILLION, $176 MILLION AND $67 MILLION FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY. FULFILLMENT COSTS WERE $415 MILLION, $237 MILLION AND $65 MILLION FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTING 15%, 14% AND 11% OF NET SALES FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS. THE INCREASE IN FULFILLMENT COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES IN 2000 REFLECTS THE FULL YEAR OF OPERATING OUR NEWLY OPENED FULFILLMENT CENTERS, OFFSET BY IMPROVED UTILIZATION OF OUR FULFILLMENT NETWORK IN COMPARISON WITH 1999. THE INCREASE IN FULFILLMENT EXPENSE DURING 1999 RELATES TO THE EXPANSION OF OUR FULFILLMENT NETWORK CAPACITY DURING 1999. IN JANUARY 2001, WE ANNOUNCED OUR DECISION TO CLOSE OUR FULFILLMENT CENTER IN MCDONOUGH, GEORGIA, CLOSE OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER IN SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, AND OPERATE SEASONALLY OUR FULFILLMENT CENTER IN SEATTLE, WASHINGTON. IN FEBRUARY 2001, WE ANNOUNCED OUR DECISION TO CONSOLIDATE OUR EUROPEAN CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTERS BY CLOSING OUR CENTER IN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS, AND OPERATING OUT OF TWO EXPANDED CENTERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND GERMANY. WE EXPECT THESE DECISIONS, ALONG WITH OUR CONTINUED EFFORTS TO IMPROVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, WILL CAUSE MARKETING AND FULFILLMENT COSTS TO DECLINE AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES DURING 2001. 22 <PAGE> TECHNOLOGY AND CONTENT TECHNOLOGY AND CONTENT EXPENSES CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF PAYROLL AND RELATED EXPENSES FOR DEVELOPMENT, EDITORIAL, SYSTEMS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS OPERATIONS PERSONNEL AND CONSULTANTS; SYSTEMS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE; AND COSTS OF ACQUIRED CONTENT, INCLUDING FREELANCE REVIEWS. TECHNOLOGY AND CONTENT EXPENSE WAS $269 MILLION, $160 MILLION AND $46 MILLION FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998, REPRESENTING 10%, 10%, AND 8% OF NET SALES FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS. THE INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS SPENT DURING 2000 AND 1999 WERE PRIMARILY REFLECTIVE OF OUR CONTINUAL ENHANCEMENTS TO THE FEATURES, CONTENT AND FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR WEB SITES AND TRANSACTION-PROCESSING SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS INCREASED INVESTMENT IN SYSTEMS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE. THESE INCREASES WERE ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND EXPANSIONS OF EXISTING PRODUCT OFFERINGS, AS WELL AS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LAUNCHING OUR WWW.AMAZON.FR AND WWW.AMAZON.CO.JP SITES DURING 2000. DURING 2000 AND 1999, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SOP 98-1, ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR OBTAINED FOR INTERNAL USE, WHICH WE ADOPTED IN 1999, WE CAPITALIZED, NET OF DEPRECIATION, $16 MILLION AND $8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF COSTS RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO OPERATING OUR WEB SITES. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN TECHNOLOGY AND IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR WEB SITES DURING 2001, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, OFFERING ADDITIONAL PRODUCT CATEGORIES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY CONTINUING OUR INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST OF PAYROLL AND RELATED EXPENSES FOR EXECUTIVE, FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL, RECRUITING, PROFESSIONAL FEES AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSES. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $109 MILLION, $70 MILLION AND $16 MILLION FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTING 4%, 4%, AND 3% OF NET SALES FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IS COMPRISED OF THE PORTION OF ACQUISITION-RELATED CONSIDERATION CONDITIONED ON THE CONTINUED TENURE OF KEY EMPLOYEES OF CERTAIN OF OUR ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, WHICH MUST BE CLASSIFIED AS COMPENSATION EXPENSE RATHER THAN AS A COMPONENT OF PURCHASE PRICE UNDER ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ALSO INCLUDES STOCK-BASED CHARGES SUCH AS OPTION-RELATED DEFERRED COMPENSATION RECORDED AT OUR INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER COMPENSATION AND SEVERANCE ARRANGEMENTS. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION WAS $25 MILLION, $31 MILLION, AND $2 MILLION FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY. DURING 2000, DECLINES IN THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE AND THE TERMINATION OF CERTAIN ACQUISITION-RELATED EMPLOYEES PRIOR TO VESTING IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS HAD THE EFFECT OF REDUCING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN COMPARISON WITH 1999. THE INCREASE DURING 1999 OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS DURING 1999. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001, WE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO OFFER A LIMITED NON- COMPULSORY EXCHANGE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS. THIS OPTION EXCHANGE OFFER WILL RESULT IN VARIABLE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR STOCK OPTIONS REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 15 MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. VARIABLE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT WILL RESULT IN UNPREDICTABLE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION DEPENDENT ON FLUCTUATIONS IN QUOTED PRICES FOR THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. THESE UNPREDICTABLE FLUCTUATIONS IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION MAY RESULT IN MATERIAL NON-CASH FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN PERIODS OF GENERAL DECLINE IN THE QUOTED PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, IF ANY, VARIABLE ACCOUNTING WILL CAUSE US TO RECOGNIZE LESS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION THAN IN PERIODS OF GENERAL APPRECIATION IN THE QUOTED PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. FURTHERMORE, IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE INCREASES IN THE QUOTED PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ARE FOLLOWED BY DECLINES IN THE QUOTED PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, VARIABLE ACCOUNTING MAY RESULT IN NEGATIVE EXPENSE RECOGNITION AS WE ADJUST THE CUMULATIVE COMPENSATION OF OUR STOCK-BASED AWARDS. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IS NON-CASH AND WILL THEREFORE HAVE NO IMPACT ON OUR CASH FLOWS OR LIQUIDITY. PURSUANT TO THE OPTION EXCHANGE OFFER, THE NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUABLE UPON OPTION EXERCISES DECREASED FROM APPROXIMATELY 70 MILLION SHARES, OR 19.5% OF THE COMPANY'S OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, TO APPROXIMATELY 52 MILLION SHARES, OR 14.4% OF THE COMPANY'S OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK. 23 <PAGE> AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES WAS $322 MILLION, $215 MILLION AND $43 MILLION FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY. THESE COSTS INCREASED IN 2000 RELATING TO THE FULL YEAR OF AMORTIZATION FOR THE ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN 1999, AND INCREASED DURING 1999 RESULTING FROM AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL RECORDED IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED DURING THE FIRST PART OF 1999. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2000, WE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS ON GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES OF $184 MILLION RELATING TO CERTAIN OF OUR 1999 ACQUISITIONS (SEE "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--IMPAIRMENT-RELATED AND OTHER"). THIS IMPAIRMENT LOSS REDUCED OUR RECORDED BASIS IN GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUCING AMORTIZATION EXPENSE IN 2001. THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD HAS TENTATIVELY DECIDED TO REQUIRE USE OF A NONAMORTIZATION APPROACH TO ACCOUNT FOR PURCHASED GOODWILL. UNDER A NONAMORTIZATION APPROACH, GOODWILL WOULD NOT BE AMORTIZED INTO EARNINGS, BUT INSTEAD WOULD BE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT, THAT IS, WRITTEN DOWN AND CHARGED TO EARNINGS ONLY IN THE PERIODS IN WHICH THE RECORDED VALUE OF GOODWILL IS MORE THAN ITS FAIR VALUE. IF THIS TENTATIVE DECISION IS FINALIZED, OUR AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINE IN FUTURE PERIODS. IMPAIRMENT-RELATED AND OTHER IMPAIRMENT-RELATED AND OTHER WAS $200 MILLION, $8 MILLION AND $4 MILLION FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY. WE RECORD IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WHEN EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT SUCH ASSETS MIGHT BE IMPAIRED AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET IS LESS THAN ITS RECORDED AMOUNT. CONDITIONS THAT WOULD NECESSITATE AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT INCLUDE MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGES IN OPERATIONS, SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE DIFFERENCES IN ACTUAL RESULTS IN COMPARISON WITH INITIAL VALUATION FORECASTS PREPARED AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION, A DECISION TO ABANDON ACQUIRED PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGIES, OR OTHER SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGES THAT WOULD INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE RECORDED ASSET MIGHT NOT BE RECOVERABLE. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2000, WE IDENTIFIED INDICATORS OF POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT OF OUR RECORDED GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES. SUCH INDICATORS INCLUDED THE GENERAL SLOWDOWN IN CONSUMER SPENDING, OUR DECLINE IN MARKET CAPITALIZATION AS DETERMINED BY THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK, THE PERVASIVE AND SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN E-COMMERCE BUSINESS VALUATIONS IN COMPARISON WITH THE MARKET VALUATIONS AT THE TIME WE INVESTED IN OUR ACQUISITIONS, AND CHANGES IN OUR STRATEGIC PLANS FOR CERTAIN OF OUR ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES, WE IDENTIFIED CERTAIN LEVELS OF IMPAIRMENT CORRESPONDING WITH THE BUSINESS-UNIT GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES INITIALLY RECORDED IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOLLOWING ACQUISITIONS: ALEXA INTERNET, BACK TO BASICS TOYS, INC., ACME ELECTRIC MOTOR CO. (TOOL CRIB) AND LIVEBID.COM, INC. ACCORDINGLY, WE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS OF $184 MILLION DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2000. NO IMPAIRMENTS WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE COMPANY'S ENTERPRISE-LEVEL GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES, AND NO IMPAIRMENTS OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES WERE RECORDED IN 1999 AND 1998. LOSS FROM OPERATIONS OUR LOSS FROM OPERATIONS WAS $864 MILLION, $606 MILLION AND $109 MILLION FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY. THESE INCREASES ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION OF OUR BUSINESS THROUGH STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS, NEW CONSUMER PRODUCT-LINE OFFERINGS, LAUNCHING ADDITIONAL INTERNATIONALLY-FOCUSED WEB SITES, AND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING OUR FULFILLMENT CAPACITY IN ADVANCE OF DEMAND. ADDITIONALLY, DURING 2000 OUR OPERATING LOSS INCLUDED IMPAIRMENT-RELATED AND OTHER COSTS OF $200 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATING TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES. OUR OPERATING EXPENSES HAVE HISTORICALLY INCREASED MORE QUICKLY THAN OUR REVENUES AS WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR OPERATIONS. WE EXPECT THAT OUR OVERALL LOSS FROM OPERATIONS INCURRED IN 2001 WILL DECREASE SIGNIFICANTLY AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, AND IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS, COMPARED TO 2000. HOWEVER, ANY SUCH PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY. SEE ITEM 1 OF PART I "BUSINESS--ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS." NET INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER NET INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER, EXCLUDING "NON-CASH GAINS AND LOSSES," WAS $100 MILLION, $37 MILLION AND $13 MILLION FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY. INCLUDED WAS INTEREST INCOME OF $41 MILLION, 24 <PAGE> $45 MILLION AND $14 MILLION, AND INTEREST EXPENSE OF $131 MILLION, $85 MILLION AND $27 MILLION FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY. INTEREST INCOME RELATES PRIMARILY TO INTEREST EARNED ON FIXED INCOME SECURITIES AND CORRELATES WITH THE AVERAGE BALANCE OF THOSE INVESTMENTS. THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE DURING 2000 AND 1999 IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR FEBRUARY 2000 ISSUANCE OF 690 MILLION EUROS OF 6.875% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES DUE 2010, ALSO KNOWN AS PEACS (THE "PEACS"), OUR FEBRUARY 1999 ISSUANCE OF $1.25 BILLION OF 4.75% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES DUE 2009 (THE "4.75% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES"), AND OUR MAY 1998 ISSUANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $326 MILLION GROSS PROCEEDS OF 10% SENIOR DISCOUNT NOTES DUE 2008 (THE "SENIOR DISCOUNT NOTES"). NON-CASH GAINS AND LOSSES NON-CASH GAINS AND LOSSES WERE RECORDED DURING 2000 AND AMOUNTED TO A LOSS OF $143 MILLION, NET. NO CORRESPONDING AMOUNTS RELATED TO 1999 OR 1998. DURING 2000, WE RECORDED NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT LOSSES, WHICH TOTALED $189 MILLION, RELATING TO OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINES IN OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN AUDIBLE, INC., NEXTCARD, INC., WEBVAN GROUP, INC., ASHFORD.COM, INC., GREG MANNING AUCTIONS, INC, AND SOTHEBY'S HOLDINGS, INC. ADDITIONALLY, WE RECORDED A NON- CASH GAIN OF $40 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE SEPTEMBER 2000 ACQUISITION OF HOMEGROCER.COM, INC. BY AN UNRELATED THIRD-PARTY, WEBVAN GROUP, INC. THIS NON- CASH GAIN REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR RECORDED BASIS IN THE COMMON STOCK OF HOMEGROCER.COM PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION AND THE FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY SECURITIES RECEIVED FROM THE ACQUIRING COMPANY, WEBVAN GROUP, INC. AFTER THE ACQUISITION, WE CLASSIFIED THE RESULTING INVESTMENT AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AS WE NO LONGER HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE INVESTEE. WE ALSO RECORDED A NET GAIN WHEN LIVING.COM, INC. DECLARED BANKRUPTCY AND TERMINATED ITS COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT WITH US. OUR NET GAIN OF $6 MILLION WAS COMPRISED OF A $14 MILLION LOSS REPRESENTING OUR REMAINING INVESTMENT BALANCE IN LIVING.COM AND A $20 MILLION GAIN RELATING TO THE UNAMORTIZED PORTION OF UNEARNED REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE LIVING.COM COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000, OUR BASIS IN EQUITY SECURITIES WAS $128 MILLION, INCLUDING $36 MILLION CLASSIFIED AS "MARKETABLE SECURITIES," $52 MILLION CLASSIFIED AS "INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY-METHOD INVESTEES," AND $40 MILLION CLASSIFIED AS "OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS." EQUITY IN LOSSES OF EQUITY-METHOD INVESTEES EQUITY IN LOSSES OF EQUITY-METHOD INVESTEES REPRESENTS OUR SHARE OF LOSSES OF COMPANIES IN WHICH WE HAVE INVESTMENTS THAT GIVE US THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT NOT CONTROL, OVER AN INVESTEE. THIS IS GENERALLY DEFINED AS AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF THE VOTING STOCK OF THE INVESTEE OF BETWEEN 20% AND 50%, ALTHOUGH OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS REPRESENTATION ON THE INVESTEE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE IMPACT OF COMMERCIAL ARRANGEMENTS, ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING IS APPROPRIATE. OUR SHARE OF EQUITY-METHOD LOSSES WAS $305 MILLION, $77 MILLION AND $3 MILLION FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY. EQUITY-METHOD LOSSES REDUCE OUR UNDERLYING INVESTMENT BALANCES UNTIL THE RECORDED BASIS IS REDUCED TO ZERO. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000, OUR BASIS IN EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS WAS $52 MILLION. ACCORDINGLY, WE EXPECT EQUITY-METHOD LOSSES TO DECLINE SUBSTANTIALLY DURING 2001 IN COMPARISON WITH 2000. INCOME TAXES WE PROVIDED FOR AN IMMATERIAL AMOUNT OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED U.S. FEDERAL, STATE OR FOREIGN INCOME TAXES FOR THE CURRENT AND ALL PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED. WE PROVIDED A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF NET OPERATING LOSSES, BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ITS REALIZATION. OPERATIONAL RESTRUCTURING SUBSEQUENT TO DECEMBER 31, 2000, WE APPROVED A PLAN FOR AN OPERATIONAL RESTRUCTURING IN WHICH WE WILL REDUCE OUR EMPLOYEE STAFF BY APPROXIMATELY 1,300 POSITIONS, OR 15% OF OUR WORKFORCE. ADDITIONALLY, WE WILL CONSOLIDATE OUR SEATTLE, WASHINGTON CORPORATE OFFICE LOCATIONS, CLOSE OUR MCDONOUGH, GEORGIA FULFILLMENT CENTER, OPERATE OUR SEATTLE, WASHINGTON FULFILLMENT CENTER ON A SEASONAL BASIS, CLOSE OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTERS IN SEATTLE, WASHINGTON AND THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS, AND MIGRATE A LARGE PORTION OF OUR TECHNOLOGY 25 <PAGE> INFRASTRUCTURE TO A NEW HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PLATFORM. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE RESTRUCTURING WILL RESULT IN COSTS DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2001 EXCEEDING $150 MILLION RELATING PRIMARILY TO SEVERANCE, FIXED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, CONTINUING LEASE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER EXIT COSTS DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR RESTRUCTURING. PRO FORMA RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WE PROVIDE CERTAIN PRO FORMA INFORMATION REGARDING OUR RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS, WHICH EXCLUDES STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES, AND IMPAIRMENT-RELATED AND OTHER. WE ALSO PROVIDE CERTAIN PRO FORMA INFORMATION REGARDING OUR NET LOSS WHICH EXCLUDES NON-CASH GAINS AND LOSSES, NET; EQUITY IN LOSSES OF EQUITY-METHOD INVESTEES, NET; AS WELL AS THE AMOUNTS EXCLUDED FROM PRO FORMA OPERATING RESULTS.

WE ARE PROVIDING PRO FORMA RESULTS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THE PRO FORMA RESULTS ARE DERIVED FROM INFORMATION RECORDED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE EXPECT THAT OUR PRO FORMA LOSS FROM OPERATIONS WILL DECLINE AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES FOR 2001. ADDITIONALLY, WE EXPECT TO GENERATE PRO FORMA OPERATING INCOME FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001. WE ALSO EXPECT THAT OUR U.S. BOOKS, MUSIC AND DVD/VIDEO SEGMENT WILL GENERATE INCOME ON A PRO FORMA OPERATING BASIS FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE YEAR IN 2001. OVER THE LONGER TERM, IT IS OUR OBJECTIVE THAT PRO FORMA OPERATING PROFIT WILL REACH THE LOW DOUBLE- DIGITS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES AND OUR RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL MAY REACH THE LOW TRIPLE-DIGITS. HOWEVER, ANY SUCH PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY. SEE ITEM 1 OF PART I, "BUSINESS--ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS." LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCE WAS $822 MILLION AND $133 MILLION, AND OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCE WAS $278 MILLION AND $573 MILLION, AT DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY. NET CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2000 WAS $130 MILLION. THIS WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NET LOSS FOR THE YEAR OF $1.4 BILLION, LARGELY OFFSET BY NET NON-CASH CHARGES TOTALING $995 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO DEPRECIATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, EQUITY IN LOSSES OF EQUITY-METHOD INVESTEES, AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES, IMPAIRMENT-RELATED AND OTHER COSTS, AMORTIZATION OF UNEARNED REVENUE, INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES, AND INTEREST EXPENSE, AS WELL AS $286 MILLION OF CASH PROVIDED BY CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. CASH PROVIDED BY CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IS PRIMARILY A FUNCTION OF A DECREASE IN INVENTORIES, INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND INCREASES IN UNEARNED REVENUE, OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS. FOR 1999, NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $91 MILLION AND WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NET LOSS FOR THE YEAR OF $720 MILLION OFFSET BY NET NON- CASH EXPENSES OF $399 MILLION AND CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $230 MILLION. FOR 1998, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $31 MILLION. NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2000 WAS $164 MILLION AND CONSISTED OF NET SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF $361 MILLION, OFFSET BY PURCHASES OF FIXED ASSETS OF $135 MILLION AND CASH PAID FOR INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY-METHOD INVESTEES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS OF $63 MILLION. NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING 1999 AND 1998 WAS $952 MILLION AND $324 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND CONSISTED OF NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF $295 MILLION AND $277 MILLION, PURCHASES OF FIXED ASSETS OF $287 MILLION AND $28 MILLION, AND CASH PAID FOR INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY-METHOD INVESTEES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS OF $370 MILLION AND $19 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2000 WAS $693 MILLION RELATING PRIMARILY TO OUR ISSUANCE OF 690 MILLION EUROS OF PEACS, NET OF FINANCING COSTS OF $16 MILLION, AND PROCEEDS OF $45 MILLION FROM EXERCISES OF STOCK OPTIONS, OFFSET BY REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT OF $17 MILLION. NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $1.1 BILLION FOR 1999 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $1.25 BILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF OUR 4.75% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES, NET OF FINANCING COSTS OF $35 MILLION, AND PROCEEDS OF $64 MILLION FROM EXERCISES OF STOCK OPTIONS, OFFSET BY REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING $178 MILLION OF CASH PAID TO REPURCHASE A PORTION OF OUR OUTSTANDING SENIOR DISCOUNT NOTES. NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING 1998 WAS $254 MILLION AND WAS RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF OUR SENIOR DISCOUNT NOTES, OFFSET BY FINANCING COSTS AND THE REPAYMENT OF OTHER LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000, OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY CONSISTED OF $1.1 BILLION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES. AS OF THAT DATE, OUR PRINCIPAL COMMITMENTS CONSISTED OF OBLIGATIONS TOTALING $2.1 BILLION RELATED PRIMARILY TO OUR 6.875% PEACS, 4.75% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES AND SENIOR DISCOUNT NOTES, AS WELL AS $1.1 BILLION IN OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO OPERATING LEASES, TRADE PAYABLES, AND COMMITMENTS FOR ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS. 27 <PAGE> FOR A MORE COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER COMMITMENTS SEE NOTES 8 AND 9 TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE TO ITEM 8 OF PART II "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA". WE BELIEVE THAT CURRENT CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED OPERATING CASH NEEDS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE EXPECT THAT OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCE WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $650 MILLION AT MARCH 31, 2001 AND APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2001. HOWEVER, ANY PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE CASH NEEDS AND CASH FLOWS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY. SEE ITEM 1 OF PART I, "BUSINESS--ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS." WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES TO SELL ADDITIONAL EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES, OR OBTAIN CREDIT FACILITIES FROM LENDERS, FOR STRATEGIC REASONS OR TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN OUR FINANCIAL POSITION. THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY OR CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL DILUTION TO THE COMPANY'S STOCKHOLDERS. IN ADDITION, WE WILL, FROM TIME TO TIME, CONSIDER THE ACQUISITION OF OR INVESTMENT IN COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES, AND THE REPURCHASE AND RETIREMENT OF DEBT, WHICH MIGHT IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OR CAUSE US TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE IN AMOUNTS OR ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, IF AT ALL. STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS IN THE FALL OF 1999, WE BEGAN ENTERING INTO COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS WITH SELECT STRATEGIC PARTNERS THAT INVOLVED THE SALE OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ON CO- BRANDED SECTIONS OF OUR WEB SITE AS WELL AS OTHER PROMOTIONAL SERVICES, SUCH AS ADVERTISING PLACEMENTS AND CUSTOMER REFERRALS. AS COMPENSATION FOR THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS, WE RECEIVE CASH, EQUITY SECURITIES OF THESE STRATEGIC PARTNERS, OR A COMBINATION OF THE TWO. IN SOME CASES, WE HAVE ALSO MADE SEPARATE INVESTMENTS IN THESE PARTNERS BY MAKING CASH PAYMENT IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR EQUITY SECURITIES. DURING 2000, WE RECEIVED CASH PAYMENTS OR RECORDED CASH RECEIVABLES OF $98 MILLION AS UNEARNED REVENUE, OF WHICH $85 MILLION WAS CASH RECEIVED FROM OUR STRATEGIC PARTNERS. WE ALSO RECORDED AS UNEARNED REVENUE EQUITY SECURITIES RECEIVED IN A NUMBER OF THESE PARTNERS, NET OF CASH PAID BY US, WITH AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF $107 MILLION AS OF THE DATE THE SECURITIES WERE RECEIVED. SERVICE REVENUE RECOGNIZED DURING 2000 WAS $167 MILLION, WHICH CONSISTED OF CONSIDERATION, EITHER RECEIVED DURING THE PERIOD OR AMORTIZED FROM PREVIOUSLY UNEARNED REVENUE, IN THE FORM OF $88 MILLION OF CASH, $73 MILLION OF EQUITY SECURITIES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES AND $6 MILLION OF EQUITY SECURITIES OF PRIVATE COMPANIES. FOR EQUITY SECURITIES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES, WE GENERALLY DETERMINE FAIR VALUE BASED ON THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE AT THE TIME WE ENTER INTO THE UNDERLYING COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT, AND ADJUST SUCH MARKET PRICE APPROPRIATELY IF SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS ON MARKETABILITY EXIST. BECAUSE AN OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICE DOES NOT EXIST FOR EQUITY SECURITIES OF PRIVATE COMPANIES, OUR ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE OF SUCH SECURITIES ARE MORE SUBJECTIVE THAN FOR THE SECURITIES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES. FOR SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING EQUITY SECURITIES IN PRIVATE COMPANIES, WE OBTAIN AND CONSIDER INDEPENDENT, THIRD-PARTY VALUATIONS WHERE APPROPRIATE. SUCH VALUATIONS USE A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING COMPARING THE SECURITY WITH SECURITIES OF PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES IN SIMILAR LINES OF BUSINESS, APPLYING PRICE MULTIPLES TO ESTIMATED FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE PRIVATE COMPANY, AND THEN ALSO ESTIMATING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FOR THAT COMPANY. THESE VALUATIONS ALSO REDUCE THE OTHERWISE FAIR VALUE BY A FACTOR THAT IS INTENDED TO ACCOUNT FOR RESTRICTIONS ON CONTROL AND MARKETABILITY WHERE APPROPRIATE. USING THESE VALUATIONS AND OTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US, SUCH AS OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE INDUSTRY AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE INVESTEE, WE DETERMINE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITIES RECEIVED. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE SECURITIES, LESS THE NET AMOUNT OF CASH WE PAID FOR THEM, IS THEN RECORDED AS UNEARNED REVENUE. OUR RECORDED UNEARNED REVENUE RESULTING FROM THESE TRANSACTIONS AND ANY ADDITIONAL PROCEEDS RECEIVED UNDER THE ARRANGEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE OVER THE TERMS (GENERALLY, ONE TO THREE YEARS) OF THE COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS WITH OUR STRATEGIC PARTNERS. WE DO NOT ADJUST UNEARNED REVENUE TO GIVE EFFECT TO EITHER INCREASE OR DECREASE IN VALUE OF THE EQUITY SECURITIES SUBSEQUENT TO THEIR INITIAL MEASUREMENT (TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH SECURITIES ARE EITHER NOT SUBJECT TO VESTING OR FORFEITURE OR, IF SUBJECT TO VESTING OR FORFEITURE WERE NOT 28 <PAGE> MODIFIED AFTER MARCH 16, 2000, PURSUANT TO EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 00-8 "ACCOUNTING BY A GRANTEE FOR AN EQUITY INSTRUMENT TO BE RECEIVED IN CONJUNCTION WITH PROVIDING GOODS OR SERVICES,"). THEREFORE, THE VALUE OF EQUITY SECURITIES RECORDED AS UNEARNED REVENUE COULD DECLINE IN VALUE SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THE INITIAL MEASUREMENT IS MADE. WE HAVE IN THE PAST EXPERIENCED, AND MAY EXPERIENCE IN THE FUTURE, LOSSES WITH RESPECT TO INVESTMENTS IN STRATEGIC PARTNERS THAT ARE NOT EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES AS A RESULT OF EITHER LIQUIDATION OF SUCH INVESTMENTS AT A LOSS OR PROVISION FOR AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS. SEE "NON-CASH GAINS AND LOSSES." DURING 2000, WE AMENDED SEVERAL OF OUR AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN OF OUR STRATEGIC PARTNERS THAT REDUCED FUTURE CASH PROCEEDS TO BE RECEIVED BY US, SHORTENED THE TERM OF OUR COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS, OR BOTH. ALTHOUGH THESE AMENDMENTS DID NOT IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF UNEARNED REVENUE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED BY US, THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION OF THESE RECORDED UNEARNED AMOUNTS HAS BEEN CHANGED TO CORRESPOND WITH THE TERMS OF THE AMENDED AGREEMENTS. DURING 2000, WE RECORDED $305 MILLION OF EQUITY-METHOD LOSSES, WHICH REDUCED OUR INVESTMENT IN EQUITY-METHOD INVESTEES. OFFSETTING THIS REDUCTION ARE NEW INVESTMENTS WE HAVE MADE SINCE DECEMBER 31, 1999. WE ALSO MADE CASH PAYMENTS DURING 2000 FOR INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY-METHOD INVESTEES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS OF $63 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED CASH PAYMENTS BY US OF $62 MILLION TO PURCHASE SECURITIES PRIMARILY OF STRATEGIC PARTNERS, AND NON-CASH CONSIDERATION WE RECEIVED FROM OUR PARTNERS CONSISTING OF THEIR EQUITY SECURITIES WITH AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF $107 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, THREE OF THE COMPANY'S EQUITY-METHOD INVESTEES (HOMEGROCER.COM, INC., ACQUIRED BY WEBVAN GROUP, INC.; PETS.COM, INC.; AND DRUGSTORE.COM, INC.), SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF THEIR COMMON STOCK DURING 2000 AND 1999. AS A RESULT OF THESE PUBLIC OFFERINGS, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 51, ACCOUNTING BY THE PARENT IN CONSOLIDATION FOR SALE OF STOCK BY SUBSIDIARY, THE COMPANY RECORDED UNREALIZED GAINS, NET OF UNREALIZED LOSSES, AS ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL TOTALING $77 MILLION AND $14 MILLION IN 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE IN EACH INVESTEE WAS DILUTED, CREATING AN "IMPLIED SALE" OF A PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENTS. THE NET UNREALIZED GAINS REPRESENT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COMPANY'S CARRYING BASIS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PORTION OF EACH INVESTMENT DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SOLD BY THE INVESTEES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000, OUR RECORDED BASIS WAS $11 MILLION, $38 MILLION, AND $0 FOR OUR INVESTMENTS IN WEBVAN (ACQUIROR OF HOMEGROCER.COM), DRUGSTORE.COM, AND PETS.COM, RESPECTIVELY. WE RECLASSIFIED CERTAIN OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS AMOUNTING TO $60 MILLION FROM "OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS" TO "MARKETABLE SECURITIES" AS WE NO LONGER HAD THE INTENT TO HOLD THESE INVESTMENTS FOR OVER ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF RECLASSIFICATION. ADDITIONALLY, WE RECLASSIFIED $14 MILLION OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS FROM "INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY-METHOD INVESTEES" TO "OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS" UPON THE ACQUISITION OF AN INVESTEE BY A THIRD PARTY, WHICH RESULTED IN THE LOSS OF SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE INVESTEE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000, THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL EQUITY SECURITIES CLASSIFIED IN "MARKETABLE SECURITIES" ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WAS $36 MILLION. NO EQUITY SECURITIES WERE CLASSIFIED IN "MARKETABLE SECURITIES" AS OF DECEMBER 31, 1999. "UNEARNED REVENUE" INCREASED FROM $55 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 1999 TO $131 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2000. THIS IS DUE TO OUR RECEIPT OF CONSIDERATION IN THE FORM OF CASH PAYMENTS OF $98 MILLION AND EQUITY SECURITIES OF $107 MILLION FROM STRATEGIC PARTNERS AND OTHERS. THE REVENUE IS TERMED "UNEARNED" BECAUSE IT IS RECEIVED IN ADVANCE OF OUR PERFORMANCE OF CERTAIN SERVICES WE HAVE AGREED TO PROVIDE IN THE FUTURE. OFFSETTING THESE INCREASES IN UNEARNED REVENUE, WE HAVE RECOGNIZED $108 MILLION OF REVENUE DURING 2000 THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY CATEGORIZED AS BEING "UNEARNED." WE HAVE ALSO RECOGNIZED PREVIOUSLY UNEARNED REVENUE OF $20 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERMINATION OF OUR COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT WITH LIVING.COM, WHICH WAS OFFSET BY A $14 MILLION LOSS FROM OUR INVESTMENT IN LIVING.COM AND REPORTED AS A NET AMOUNT OF $6 MILLION INCLUDED IN "NON-CASH GAINS AND LOSSES, NET" ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. 29 <PAGE> ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK WE ARE EXPOSED TO MARKET RISK FOR THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES, FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUES OF OUR INVESTMENTS. WE HAVE NOT UTILIZED DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. INFORMATION RELATING TO QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK IS SET FORTH BELOW AND IN "MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES." INTEREST RATE RISK OUR EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK FOR CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES RELATES PRIMARILY TO OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND OUR LONG-TERM DEBT. ALL OF OUR CASH EQUIVALENT AND MARKETABLE FIXED INCOME SECURITIES ARE DESIGNATED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND, ACCORDINGLY, ARE PRESENTED AT FAIR VALUE ON OUR BALANCE SHEETS. WE GENERALLY INVEST OUR EXCESS CASH IN A-RATED OR HIGHER SHORT- TO INTERMEDIATE- TERM FIXED INCOME SECURITIES AND MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS. FIXED RATE SECURITIES MAY HAVE THEIR FAIR MARKET VALUE ADVERSELY IMPACTED DUE TO A RISE IN INTEREST RATES, AND WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES IN PRINCIPAL IF FORCED TO SELL SECURITIES THAT HAVE DECLINED IN MARKET VALUE DUE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CASH EQUIVALENT AND MARKETABLE FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, INCLUDING PRINCIPAL CASH FLOWS FOR 2001 THROUGH 2005 AND THE RELATED WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES. AMOUNTS ARE PRESENTED IN U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENTS, WHICH IS THE COMPANY'S REPORTING CURRENCY.

NET SALES GENERATED FROM OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, AS WELL AS MOST EXPENSES INCURRED, ARE DENOMINATED IN THEIR LOCAL CURRENCIES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES USE THEIR LOCAL CURRENCIES AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AS THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS UPON CONSOLIDATION. AS EXCHANGE RATES VARY, NET SALES AND OTHER OPERATING RESULTS, WHEN TRANSLATED, MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTATIONS. THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 WAS NOT MATERIAL. AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, WE WERE ALSO EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK RELATED TO OUR PEACS AND EURO DENOMINATED CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES ("EURO INVESTMENTS"). THE PEACS HAVE AN OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF 690 MILLION EUROS ($650 MILLION), AND OUR EURO INVESTMENTS, CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, HAD A BALANCE OF 624 MILLION EUROS ($589 MILLION). DEBT PRINCIPAL OF 615 MILLION EUROS IS DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF AN EQUIVALENT PORTION OF OUR EURO INVESTMENTS, WHICH RESULTS IN OFFSETTING CURRENCY GAINS AND LOSSES, WHICH ARE RECORDED AS A NET AMOUNT IN "ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS." WE ALSO HEDGE THE EXCHANGE RATE RISK ON THE REMAINING DEBT PRINCIPAL AND A PORTION OF THE INTEREST PAYMENTS USING A CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP AGREEMENT AND A SERIES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. UNDER THE SWAP AGREEMENT, WE AGREED TO PAY AT INCEPTION AND RECEIVE UPON MATURITY 75 MILLION EUROS IN EXCHANGE FOR RECEIVING AT INCEPTION AND PAYING AT MATURITY $67 MILLION. IN ADDITION, WE AGREED TO RECEIVE IN FEBRUARY OF EACH YEAR 27 MILLION EUROS FOR INTEREST PAYMENTS ON 390 MILLION EUROS OF THE PEACS AND, SIMULTANEOUSLY, TO PAY $32 MILLION. THIS AGREEMENT IS CANCELABLE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT OUR OPTION AT NO COST ON OR AFTER FEBRUARY 20, 2003 IF OUR COMMON STOCK PRICE (CONVERTED INTO EUROS) IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO THE MINIMUM CONVERSION PRICE OF THE PEACS. UNDER THE FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENTS, WE AGREED TO PAY $18 MILLION AND RECEIVE 21 MILLION EUROS IN FEBRUARY 2001. WE ACCOUNT FOR THESE AGREEMENTS AS HEDGES OF THE RISK OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE DEBT PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. CURRENCY GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE HEDGE AGREEMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED UPON THE RECOGNITION OF THE CORRESPONDING CURRENCY GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE HEDGED LIABILITIES. ADDITIONALLY, BECAUSE THE CONVERSION OPTION IN THE PEACS IS DENOMINATED IN EUROS, CHANGES IN THE EURO TO U.S. DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE MAY AFFECT THE FUTURE CONVERSION OF THE PEACS. INVESTMENT RISK AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000, OUR TOTAL HOLDINGS IN EQUITY SECURITIES OF OTHER COMPANIES, INCLUDING EQUITY- METHOD INVESTMENTS, INVESTMENTS RECORDED AT COST, AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE EQUITY SECURITIES, WAS $128 MILLION. WE INVEST IN BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC COMPANIES, INCLUDING OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS, PRIMARILY FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES. WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED SECURITIES FROM SOME OF OUR STRATEGIC PARTNERS IN EXCHANGE FOR SERVICES PROVIDED BY US TO THOSE PARTNERS. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD IF THEY GIVE US THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT NOT CONTROL, OVER AN INVESTEE. SOME OF OUR COST-METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE IN PRIVATE COMPANIES AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT COST AND OTHERS ARE IN PUBLIC COMPANIES AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS AND IDENTIFY AND RECORD LOSSES WHEN EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT SUCH DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS BELOW OUR ACCOUNTING BASIS ARE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. IN 2000, WE RECORDED NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT LOSSES TOTALING $189 MILLION TO WRITE-DOWN SEVERAL OF OUR EQUITY SECURITIES TO FAIR VALUE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000, WE HAD EQUITY- METHOD INVESTMENTS OF $52 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDES $11 MILLION OF SECURITIES OF PRIVATE COMPANIES; INVESTMENTS RECORDED AT COST OF $33 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDES $30 MILLION OF SECURITIES OF PRIVATE COMPANIES; AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE EQUITY SECURITIES AT FAIR VALUE TOTALING $43 MILLION ($36 MILLION OF WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN "MARKETABLE SECURITIES" AND $7 MILLION OF WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN "OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS"). ALL OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE IN COMPANIES INVOLVED IN THE INTERNET AND E-COMMERCE INDUSTRIES AND THEIR FAIR VALUES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS DUE TO VOLATILITY OF THE STOCK MARKET AND CHANGES IN GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED EQUITY SECURITIES WE HELD, INCLUDING $11 MILLION INCLUDED IN "INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY-METHOD INVESTEES," AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, AN ASSUMED 15%, 30% OR 50% ADVERSE CHANGE TO MARKET PRICES OF THESE SECURITIES WOULD RESULT IN A CORRESPONDING DECLINE IN TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $8 MILLION, $16 MILLION OR $27 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. 31 <PAGE>
