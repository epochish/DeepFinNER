THESE INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY RELATE TO EQUITY AND COST METHOD INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE COMPANIES. WE REVIEW OUR INVESTMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS BELOW THE CARRYING VALUE IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. OUR ANALYSIS INCLUDES REVIEW OF RECENT OPERATING RESULTS AND TRENDS, RECENT SALES/ACQUISITIONS OF THE INVESTEE SECURITIES, AND OTHER PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA. THE CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CLIMATE PROVIDES ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY. VALUATIONS OF PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE INHERENTLY MORE DIFFICULT DUE TO THE LACK OF READILY AVAILABLE MARKET DATA. AS SUCH, WE BELIEVE THAT MARKET SENSITIVITIES ARE NOT PRACTICABLE. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:0PX;MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PX"><FONT SIZE="1">&NBSP;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:0PX;MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PX" ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2">34 </FONT></P> <P STYLE='PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:ALWAYS'> <HR SIZE="3" STYLE="COLOR:#999999" WIDTH="100%" ALIGN="CENTER"> <H5 ALIGN="LEFT"><A HREF="#TOC">TABLE OF CONTENTS</A></H5> <TABLE STYLE="BORDER-COLLAPSE:COLLAPSE" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="100%"> <TR> <TD WIDTH="9%" VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2"><B><A NAME="TX445434_13"></A>ITEM&NBSP;8.</B></FONT></TD> <TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2"><B></B><B><I>
