                                  THE COMPANY

    Citigroup Inc. (Citigroup and, together with its subsidiaries, the Company)
is a diversified financial holding company whose businesses provide a broad
range of financial services to consumer and corporate customers in over 100
countries and territories.

    On November 30, 2000, Citigroup, completed its acquisition of Associates
First Capital Corporation (Associates) in a transaction accounted for as a
pooling of interests. The acquisition was consummated through a merger of a
subsidiary of Citigroup with and into Associates (with Associates as the
surviving corporation) pursuant to which each share of Associates common stock
became a right to receive .7334 of a share of Citigroup's common stock
(534.5 million shares). Subsequent to the acquisition, Associates was
contributed to and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Citicorp and Citicorp
issued a full and unconditional guarantee of the outstanding long-term debt
securities and commercial paper of Associates and Associates Corporation of
North America (ACONA), a subsidiary of Associates. Associates' and ACONA's debt
securities and commercial paper will no longer be separately rated.

    On October 8, 1998, Citicorp merged with and into a newly formed, wholly
owned subsidiary of Travelers Group Inc. (TRV). Following the merger, TRV
changed its name to Citigroup Inc. (Citigroup). The merger was accounted for
under the pooling of interests method.

    During April 2000, The Travelers Insurance Group Inc. (TIGI), an indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed a cash tender offer to
purchase all of the outstanding shares of Travelers Property Casualty Corp.
(TPC) not previously owned.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

ACQUISITION OF ASSOCIATES

    On November 30, 2000, Citigroup completed its acquisition of Associates. The
consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to the acquisition in
a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests, with all periods
presented as if Citigroup and Associates had always been combined. Certain
reclassifications and adjustments have been recorded to conform the accounting
policies and presentations of Citigroup and Associates.

MANAGED BASIS REPORTING

    The discussion that follows includes amounts reported in the historical
financial statements (owned basis) adjusted to include certain effects of
securitization activity, receivables held for securitization, and receivables
sold with servicing retained (managed basis). On an owned basis, for securitized
receivables, amounts that would otherwise be reported as net interest revenue,
as fee and commission revenue, and as credit losses on loans are instead
reported as fee and commission revenue (for servicing fees) and as other revenue
(for the remaining cash flows to which Citigroup is entitled, which are net of
credit losses). Because credit losses are a component of these cash flows,
Citigroup's revenues over the terms of these transactions may vary depending
upon the credit performance of the securitized receivables. However, Citigroup's
exposure to credit losses on the securitized receivables is contractually
limited to these cash flows. Additionally, the net earnings on retained
securitization interests and receivables held for securitization, as well as
gains from subsequent sales in revolving securitization structures are included
in fees and commissions in the consolidated statement of income. On a managed
basis, these earnings are reclassified and presented as if the receivables had
neither been held for securitization nor sold.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE

    Citigroup reported 2000 core income of $14.140 billion or $2.74 per diluted
common share, both up 25% from $11.345 billion or $2.19 in 1999. Core income in
2000 excluded $550 million in after-tax restructuring-related items and
merger-related costs, and $71 million (after-tax) related to the discontinuation
of Associates' housing finance loan origination operations. Core income in 1999
excluded a release of $25 million for after-tax restructuring-related items and
an after-tax charge of $127 million reflecting the cumulative effect of adopting
several new accounting standards as described in Note 1 of Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Net income was $13.519 billion or $2.62 per
diluted share, up 20% and 21%, respectively, from $11.243 billion or $2.17 in
1999. Citigroup's 1999 core income was up $3.860 billion or 52% from 1998. Net
income in 1999 was up $4.293 billion or 62% from 1998. Core income return on
common equity was 23.5% in 2000 compared to 21.7% for 1999 and 15.2% for 1998.

    Core income growth of $2.8 billion or 25% in 2000 was led by Global
Corporate and Investment Bank which improved $1.374 billion or 28%. Global
Consumer increased $947 million or 22%, Investment Activities were up
$705 million or 107%, Global Investment Management and Private Banking improved
$88 million or 15%, while Associates core income declined $21 million.

    Core income growth of $3.860 billion or 52% in 1999, was led by increases in
Global Corporate and Investment Bank of $2.650 billion or 113%, as well as
Global Consumer of $1.169 billion or 37%, Associates of $259 million or 23%, and
Global Investment Management and Private Banking of $88 million or 17%.
Partially offsetting this was a $174 million or 21% decrease in Investment
Activities.

REVENUES, NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE

    Adjusted revenues, net of interest expense of $77.7 billion in 2000 were up
$9.3 billion or 14% from 1999. Revenues in 1999 were up $10.8 billion or 19%
from 1998. Global Corporate and Investment Bank revenues of $32.1 billion in
2000 were up $4.6 billion or 17% from 1999, led by an increase of $3.4 billion
or 20% in SSB & GRB, driven by double-digit revenue growth across most
businesses. EM Corporate was up $731 million or 17%, while Commercial Lines was
up $435 million or 7%. In 1999, Global Corporate and Investment Bank revenues of
$27.5 billion were up $5.1 billion or 23% from 1998, principally reflecting an
increase in SSB & GRB of $4.6 billion or 37% to $16.9 billion, driven by an
increase in principal transactions revenues due to the absence of economic
turmoil that existed in 1998 along with strong 1999 results. EM Corporate's 1999
revenues increased by 20% from 1998 to $4.3 billion, while Commercial Lines was
down 3% to $6.3 billion.

    Global Consumer revenues reflected strong performance across most businesses
in 2000 and were up $2.0 billion or 7% from 1999 to $30.4 billion. The Global
Consumer revenue growth was led by an $829 million or 7% increase in
Banking/Lending, a $781 million or 8% increase in Insurance, and a $477 million
or 7% increase in International. Global Consumer revenues in 1999 increased
$3.3 billion or 13% from 1998 to $28.4 billion, led by Banking/Lending up
$1.5 billion or 13%, and growth in the International businesses, up
$971 million or 17%.

    Global Investment Management and Private Banking revenues of $3.3 billion
grew $593 million or 22% in 2000, and revenues of $2.7 billion grew
$302 million or 13% in 1999, reflecting continued growth in assets under
management and business volumes for both years and in 2000 the impact of
acquisitions in Citigroup Asset Management.

    Associates revenues in 2000 were up $1.4 billion or 16% to $10.3 billion,
and in 1999 were up $2.5 billion or 38% from 1998. Investment Activities
revenues in 2000 increased $1.2 billion or 106%, primarily reflecting increases
in venture capital results and gains on the exchange of certain Latin

                                       10
<PAGE>
American bonds, partially offset by repositioning losses in the
insurance-related investments. Investment Activities revenues in 1999 decreased
$233 million or 18%, primarily reflecting declines in realized gains, partially
offset by venture capital results and realized investment gains on certain
corporate-related investments.

SELECTED REVENUE ITEMS

    Net interest revenue as calculated from the Consolidated Statement of Income
was $28.3 billion in 2000, up $2.0 billion or 8% from 1999, which was up
$2.5 billion or 10% from 1998, reflecting business volume growth in most markets
and acquisitions in Global Corporate & Investment Bank, Global Consumer and
Associates. Net interest revenue, adjusted for the effect of securitization
activity, of $34.6 billion was up $2.5 billion or 8% in 2000 and $2.2 billion or
7% in 1999. Total commissions, asset management and administration fees, and
other fee revenues of $21.7 billion were up $4.3 billion or 25% in 2000 and
$2.7 billion or 18% in 1999, primarily as a result of volume-related growth,
investment banking fees, assets under fee-based management, and the impact of
acquisitions. Insurance premiums of $12.4 billion in 2000 were up $925 million
or 8%, and were up $1.2 billion or 11% in 1999, reflecting strong growth in
Travelers Life & Annuity in both 2000 and 1999, and Commercial Lines in 2000.

    Principal transactions revenues increased to $6.0 billion in 2000, up from
$5.2 billion in 1999 and $1.8 billion in 1998, reflecting strong results in
SSB & GRB. Realized gains from sales of investments of $806 million in 2000 were
up from $541 million in 1999, but were down from $841 million in 1998. The
increase in 2000 resulted from gains on the exchange of certain Latin American
bonds, partially offset by losses in insurance-related investments. Other income
of $6.0 billion increased $1.2 billion from 1999, which was up $1.1 billion from
1998. The 2000 improvement primarily reflected higher venture capital results
offset by lower securitization activities.

OPERATING EXPENSES

    Adjusted operating expenses, which exclude restructuring and merger-related
costs, grew $4.0 billion or 12% to $37.8 billion in 2000, and increased
$3.2 billion or 10% from 1998 to 1999.

    Global Corporate and Investment Bank expenses were up 16% in 2000, primarily
attributable to production-related compensation and acquisitions at SSB & GRB,
partially offset by lower year 2000 and European Economic Monetary Union (EMU)
expenses. EM Corporate expenses rose $208 million or 10% in 2000, as a result of
the acquisition of Bank Handlowy, investment spending in selected countries and
other volume related increases. Expenses increased in Global Consumer by 5% in
2000 and 7% in 1999, reflecting higher business volumes, including acquisitions,
and increases in e-Consumer. Associates expenses increased $493 million or 13%
in 2000, and were up $1.1 billion or 38% from 1998 to 1999, reflecting business
growth and acquisitions. Global Investment Management and Private Banking
expenses increased 25% in 2000 and 10% in 1999, driven by acquisitions in 2000
and investments in sales and marketing activities, technology, and product
development in both years.

RESTRUCTURING-RELATED ITEMS AND MERGER-RELATED COSTS

    Restructuring-related items and merger-related costs of $759 million
($550 million after-tax) in 2000 primarily consisted of exit costs related to
the acquisition of Associates. Restructuring charges included the
reconfiguration of branch operations, exiting certain activities, and the
consolidation and integration of certain middle and back office functions, and
are expected to be implemented over the next year. Also included in the costs
were $177 million of merger-related costs, which included legal, advisory and
SEC filing fees, as well as other costs of administratively closing the
acquisition.

    The 1998 restructuring-related and merger-related costs of $795 million
($535 million after-tax) represented $1.122 billion of exit costs associated
with the Citigroup Merger and $65 million of costs

                                       11
<PAGE>
associated with administratively closing the Merger, partially offset by a
$392 million reduction in the 1997 restructuring charge due to changes in
estimates.

BENEFITS, CLAIMS, AND CREDIT LOSSES

    Benefits, claims, and credit losses were $17.9 billion in 2000, up
$1.3 billion or 8% from 1999, which was up $1.4 billion or 9% from 1998.
Policyholder benefits and claims expense increased 11% to $10.1 billion in 2000
and 7% to $9.1 billion in 1999, primarily as a result of higher loss levels in
Commercial and Personal Lines and increased volume in Travelers Life & Annuity.
The adjusted provision for credit losses increased 4% to $7.8 billion in 2000
and 13% to $7.5 billion in 1999. Associates adjusted provision for credit losses
increased $1.007 billion or 36% to $3.8 billion in 2000, which included a
$210 million transportation loss provision relating to the truck loan and
leasing portfolio.

    Global Consumer adjusted benefits, claims, and credit losses of
$10.0 billion were up 1% in 2000 and 8% in 1999. Managed net credit losses in
2000 were $6.8 billion and the related loss ratio was 2.48% compared with
$6.7 billion and 2.80% in 1999 and $5.9 billion and 2.90% in 1998. The managed
consumer loan delinquency ratio (90 days or more past due) was 1.78%, a decrease
from 2.07% and 2.13% at the end of 1999 and 1998.

    Global Corporate and Investment Bank benefits, claims, and credit losses
increased to $4.1 billion from $3.9 billion in 1999, which was down from
$4.2 billion in 1998. The 2000 increases in Commercial Lines of $236 million,
and $155 million in SSB & GRB were partially offset by a decrease of
$162 million in EM Corporate, primarily in Asia. The 1999 decrease reflected
improvements in Russia and Asia, and a lower provision for credit losses
resulting from an improved credit outlook in EM Corporate, partially offset by
Latin America.

    Commercial cash-basis loans and other real estate owned (OREO) of
$2.4 billion at December 31, 2000 were up from $2.2 billion a year earlier,
primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions, along with increases in North
America, Associates, and Latin America, partially offset by improvements in Asia
and the North America real estate portfolio.

CAPITAL

    Total capital (Tier 1 and Tier 2) was $73.0 billion or 11.23% of net
risk-adjusted assets, and Tier 1 capital was $54.5 billion or 8.38% at
December 31, 2000. See page 69 for the components of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.

    Global Consumer--which provides banking, lending, investment and personal
insurance products and services, including credit and charge cards, to customers
around the world--reported core income of $5.294 billion in 2000, up
$947 million or 22% from 1999, and in 1999 core income grew $1.169 billion or
37% from 1998. Banking/Lending core income increased $507 million or 23% in 2000
and increased $846 million or 63% in 1999 reflecting strong performance across
all businesses. In the insurance segment, core income grew $226 million or 17%
in 2000 and $142 million or 12% in 1999 driven by strong performance in
Travelers Life and Annuity where income grew $154 million or 25% in 2000 and
$130 million or 26% in 1999. In the International segment, the developed markets
of Western Europe and Japan reported core income of $484 million in 2000 up
$122 million from 1999 and in 1999 income was up $85 million from 1998 despite
the foreign currency translation effects of a weakening Euro. Core income in the
emerging markets increased $206 million or 33% in 2000 and was up $140 million
or 29% in 1999 reflecting strong performance in Asia and in Central and Eastern
Europe, Middle East and Africa. In Latin America, core income in 2000 declined
$14 million from 1999 reflecting reduced revenue related to Confia, a Mexican
bank acquired in August 1998.

    Net income of $5.281 billion in 2000, $4.291 billion in 1999, and
$2.777 billion in 1998 included restructuring-related charges of $13 million
($19 million pretax), $56 million ($87 million pretax), and $401 million
($633 million pretax), respectively.

    In 2000, Global Consumer recorded restructuring-related items totaling
$19 million, including charges of $46 million for the reconfiguration of certain
branch operations outside the U.S. and for the downsizing and consolidation of
certain back office functions in the U.S., and accelerated depreciation charges
on the planned disposition of certain premises and equipment assets, in excess
of the normal scheduled depreciation on those assets of $30 million, offset by a
reduction in restructuring reserves due to changes in estimates attributable to
facts and circumstances arising subsequent to the original restructuring charges
of $57 million. In 1999, Global Consumer recorded restructuring-related items
totaling $87 million, including charges of $104 million, of which $82 million
related to new initiatives primarily for the reconfiguration of certain consumer
branch operations outside the U.S., downsizing of

                                       13
<PAGE>
certain marketing operations, and costs associated with exiting a non-strategic
business. The 1999 items also include accelerated depreciation charges of
$114 million, offset by a reduction of restructuring reserves of $131 million.
In 1998, Global Consumer recorded a net restructuring charge totaling
$633 million for regional consolidation of call centers and other back office
functions worldwide, reduction of management layers, sales force restructuring,
integration of overlapping marketing and product management groups, and exiting
several non-strategic operations. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for a discussion of restructuring-related items.

    In 2000, Citigroup adopted the Federal Financial Institutions Examination
Council's (FFIEC) revised Uniform Retail Classification and Account Management
Policy, which provided guidance on the reporting of delinquent consumer loans
and the timing of associated charge-offs for Citigroup's depository institution
subsidiaries. The adoption of the policy resulted in additional net credit
losses of approximately $90 million which were charged against the allowance for
credit losses.

    Citibanking North America--which delivers banking, lending and investment
services to customers through Citibank's branches and electronic delivery
systems--reported core income of $566 million in 2000, up $168 million or 42%
from 1999 and in 1999 grew $284 million or 249% from 1998 due to revenue growth,
and continued expense reduction initiatives and credit cost improvements. Net
income of $575 million in 2000, $399 million in 1999, and $25 million in 1998
included restructuring-related credits of $9 million ($15 million pretax), and
$1 million ($4 million pretax) in 2000 and 1999, respectively, and
restructuring-related charges of $89 million ($139 million pretax) in 1998.

</TABLE>

    Revenues, net of interest expense, of $2.277 billion increased $173 million
or 8% from 1999 which increased $134 million or 7% from 1998, reflecting growth
in customer deposits and spreads, and increased investment product fees,
partially offset by lower loan revenues. Investment product fees and commissions
increased 24% and 54% in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

    Adjusted operating expenses of $1.310 billion in 2000 declined $44 million
or 3% from 1999, and were down $311 million or 19% in 1999. The significant
reduction in expenses in 1999 reflects the impact of expense management
initiatives that reduced staff and other fixed expenses, as well as lower
marketing program spending.

    The provision for credit losses declined to $29 million in 2000 from
$64 million in 1999 and $100 million in 1998. The net credit loss ratio of 0.91%
in 2000 declined from 1.22% in 1999 and 1.39% in 1998. Loans delinquent 90 days
or more of $35 million or 0.48% at December 31, 2000 declined from $55 million
or 0.78% at December 31, 1999 and $93 million or 1.25% at December 31, 1998. The
declines in the provision for credit losses and delinquencies reflect continued
improvement in the portfolio and a decline in loan volumes.

    Mortgage Banking--which originates and services mortgages and student loans
for customers across the United States--reported core income of $272 million in
2000, up $47 million or 21% from 1999 and in 1999 income was up $19 million or
9% from 1998, reflecting growth in both the mortgage

                                       15
<PAGE>
and student loan businesses and credit improvement in the mortgage portfolio.
Core income in 2000 and 1999 also reflects the April 1999 acquisition of the
principal operating assets and certain liabilities of Source One Mortgage
Services Corporation (Source One). Net income of $200 million in 1998 included a
restructuring-related charge of $6 million ($9 million pretax).

    As shown in the following table, accounts grew 29% in 2000 and 21% in 1999,
reflecting loan growth in both mortgages and student loans and an increase in
serviced mortgage accounts. In 2000, growth in mortgage loans reflects higher
originations with a larger proportion at variable interest rates which are
typically held on-balance sheet rather than securitized. Growth in mortgage
originations and loans in both periods, and account growth in 1999 also reflects
Source One.

(1) Includes student loans.

    Revenues, net of interest expense, of $829 million in 2000 grew $82 million
or 11% from 1999, reflecting loan growth and higher servicing income, partially
offset by reduced spreads and lower securitization activity. Revenues in 1999
increased $127 million or 20% from 1998, principally reflecting the acquisition
of Source One and growth in the student loan portfolio. Adjusted operating
expenses increased $36 million or 11% in 2000 and grew $75 million or 30% in
1999, reflecting additional business volumes, including the Source One
acquisition in April 1999.

    The (benefit) provision for credit losses of ($11) million in 2000 declined
from $17 million in 1999 and $20 million in 1998. The adoption of revised FFIEC
write-off policies in 2000 added $17 million to net credit losses, which were
charged against the allowance for credit losses, and 5 basis points to the 2000
net credit loss ratio. The 2000 net credit loss ratio was 0.13% (0.08% excluding
the effect of FFIEC policy revisions) compared with 0.16% in 1999 and 0.31% in
1998 and the ratio of loans delinquent 90 days or more was 1.99% at
December 31, 2000 compared with 2.31% at December 31, 1999 and 2.44% at
December 31, 1998. The declines in the 2000 provision, the net credit loss ratio
(excluding FFIEC), and the delinquency ratio principally reflect improvement in
the mortgage portfolio. The 1999 improvement in mortgage delinquencies was
partially offset by higher student loan delinquencies as a result of a statutory
increase in the length of time Citigroup must hold delinquent
government-guaranteed student loans prior to submitting a claim under the
government guarantee.

(4) Adjusted for the effect of credit card securitization, managed average
    assets were $84 billion, $75 billion, and $63 billion in 2000, 1999, and
    1998, respectively.

(5) Adjusted for the effect of credit card securitization, the return on managed
    assets, excluding restructuring-related items was 1.64% in 2000, 1.58% in
    1999, and 1.28% in 1998.

    Cards--North America bankcards and Diners Club reported core income of
$1.381 billion in 2000, up $199 million or 17% from 1999 and in 1999 was up
$376 million or 47% from 1998, reflecting improvements in the bankcards
business. Net income of $1.387 billion in 2000, $1.194 billion in 1999, and
$767 million in 1998 included restructuring-related credits of $6 million
($8 million pretax) and $12 million ($18 million pretax) in 2000 and 1999,
respectively, and restructuring-related charges of $39 million ($58 million
pretax) in 1998.

    Risk adjusted margin is a measure of profitability calculated as adjusted
revenues less managed net credit losses as a percentage of average managed
loans, consistent with the goal of matching the revenues generated by the loan
portfolio with the credit risk undertaken. As shown in the following table,
North America bankcards risk adjusted margin of 6.13% decreased 27 basis points
from 1999 as lower spreads on the portfolio were partially offset by credit
improvements and an increase in non-interest revenue, primarily interchange
fees.

<PAGE>
    Adjusted revenues, net of interest expense, of $8.197 billion in 2000
increased $242 million or 3% from 1999, reflecting receivable growth, including
portfolio acquisitions, higher interchange fee revenues due to sales volume
growth and increased fees from other cardmember services, offset by lower
spreads. Spread compression in the portfolio reflects changes in portfolio mix,
including an increased percentage of the portfolio priced at low introductory
rates, and higher funding costs due to increased interest rates. Adjusted
revenues of $7.955 billion in 1999 increased $869 million or 12% from 1998
reflecting receivable and sales volume growth, including the effect of
acquisitions, and risk-based pricing actions, partially offset by lower spreads.

    As shown in the following table, on a managed basis, the North America
bankcard portfolio experienced growth in accounts, sales, cards in force, and
receivables in 2000, including the effect of portfolio acquisitions. Accounts
increased only slightly in 1999 and cards in force declined reflecting
management initiatives that resulted in the closing of inactive and/or high-risk
accounts.

    Adjusted operating expenses of $2.925 billion in 2000 increased $78 million
or 3% from 1999, and in 1999 grew $295 million or 12% from 1998, reflecting
acquisitions and increased target-marketing efforts in North America bankcards.

    The adjusted provision for credit losses in 2000 was $3.075 billion compared
with $3.234 billion in 1999 and $3.240 billion in 1998. North America bankcards
managed net credit losses in 2000 were $3.022 billion and the related loss ratio
was 3.85%, compared with $3.158 billion and 4.54% in 1999 and $3.142 billion and
5.32% in 1998. North America bankcards managed loans delinquent 90 days or more
were $1.140 billion or 1.31% of loans at December 31, 2000 compared with
$1.066 billion or 1.44% at December 31, 1999 and $1.001 billion or 1.45% at
December 31, 1998. The improvement in the 2000 net credit loss ratio reflects
industry-wide bankruptcy trends and credit risk management initiatives.

    CitiFinancial--which provides community-based lending services through its
branch network and through cross-selling initiatives with other Citigroup
businesses--reported core income of $481 million in 2000 up $93 million or 24%
from 1999 and in 1999 core income was up $167 million or 76% from 1998,
reflecting continued strong receivable growth, including the effects of
acquisitions, and improved credit performance. Net income of $386 million in
1999 and $220 million in 1998 included restructuring-related items of
$2 million ($3 million pretax) and $1 million ($2 million pretax), respectively.

    As shown in the following table, receivables grew 30% in both 2000 and 1999
resulting from higher volumes from CitiFinancial branches, and the cross-selling
of products through other Citigroup distribution channels. Growth in 1999 also
reflects acquisitions. At December 31, 2000, the portfolio consisted of 63% real
estate-secured loans, 30% personal loans, and 7% sales finance and other,
compared with 58%, 34% and 8% in 1999 and 56%, 36%, and 8% in 1998,
respectively. The average net interest margin on receivables of 8.13% in 2000
declined from 8.85% in 1999 and 8.90% in 1998, reflecting lower yields due to
changes in portfolio mix toward more real estate secured loans and higher
funding costs due to increased interest rates.

$332 million or 21% from 1999 and in 1999 were up $341 million or 27% from 1998,
reflecting continued strong receivable growth offset by lower spreads. Adjusted
operating expenses of $757 million in 2000 increased $140 million or 23% from
1999 and in 1999 increased $112 million or 22% from 1998, reflecting higher
business volumes, including acquisitions.

    The provision for benefits, claims, and credit losses was $431 million in
2000 up from $385 million in 1999 and $419 million in 1998, primarily reflecting
receivable growth. The net credit loss ratio of 1.96% in 2000 was down from
2.18% in 1999 and 2.75% in 1998. The 2000 net credit loss ratio included a
benefit of approximately 18 basis points related to changes in the write-off
policy for certain bankrupt accounts. Loans delinquent 90 days or more were
$277 million or 1.38% of loans in 2000 compared to $203 million or 1.31% in 1999
and $171 million or 1.44% in 1998. The increase in delinquencies from a year-ago
reflects the impact of previous acquisitions.

    Travelers Life and Annuity offers individual annuity, group annuity,
individual life insurance products and corporate owned life insurance (COLI)
marketed by The Travelers Insurance Company (TIC) and its wholly owned
subsidiary The Travelers Life and Annuity Company (TLAC) under the Travelers
name. Among the range of individual products offered are fixed and variable
deferred annuities, payout annuities and term, universal and variable life
insurance. These products are primarily distributed through CitiStreet
Retirement Services (CitiStreet) (via The Copeland Companies (Copeland)), a
joint venture, Salomon Smith Barney Financial Consultants, Primerica Financial
Services (Primerica), Citibank, and a nationwide network of independent agents.
The COLI product is a variable universal life product distributed through
independent specialty brokers. The group products include institutional
pensions, including guaranteed investment contracts (GICs), payout annuities,
group annuities to employer-sponsored retirement and savings plans and
structured finance transactions.

    Core income was $777 million in 2000 compared to $623 million in 1999 and
$493 million in 1998. The 25% improvement in 2000 reflects increased business
volume, a strong capital base and particularly strong investment income versus
the prior-year period. During 2000, this business continued strong individual
annuity sales and achieved double-digit business volume growth in group annuity
account balances and individual life net written premiums, reflecting growth in
retirement savings and estate planning products and strong momentum from
cross-selling initiatives. The 26% improvement in 1999 was largely driven by
increases in business volumes and strong investment income. During 1999, this
business achieved double-digit growth in individual and group annuity account
balances and direct periodic life insurance premiums. The continued growth in
2000 and 1999 reflects both greater popularity of these products with an aging
American population and strong momentum from cross-selling initiatives. Adjusted
operating expenses decreased in 2000 compared to the prior-year period due to
the contribution of Copeland to the CitiStreet joint venture and the absence of
certain one-time technology expenses in 1999. The increase in revenues was also
mitigated by the contribution of Copeland.

    The cross-selling initiatives of Travelers Life and Annuity products through
Primerica, Citibank, Salomon Smith Barney Financial Consultants, CitiStreet via
Copeland, and a nationwide network of independent agents and strong group sales
through various intermediaries reflect the ongoing effort to build market share
by strengthening relationships in key distribution channels.

    On July 31, 2000, TIC sold 90% of its individual long-term care insurance
business to General Electric Capital Assurance Company in the form of an
indemnity reinsurance arrangement. Proceeds from the sale were $410 million,
resulting in a deferred gain of approximately $150 million after-tax.

    The following table shows net written premiums and deposits by product line,
excluding long-term care insurance written premiums for the three years ended
December 31:

    The majority of the annuity business and a substantial portion of the life
business written by Travelers Life and Annuity is accounted for as investment
contracts, with the result that the premiums and deposits collected are not
included in revenues.

    Increased variable annuities sales drove account balances to $29.4 billion
at December 31, 2000, from $27.9 billion at year-end 1999 (up 5%) and
$21.5 billion at year-end 1998. Net written premiums and deposits increased in
2000 to $6.371 billion from $5.351 billion in 1999 (up 19%) and $3.870 billion
in 1998. Sales reflect significant increased production at Salomon Smith Barney
during 2000 and increased sales from all Travelers Life and Annuity core
distribution channels during both 2000 and 1999.

    Group annuity account balances and benefit reserves reached $17.5 billion at
December 31, 2000, up from $15.1 billion at year-end 1999 (up 16%), and
$13.2 billion at year-end 1998. The group annuity businesses experienced
continued strong sales momentum in variable rate guaranteed investment
contracts, employer sponsored group plans and cross-selling structured
settlement annuities through Travelers Property Casualty Corp. (TPC). Net
written premiums and deposits (excluding the Company's employee pension plan
deposits) in 2000 were $5.528 billion, compared to $5.619 billion in 1999 (which
reflected particularly strong structured finance transactions) and
$4.049 billion in 1998.

    Direct periodic premiums and deposits for individual life insurance were
$511 million in 2000 compared to $409 million in 1999 (up 25%) and $322 million
in 1998. Life insurance in force was $66.9 billion at December 31, 2000, up from
$60.6 billion at year-end 1999 and $55.4 billion at year-end 1998.

    Primerica Financial Services--which sells life insurance as well as other
products manufactured by the Company, including Salomon Smith Barney mutual
funds, CitiFinancial mortgages and personal loans and Travelers Insurance
Company annuity products--reported core income of $492 million in 2000 compared
to $452 million in 1999 and $400 million in 1998. The 9% improvement in 2000
reflects strong mutual fund sales and net investment income and was partially
offset by increased infrastructure investment including international expansion.
The 13% increase in 1999 results reflects continued success at cross selling a
range of products (particularly mutual funds, variable annuities and debt
consolidation loans), growth in life insurance in force, improved investment
income, and disciplined expense management.

    Increases in production and cross-selling initiatives were achieved during
2000. Earned premiums net of reinsurance were $1.106 billion, $1.071 billion,
and $1.057 billion in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Total face amount of
issued term life insurance was $67.4 billion in 2000 compared to

                                       21
<PAGE>
$56.2 billion in 1999 and $57.4 billion in 1998. The number of policies issued
was 234,700 in 2000, compared to 209,900 in 1999 and 223,600 in 1998. The
average face value per policy issued was $245,000 in 2000 compared to $229,000
in 1999 and $223,000 in 1998. Life insurance in force at year-end 2000 reached
$412.7 billion, up from $394.9 billion at year-end 1999 and $383.7 billion at
year-end 1998, and continued to reflect good policy persistency.

    In recent years, Primerica has leveraged cross selling through the Financial
Needs Analysis (FNA)--the diagnostic tool that enhances the ability of the
Personal Financial Analysts to address client needs--to expand its business
beyond life insurance and now offers its clients a greater array of financial
products and services, delivered personally through its sales force. During
2000, 438,000 FNAs were submitted. In addition, Primerica has traditionally
offered mutual funds to clients as a means to invest the relative savings
realized through the purchase of term life insurance as compared to traditional
whole life insurance. Sales of mutual funds were $4.220 billion in 2000 compared
to $3.124 billion in 1999 and $2.942 billion in 1998. During 2000, proprietary
mutual funds accounted for 50% of Primerica's U.S. sales and 43% of Primerica's
total sales. Variable annuity sales continued to show momentum, reaching net
written premiums and deposits of $1.057 billion in 2000, up from $990 million in
1999 and $652 million in 1998. As a result of the increased emphasis placed on
cross-selling initiatives, current year sales predominately reflect sales of
Travelers Life and Annuity variable annuity products. Cash advanced on
$.M.A.R.T-Registered Trademark- loan and $.A.F.E.-Registered Trademark- loan
products underwritten by Travelers Bank & Trust, fsb and CitiFinancial was
$2.09 billion in 2000, up 9% from $1.92 billion in 1999 and $1.46 billion in
1998.

    Personal Lines--which writes all types of property and casualty insurance
covering personal risks--reported net income of $311 million in 2000 compared to
$279 million in 1999 and $319 million in 1998. Included in 1999 is a charge
related to curtailing the sale of TRAVELERS SECURE-Registered Trademark- auto
and homeowners products. The 2000 results reflect increased net investment
income, lower catastrophe losses, and the incremental earnings from the minority
interest buyback, offset in part by increased loss cost trends and lower
favorable prior-year reserve development. The 1999 decrease primarily reflects
higher catastrophe losses due to Hurricane Floyd, higher loss ratios in the
TRAVELERS SECURE-Registered Trademark- program, the charge related to curtailing
the sale of TRAVELERS SECURE-Registered Trademark- products, and lower favorable
prior-year reserve development, partially offset by the increase in income due
to the growth in earned premiums.

</TABLE>

    Personal Lines net written premiums for 2000 were $3.813 billion compared to
$3.805 billion in 1999 and $3.490 billion in 1998. Net written premiums in 1999
included an adjustment associated with the termination of a quota share
reinsurance arrangement, which increased homeowners' premiums written by
independent agents by $72 million. The increase in net written premiums in 2000
compared to 1999, excluding the reinsurance adjustment, primarily reflects
growth in target markets served by independent agents and growth in affinity
group marketing and joint marketing arrangements and is offset in part by
planned reductions in the TRAVELERS SECURE-Registered Trademark- auto and
homeowners business, a mandated rate decrease in New Jersey and continued
emphasis on disciplined underwriting and risk management. The business retention
ratio for 2000 was moderately lower than 1999, reflecting planned reductions in
the TRAVELERS SECURE-Registered Trademark- business. The 1999 increase compared
to 1998 primarily reflected growth in independent agents business and growth in
affinity group marketing and joint marketing arrangements.

    Catastrophe losses, net of taxes and reinsurance, were $54 million in 2000
compared to $79 million in 1999 and $44 million in 1998. Catastrophe losses in
2000 were primarily due to Texas, Midwest and Northeast wind and hailstorms in
the second quarter and hailstorms in Louisiana and Texas in the first quarter.
Catastrophe losses in 1999 were primarily due to Hurricane Floyd in the third
quarter, wind and hailstorms on the East Coast and tornadoes in the Midwest in
the second quarter and a wind and ice storm in the Midwest and Northeast in the
first quarter. Catastrophe losses in 1998 were primarily due to Hurricanes
Bonnie and Georges, severe first quarter winter storms and second and third
quarter wind and hailstorms.

    The statutory combined ratio for Personal Lines was 99.7% in 2000 compared
to 96.7% in 1999 and 93.9% in 1998. The U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) combined ratio for Personal Lines was 99.3% in 2000 compared
to 96.8% in 1999 and 93.2% in 1998. GAAP combined ratios for Personal Lines
differ from statutory combined ratios primarily due to the deferral and
amortization of certain expenses for GAAP reporting purposes only.

    The 1999 statutory and GAAP combined ratios for Personal Lines include an
adjustment associated with the termination of a quota share reinsurance
arrangement. Excluding this adjustment, the 1999 statutory and GAAP combined
ratios were 96.5% and 97.3%, respectively. The increase in the 2000 statutory
and GAAP combined ratios compared to the statutory and GAAP combined ratios
(excluding the premium adjustment) for 1999 was primarily due to increased loss
cost trends and lower favorable prior-year reserve development, offset in part
by the TRAVELERS SECURE-Registered Trademark- charge taken in the third quarter
of 1999 and lower catastrophe losses. The increase in the 1999 statutory and
GAAP combined ratios excluding this adjustment compared to the 1998 statutory
and GAAP combined ratios was due to higher catastrophe losses due to Hurricane
Floyd, higher loss ratios in the TRAVELERS SECURE-Registered Trademark- program,
the TRAVELERS SECURE-Registered Trademark- charge, and lower favorable
prior-year reserve development in the automobile bodily injury line.

    Western Europe--which provides banking, lending and investment services,
including credit and charge cards, to customers throughout the region--reported
core income of $345 million in 2000, up $70 million or 25% from 1999 and in 1999
income was up $64 million or 30% from 1998, reflecting growth across the region,
particularly Germany. Net income of $277 million in 1999 and $86 million in 1998
included restructuring credits of $2 million ($4 million pretax) in 1999 and
restructuring-related charges of $125 million ($239 million pretax) in 1998.

    The net effect of foreign currency translation reduced income growth by
approximately $54 million in 2000 and reduced revenue and expense and growth
rates by 14 and 12 percentage points from 1999. In 1999, the net effect of
foreign currency translation on core income growth from 1998 was minimal,
however, revenue and expenses growth rates were reduced by 3 and 4 percentage
points, respectively.

    As shown in the following table, Western Europe reported 7% account growth
in 2000 and 3% in 1999 primarily reflecting loan and deposit growth. However,
loans and customer deposit volumes were reduced by the effect of foreign
currency translation.

</TABLE>

    Revenues, net of interest expense, of $1.899 billion in 2000 decreased
$92 million or 5% from 1999 as higher investment product fees, loan growth and
higher deposit spreads were more than offset by the effect of foreign currency
translation. Revenues in 1999 increased $122 million or 7% from 1998, as growth
across most products and countries was partially offset by foreign currency
translation effects.

    Adjusted operating expenses of $1.125 billion declined $146 million or 11%
from 1999 as costs associated with higher business volumes were more than offset
by lower regional office and technology expenses and the effect of foreign
currency translation. Expenses in 1999 were up slightly from 1998.

    The provision for benefits, claims and credit losses was $234 million in
2000, down from $280 million in 1999 and $262 million in 1998. The adoption of
revised FFIEC write-off policies in 2000 added $10 million to net credit losses,
which were charged against the allowance for credit losses, and 7 basis points
to the net credit loss ratio. The net credit loss ratio was 1.62% (1.55%
excluding the effects of FFIEC policy revisions) in 2000, compared with 1.64% in
1999 and 1.61% in 1998. Loans delinquent 90 days or more of $782 million or
5.09% of loans at December 31, 2000 decreased from $868 million or 5.75% at
December 31, 1999 and $911 million or 5.69% at December 31, 1998.

    Japan--which provides banking, lending and investment services, including
credit and charge cards, to customers throughout the country--reported net
income of $139 million in 2000, up $52 million or 60% from 1999 and net income
in 1999 was up $21 million or 32% from 1998, reflecting expansion of the
business, driven by growth in deposits, investment products, and mortgages. Net
income growth in 2000 also reflects the Diners Club acquisition in the 2000
first quarter.

    Net foreign currency translation effects increased revenue growth by 2 and
11 percentage points, and expense growth by 4 and 17 percentage points in 2000
and 1999, respectively.

    As shown in the following table, Japan reported strong growth in accounts,
customer deposits, and loans. In 2000, the Diners Club acquisition added
approximately $0.5 billion in loans and 0.6 million accounts.

    Revenues, net of interest expense, of $652 million in 2000 grew
$260 million or 66% from 1999 and in 1999 was up $99 million or 34% from 1998,
reflecting higher deposit volumes and spreads, and growth in investment product
fees and mortgage loans. Adjusted operating expenses increased $178 million or
74% in 2000 and grew $62 million or 35% in 1999 reflecting costs associated with
expansion efforts and additional business volumes. In 2000, both revenue and
expense increases also reflect the Diners Club acquisition.

    The provision for benefits, claims, and credit losses in 2000 was
$20 million, up from $12 million in 1999 and $8 million in 1998. The net credit
loss ratio of 0.63% in 2000 declined from 0.76% in 1999 and 0.98% in 1998 and
loans delinquent 90 days or more were $8 million or 0.22% of loans at

    Asia (excluding Japan)--which provides banking, lending and investment
services, including credit and charge cards, to customers throughout the
region--reported core income of $563 million in 2000, up $207 million or 58%
from 1999, reflecting loan growth, particularly credit cards, higher investment
product fees and deposit growth. Core income in 1999 grew $39 million or 12%
from 1998, reflecting business growth and expansion as the region rebounded from
weak 1998 results. Net income of $559 million in 2000, $343 million in 1999, and
$253 million in 1998 included restructuring-related charges of $4 million
($5 million pretax), $13 million ($23 million pretax), and $64 million
($83 million pretax), respectively.

    In 2000, net foreign currency translation effects reduced revenue and
expense growth by approximately 1 and 3 percentage points, respectively. In
1999, strengthening currencies across the region increased both revenue and
expense growth by approximately 3 percentage points from 1998.

    As shown in the following table, Asia accounts grew 13% in 2000 and 20% in
1999, reflecting growth in the cards business across the region, and favorable
economic conditions in most countries.

</TABLE>

    Revenues, net of interest expense, of $2.109 billion in 2000 increased
$257 million or 14% from 1999 reflecting improvements in most countries driven
by growth in cards, investment product fees, and deposits. Revenues in 1999
increased $295 million or 19% from 1998 reflecting business volume growth and
higher spreads.

    Adjusted operating expenses of $962 million increased $19 million or 2% from
1999 reflecting increased variable compensation, including higher investment
product sales commissions, and increased

                                       26

marketing costs, offset by lower expenses in certain countries resulting from
previously implemented restructuring initiatives. Expenses in 1999 increased
$146 million or 18% from 1998, reflecting higher marketing spending across the
region, and costs associated with new branches and additional product offerings.

    The provision for benefits, claims, and credit losses in 2000 was
$273 million compared with $341 million in 1999 and $243 million in 1998. The
net credit loss ratio was 1.16% in 2000, compared with 1.32% in 1999 and 1.12%
in 1998. Loans delinquent 90 days or more were $335 million or 1.51% of loans at
December 31, 2000, compared with $442 million or 1.93% at December 31, 1999 and
$486 million or 2.35% at December 31, 1998. The declines in the net credit loss
ratio and delinquencies from 1999 reflect favorable economic conditions in most
countries.

    Latin America--which provides banking, lending and investment services,
including credit and charge cards, to customers throughout the region--reported
core income of $208 million in 2000, down $14 million or 6% from 1999,
reflecting reduced earnings related to Confia and lower business volumes due to
weak economic conditions, partially offset by lower credit costs and an increase
in earnings from Credicard, a 33%-owned Brazilian Card affiliate. Core income of
$222 million in 1999 increased from $149 million in 1998 primarily reflecting an
increase in earnings from Credicard, and the effect of certain acquisitions,
partially offset by higher credit costs. Net income of $177 million in 2000,
$195 million in 1999, and $82 million in 1998 included restructuring-related
charges of $31 million ($45 million pretax), $27 million ($42 million pretax),
and $67 million ($88 million pretax), respectively.

    The net effect of foreign currency translation in 2000 was minimal. The
Brazilian currency devaluation in 1999 significantly contributed to the foreign
currency translation effects that reduced core income by approximately
$37 million in 1999 and reduced revenue and expense growth by approximately 10
and 7 percentage points, respectively, from 1998.

    In 2000, minimal growth in accounts and deposits reflected economic
conditions in certain countries. The decline in average loans reflects the 2000
first quarter auto loan portfolio sale in Puerto

                                       27
<PAGE>
Rico and credit risk management initiatives. In 1999, growth in accounts,
customer deposits and loans reflects acquisitions in the region with deposit
growth also reflecting a "flight to quality" in the region.

</TABLE>

    Revenues, net of interest expense, of $1.941 billion in 2000 decreased
$29 million or 1% from 1999 as higher Credicard earnings were offset by reduced
revenues from Confia and business volume declines in certain countries,
including the effect of the auto loan portfolio sale in Puerto Rico. Revenues in
1999 increased $391 million or 25% from 1998, reflecting acquisitions in the
region and increased Credicard earnings.

    Adjusted operating expenses of $1.307 billion increased $113 million or 9%
from 1999 reflecting costs associated with new business initiatives, strategy
changes in certain countries, and acquisitions in the region. Expenses in 1999
grew $128 million or 12% from 1998 reflecting acquisitions.

    The provisions for benefits, claims and credit losses was $335 million in
2000 compared to $447 million in 1999 and $265 million in 1998. The adoption of
revised FFIEC write-off policies in 2000 added $41 million to net credit losses,
which were charged against the allowance for credit losses, and 56 basis points
to the net credit loss ratio. The net credit loss ratio was 4.62% (4.06%
excluding the effect of FFIEC policy revisions) in 2000, compared to 5.30% in
1999 and 3.07% in 1998. Loans delinquent 90 days or more of $250 million or
3.66% of loans at December 31, 2000 decreased from $320 million or 4.10% at
December 31, 1999 and $288 million or 3.60% at December 31, 1998. The decline in
delinquent loans in 2000 from 1999 reflects additional write-offs related to the
adoption of revised FFIEC policies.

    Central & Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa (CEEMEA--including India and
Pakistan)--which provides banking, lending and investment services, including
credit and charge cards, to customers throughout the region--reported core
income of $59 million in 2000, up $13 million or 28% from 1999, and in 1999 core
income was up $28 million or 156% from 1998, reflecting growth across the
region, particularly India. Net income of $63 million in 2000 and $29 million in
1999 included restructuring-related items of $4 million ($5 million pretax) and
($17) million (($27) million pretax), respectively. Core income in 1999 includes
a $16 million ($25 million pretax) gain related to an investment in an
affiliate.

    The net effect of foreign currency translation reduced revenue growth by
approximately 5 and 4 percentage points and expense growth was reduced by
approximately 6 and 5 percentage points in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

    As shown in the following table, CEEMEA reported 33% account growth in 2000
and 31% in 1999 primarily reflecting growth in credit cards and customer
deposits as franchise growth efforts continue across the region.

</TABLE>

    Revenues, net of interest expense, of $418 million in 2000 increased
$81 million or 24% from 1999 reflecting strong growth in cards and deposits, and
higher spreads. Revenues in 1999 were up $64 million or 23% from 1998, including
the $25 million gain in 1999 related to an investment in an affiliate.

    Adjusted operating expenses of $289 million increased $59 million or 26%
from 1999 and in 1999 increased $24 million or 12% from 1998, reflecting higher
business volumes and costs associated with franchise growth in the region.

    The provision for credit losses was $33 million in 2000 compared with
$32 million in 1999 and $37 million in 1998. The adoption of revised FFIEC
write-off policies in 2000 added $3 million to net credit losses, which were
charged against the allowance for credit losses, and 15 basis points to the net
credit loss ratio. The net credit loss ratio was 1.95% (1.80% excluding the
effect of FFIEC policy revisions) in 2000, down from 1.96% in 1999 and 2.63% in
1998. Loans delinquent 90 days or more of $32 million or 1.37% of loans at
December 31, 2000 decreased from $46 million or 2.25% at December 31, 1999 and
$44 million or 2.97% at December 31, 1998.

    Other Consumer--which includes certain treasury operations and global
marketing and other programs--reported losses before restructuring-related items
of $98 million in 2000, compared with $75 million in 1999 and $67 million in

reduced staff levels. Expenses in 2000 also reflect costs associated with the
termination of certain global distribution initiatives. The 1999 and 1998
revenues, expenses and provision for credit losses include the results of the
private label cards business that was discontinued in early 2000. The net loss
of $96 million in 2000 and $87 million in 1999 included restructuring-related
items of $2 million ($2 million pretax) and ($12) million (($19) million
pretax), respectively.

CONSUMER PORTFOLIO REVIEW

    In the consumer portfolio, credit loss experience is often expressed in
terms of annualized net credit losses as a percentage of average loans. Pricing
and credit policies reflect the loss experience of each particular product.
Consumer loans are generally written off no later than a predetermined number of
days past due on a contractual basis, or earlier in the event of bankruptcy. The
number of days is set at an appropriate level according to loan product and
country. The table below summarizes delinquency and net credit loss experience
in both the managed and on-balance sheet loan portfolios in terms of loans
90 days or more past due, net credit losses, and as a percentage of related
loans.

BANKING/LENDING

    CITIBANKING NORTH AMERICA.  2000 was a year of continued success.
Citibanking invested in programs and staff to improve operations and customer
service while continuing to reduce overall expenses. In addition, Citibanking
implemented its needs based sales approach through Citipro, a complimentary
financial needs analysis that assesses customers' needs and recommends
appropriate financial products to meet those needs. In 2001, Citibanking expects
business volumes to increase, including loans, which have declined in the past
two years, however, lower interest rates may narrow spreads.

    On February 12, 2001, Citigroup agreed to acquire European American Bank
(EAB), a state-chartered bank with $11.5 billion in deposits, $15.4 billion in
assets and 97 branches in the New York area. The transaction, which upon
completion will be immediately accretive to Citigroup's earnings, is subject to
customary bank regulatory approvals and is expected to close in mid-2001.

                                       32

    MORTGAGE BANKING.  In 2000, Mortgage Banking, increased core income by 21%
over 1999. New loan production was 13% higher than 1999 as mortgage market share
increased and was supported by the cross-sell success of Salomon Smith Barney
financial consultants selling approximately $1 billion of mortgage products.
Student Loans retained its top industry ranking for volume and continued to
expand its Internet presence by sourcing 40% of new loan applications through
its website versus 16% in 1999. In 2001, core income should improve over 2000 if
increased refinancing activity occurs as a result of lower interest rates, by
the development of Internet-based partnerships, and additional e-commerce
volumes. Credit costs are not expected to improve further from 2000, due to
volume growth and U.S. economic conditions.

    NORTH AMERICA CARDS.  The Cards business achieved improved performance in
2000 despite a challenging interest rate environment and continuing competitive
pressures. Despite lower spreads, return on managed assets increased as both net
credit loss and expense ratios improved. In 2001, the business is expected to
show continued growth as lower interest rates should help improve spreads;
however, credit costs and delinquencies are expected to increase from 2000
levels as a result of the U.S. economic environment and continued business
growth.

    CITIFINANCIAL.  The addition of approximately 100 new branches, successful
integration of prior years acquisitions, and the continuation of originating new
volume through Citigroup affiliates contributed to the growth of the business in
2000. CitiFinancial will continue to pursue growth by expanding and developing
new channels and diversifying its product offerings. As in the past, cross-
selling opportunities among Citigroup affiliates will continue. The slowing U.S.
economy may mitigate growth in 2001 and credit performance is expected to
deteriorate as previous portfolio additions mature and the uncertain economic
environment persists.

INSURANCE INDUSTRY

    A variety of factors continue to affect the property and casualty insurance
market and the Company's core business outlook, including a firming of pricing
in the commercial lines marketplace as evidenced by price increases, a
continuing highly competitive personal lines marketplace, inflationary pressures
on loss cost trends including medical inflation and increasing auto loss costs,
rising reinsurance costs and litigation.

    Changes in the general interest rate environment affect the return received
by the insurance subsidiaries on newly invested and reinvested funds. While a
rising interest rate environment enhances the returns available, it reduces the
market value of existing fixed maturity investments and the availability of
gains on disposition. A decline in interest rates reduces the return available
on investment of funds, but creates the opportunity for realized investment
gains on disposition of fixed maturity investments.

    Certain social, economic, political, and litigation issues have led to an
increased number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at addressing the
cost and availability of certain types of insurance, as well as the claim and
coverage obligations of insurers. While most of these provisions have failed to
become law, these initiatives may continue as legislators and regulators try to
respond to the public availability, affordability, and claims concerns, and the
resulting laws, if any, could adversely affect the Company's ability to write
business with appropriate returns.

    TRAVELERS LIFE AND ANNUITY should benefit from growth in the aging
population who are becoming more focused on the need to accumulate adequate
savings for retirement, to protect these savings and to plan for the transfer of
wealth to the next generation. Travelers Life and Annuity is well positioned to
take advantage of the favorable long-term demographic trends through its strong
financial position, widespread brand name recognition and broad array of
competitive life, annuity and retirement and estate planning products sold
through established distribution channels.

                                       33
<PAGE>
    However, competition in both product pricing and customer service is
intensifying. While there has been some consolidation within the industry, other
financial services organizations are increasingly involved in the sale and/or
distribution of insurance products. Financial Services reform is likely to have
many effects on the life insurance industry and the results will take time to
assess; however, heightened competition is expected. Also, the annuities
business is interest rate and market sensitive, and swings in interest rates and
equity markets could influence sales and retention of in-force policies. In
order to strengthen its competitive position, Travelers Life and Annuity expects
to maintain a current product portfolio, further diversify its distribution
channels, and retain its healthy financial position through strong sales growth
and maintenance of an efficient cost structure.

    PRIMERICA.  During the last few years, primerica has instituted programs
including sales and product training that are designed to maintain high
compliance standards, increase the number of producing agents and customer
contacts and, ultimately, increase production levels. Additionally, increased
effort has been made to provide all Primerica customers full access to all
Primerica marketed lines. Insurance in force continues to grow. A continuation
of these trends could positively influence future operations. Primerica
continues to expand cross selling with other Company subsidiaries of products
such as loans, mutual funds, and annuity products.

    PERSONAL LINES strategy includes control of operating expenses to improve
competitiveness and profitability, growth in sales primarily through independent
agents and selective expansion of alternative marketing channels to broaden
distribution to a wider customer base. Personal Lines is continuing to grow its
nonstandard auto insurance to broaden its product capabilities. These growth
strategies also provide opportunities to leverage the existing cost structure
and achieve economies of scale. In addition, Personal Lines continues to take
action to control its exposure to catastrophe losses, including limiting the
writing of new homeowners business in certain markets and implementing price
increases in certain hurricane-prone areas, subject to restrictions imposed by
insurance regulatory authorities.

    The personal auto insurance marketplace remains highly competitive as some
personal auto carriers have been reluctant to increase prices despite increases
in loss cost trends due to inflationary pressures. These trends are expected to
continue into 2001. Personal Lines will continue to emphasize underwriting
discipline in this competitive marketplace and continue to pursue its strategy
of increases in auto rates to offset increases in loss cost trends. Market
conditions for homeowners insurance have remained stable with the industry
experiencing modest rate increases. Personal Lines expects homeowners rate
increases to continue in 2001. Homeowners loss cost trends continue to increase
at modest levels, reflecting inflationary pressures and the increased frequency
of weather-related losses.

    The property and casualty insurance industry continues to be reshaped by
consolidations. The Company's strategic objectives are to enhance its position
as a consistently profitable market leader and to become a low-cost provider of
property and casualty insurance in the United States, as the industry
consolidates.

    In relation to the Company's objective of being a low-cost provider of
property and casualty insurance, an emphasis on claim payout and performance and
enhanced productivity efforts is expected to continue.

INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER

    WESTERN EUROPE.  The outlook for the Western Europe region appears to be
favorable. The economic convergence of Eurozone is progressing and increasing
its breadth with the inclusion of Greece as of January 2001. In 2001, the
business will continue to focus on the development of Internet banking and
investment products, along with consumer finance and cards. As social reforms
take hold, an increasing recognition on the part of consumers that they will
need to fund their own retirements is fueling a substantial investment product
opportunity. Citigroup's strengths in distribution and consistent

                                       34
<PAGE>
global advertising and marketing efforts will provide a strong platform to
expand beyond the current European presence.

    JAPAN.  The acquisition of Diners Japan in 2000 expanded the country's loan
portfolio and contributed to both revenue and income growth. Growth was reported
across all product categories in 2000 and is planned to continue in 2001. In
2001, the business focus will be on expanding cards, revolving credit, and
investment products. While competitive pressures are expected to continue and
compress spreads, the business plans to grow through volume and fee revenue
increases. Credit costs are expected to increase modestly due to volume growth.

    CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA.  The business experienced
strong momentum in 2000 with a 28% increase in core income, driven by an
expanded presence in the region and the rapid emergence of a middle class with
increasing financial services needs. In 2000, revenue and account growth was
driven by leadership in cards across the region, the development of the consumer
finance franchise in key markets, and increased focus on investment and
insurance product sales. The priorities for 2001 will be the growth of market
share in established markets, further integration of acquisitions in India,
Poland and Hungary, continued development of the new franchises, and the launch
of innovative products and services using the Internet and mobile channels. The
business plans to grow in 2001, despite increased competitive pressures.

    ASIA.  The region recorded strong financial performance in 2000, driven by
volume growth, expense management initiatives and favorable credit performance,
despite pricing compression and currency devaluation in a number of countries.
Credit costs in 2000 were low compared to previous years, and are expected to
increase modestly in 2001 to reflect business growth. The business focus in 2001
will be on continuing the 2000 momentum to expand the cards, revolving credit,
and investment products portfolios.

    LATIN AMERICA.  In 2000, the region continued to experience weak economic
conditions in some of its countries. Tight controls in loan underwriting and
collections resulted in improved credit performance, offsetting a portion of the
revenue weakness. The termination and subsequent partial restoration of a
subsidy from the Mexican government also impacted results. The business will
continue to focus on products with reduced risk and population segments and
continue to implement operating expense reduction programs. The partial
restoration of the subsidy from the Mexican government coupled with expected
improvement in the economic climate and stable credit costs should position the
Latin American region for growth in 2001.

    e-CONSUMER.  In 2000 the business launched several new product initiatives,
including Citibank Online, C2it and MyCiti, and entered into a strategic
alliance with America Online. Expenses in 2000 included one-time charges related
to the termination of certain contracts and other initiatives. In 2001, the
business will continue to develop and refine product offerings and focus on
strategic alliances that will extend Citigroup's ability to deliver financial
services via the Internet and improve cross selling opportunities with other
Citigroup businesses. These efforts should position Citigroup to grow with the
digital economy and improve product distribution and customer service
capabilities.

    Citigroup's Global Corporate and Investment Bank business serves
corporations, financial institutions, governments, investors and other
participants in capital markets throughout the world and consists of Salomon
Smith Barney and The Global Relationship Bank, Emerging Markets Corporate
Banking and the Commercial Lines business of TPC. SSB is one of the largest
investment banking, underwriting and brokerage firms in the world, with a
significant presence in most major financial products. GRB focuses on providing
banking, capital markets and transaction processing services to large
multinational companies in 22 developed countries. EM Corporate provides a wide
array of banking products and services to multinational and large and emerging
local corporations in 78 emerging market countries. TPC is one of the largest
property and casualty insurers in the United States offering, among other
products, workers' compensation, commercial multi-peril, commercial auto, other
liability, fidelity and surety and property and other lines, which it
distributes through independent agents and brokers.

    The Global Corporate and Investment Bank reported core income of
$6.370 billion in 2000, up $1.374 billion or 28% from 1999, reflecting continued
strong growth across the franchise. The growth in core income was led by SSB &
GRB, up $699 million to $3.688 billion, EM Corporate, up $448 million to
$1.610 billion, and Commercial Lines, up $227 million to $1.072 billion. Core
income growth at SSB & GRB was driven by double-digit revenue growth across most
businesses partially offset by increases in expenses and the provision for
credit losses. EM Corporate's core income growth was driven by broad-based
growth in revenues, tight expense control management and improved credit.
Commercial Lines growth primarily reflects incremental earnings from the
minority interest buyback, revenue growth from rate increases achieved during
the year, higher fee income and lower catastrophe losses.

    Net income of $6.359 billion, $5.117 billion (excluding a charge of
$127 million for the cumulative effect of accounting changes) and
$2.372 billion in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, included a
restructuring-related charge of $11 million ($18 million pretax) in 2000 and net
restructuring-related credits of $121 million ($207 million pretax) in 1999 and
$26 million ($62 million pretax) in 1998. Restructuring-related items in 1999
consist mainly of a release of the 1997 restructuring reserve that resulted from
SSB's reassessment of space needs. Restructuring-related items in 1998 included
a reduction of the 1997 restructuring reserve of $191 million ($324 million
pretax) that resulted from SSB's favorable negotiations on a sublease on the
Seven World Trade Center location. Also included in

    Core income was $3.688 billion in 2000 compared to $2.989 billion in 1999
and $861 million in 1998. Salomon Smith Barney and The Global Relationship
Bank's earnings during 2000 reflect double-digit revenue growth across most
businesses partially offset by increases in expenses and the provision for
credit losses, including the impact of acquisitions in 2000. Core income of
$2.989 billion in 1999 increased $2.128 billion compared to 1998, primarily
reflecting a rebound from 1998 economic turmoil and strong revenue growth in
1999. Net income of $3.120 billion and $937 million in 1999 and 1998,
respectively, included restructuring-related credits of $131 million
($224 million pretax) and $76 million ($135 million pretax), respectively. See
Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the
restructuring-related items.

    On May 1, 2000, SSB completed the approximately 1.36 billion British Pound
($2.2 billion) acquisition of the global investment banking business and related
net assets of Schroders PLC (Schroders), including all corporate finance,
financial markets and securities activities. The combined European operations of
SSB are now known as Schroder Salomon Smith Barney. During the second quarter of
2000, GRB strengthened its position in the U.S. leasing market through the
purchase of Copelco.

(1) Excludes the revenues of SSB Asset Management which are reported in the
    Citigroup Asset Management segment.

    Revenues, net of interest expense, increased 20% in 2000 to $20.316 billion
from $16.893 billion in 1999 which, in turn, increased 37% from $12.323 billion
in 1998. The 2000 increase compared to 1999 reflects continued strong growth
across all businesses. The 1999 increase compared to 1998 primarily reflects
strong growth in all businesses as well as a rebound from the 1998 economic
turmoil.

    Commissions and fees revenue increased 19% in 2000 to $5.178 billion from
$4.365 billion in 1999 and $4.203 billion in 1998. The 2000 and 1999 increases
reflect growth in sales of listed and over-the-counter securities along with
increased mutual fund commissions and GRB transaction services fees in 2000.

    Investment banking revenues were $4.087 billion in 2000 compared to
$3.350 billion in 1999 and $2.549 billion in 1998. Growth in 2000 was primarily
due to growth in equity and high grade debt underwriting and in merger and
acquisition fees and was partially offset by a decline in high yield
underwriting. The increase in 1999 compared to 1998 reflects higher equity and
high grade debt underwriting combined with increased mergers and acquisitions
fees.

    Principal transactions revenues were $4.396 billion in 2000, up
$679 million or 18% from 1999, primarily reflecting increases in global
equities, fixed income and foreign exchange. Principal transactions were
$3.717 billion in 1999 compared to $719 million in 1998. In 1998 trading results
were adversely impacted by significant dislocations in the global fixed income
markets, including greatly reduced liquidity and widening credit spreads.

    Asset management and administration fees were $2.618 billion in 2000
compared to $2.024 billion in 1999 and $1.356 billion in 1998. The year-to-year
increases reflect growth in assets under fee-based management. These fees
include results from assets managed by the Financial Consultants and other
internally managed assets as well as those that are managed through the
Consulting Group.

    Total assets under fee-based management at December 31, were as follows:

    Interest and dividend income, net, was $3.523 billion in 2000 compared to
$3.399 billion in 1999 and $3.315 billion in 1998. The increase in 2000 was
primarily due to the addition of Copelco. The 1999 increase primarily reflects
increases in margin lending to clients.

    Other income was $514 million in 2000 compared with $38 million in 1999,
primarily reflecting an increase in ownership in Nikko Securities along with
higher income from the Nikko SSB joint venture which began operations during the
1999 first quarter. Other income of $38 million in 1999 was down $143 million
from 1998 primarily due to 1998 gains resulting from the disposition of real
estate investments in GRB.

    Adjusted operating expenses were $14.427 billion in 2000 compared to
$12.176 billion in 1999 and $11.006 billion in 1998. Adjusted operating expenses
increased 18% in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily due to higher production
related compensation and benefits expense, including the impact of the
acquisitions of Schroders and Copelco in the 2000 second quarter, partially
offset by the absence of year 2000 and European Economic Monetary Union
expenses. Adjusted operating expenses increased 11% in 1999 over 1998 primarily
due to an increase in production-related expenses, corresponding to increased
revenues.

    The provision for credit losses was $161 million in 2000 compared to
$6 million in 1999 and net benefits of $27 million in 1998. The increase in 2000
compared to 1999 was due to 2000 losses on exposures to North American health
care borrowers; recoveries on real estate loans in 1999; and the inclusion of
losses for Copelco, which was acquired in the second quarter of 2000. Exposures
to healthcare were limited in 1999 and were significantly reduced during 2000.
Copelco is an equipment lease financing business that incurred an acceptable
level of credit losses in the normal course of its business. Net benefits in
1998 were primarily the result of real estate recoveries partially offset by
write-offs resulting from the financial market turmoil in Russia.

    Cash-basis loans at December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $539 million,
$304 million and $268 million while the Other Real Estate Owned (OREO) portfolio
totaled $115 million, $156 million and $235 million, respectively. In all
periods, cash-basis loans represent less than 0.2% of total outstanding loans
and unfunded commitments. Approximately half of the increase in cash-basis loans
in 2000 was due to the acquisition of Copelco, with the balance attributable to
borrowers in North America. The increase in cash-basis loans in 1999 was due to
an increase in North America, primarily in the health-care industry, partially
offset by improvements in the real estate portfolio. The improvements in OREO in
2000 and 1999 were primarily related to the North America real estate portfolio.

    Emerging Markets Corporate Banking core income totaled $1.610 billion in
2000, up $448 million or 39% from 1999, reflecting broad based revenue growth,
tight expense control management and improved credit in Asia. The improvement in
core income was driven by growth across all regions with Asia up $212 million to
$588 million, CEEMEA up $138 million to $393 million and Latin America up
$34 million to $566 million. In June 2000, EM Corporate completed the
acquisition of a majority interest in Bank Handlowy, Poland's largest corporate
bank. Core income in 1999 of $1.162 billion increased $400 million or 52% from
1998, mainly reflecting Russia-related losses in 1998 and strong 1999 revenue
growth in Latin America. Net income of $1.599 billion, $1.152 billion and
$712 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, included
restructuring-related items of $11 million ($18 million pretax), $10 million
($17 million pretax) and $50 million ($73 million pretax), respectively.

    Revenues, net of interest expense, of $5.078 billion in 2000 grew
$731 million or 17% compared with 1999. Revenue growth in 2000 was led by
CEEMEA, up 36% from 1999, due to the acquisition of Bank Handlowy along with
growth in trading-related revenues and transaction services. Asia revenues were
up 10% in 2000 as growth in transaction services and higher realized investment
gains were partially offset by a decline in trading-related revenues. Latin
America revenues were up 6% in 2000 reflecting growth in transaction services,
capital markets and asset based finance, partially offset by lower
trading-related revenues. Revenues of $4.347 billion in 1999 grew $710 million
or 20% compared with 1998, reflecting double-digit growth in revenues from loan
products, structured products and transaction services along with an
$86 million improvement in trading-related revenues.

    Revenues in the EM Corporate business that were attributable to business
from multinational companies managed jointly with GRB grew 10% in 2000 and 17%
in 1999. These revenues accounted for approximately 23%, 25% and 25% of total EM
Corporate revenues in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

    Adjusted operating expenses in 2000 were well controlled, increasing
$208 million or 10% to $2.332 billion (up 4% excluding the impact of the
acquisition of Bank Handlowy). Expense growth was primarily due to investment
spending to gain market share in selected emerging market countries and other
volume related increases. Expenses in 1999 were $2.124 billion, up $130 million
or 7% compared to 1998, as investment spending and volume growth were
essentially funded by savings from prior restructuring actions and other expense
initiatives.

    The provision for credit losses totaled $185 million and $347 million in
2000 and 1999, respectively, down $162 million and $77 million compared with the
respective prior-year periods. Net credit losses in 2000 were down $185 million
or 46% compared to 1999, primarily reflecting improvements in Asia, mainly
China, Indonesia, Australia and Thailand, and in CEEMEA. The improvement in net
credit losses in 1999, down $40 million compared to 1998, was primarily
attributable to lower write-offs in Russia and Asia, partially offset by an
increase in Latin America.

    Cash-basis loans at December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $1.147 billion,
$1.044 billion and $1.062 billion, respectively. The increase in 2000 was
primarily due to the acquisition of Bank Handlowy along with increases in Latin
America, partially offset by improvements in Asia. The 1999 balance reflected
decreases in Asia, partially offset by increases in Latin America.

    Commercial Lines--which offers a broad array of property and casualty
insurance and insurance-related services through brokers and independent
agencies--reported net income, excluding the effect of accounting changes in
1999, of $1.072 billion in 2000 compared to $845 million in 1999 and
$723 million in 1998. The improvements in 2000 over 1999 reflect the incremental
earnings from the minority interest buyback, rate increases, higher fee income,
lower catastrophe losses, and higher net investment income and were partially
offset by increased loss cost trends and lower favorable prior-year reserve
development. Results for 2000 and 1999 reflect benefits resulting from
legislative actions that changed the manner in which certain states finance
their workers' compensation second-injury funds principally in the states of New
York and Pennsylvania. The 1999 increase compared to 1998 reflects a benefit
resulting from legislative actions by the states of New York and Pennsylvania
and favorable prior-year reserve development. Also contributing to the earnings
improvement in 1999 were lower weather-related losses and lower operating
expenses, partially offset by lower fee income.

    On May 31, 2000, the Company completed the acquisition of the surety
business of Reliance Group Holdings, Inc. (Reliance Surety) for $580 million. In
the third quarter of 2000 the Company purchased the renewal rights to a portion
of Reliance Group Holdings, Inc.'s commercial lines middle-market book of
business (Reliance Middle Market) and also acquired the renewal rights to
Frontier Insurance Group, Inc.'s (Frontier) environmental, excess and surplus
lines casualty businesses and certain classes of surety business.

</TABLE>

    Commercial Lines net written premiums were $5.031 billion in 2000 compared
to $4.408 billion in 1999 and $4.614 billion in 1998. Included in Specialty
Accounts net written premiums in 2000 is an adjustment of $131 million due to a
reinsurance transaction associated with the acquisition of the

                                       41
<PAGE>
Reliance Surety business. Net written premiums continues to reflect the impact
of an improving rate environment as evidenced by the favorable pricing on
renewal business and an increase in new business premiums. Also contributing to
the net written premium increases in 2000 was the new business associated with
the acquisition of the renewal rights for the Reliance Middle Market business in
Commercial Accounts, and the impact of the ongoing business associated with the
Reliance Surety acquisition and the new business associated with the acquisition
of the renewal rights for the Frontier business in Specialty Accounts. The net
written premium decrease in National Accounts was primarily due to a shift of
business mix from premium-based products to fee-based products. The decrease in
1999 net written premiums reflects the highly competitive marketplace and the
Company's continued disciplined approach to underwriting and risk management.
Also contributing to the 1999 decrease in net written premiums in National
Accounts and Specialty Accounts is the impact of additional reinsurance
coverage. The slight increase in Commercial Accounts net written premiums in
1999 reflects growth in specific business segments and an improving rate
environment.

    New business in National Accounts for 2000 was marginally lower than in
1999, reflecting the Company's continued disciplined approach to underwriting
and risk management. National Accounts new business in 1999 was significantly
lower than in 1998 reflecting the Company's continued disciplined approach to
underwriting and risk management in the highly competitive marketplace. National
Accounts business retention ratio for 2000 was moderately lower than 1999,
reflecting an increase in lost business due to the renewal price increases in
2000. National Accounts business retention ratio was moderately higher in 1999
than in 1998, primarily reflecting the loss of one large account in 1998.

    New business in Commercial Accounts for 2000 was significantly higher than
in 1999, reflecting the impact of the Reliance Middle Market business. In 1999,
new business in Commercial Accounts was significantly lower than in 1998,
reflecting the Company's selective underwriting policy and continued focus on
obtaining profitable new business accounts. Commercial Accounts business
retention ratio for 2000 was moderately lower than 1999, reflecting an increase
in lost business due to the renewal price increases in 2000. The Commercial
Accounts business retention ratio in 1999 was virtually the same as in 1998.

    For 2000, new business in Select Accounts was moderately higher than in
1999, while for 1999 new business was significantly lower than in 1998. These
changes reflect the unusually low new business in 1999 resulting from the
Company's selective underwriting policy in the highly competitive marketplace.
The business retention ratio for 2000 was moderately lower than in 1999,
reflecting an increase in lost business due to renewal price increases in 2000.
Select Accounts business retention ratio in 1999 was virtually the same as 1998.

    There were no catastrophe losses in 2000. Catastrophe losses, net of tax and
reinsurance, were $27 million in 1999 compared to $25 million in 1998. The 1999
catastrophe losses were primarily due to Hurricane Floyd in the third quarter
and tornadoes in Oklahoma in the second quarter. The 1998 catastrophe losses
were primarily due to Hurricane Georges in the third quarter and tornadoes in
Nashville, Tennessee in the second quarter.

    The statutory combined ratio before policyholder dividends for Commercial
Lines was 103.8% in 2000 compared to 108.6% in 1999 and 108.2% in 1998. The GAAP
combined ratio before policyholder dividends for Commercial Lines was 100.1% in
2000 compared to 105.0% in1999 and 109.5% in 1998. GAAP combined ratios for
Commercial Lines differ from statutory combined ratios primarily due to the
deferral and amortization of certain expenses for GAAP reporting purposes only.

    The 2000 statutory and GAAP combined ratios include an adjustment associated
with the acquisition of the Reliance Surety business. Excluding this adjustment,
the 2000 statutory and GAAP combined ratios before policyholder dividends would
have been 103.5% and 100.8%, respectively. The 1999 statutory combined ratio for
Commercial Lines reflected the treatment of the commutation of an

                                       42
<PAGE>
asbestos liability to an insured. Excluding this commutation, the statutory
combined ratio before policyholder dividends for 1999 would have been 106.1%.
The improvement in the 2000 statutory and GAAP combined ratios before
policyholder dividends, excluding the adjustments above, compared to the 1999
statutory and GAAP combined ratios before policyholder dividends was primarily
due to premium growth related to rate increases as well as the impact of the
ongoing business associated with the Reliance Surety acquisition and the
purchase of the renewal rights for the Reliance Middle Market and Frontier
businesses and lower catastrophe losses, partially offset by increased loss cost
trends and lower favorable prior-year reserve development.

    The improvement in the 1999 statutory combined ratio before policyholder
dividends, excluding the commutation, compared to 1998 was primarily due to
favorable prior-year reserve development and lower weather-related losses. The
decrease in the 1999 GAAP combined ratio before policyholder dividends compared
to 1998 was due to favorable prior-year reserve development, lower weather-
related losses, and the benefit of the New York and Pennsylvania legislative
actions, partially offset by lower fee income.

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

    The Company continues to receive claims from insureds, alleging that they
are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged disposition of
toxic substances. Mostly, these claims are due to various legislative as well as
regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation. The Company has been, and
continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues
pertaining to environmental claims. The Company believes that certain court
decisions have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the
original intent of the insurers and insureds. These decisions often pertain to
insurance policies that were issued by the Company prior to the mid-1970s. These
decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction. Environmental claims when submitted rarely indicate the monetary
amount being sought by the claimant from the insured and the Company does not
keep track of the monetary amount being sought in those few claims which
indicate such a monetary amount.

    The Company's reserves for environmental claims are not established on a
claim-by-claim basis. An aggregate bulk reserve is carried for all of the
Company's environmental claims that are in the dispute process, until the
dispute is resolved. This bulk reserve is established and adjusted based upon
the aggregate volume of in-process environmental claims and the Company's
experience in resolving such claims. At December 31, 2000, approximately 73% of
the net aggregate reserve (approximately $405 million), is carried in a bulk
reserve and includes unresolved as well as incurred but not reported
environmental claims for which the Company has not received any specific claims.
The balance, approximately 27% of the net environmental loss reserve
(approximately $153 million) consists of case reserves for resolved claims.

    The Company's reserving methodology is preferable to one based on
"identified claims" since the resolution of environmental exposures by the
Company generally occurs by settlement on an insured-by-insured basis as opposed
to a claim-by-claim basis. Generally, the settlement between the Company and the
insured extinguishes any obligation the Company may have under any policy issued
to the insured for past, present and future environmental liabilities as well as
extinguishes any pending coverage litigation dispute with the insured. This form
of settlement is commonly referred to as a "buy-back" of policies for future
environmental liability. In addition, many of the agreements have also
extinguished any insurance obligation which the Company may have for other
claims, including but not limited to asbestos and other cumulative injury
claims. Provisions of these agreements also include appropriate indemnities and
hold harmless provisions to protect the Company. The Company's general purpose
in executing such agreements is to reduce its potential environmental exposure
and eliminate both the risks presented by coverage litigation with the insured
and the cost of such litigation.

                                       43
<PAGE>
    As of December 31, 2000, the Company had approximately 43,000 pending
environmental-related claims tendered by 787 active policyholders. The pending
environmental-related claims represent federal or state EPA-type claims as well
as plaintiffs' claims alleging bodily injury and property damage due to the
discharge of waste or pollutants allegedly by the policyholder.

    The following table displays activity for environmental losses and loss
expenses and reserves for the years ended December 31:

    As of December 31, 2000, the number of policyholders with pending coverage
litigation disputes pertaining to environmental claims was 243, approximately
10% less than the number pending as of December 31, 1999, approximately 40% less
than the number of pending as of December 31, 1998, as well as approximately 54%
less than the number pending as of December 31, 1997. Also, in 2000, there were
158 policyholders tendering for the first time an environmental remediation-type
claim to the Company. This compares to 256 policyholders doing so in 1999 and
288 policyholders in 1998.

    As of December 31, 2000, the Company, for approximately $1.78 billion
(before reinsurance), has resolved the environmental liabilities presented by
5,286 of the 6,073 policyholders who have tendered environmental claims to the
Company. This resolution comprises 87% of the policyholders who have tendered
such claims. The Company generally has been successful in resolving its coverage
litigation disputes and continues to reduce its potential exposure through
favorable settlements with certain insureds. Generally, the settlement dollars
paid in disputed coverage claims are a percentage of the total coverage sought
by such insureds.

    The Company has direct environmental reserves (before reinsurance) of
approximately $669 million, $390 million of which relates to 787 policyholders
with unresolved environmental claims (the remaining 13% of the 6,073
policyholders who have tendered environmental claims); policyholders that may
tender an environmental claim in the future; and for the anticipated cost of
coverage litigation disputes pertaining to such environmental claims. Based upon
the Company's reserving methodology and the experience of its historical
resolution of environmental exposures, it believes that the environmental
reserves are appropriate.

ASBESTOS CLAIMS

    In the area of asbestos claims, the Company believes that the property and
casualty insurance industry has suffered from judicial interpretations that have
attempted to maximize insurance availability from both a coverage and liability
standpoint far beyond the intent of the contracting parties. These policies
generally were issued prior to 1980. The Company continues to receive asbestos
claims alleging insureds' liability from claimants' asbestos-related injuries.
In 2000, the Company experienced an increase over prior years in the number of
asbestos claims being tendered to the Company. In addition, the Company is
continuing to evaluate the impact of recent and well-publicized filings for
bankruptcy protection by certain major asbestos producers. As in the past,
asbestos claims, when submitted, rarely indicate the monetary amount being
sought by the claimant from the insured and the Company does not keep track of
the monetary amount being sought in those few claims that indicated such a
monetary amount. Based upon the Company's experience with asbestos claims, the
duration period of an asbestos claim from the date of submission to resolution
is approximately two years.

    Various classes of asbestos defendants, such as major product manufacturers,
installers of asbestos, peripheral and regional product defendants as well as
premises owners, continue to tender asbestos-related claims to the industry.
Because each insured presents different liability and coverage issues, including
whether such claims qualify as products/completed operations or
non-products/operations claims, the Company evaluates those issues on an
insured-by-insured basis. From a coverage standpoint, one general distinction
between a products/completed operations and a non-products/operations claim is
that a products/completed operations claim is typically subject to a policy
aggregate limitation and a non-products/operations claim is not typically
subject to such a limitation in a pre-1985 general liability policy. The
Company's evaluations have not resulted in any meaningful data from which an
average asbestos defense or indemnity payment may be determined.

    At December 31, 2000, approximately 83% (approximately $670 million) of the
net asbestos reserve, represents incurred but not reported losses for which the
Company has not received any specific claims. The balance, approximately 17% of
the net aggregate reserve (approximately $136 million) is for pending asbestos
claims.

    In general, the Company posts case reserves for pending asbestos claims
within approximately thirty (30) business days of receipt of such claims.

</TABLE>

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS RESERVES

    It is difficult to estimate the reserves for environmental and
asbestos-related claims due to the vagaries of court coverage decisions,
plaintiffs' expanded theories of liability, the risks inherent in major
litigation and other uncertainties, including without limitation, those which
are set forth below. Conventional actuarial techniques are not used to estimate
such reserves.

    For environmental claims, the reserving methodology includes an analysis by
the Company of the exposure presented by each insured and the anticipated cost
of resolution, if any, for each insured. This analysis is completed by the
Company on a quarterly basis. In the course of its analysis, an assessment of
the probable liability, available coverage, judicial interpretations and
historical value of similar exposures is considered by the Company. In addition,
due consideration is given to the many variables presented, such as the nature
of the alleged activities of the insured at each site; the allegations of
environmental harm at each site; the number of sites; the total number of
potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of environmental harm
and the corresponding remedy at a site; the nature of government enforcement
activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall
nature of the insurance relationship between the Company and the insured,
including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance issued by the Company to
the insured; the identification of other insurers; the potential for other
available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any,
of non-environmental claims or potential non-environmental claims, in any
resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. Analysis of
these and other factors, including the potential for future claims, results in
the establishment of the bulk reserve.

    The reserving methodology for asbestos includes an evaluation of the
asbestos exposure presented by each insured. The following factors are
evaluated: available insurance coverage including the role of any umbrella or
excess insurance issued by the Company to the insured; limits and deductibles;
an analysis of each insured's potential liability; jurisdictional involvement;
past and anticipated future claim activity; past settlement values of similar
claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; potential role of other insurance;
the role, if any, of non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any

                                       46
<PAGE>
resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any,
including the determination as to whether an asbestos claim is a
products/completed operations or non-products/ operations claim and the
available coverage, if any, for such a claim. Once the gross ultimate exposure
for indemnity and allocated claim adjustment expense is determined for each
insured by each policy year, a ceded reinsurance projection is calculated based
on any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, as well as past ceded
experience. Adjustments to the ceded projections also occur due to actual ceded
claim experience and reinsurance collections.

    Historically, the Company's experience has indicated that insureds with
potentially significant environmental and asbestos exposures may often have
potential cumulative injury other than asbestos (CIOTA) exposures or CIOTA
claims pending with the Company. Due to this experience and the fact that
settlement agreements with insureds may extinguish the Company's obligations for
all claims, including environmental, asbestos and CIOTA, the Company evaluates
and considers the environmental and asbestos reserves in conjunction with the
CIOTA reserve.

    The Company also compares its historical direct and net loss and expense
paid experience in environmental and asbestos, year-by-year, to assess any
emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid
activity. The comparison includes a review of the result derived from the
division of the ending direct and net reserves by last year's direct and net
paid activity, also known as the survival ratio.

    As a result of these processes and procedures, the reserves carried for
environmental and asbestos claims at December 31, 2000 are the Company's best
estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses based upon known facts
and current law. However, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of
these claims continue. These include, without limitation, any impact from the
bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers, a further increase
or decrease in asbestos and environmental claims which cannot now be anticipated
as well as the role of any umbrella or excess policies issued by the Company for
such claims, the resolution or adjudication of certain disputes pertaining to
asbestos non-products/operations claims in a manner inconsistent with the
Company's previous assessment of such claims as well as unanticipated
developments pertaining to the Company's ability to recover reinsurance for
environmental and asbestos claims.

    It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative
environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and
environmental claims. Such development will be affected by future court
decisions and interpretations, as well as changes in legislation applicable to
such claims. Because of these future unknowns, and the uncertainties set forth
above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current
reserves. These additional amounts, or a range of these additional amounts,
cannot now be reasonably estimated, and could result in a liability exceeding
reserves by an amount that would be material to the Company's operating results
in a future period. However, in the opinion of the Company's management, it is
not likely that these claims will have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial condition or liquidity.

CUMULATIVE INJURY OTHER THAN ASBESTOS (CIOTA) CLAIMS

    CIOTA claims are generally submitted to the Company under general liability
policies and often involve an allegation by a claimant against an insured that
the claimant has suffered injuries as a result of long-term or continuous
exposure to potentially harmful products or substances. Such potentially harmful
products or substances include, but are not limited to, lead paint, pesticides,
pharmaceutical products, silicone-based personal products, solvents and other
deleterious substances.

    To the extent disputes exist between the Company and a policyholder
regarding the coverage available for CIOTA claims, the Company resolves the
disputes, where feasible, through settlements with the policyholder or through
coverage litigation. Some agreements may extinguish any insurance obligation
which the Company may have for other claims, including but not limited to
asbestos and

                                       47
<PAGE>
environmental claims. Generally, the terms of a settlement agreement set forth
the nature of the Company's participation in resolving CIOTA claims, the scope
of coverage to be provided by the Company and contain the appropriate
indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect the Company. These
settlements generally eliminate uncertainties for the Company regarding the
risks extinguished, including the risk that losses would be greater than
anticipated due to evolving theories of tort liability or unfavorable coverage
determinations. The Company's approach also has the effect of determining losses
at a date earlier than would have occurred in the absence of such settlement
agreements. On the other hand, in cases where future developments are favorable
to insurers, this approach could have the effect of resolving claims for amounts
in excess of those that would ultimately have been paid had the claims not been
settled in this manner. No inference should be drawn that because of the
Company's method of dealing with CIOTA claims, its reserves for such claims are
more conservatively stated than those of other insurers.

    At December 31, 2000, approximately 83% (approximately $667 million) of the
net CIOTA reserve, represents incurred but not reported losses for which the
Company has not received any specific claims. The balance, approximately 17% of
the net aggregate reserve (approximately $132 million) is for pending CIOTA
claims.

reserves for the years ended December 31:

COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO REVIEW

    Commercial loans are identified as impaired and placed on a nonaccrual basis
when it is determined that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful of
collection or when interest or principal is past due for 90 days or more, except
when the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Impaired
commercial loans are written down to the extent that principal is judged to be

                                       48

uncollectible. Impaired collateral-dependent loans are written down to the lower
of cost or collateral value. The following table summarizes commercial
cash-basis loans and net credit losses.

    credit losses related to Copelco.

(2) Associates results are reported in the Associates segment and exclude
    amounts related to manufactured housing, as such loan origination operations
    were discontinued in early 2000. Excluded cash-basis loans and net credit
    losses relating to manufactured housing were $55 million and $36 million,
    respectively, in 1999 and $75 million and $21 million, respectively, in
    1998.

(3) Investment Activities results are reported in the Investment Activities
    segment.

    Total commercial cash-basis loans were $2.134 billion, $1.626 billion and
$1.775 billion at December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Cash-basis
loans in GRB increased $235 million to $539 million at December 31, 2000 with
approximately half of the increase due to the acquisition of Copelco and the
balance attributable to borrowers in North America. Associates' cash-basis loans
of $402 million increased $179 million primarily in the transportation
portfolio. EM Corporate cash-basis loans were $1.147 billion at December 31,
2000, up 10% from a year ago primarily due to the acquisition of Bank Handlowy
along with increases in Latin America, partially offset by improvements in Asia.
Total commercial cash-basis loans at December 31, 1999 declined $149 million
from December 31, 1998. The decline was primarily due to a decrease in Insurance
cash-basis loans resulting from a loan foreclosure during the year partially
offset by increases in GRB. The increase in GRB cash-basis loans in 1999 was due
to an increase in North America, primarily in the health-care industry,
partially offset by improvements in the real estate portfolio.

    Total commercial net credit losses of $771 million in 2000 increased
$217 million compared to 1999 primarily reflecting increases in Associates and
GRB partially offset by a decline in EM Corporate. The increase in Associates
net credit losses was primarily due to deterioration in the transportation
portfolio while the GRB increase reflected 2000 losses on exposures to North
American health care borrowers, recoveries on real estate loans in 1999, and the
inclusion of losses for Copelco, which was acquired in the second quarter of
2000. Exposures to health care were limited in 1999 and were significantly
reduced during 2000. EM Corporate net credit losses in 2000 were down
$185 million, primarily reflecting improvements in Asia, mainly China,
Indonesia, Australia and Thailand, and in CEEMEA. Total commercial net credit
losses increased $95 million in 1999 compared to 1998, reflecting an increase in
Associates, primarily related to the transportation portfolio, combined with net
recoveries in GRB and Investment Activities in 1998. Partially offsetting the
1999 increases was improvement in EM Corporate primarily attributable to lower
write-offs in Russia and Asia. For a further discussion of trends by business,

    Citigroup's allowance for credit losses of $8.961 billion is available to
absorb all probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. For analytical
purposes only, the portion of Citigroup's allowance for credit losses attributed
to the commercial portfolio was $3.988 billion at December 31, 2000 compared to
$3.695 billion and $3.717 billion at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
The increase in the allowance in 2000 primarily reflects an increase related to
the Associates' transportation portfolio and the impact of acquisitions while
the decline in 1999 was primarily due to an improved credit outlook in Emerging
Markets Corporate Banking.

GLOBAL CORPORATE AND INVESTMENT BANK OUTLOOK

    The statements below are forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. See "Forward-Looking Statements"
on page 59.

    The businesses of Global Corporate and Investment Bank are significantly
affected by the levels of activity in the global capital markets which, in turn,
are influenced by macro-economic and political policies and developments, among
other factors, in the 100 countries in which the businesses operate. Global
economic and market events can have both positive and negative effects on the
revenue performance of the businesses and can negatively affect credit
performance. In particular, levels of principal transactions, realized gains
from sales of investments, and gains from asset sales may fluctuate in the
future as a result of market and asset-specific factors.

    In 1998, the global capital markets experienced severe economic turmoil.
Currency crises sparked economic turmoil that began in Asia, spread to Russia
and in early 1999 to Latin America. In response, the businesses undertook
initiatives at that time to reduce the risk profile, particularly in SSB's
global arbitrage operation.

    Losses on commercial lending activities and the level of cash-basis loans
can vary widely with respect to timing and amount, particularly within any
narrowly defined business or loan type.

    SALOMON SMITH BARNEY AND THE GLOBAL RELATIONSHIP BANK.  In 2000, market
share improvements were achieved in equity and fixed income underwriting as well
as in global mergers and acquisitions. Investments are expected to continue in
2001 to expand and upgrade the Private Client branch system as well as expanding
the integration of Internet services with personal advice from the Salomon Smith
Barney Financial Consultants. In 2001, the businesses also plan to continue
broadening e-commerce opportunities through the development of new products,
services and strategic partnerships.

    Citigroup continues to monitor the impact of the slowing U.S. economy on its
portfolio. Problem credits will continue to be identified early and appropriate
remedial actions will be taken.

    EMERGING MARKETS CORPORATE BANKING.  EM Corporate continues to work on
strategies such as Embedded Bank, Emerging Local Corporate and selective
acquisitions to increase market share in priority countries. In June 2000, EM
Corporate reinforced its position in Poland by completing the acquisition of a
majority interest in Bank Handlowy. Investments in a number of Internet
initiatives are expected to continue in 2001, including the expansion of
CitiDirect--giving clients Internet-based access to cash management and trade
capabilities--which has been installed in 39 countries and is available in 4
languages.

                                       50

    Overall, the EM Corporate portfolio remains diversified across a number of
geographies and industry groups. During 2000, most emerging market economies
showed improvements, particularly in Asia. While most countries that suffered
from the economic turmoil of 1998 and early 1999 have stabilized, they remain
dependent on U.S. and world economic growth as well as liquidity. Citigroup
continues to monitor countries closely and, where appropriate, adjusts
exposures, tunes early warning systems and strengthens risk management
oversight.

    COMMERCIAL LINES.  In 2000, the trend of higher rates continued in
Commercial Lines. Prices generally rose throughout the year, although some of
the increases varied significantly by region and business segment. These
increases were necessary to offset the impact of rising loss cost trends and the
decline in profitability from the competitive pressures of the last several
years.

    In National Accounts, where programs include risk management service, such
as claims settlement, loss control and risk management information services,
which are generally offered in connection with a large deductible or
self-insured program, and risk transfer, which is typically provided through a
guaranteed cost or retrospectively rated insurance policy, pricing began to
stabilize during 2000. National Accounts has benefited from higher rates on both
new and renewal business as evidenced by the improving profit margins earned on
this business. National Accounts believes that pricing will continue to firm in
2001. However, National Accounts will continue to reject business that is not
expected to produce acceptable returns.

    Commercial Accounts achieved double-digit price increases on renewal
business during 2000, improving the overall profit margin in this business. In
addition, these increases were necessary to offset the impacts of rising loss
cost inflation, medical inflation and reinsurance costs. Commercial Accounts
will continue to seek significant rate increases in 2001 as pricing in certain
areas and business segments has not improved to the point of producing
acceptable returns.

    In Select Accounts, the trends toward increased pricing on renewal business
that started in late 1999 gained momentum in 2000. Prices generally rose
throughout the year, although these increases varied significantly by region,
industry and product. Loss cost trends, however also worsened in 2000,
especially in workers' compensation and auto liability. The impact of these
negative loss cost trends has been partially offset by a continued disciplined
approach to underwriting and risk selection by the Company. Select Accounts
believes that the improvements gained through high quality underwriting and
continued price increases in 2001 may be offset by the combination of worsening
loss cost trends in certain lines and regulatory pricing constraints in some
jurisdictions.

    Specialty Accounts achieved significant growth in 2000, with the acquisition
of Reliance Surety, cementing a leadership position in the surety bond
marketplace by broadening product and service capabilities. The Company's focus
in this market is to sustain its emphasis on products with the most
opportunities for acceptable profitability and increase its efforts to cross
sell its expanding array of specialty products to existing customers of National
Accounts, Commercial Accounts, Select Accounts, and various other Citigroup
units.

    The Company was able to achieve growth in its premium and fee levels during
2000 as a result of the Reliance Surety acquisition, the acquisition of the
renewal rights for the Reliance Middle Market and Frontier businesses and the
continuation of rate increases. The rate increases are expected to continue into
2001, although the deteriorating loss cost trends and increased costs of
reinsurance will offset some of the positive impact. The Company will continue
to adhere to strict underwriting guidelines and to reject business that is not
expected to produce acceptable returns.

    The Company continues to receive asbestos claims alleging insureds'
liability from claimants' asbestos-related injuries. In 2000, the Company
experienced an increase over prior years in the number of asbestos claims being
tendered to the Company. However, the uncertainties surrounding the final

                                       51
<PAGE>
resolution of these claims continue. See the discussion on Asbestos Claims and
Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Environmental and Asbestos Reserves.

    The property and casualty insurance industry continues to be reshaped by
consolidation and globalization. The Company's strategic objectives are to
enhance its position as a consistently profitable market leader and to become a
low-cost provider of property and casualty insurance in the United States, as
the industry consolidates. While some of the insurance industry's cost control
methods have been challenged in litigation, it continues to be the Company's
objective to be a low-cost provider of property and casualty insurance, with an
emphasis on claim payout and performance and enhanced productivity.

    With respect to globalization, Citigroup recently announced the formation of
CitiInsurance, the international arm of Citigroup insurance activities. This new
Citigroup unit was formed to capitalize on the strength of the Citigroup branch
franchise and the extensive distribution strength of the Citigroup consumer
business around the world. This unit expects to build on the progress already
made in Southeast Asia during 2000 with the strategic alliance with Fubon Group,
a diversified financial services company based in Taiwan.

    As required by various state laws and regulations, the Company's insurance
subsidiaries are subject to assessments from state-administered guaranty
associations, second injury funds and similar associations. Management believes
that such assessments will not have a material impact on the Company's results
of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

retail clients.

    Global Investment Management and Private Banking core income in 2000
increased to $685 million, up $88 million or 15% from 1999. The 2000 increase in
core income reflected continued customer revenue momentum within The Citigroup
Private Bank along with the impact of the acquisitions of Garante, Siembra and
Colfondos in Citigroup Asset Management. Core income of $597 million in 1999 was
up $88 million or 17% from 1998, primarily reflecting revenue growth
corresponding to growth in assets under management within Citigroup Asset
Management and client

(2) Excludes restructuring-related items.

(3) Includes $30 billion, $31 billion, and $34 billion in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
    respectively, for Citigroup Private Bank clients.

(4) Includes Unit Investment Trusts held in client accounts of $9 billion,
    $13 billion and $13 billion in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, and
    $5 billion in Emerging Markets Pension Administration assets under
    management in 2000.

    Citigroup Asset Management is comprised of the substantial resources that
are available through its three primary asset management business
platforms--Smith Barney Asset Management, Salomon Brothers Asset Management and
Citibank Asset Management--along with the pension administration businesses of
Global Retirement Services. These businesses offer institutional, high net worth
and retail clients a broad range of investment alternatives from global
investment centers around the world. Products and services offered include
mutual funds, closed-end funds, separately managed accounts, unit investment
trusts, variable annuities (through affiliated and third party insurance
companies) and pension administration.

    Core income of $361 million in 2000 was up $33 million or 10% compared to
1999, reflecting the impact of Latin American acquisitions in the Global
Retirement Services business and growth in asset-based fee revenue, partially
offset by increased expenses. Core income of $328 million in 1999 grew
$63 million or 24% from 1998, primarily reflecting an increase in assets under
management and a corresponding increase in revenues. Net income of $355 million
in 2000, $329 million in 1999, and $255 million in 1998 included a
restructuring-related charge of $6 million ($10 million pretax), a
restructuring-related credit of $1 million ($2 million pretax), and a
restructuring-related charge of $10 million ($17 million pretax), respectively.

    Assets under management rose to $401 billion as of December 31, 2000, up 6%
from $377 billion in 1999, reflecting growth within the money market and
institutional liquidity funds and managed accounts product categories. Retail
client assets were $242 billion, up 9% compared to 1999 as growth in private
client separately managed accounts (up 20%) and money market funds (up 17%) were

                                       53
<PAGE>
partially offset by a decline in fixed income funds. Institutional client assets
of $154 billion at December 31, 2000 were down 1% compared to a year ago
reflecting a decline in managed accounts, partially offset by cross-selling
efforts, including $20 billion in sales to Global Corporate and Investment Bank
customers.

    Sales of proprietary mutual funds and managed account products at SSB rose
30% to $21 billion in 2000 and represented 41% of SSB's retail channel sales for
the year. Sales of mutual and money funds through Global Consumer's banking
network were $13 billion for the year, representing 56% of total sales,
including $9.3 billion in International and $4.2 billion in the U.S. Primerica
sold $1.8 billion of proprietary U.S. mutual and money funds in 2000, a 10%
increase compared to 1999, representing 50% of Primerica's total sales.

    Revenues, net of interest expense, increased $399 million or 27% to
$1.893 billion in 2000, compared to $1.494 billion in 1999 which was up
$220 million or 17% from 1998. The increase in 2000 was primarily due to the
impact of the acquisitions of Siembra, Garante and Colfondos in the Global
Retirement Services business, along with continued growth in asset-based fee
revenues. The increase in 1999 was predominantly due to an increase in advisory
fee revenues and reflected broad-based growth in assets under management.

    Adjusted operating expenses of $1.286 billion in 2000 were up $337 million
or 36% from 1999. The increase in 2000 reflected the impact of the acquisitions
of Siembra, Garante and Colfondos as well as continued investments in sales and
marketing activities, technology and product development. Expenses were
$949 million in 1999, up $113 million or 14%, primarily reflecting higher costs
associated with building the business' global sales and marketing capabilities
and investments in research, quantitative and technology expertise.

    The Citigroup Private Bank provides personalized wealth management services
for high net worth clients around the world. The Citigroup Private Bank reported
core income in 2000 of $324 million, up $55 million or 20% from 1999, primarily
reflecting continued customer revenue momentum, partially

                                       54
<PAGE>
offset by increased front-end expenses. Core income of $269 million in 1999 was
up $25 million or 10% from 1998, primarily reflecting improving revenue growth
which outpaced moderate increases in expenses and the provision for credit
losses. Net income of $319 million in 2000, $270 million in 1999 and
$201 million in 1998, included a restructuring-related charge of $5 million
($8 million pretax), a restructuring-related credit of $1 million ($2 million
pretax) and a restructuring-related charge of $43 million ($70 million pretax),
respectively.

    Client business volumes under management, which include custody accounts,
client assets under fee-based management, deposits and loans, were $153 billion
at the end of the year, up 9% from $140 billion in 1999, reflecting strong
growth in the U.S., Asia Pacific and CEEMEA. Business volumes grew in all
product lines.

    Revenues, net of interest expense, in 2000 were $1.406 billion, up
$194 million or 16% from 1999. Net interest and recurring fee-based revenues
increased $131 million or 16%, transaction revenues increased $59 million or
26%, while other revenue increased $4 million or 3% compared to 1999. The 2000
increase in revenues reflected growth in the international region, up
$130 million or 17%, as well as continued favorable trends in the U.S., up
$64 million or 15% compared to 1999. Revenues in 1999 were $1.212 billion, up
$82 million or 7% from 1998, reflecting strong lending and asset management
activity, partially offset by lower fees from customer trading-related
activities.

    Adjusted operating expenses of $870 million in 2000 were up $100 million or
13% from 1999, primarily reflecting higher levels of bankers and product
specialists hired to improve front-end sales and service capabilities. Expenses
of $770 million in 1999 were up $43 million or 6% from 1998, reflecting
increased spending related to growth in the sales force and technology platform
development, partially offset by saves from restructuring initiatives.

    The provision for credit losses in 2000 was $23 million, compared with
$12 million in 1999 and $5 million in 1998. The increase in the 2000 provision
primarily related to a loan in Europe. Net credit losses in 2000 remained at a
nominal level of 0.09% of average loans outstanding. Loans 90 days or more past
due at year-end were $61 million or 0.23% of total loans outstanding, compared
with 0.54% at the end of 1999 and 1.14% at the end of 1998.

    Average assets of $25 billion in 2000 rose $5 billion or 25% from
$20 billion in 1999 which, in turn, increased $3 billion or 18% from 1998. The
growth in both periods was primarily due to higher loans.

GLOBAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND PRIVATE BANKING OUTLOOK

    The statements below are forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. See "Forward-Looking Statements"
on page 59.

    The businesses of Global Investment Management and Private Banking are
affected by the economic outlook and market levels. The market for investment
management and private banking services is extremely attractive because the
"wealth" segment has been growing faster than the overall market. While
competition for this attractive and dynamic market segment is increasing, the
global market is highly fragmented. This presents Global Investment Management
and Private Banking with an extremely attractive business opportunity because it
is one of the few providers that can claim to offer a full range of services on
a global basis.

(1) Includes after-tax adjustments to conform accounting policies to those of
    Citigroup of $163 million, $110 million, and $81 million, respectively. See
    Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2) Excludes restructuring-related items and Housing Finance charge.

(3) Adjusted for the effect of securitization and Housing Finance charge.

(4) Adjusted for the effect of securitization, managed average assets were
    $103 billion, $91 billion, and $69 billion in 2000, 1999, and 1998,
    respectively.

(5) Adjusted for the effect of securitization, the return on managed assets,
    excluding restructuring-related items and Housing Finance charge was 1.34%
    in 2000, 1.54% in 1999, and 1.66% in 1998.

    Associates--which provides finance, leasing, insurance and related services
to consumers and businesses in the United States and internationally--reported
core income of $1.381 billion in 2000, down $21 million or 1.5% from 1999. In
1999, core income increased $259 million or 23%. The increase in core income in
1999 primarily related to continued strong receivable growth, including the
effect of acquisitions.

    Net income of $850 million in 2000 and $1.380 billion in 1999 included
restructuring-related items and merger-related costs of $460 million
($630 million pretax) and $22 million ($35 million pretax), respectively, and in
2000, $71 million ($112 million pretax) related to the discontinuation of
Associates Housing Finance loan origination operations.

    The restructuring charge of $474 million recorded in 2000 related to exit
costs as a result of Citigroup's acquisition of Associates. The charge included
amounts for the reconfiguration of certain branch operations, the exit from
non-strategic businesses and from activities as mandated by Federal bank
regulations, and the consolidation and integration of Corporate and middle and
back office functions. Also recorded in 2000 were $156 million of merger-related
costs, which included the direct and incremental costs of administratively
closing Citigroup's acquisition of Associates. The

                                       56
<PAGE>
implementation of these restructuring initiatives will cause some related
premises and equipment assets to become redundant. As a result, the remaining
depreciable lives of these assets were shortened, and accelerated depreciation
charges of $62 million will be recognized in subsequent periods. See Note 15 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of
restructuring-related items.

    In January 2000, Associates announced its intention to discontinue the loan
origination operations of its Associates Housing Finance (AHF) unit. Prior to
the announcement, AHF originated and serviced loans for manufactured homes. As a
result of this announcement, Associates took a charge of approximately
$112 million in the first quarter of 2000. This charge covers exit costs of
approximately $25 million, including severance, noncancellable contractual
obligations and related costs, a securitization retained interest write-down of
approximately $47 million, and a provision for increased losses on the
disposition of repossessions of approximately $40 million. Associates closed
substantially all of its sales centers in the second quarter of 2000. Associates
will service the liquidation of the existing receivables through its centralized
service facility. Associates will limit its origination activities to support
its contractual arrangements and loss mitigation initiatives.

    As shown in the following table, Associates managed assets, end-of-period
managed receivables and average managed loans increased 22%, 15% and 15%,
respectively, during 2000 as compared to 17%, 20% and 24%, respectively, in
1999. The increase in managed receivables was a result of internal growth and
acquisitions primarily in the real estate, personal lending and retail sales
finance, and credit card product lines. The average net interest margin on
receivables increased to 9.65% in 2000 from 9.52% and 9.09% in 1999 and 1998,
respectively, reflecting higher yields due to increased interest rates and
changes in the aggregate portfolio composition toward high yielding automobile,
credit card and personal loans.

(1) Excludes manufactured housing and the receivables of Arcadia (an auto
    finance company purchased in April 2000) which were securitized prior to
    Associates' purchase of the company.

    Adjusted revenues, net of interest expense increased $1.403 billion or 16%
in 2000 and $2.453 billion or 38% in 1999 primarily resulting from an increase
in average loans outstanding during 2000 and the acquisition of Avco Financial
Services, Inc. in 1999 (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements). Adjusted operating expense of $4.368 billion and $3.875 billion in
1999 increased $493 million or 13% and $1.066 billion or 38% reflecting
acquisitions, as well as new business volumes.

    The adjusted provision for benefits, claims and credit losses increased
$1.007 billion or 36% during 2000 and $961 million or 52% in 1999 primarily
reflecting receivables growth and industry weakness in the transportation and
manufactured housing businesses and in 2000, a $210 million transportation loss
provision relating to the truck loan and leasing portfolio. The net credit loss
ratio of 3.30% in 2000 increased from 2.97% in 1999 and 2.59% in 1998. Loans
delinquent 90 days or more as a percentage of average managed loans increased to
2.24% in 2000 from 2.20% in 1999 and 1.80% in 1998.

ASSOCIATES OUTLOOK

    During 2000, Associates experienced continued revenue growth internally and
through acquisitions both domestically and in Japan. In 2001, Associates expects
to have growth particularly in its international markets and credit card
portfolio due to expansion in its college and emerging credit markets. The
commercial business expects reduced earnings due to increased fuel prices,
excess capacity for used vehicles and other economic factors having a large
negative effect on the performance of its transportation portfolio. This

(1) Reclassified to conform to the 2000 presentation.

    Investment Activities comprises Citigroup's venture capital activities,
realized investment gains (losses) related to certain corporate and
insurance-related investments, and the results of certain investments in
countries that refinanced debt under the 1989 Brady Plan or plans of a similar
nature.

    Revenues, net of interest expense in 2000 of $2.245 billion increased
$1.155 billion from 1999, primarily reflecting increases in venture capital
results and gains on the exchange of certain Latin American bonds. Partially
offsetting the 2000 revenue increases were 2000 first quarter losses in
insurance-related investments from repositioning activities designed to improve
yields and maturity profiles, and writedowns in the refinancing portfolio.
Revenues in 1999 of $1.090 billion declined $233 million from 1998, primarily
reflecting declines in realized gains from sales of Brady bonds and
insurance-related investments, partially offset by an increase in venture
capital results and realized investment gains on certain corporate-related
investments.

    Investment Activities results may fluctuate in the future as a result of
market and asset-specific factors. This statement is a forward-looking statement

(2) Excludes restructuring-related items and merger-related costs.

    Corporate/Other includes net corporate treasury results, corporate staff and
other corporate expenses, certain intersegment eliminations, and the remainder
of Internet-related development activities (e-Citi) not allocated to the
individual businesses.

    Revenues in 2000 and 1999 included higher treasury costs as well as the
impact of intersegment eliminations and in 1998, income from the disposition of
a real estate development property. Expenses in 2000 include a $108 million
pretax expense for the contribution of appreciated venture capital securities to
Citigroup's Foundation, which had minimal impact on Citigroup's earnings after
related tax benefits and investment gains, and increases in certain unallocated
corporate costs offset by decreases in performance-based option expense,
technology costs and intersegment eliminations. Expenses in 1999 included
certain technology costs associated with year 2000 remediation, partially offset
by decreases in corporate staff expenses as a result of headcount reductions in
1999. Expenses in 1998 included a $100 million contribution of appreciated
venture capital securities to the Company's Foundation, which had minimal impact
on Citigroup's earnings after related tax benefits and investment gains. 1999
and 1998 expenses included $108 million and $70 million, respectively,
associated with performance-based stock options granted in 1998 and prior years.

    The 2000 after-tax restructuring-related items of $55 million consisted of
$21 million in merger-related costs due to the Associates acquisition,
$19 million relating to accelerated depreciation charges and $15 million in net
restructuring charges to streamline corporate functions. The 1999 after-tax
restructuring-related items of $20 million primarily included accelerated
depreciation charges. The 1998 after-tax restructuring-related items included
$42 million to streamline and integrate corporate staff functions, as well as
$65 million of one-time expenses associated with merging Citigroup's predecessor
organizations. See Note 15 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information on restructuring-related items and merger-related costs.

                              MANAGING GLOBAL RISK

    The Citigroup Risk Management framework recognizes the wide range and
diversity of global business activities by balancing strong corporate oversight
with defined independent risk management functions at the business level.

    The risk management functions at the corporate-level are responsible for
establishing Citigroup risk management standards and ensuring their ongoing
appropriateness, appointing business-specific risk managers, approving
business-specific risk management policies and limits, and reviewing, on an
ongoing basis, major risk exposures and concentrations across the organization.

    The business-specific risk managers are responsible for establishing and
implementing risk management policies and practices within their business, while
ensuring ongoing consistency with Citigroup standards. The business-specific
risk managers have dual accountability--to the Citigroup Senior Risk Officer and
to the head of their business unit.

    The Citigroup Senior Risk Officer is responsible for reviewing material
corporate-wide risks, and determining appropriate exposure levels and limits.
These risks are regularly reviewed with the business risk managers, the
Citigroup Management Committee, and as necessary, with committees of the Board
of Directors:

    - Risk ratings, including trends in client creditworthiness;

    - Industry concentrations, globally and within regions;

    - Corporate customer credit concentrations and consumer programs;

    - Product concentrations in consumer managed receivables, by product and by
      region;

    - Global real estate exposure, including commercial and consumer portfolios;

    - Country risk, encompassing political and cross-border risk;

    - Counterparty risk, evaluating presettlement risk on foreign exchange,
      derivative products, and securities trades;

                                       60
<PAGE>
    - The estimated effects of sudden and severe external market events;

    - Distribution and underwriting risk, capturing the risk that arises when
      Citigroup commits to purchase an instrument from an issuer for subsequent
      sale;

    - Business process defects identified by Audit and Risk Review;

    - Price risk, evaluating the earnings risk resulting from changing levels
      and implied volatilities of interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and
      commodity and security prices;

    - Liquidity risk, evaluating funding concentrations and diversification
      strategy;

    - Commodities risk, evaluating earnings risk resulting from changing levels
      and volatilities of commodity prices;

    - Life Insurance, evaluating the risks that result from the underwriting,
      sale, and reinsurance of life insurance policies;

    - Property & Casualty, evaluating the risks that result from the
      underwriting, sale, and reinsurance of commercial, personal, and
      performance bonds insurance policies;

    - Equity and subordinated debt investment risk;

    - Margin lending risk;

    - Legal risk, reviewing the business implications of legal issues; and

    - Technology risk, assessing vulnerability to the business processing
      environment.

    The following sections summarize the processes for managing credit and
market risks within Citigroup's major businesses, and reflect the successful
ongoing integration of businesses and risk management practices.

THE CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

    The credit risk management process at Citigroup relies on corporate-wide
standards to ensure consistency and integrity, with business-specific policies
and practices to ensure applicability and ownership.

    Within the Global Corporate and Investment Bank (GCIB), the credit process
is grounded in a series of fundamental policies, including:

    - Business accountability for credit risks taken;

    - Single center of control for each credit relationship;

    - Approval authority standards;

    - Approval requirements from the business and from independent credit risk
      management;

    - Uniform risk measurement standards, including risk ratings;

    - Portfolio management tools, including obligor and other limits.

    These policies apply universally across the Global Corporate and Investment
Bank, as well as the Private Bank, and incorporate previous Citibank and Salomon
Smith Barney credit policies. GCIB businesses that require tailored credit
processes, due to unique or unusual risk characteristics in their activities,
may do so under a separately approved Credit Program. A Credit Program must be
sponsored by a business, and must be approved by independent credit risk
management. In all cases, the GCIB Policies must be adhered to, or specific
exceptions must be granted by independent credit risk management.

                                       61
<PAGE>
    Within the Global Consumer Group (GCG), business-specific credit risk
policies and procedures are derived from the following risk management
framework:

    - Each business must develop a plan, including risk/return tradeoffs, as
      well as risk acceptance criteria and policies appropriate to their
      activities;

    - Senior Business Managers are responsible for managing risk/return
      tradeoffs in their business;

    - Senior Business Managers, in conjunction with Senior Credit Officers,
      implement business-specific risk management policies and practices;

    - Approval policies for a product or business are tailored to audit ratings,
      profitability and credit risk management performance;

    - Independent credit risk management is responsible for establishing the GCG
      Policy, approving business-specific policies and procedures, monitoring
      business risk management performance, providing ongoing assessment of
      portfolio credit risks, and approving new products and new risks.

    In the course of its insurance activities, TPC reinsures a portion of the
risks it underwrites in an effort to control its exposure to losses, stabilize
earnings and protect capital resources. TPC cedes to reinsurers a portion of
these risks and pays premiums based upon the risk and exposure of the policies
subject to such reinsurance. Reinsurance involves credit risk and is subject to
aggregate loss limits. Although the reinsurer is liable to TPC generally to the
extent of the reinsurance ceded, TPC remains primarily liable as the direct
insurer on all risks reinsured. TPC also holds collateral, including escrow
funds and letters of credit, under certain reinsurance agreements. TPC monitors
the financial condition of reinsurers on an ongoing basis, and reviews its
reinsurance arrangements periodically. Reinsurers are selected based on their
financial condition, business practices and the price of their product
offerings. For additional information concerning reinsurance, see Note 14 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

THE MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

    Market risk encompasses liquidity risk and price risk, both of which arise
in the normal course of business of a global financial intermediary. Liquidity
risk is the risk that some entity, in some location and in some currency, may be
unable to meet a financial commitment to a customer, creditor, or investor when
due. Liquidity Risk is discussed in greater detail in the Liquidity and Capital
Resources section.

    Market risk at Citigroup--like credit risk--is managed through
corporate-wide standards and business-specific policies and procedures. Each
business is required to establish a market risk limit framework, including
standardized risk measures, limits and controls, and independent reporting and
monitoring functions. In all cases, the businesses are ultimately responsible
for the market risks that they take, and for remaining within their defined
limit frameworks. Independent market risk management establishes policies and
procedures, approves limits, and monitors exposures against limits.

    Price risk is the risk to earnings that arises from changes in interest
rates, foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, and in their implied
volatilities. Price risk arises in Non-Trading Portfolios, as well as in Trading
Portfolios.

NON-TRADING PORTFOLIOS

    Price risk in non-trading portfolios is measured predominantly through
Earnings-at-Risk and Factor Sensitivity techniques. These measurement techniques
are supplemented with additional tools, including stress testing and
cost-to-close analysis.

                                       62

    Business units manage the potential earnings effect of interest rate
movements by managing the asset and liability mix, either directly or through
the use of derivative financial products. These include interest rate swaps and
other derivative instruments which are either designated and effective as hedges
or designated and effective in modifying the interest rate characteristics of
specified assets or liabilities. The utilization of derivatives is managed in
response to changing market conditions as well as to changes in the
characteristics and mix of the related assets and liabilities. Additional
information about non-trading derivatives is located in Note 23 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. Citigroup does not utilize instruments with
leverage features in connection with its non-trading risk management activities.

    Earnings-at-Risk is the primary method for measuring price risk in
Citigroup's non-trading portfolios (excluding the Travelers Insurance
Companies). Earnings-at-Risk measures the pretax earnings impact of a specified
upward and downward shift in the yield curve for the appropriate currency. The
Earnings-at-Risk is calculated separately for each currency and reflects the
repricing gaps in the position as well as option positions, both explicit and
embedded. U.S. dollar exposures are calculated by multiplying the gap between
interest sensitive items, including assets, liabilities, derivative instruments
and other off-balance sheet instruments, by 100 basis points. Non-U.S. dollar
exposures are calculated utilizing the statistical equivalent of a 100 basis
point change in interest rates and assumes no correlation between exposures in
different currencies.

    Citigroup's primary non-trading price risk exposure is to movements in U.S.
dollar interest rates. Citigroup also has Earnings-at-Risk in various other
currencies; however, there are no significant risk concentrations in any
individual non-U.S. dollar currency.

    The following table illustrates the impact to Citigroup pretax earnings from
a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the U.S. dollar yield curve. As of
December 31, 2000, pre-tax earnings would have a potential negative impact of
$243 million from an interest rate increase and a potential positive impact of
$270 million over the next 12 months from an interest rate decrease. This level
of 12 month Earnings-at-Risk equates to less than 1.5% of Citigroup pre-tax
earnings in 2000. The potential impact on pre-tax earnings for periods beyond
the first 12 months is an increase of $778 million from an increase in interest
rates and a decrease of $883 million from a decline in interest rates. The
change in Earnings-at-Risk from the prior year reflects the growth in
Citigroup's fixed funding as well as the reduction in the use of derivatives in
managing our risk portfolio.

    The statistical equivalent of a 100 basis points increase in non-U.S. dollar
interest rates would have a potential negative impact on Citigroup's pretax
earnings of approximately $187 million for 2001 and $98 million for the years
thereafter. The statistical equivalent of a 100 basis points decrease in
non-U.S. dollar interest rates would have a potential positive impact on
Citigroup's pretax earnings of approximately $189 million for 2001 and
$115 million for the years thereafter. The lower sensitivity to rising rates in
the non-U.S. dollar Earnings-at-Risk from the prior year primarily reflects the
lower interest rate volatility seen across the Asia Pacific region.

    A significant portion of Travelers Insurance Companies liabilities, (e.g.,
insurance policy and claims reserves) are not financial instruments and are
excluded from the above sensitivity analysis. Corresponding changes in fair
value of these accounts, based on the present value of estimated cash flows,
would materially mitigate the impact of the net decrease in values implied
above. The analysis also excludes all financial instruments, including long-term

comparable to the Earnings-at-Risk used for the Citigroup non-trading portfolios
or the Value-at-Risk used for the trading portfolios, described below.

TRADING PORTFOLIOS

    Price risk in trading portfolios is measured through a complementary set of
tools, including Factor Sensitivities, Value-at-Risk, and Stress Testing. Each
trading portfolio has its own market risk limit framework, encompassing these
measures and other controls, including permitted product lists and a new,
complex product approval process, established by the business, and approved by
independent market risk management.

    Factor Sensitivities are defined as the change in the value of a position
for a defined change in a market risk factor (e.g., the change in the value of a
Treasury bill for a 1 basis point change in interest rates). It is the
responsibility of independent market risk management to ensure that factor
sensitivities are calculated, monitored and, in some cases, limited, for all
relevant risks taken in a trading portfolio. Value-at-Risk estimates the
potential decline in the value of a position or a portfolio, under normal market
conditions, over a one-day holding period, at a 99% confidence level. The
Value-at-Risk method incorporates the Factor Sensitivities of the trading
portfolio with the volatilities and correlations of those factors.

    Stress Testing is performed on trading portfolios on a regular basis, to
estimate the impact of extreme market movements. Stress Testing is performed on
individual trading portfolios, as well as on aggregations of portfolios and
businesses, as appropriate. It is the responsibility of independent market risk
management, in conjunction with the businesses, to develop stress scenarios,
review the output of periodic stress testing exercises, and utilize the
information to make judgments as to the ongoing appropriateness of exposure
levels and limits..

    New and/or complex products in trading portfolios are required to be
reviewed and approved by the GCIB Capital Markets Approval Committee (CMAC). The
CMAC is responsible for ensuring that all relevant risks are identified and
understood, and can be measured, managed and reported in accordance with
applicable GCIB policies and practices. The CMAC is made up of senior
representatives from market and credit risk management, legal, accounting,
operations and other support areas, as required.

    The level of price risk exposure at any given point in time depends on the
market environment and expectations of future price and market movements, and
will vary from period to period.

    For Citicorp's major trading centers, the aggregate pretax Value-at-Risk in
the trading portfolios was $29 million at December 31, 2000. Daily exposures at
Citicorp averaged $24 million in 2000 and ranged from $16 million to
$36 million. At Salomon Smith Barney the aggregate pretax Value-at-Risk in the
trading portfolios was $35 million at December 31, 2000. Quarterly exposures at
Salomon Smith Barney averaged $28 million in 2000 and ranged from $20 million to
$37 million.

    The following table summarizes Value-at-Risk in the trading portfolios as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, along with the averages.

MANAGEMENT OF CROSS-BORDER RISK

    Cross-border risk is the risk that Citigroup will be unable to obtain
payment from customers on their contractual obligations as a result of actions
taken by foreign governments such as exchange controls, debt moratoria, and
restrictions on the remittance of funds. Citigroup manages cross-border risk as
part of the risk management framework described on pages 60 and 61.

    Except as described below for cross-border resale agreements and the netting
of certain long and short securities positions, the following table presents
total cross-border outstandings and commitments on a regulatory basis in
accordance with Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ("FFIEC")
guidelines. In regulatory reports under FFIEC guidelines, cross-border resale
agreements are presented based on the domicile of the issuer of the securities
that are held as collateral. However, for purposes of the following table,
cross-border resale agreements are presented based on the domicile of the
counterparty because the counterparty has the legal obligation for repayment.
Similarly, under FFIEC guidelines, long securities positions are required to be
reported on a gross basis. However, for purposes of the following table, certain
long and short securities positions are presented on a net basis consistent with
internal cross-border risk management policies, reflecting a reduction of risk
from offsetting positions.

    During 2000, the FFIEC revised their cross-border reporting guidelines to
allow credit derivative contracts containing cross-border provisions to be
treated as effective guarantees. Purchased credit derivative contracts where
Citigroup is the beneficiary shift the underlying exposure to the guarantor
country. Written credit derivative contracts where Citigroup provides an
effective guarantee are included as cross-border commitments in the country of
the underlying credit exposure. Total cross-border outstandings and commitments
at December 31, 1999 and 1998 have not been restated to reflect this revised
FFIEC policy.

                        LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    Citigroup services its obligations primarily with dividends and advances
that it receives from subsidiaries. The subsidiaries' dividend paying abilities
are limited by certain covenant restrictions in credit agreements and/or by
regulatory requirements. Citigroup believes it will have sufficient funds to
meet current and future commitments. Each of Citigroup's major operating
subsidiaries finances its operations on a basis consistent with its
capitalization and ratings.

<PAGE>
    Citigroup, Citicorp, Associates and certain of its affiliated companies, TPC
and The Travelers Insurance Company (TIC) issue commercial paper directly to
investors. Citigroup and Citicorp, both of which are bank holding companies,
maintain combined liquidity reserves of cash, securities, and unused bank lines
of credit at least equal to their combined outstanding commercial paper. All of
the commercial paper issued by Associates and its affiliates is guaranteed by
Citicorp, and Associates maintains unutilized credit facilities, all guaranteed
by Citicorp, in support of approximately 75% of its commercial paper. TPC and
TIC each maintains unused credit availability under their respective bank lines
of credit at least equal to the amount of outstanding commercial paper.

    Borrowings under bank lines of credit may be at interest rates based on
LIBOR, CD rates, the prime rate, or bids submitted by the banks. Each company
pays its banks commitment fees for its lines of credit.

    Citicorp, Salomon Smith Barney, and some of their nonbank subsidiaries have
credit facilities with Citicorp's subsidiary banks, including Citibank, N.A.
Borrowings under these facilities must be secured in accordance with
Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.

CITIGROUP INC. (CITIGROUP)

    Citigroup and TIC have a five-year revolving credit facility in the amount
of $1.0 billion with a syndicate of banks that expires in June 2001 and can be
allocated to either of Citigroup or TIC. The participation of TIC in this
agreement is limited to $250 million. At December 31, 2000, all of the facility
was allocated to Citigroup. Under this facility, Citigroup is required to
maintain a certain level of consolidated stockholders' equity (as defined in the
agreement). Citigroup exceeded this requirement by approximately $44 billion at
December 31, 2000. At December 31, 2000, there were no borrowings outstanding
under this facility.

    Citigroup is subject to risk-based capital guidelines issued by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). These guidelines are used to
evaluate capital adequacy based primarily on the perceived credit risk
associated with balance sheet assets, as well as certain off-balance sheet
exposures such as unused loan commitments, letters of credit, and derivative and
foreign exchange contracts. The risk-based capital guidelines are supplemented
by a leverage ratio requirement.

(1) Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average assets.

    Citigroup maintained a strong capital position during 2000. Total capital
(Tier 1 and Tier 2) amounted to $73.0 billion at December 31, 2000, representing
11.23% of net risk-adjusted assets. This compares to $65.9 billion and 11.32% at
December 31, 1999. Tier 1 capital of $54.5 billion at December 31, 2000
represented 8.38% of net risk-adjusted assets, compared to $51.6 billion and
8.87% at December 31, 1999. Citigroup's leverage ratio was 5.97% at
December 31, 2000 compared to 6.61% at December 31, 1999. The decrease in the
regulatory capital ratios during the year reflects the growth in risk-adjusted
and average assets during 2000. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial

(1) The decrease is primarily related to the purchase of all of the outstanding
    shares of common stock of TPC not previously owned.

(2) Tier 1 capital excludes unrealized gains and losses on debt securities
    available for sale in accordance with regulatory risk-based capital
    guidelines. The federal bank regulatory agencies permit institutions to
    include in Tier 2 capital up to 45% of pretax net unrealized holding gains
    on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair
    values. Institutions are required to deduct from Tier 1 capital net
    unrealized holding losses on available-for-sale equity securities with
    readily determinable fair values, net of tax.

(3) The increase in goodwill and other intangibles was attributable to the
    acquisitions completed during the year, including TPC's minority interest,
    Schroders, Handlowy, Reliance, Copelco, and Siembra.

(4) Represents investment in certain overseas insurance activities and
    unconsolidated banking and finance subsidiaries.

(5) Includable up to 1.25% of risk-adjusted assets. Any excess allowance is
    deducted from risk-adjusted assets.

(6) Includes qualifying senior and subordinated debt in an amount not exceeding
    50% of Tier 1 capital, and subordinated capital notes subject to certain
    limitations. The net increase in qualifying

                                       69
<PAGE>
    debt during 2000 includes $4.25 billion of Citigroup subordinated debt,
    offset by net redemptions of subsidiary-obligated debt.

(7) Includes risk-weighted credit equivalent amounts, net of applicable
    bilateral netting agreements, of $27.7 billion for interest rate, commodity
    and equity derivative contracts and foreign exchange contracts, as of
    December 31, 2000, compared to $32.9 billion as of December 31, 1999. Market
    risk-equivalent assets included in net risk-adjusted assets amounted to
    $39.6 billion and $43.1 billion at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
    Net risk-adjusted assets also includes the effect of other off-balance sheet
    exposures such as unused loan commitments and letters of credit and reflects
    deductions for intangible assets and any excess allowance for credit losses.

    Common stockholders' equity increased a net $8.1 billion during the year to
$64.5 billion at December 31, 2000, representing 7.14% of assets, compared to
$56.4 billion and 7.09% at year-end 1999. The increase in common stockholders'
equity during the year principally reflected net income of $13.5 billion and
$1.4 billion related to the issuance of shares pursuant to employee benefit
plans, change in unrealized gains on investment securities and other activity,
partially offset by treasury stock acquired of $4.1 billion and dividends
declared on common and preferred stock of $2.7 billion. The increase in the
common stockholders' equity ratio during the year reflected the above items,
which was partially offset by the increase in total assets.

    During the 2000 third quarter, the Board of Directors approved an additional
$5 billion in the existing authority for the periodic repurchase of Citigroup
common stock. During the 2000 first quarter, Citigroup redeemed its Series T
perpetual preferred stock for $150 million.

    All of the mandatorily redeemable securities of subsidiary trusts (trust
securities) outstanding at December 31, 2000 and 1999 qualify as Tier 1 capital.
The amount outstanding for both periods includes $2.3 billion of
parent-obligated securities and $2.62 billion of subsidiary-obligated
securities.

    Citigroup's subsidiary depository institutions are subject to the risk-based
capital guidelines issued by their respective primary federal bank regulatory
agencies, which are generally similar to the FRB's guidelines. At December 31,
2000, all of Citigroup's subsidiary depository institutions were "well
capitalized" under the federal bank regulatory agencies' definitions.

    On January 18, 2001, the FRB issued new proposed rules that would govern the
regulatory treatment of merchant banking investments and certain similar equity
investments, including investments made by venture capital subsidiaries, in
nonfinancial companies held by bank holding companies. The new proposal
generally would impose a capital charge that would increase in steps as the
banking organization's level of concentration in equity investments increased.
An 8 percent Tier 1 capital deduction would apply on covered investments that in
the aggregate represent up to 15 percent of an organization's Tier 1 capital.
For covered investments that aggregate more than 25 percent of the
organization's Tier 1 capital, a top marginal charge of 25 percent would be set.
The Company is monitoring the status and progress of the proposed rule, which,
at the present time, is not expected to have a significant impact on Citigroup.

    On January 16, 2001, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Committee)
released the second consultative package on the new Basel Capital Accord (new
Accord). The proposal modifies and substantially expands a proposal issued for
comment by the Committee in June 1999 and describes the methods by which banks
can determine their minimum regulatory capital requirements. The new Accord,
which will apply to all "significant" banks, as well as to holding companies
that are parents of banking groups, is intended to be finalized by year-end
2001, with implementation of the new framework beginning in 2004. The Company is
monitoring the status and progress of the proposed rule.

    Additionally, from time to time, the FRB and the FFIEC propose amendments
to, and issue interpretations of, risk-based capital guidelines and reporting
instructions. Such proposals or interpretations could, if implemented in the
future, affect reported capital ratios and net risk-adjusted

                                       70

assets. This paragraph and the preceding two paragraphs contain forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.
See "Forward-Looking Statements" on page 59.

CITICORP

    Management of liquidity at Citicorp is the responsibility of the Corporate
Treasurer. The Country Corporate Officer and the Country Treasurer ensure that
all funding obligations in each country are met when due. The Country Treasurer
is appointed by the Corporate Treasurer.

    The in-country forum for liquidity issues is the Asset/Liability Management
Committee (ALCO), which includes senior executives within each country. The ALCO
reviews the current and prospective funding requirements for all businesses and
legal entities within the country, as well as the capital position and balance
sheet. All businesses within the country are represented on the committee with
the focal point being the Country Treasurer.

    Each Country Treasurer must prepare a liquidity plan at least annually that
is approved by the Country Corporate Officer, the Regional Treasurer, and the
Corporate Treasurer. The liquidity profile is monitored on an on-going basis and
reported monthly. Limits are established on the extent to which businesses in a
country can take liquidity risk. The size of the limit depends on the depth of
the market, experience level of local management, the stability of the
liabilities, and liquidity of the assets.

    Regional Treasurers generally have responsibility for monitoring liquidity
risk across a number of countries within a defined geography. They are also
available for consultation and special approvals, especially in unusual or
volatile market conditions.

    Citicorp's assets and liabilities are diversified across many currencies,
geographic areas, and businesses. Particular attention is paid to those
businesses which for tax, sovereign risk, or regulatory reasons cannot be freely
and readily funded in the international markets.

    A diversity of funding sources, currencies, and maturities is used to gain a
broad access to the investor base. Citicorp's deposits, which represent 55% of
total funding at both December 31, 2000 and 1999 are broadly diversified by both
geography and customer segments.

    Stockholder's equity, which grew $12.4 billion during the year to
$47.9 billion at year-end 2000, continues to be an important component of the
overall funding structure. In addition, long-term debt is issued by Citicorp and
its subsidiaries. Total Citicorp long-term debt outstanding at year-end 2000 was
$80.3 billion, compared with $67.8 billion at year-end 1999.

    Asset securitization programs remain an important source of liquidity. Loans
securitized during 2000 included $9.1 billion of U.S. credit cards and
$12.0 billion of U.S. consumer mortgages. As credit card securitization
transactions amortize, newly originated receivables are recorded on Citicorp's
balance sheet and become available for asset securitization. In 2000, the
scheduled amortization of certain credit card securitization transactions made
available $7.4 billion of new receivables. In addition, at least $13.1 billion
of credit card securitization transactions are scheduled to amortize during
2001.

    Citicorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from Citibank, N.A. and its
other subsidiaries and affiliates. There are various legal limitations on the
extent to which Citicorp's banking subsidiaries may extend credit, pay dividends
or otherwise supply funds to Citicorp. The approval of the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency is required if total dividends declared by a
national bank in any calendar year exceed net profits (as defined) for that year
combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years. In addition,
dividends for such a bank may not be paid in excess of the bank's undivided
profits. State-chartered bank subsidiaries are subject to dividend limitations
imposed by applicable state law.

                                       71
<PAGE>
    Citicorp's national and state-chartered bank subsidiaries can declare
dividends to their respective parent companies in 2001, without regulatory
approval, of approximately $7.2 billion, adjusted by the effect of their net
income (loss) for 2001 up to the date of any such dividend declaration. In
determining whether and to what extent to pay dividends, each bank subsidiary
must also consider the effect of dividend payments on applicable risk-based
capital and leverage ratio requirements as well as policy statements of the
federal regulatory agencies that indicate that banking organizations should
generally pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Consistent with these
considerations, Citicorp estimates that its bank subsidiaries can distribute
dividends to Citicorp, directly or through their parent holding company, of
approximately $6.4 billion of the available $7.2 billion, adjusted by the effect
of their net income (loss) up to the date of any such dividend declaration.

    Citicorp also receives dividends from its nonbank subsidiaries. These
nonbank subsidiaries are generally not subject to regulatory restrictions on
their payment of dividends except that the approval of the Office of Thrift
Supervision (OTS) may be required if total dividends declared by a savings
association in any calendar year exceed amounts specified by that agency's
regulations.

    Citicorp is subject to risk-based capital and leverage guidelines issued by
the FRB.

ASSOCIATES FIRST CAPITAL CORPORATION (ASSOCIATES)

    Associates maintains a combination of unutilized bilateral and syndicated
credit facilities to support its short-term borrowings. These facilities, which
have maturities ranging from 2001 through 2005, provide a means of managing
liquidity and ensure that funds are always available to satisfy maturing
short-term obligations. At December 31, 2000, these facilities provided coverage
of approximately 75% of Associates' commercial paper borrowings and utilized
uncommitted lines of credit. In connection with Citigroup's November 30, 2000
acquisition of Associates in which Associates became a wholly owned subsidiary
of Citicorp, Citicorp guaranteed various debt obligations of Associates,

arising under these facilities. Under these facilities, Citicorp is required to
maintain a certain level of consolidated stockholder's equity (as defined in the
agreement). At December 31, 2000, this requirement was exceeded by approximately
$32.6 billion. At December 31, 2000, there were no borrowings outstanding under
these facilities.

TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. (TPC)

with a syndicate of banks that expires in December 2001. Under this facility TPC
is required to maintain a certain level of consolidated stockholders' equity (as
defined in the agreement). At December 31, 2000, this requirement was exceeded
by approximately $5.6 billion. At December 31, 2000, there were no borrowings
outstanding under this facility.

    TPC's insurance subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory restrictions
that limit the maximum amount of dividends available to be paid to their parent
without prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities. A maximum of
$1.2 billion is available by the end of the year 2001 for such dividends without
prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Department.

SALOMON SMITH BARNEY HOLDINGS INC. (SALOMON SMITH BARNEY)

    Salomon Smith Barney's total assets were $238 billion at December 31,2000,
compared to $221 billion at year-end 1999. Due to the nature of Salomon Smith
Barney's trading activities it is not uncommon for asset levels to fluctuate
from period to period. At December 31, 2000, approximately 39% of these assets
represent trading securities, commodities, and derivatives used for proprietary
trading and to facilitate customer transactions, and approximately 43% of these
assets were related to collateralized financing transactions where securities
are bought, borrowed, sold, and lent in generally offsetting amounts. A
significant portion of the remainder of the assets represented receivables from
brokers, dealers, clearing organizations, and customers that relate to
securities transactions in the process of being settled. The carrying values of
the majority of Salomon Smith Barney's securities inventories are adjusted daily
to reflect current prices. See Notes 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 23 of Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for a further description of these assets.

    Salomon Smith Barney's assets are financed through a number of sources
including long and short-term unsecured borrowings, the financing transactions
described above, and payables to brokers, dealers, and customers. The highly
liquid nature of these assets provides Salomon Smith Barney with flexibility in
financing and managing its business. Salomon Smith Barney monitors and evaluates
the adequacy of its capital and borrowing base on a daily basis in order to
allow for flexibility in its funding, to maintain liquidity, and to ensure that
its capital base supports the regulatory capital requirements of its
subsidiaries.

    Salomon Smith Barney funds its operations through the use of secured and
unsecured short-term borrowings, long-term borrowings and
TruPS.-Registered Trademark- Secured short-term financing, including repurchase
agreements and secured loans, is Salomon Smith Barney's principal funding
source. Unsecured short-term borrowings provide a source of short-term liquidity
and are also utilized as an alternative to secured financing when they represent
a cheaper funding source. Sources of short-term unsecured borrowings include
commercial paper, unsecured bank borrowings and letters of credit, deposit
liabilities, promissory notes, and corporate loans.

    Salomon Smith Barney has a $5.0 billion 364-day committed uncollateralized
revolving line of credit that extends through May 2001. Salomon Smith Barney may
borrow under this revolving credit facility at various interest rate options
(LIBOR, CD, or base rate) and compensates the banks for this facility through
commitment fees. Under this facility Salomon Smith Barney is required to
maintain a certain level of consolidated adjusted net worth (as defined in the
agreement). At December 31, 2000, this requirement was exceeded by approximately
$4.3 billion. At December 31, 2000, there were no

                                       73
<PAGE>
borrowings outstanding under this facility. Salomon Smith Barney also has
substantial borrowing arrangements consisting of facilities that it has been
advised are available, but where no contractual lending obligation exists. These
arrangements are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure flexibility in meeting
short-term requirements.

    Unsecured term debt is a significant component of Salomon Smith Barney's
long-term capital. Long-term debt totaled $19.7 billion at December 31, 2000 and
$18.0 billion at December 31,1999. Salomon Smith Barney utilizes interest rate
swaps to convert the majority of its fixed rate long-term debt used to fund
inventory-related working capital requirements into variable rate obligations.
Long-term debt issuances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar
that are not used to finance assets in the same currency are effectively
converted to U.S. dollar obligations through the use of cross-currency swaps and
forward currency contracts.

    Salomon Smith Barney's borrowing relationships are with a broad range of
banks, financial institutions and other firms from which it draws funds. The
volume of borrowings generally fluctuates in response to changes in the level of
financial instruments, commodities and contractual commitments, customer
balances, the amount of reverse repurchase transactions outstanding, and
securities borrowed transactions. As Salomon Smith Barney's activities increase,
borrowings generally increase to fund the additional activities. Availability of
financing can vary depending upon market conditions, credit ratings, and the
overall availability of credit to the securities industry. Salomon Smith Barney
seeks to expand and diversify its funding mix as well as its creditor sources.
Concentration levels for these sources, particularly for short-term lenders, are
closely monitored both in terms of single investor limits and daily maturities.

    Salomon Smith Barney monitors liquidity by tracking asset levels, collateral
and funding availability to maintain flexibility to meet its financial
commitments. As a policy, Salomon Smith Barney attempts to maintain sufficient
capital and funding sources in order to have the capacity to finance itself on a
fully collateralized basis in the event that access to unsecured financing was
temporarily impaired. Salomon Smith Barney's liquidity management process
includes a contingency funding plan designed to ensure adequate liquidity even
if access to unsecured funding sources is severely restricted or unavailable.
This plan is reviewed periodically to keep the funding options current and in
line with market conditions. The management of this plan includes an analysis
that is utilized to determine the ability to withstand varying levels of stress,
which could impact Salomon Smith Barney's liquidation horizons and required
margins. In addition, Salomon Smith Barney monitors its leverage and capital
ratios on a daily basis.

THE TRAVELERS INSURANCE COMPANY (TIC)

    At December 31, 2000, TIC had $29.7 billion of life and annuity product
deposit funds and reserves. Of that total, $16.4 billion is not subject to
discretionary withdrawal based on contract terms. The remaining $13.3 billion is
for life and annuity products that are subject to discretionary withdrawal by
the contractholder. Included in the amount that is subject to discretionary
withdrawal are $2.9 billion of liabilities that are surrenderable with market
value adjustments. Also included are an additional $4.9 billion of the life
insurance and individual annuity liabilities which are subject to discretionary
withdrawals, and have an average surrender charge of 4.5%. In the payout phase,
these funds are credited at significantly reduced interest rates. The remaining
$5.5 billion of liabilities are surrenderable without charge. More than 12.7% of
these relate to individual life products. These risks would have to be
underwritten again if transferred to another carrier, which is considered a
significant deterrent against withdrawal by long-term policyholders. Insurance
liabilities that are surrendered or withdrawn are reduced by outstanding policy
loans, and related accrued interest prior to payout.

    Scheduled maturities of guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) in 2001,
2002, 2003, 2004, and thereafter are $3.607 billion, $944 million,
$809 million, $787 million, and $2.662 billion, respectively. At December 31,
2000, the interest rates credited on GICs had a weighted average rate of 6.75%.

    TIC is subject to various regulatory restrictions that limit the maximum
amount of dividends available to its parent without prior approval of the
Connecticut Insurance Department. A maximum of $984 million of statutory surplus
is available by the end of the year 2001 for such dividends without the prior
approval of the Connecticut Insurance Department.

INSURANCE INDUSTRY-RISK BASED CAPITAL

    The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) adopted
risk-based capital (RBC) requirements for life insurance companies and for
property and casualty insurance companies. The RBC requirements are to be used
as minimum capital requirements by the NAIC and states to identify companies
that merit further regulatory action. The formulas have not been designed to
differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with levels of
capital higher than RBC requirements. Therefore, it is inappropriate and
ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank such companies. At
December 31, 2000 and 1999, all of the Company's life and property & casualty
companies had adjusted capital in excess of amounts requiring any regulatory
action.

                              REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

    The management of Citigroup is responsible for the preparation and fair
presentation of the financial statements and other financial information
contained in this annual report. The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles appropriate
in the circumstances. Where amounts must be based on estimates and judgments,
they represent the best estimates and judgments of management. The financial
information appearing throughout this annual report is consistent with that in
the financial statements.

    The management of Citigroup is also responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting. Management establishes an environment
that fosters strong controls, and it designs business processes to identify and
respond to risk. Management maintains a comprehensive system of controls
intended to ensure that transactions are executed in accordance with
management's authorization, assets are safeguarded, and financial records are
reliable. Management also takes steps to see that information and communication
flows are effective and to monitor performance, including performance of
internal control procedures.

    Citigroup's accounting policies and internal control are under the general
oversight of the Board of Directors, acting through the Audit Committee of the
Board. The Committee is composed entirely of directors who are not officers or
employees of Citigroup. The Committee reviews reports by internal audit covering
its extensive program of audit and risk reviews worldwide. In addition, KPMG
LLP, independent auditors, are engaged to audit Citigroup's financial
statements.

    KPMG LLP obtains and maintains an understanding of Citigroup's internal
control and procedures for financial reporting and conducts such tests and other
auditing procedures as it considers necessary in the circumstances to express
the opinion in its report that follows. KPMG LLP has full access to the Audit
Committee, with no members of management present, to discuss its audit and its
findings as to the integrity of Citigroup's financial reporting and the
effectiveness of internal control.

    Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the
effectiveness of any system of internal control, and accordingly, even effective
internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation. However, management believes that Citigroup maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2000.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Citigroup Inc.:

    We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial
position of Citigroup Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999,
and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2000. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Citigroup Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

    As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 1999 the
Company changed its methods of accounting for insurance-related assessments,
accounting for insurance and reinsurance contracts that do not transfer
insurance risk, and accounting for the costs of start-up activities.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION.  The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Citigroup and its subsidiaries (the Company). Twenty-to-fifty
percent-owned affiliates, other than investments of designated venture capital
subsidiaries, are accounted for under the equity method, and the pro rata share
of their income (loss) is included in other income. Income from investments in
less than twenty percent-owned companies is generally recognized when dividends
are received. Gains and losses on disposition of branches, subsidiaries,
affiliates, and other investments and charges for management's estimate of
impairment in their value that is other than temporary, such that recovery of
the carrying amount is deemed unlikely, are included in other income. Goodwill
and other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives,
subject to periodic review for impairment that is other than temporary. If it is
determined that enterprise level goodwill is unlikely to be recovered,
impairment is measured on a discounted cash flow basis. The Company recognizes a
gain or loss in the consolidated statement of income when a subsidiary issues
its own stock to a third party at a price higher or lower than the Company's
proportionate carrying amount.

    FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  Assets and liabilities denominated in
non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated into U.S. dollar equivalents using
year-end spot foreign exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated
monthly at amounts which approximate weighted average exchange rates, with
resulting gains and losses included in income. The effects of translating
operations with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are included in
stockholders' equity along with related hedge and tax effects. The effects of
translating operations with the U.S. dollar as the functional currency,
including those in highly inflationary environments, are included in other
income along with related hedge effects. Hedges of foreign currency exposures
include forward currency contracts and designated issues of non-U.S. dollar
debt.

    RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.  The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

    CASH FLOWS.  Cash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in cash
and due from banks. Cash flows from risk management activities are classified in
the same category as the related assets and liabilities.

    INVESTMENTS include fixed maturity and equity securities. Fixed maturities
includes bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stocks, as well as certain
loan-backed and structured securities subject to prepayment risk. Equity
securities include common and non-redeemable preferred stocks. Fixed maturities
classified as "held to maturity" represent securities that the Company has both
the ability and the intent to hold until maturity and are carried at amortized
cost. Fixed maturity securities classified as "available for sale" and
marketable equity securities are carried at fair values, based primarily on
quoted market prices or if quoted market prices are not available, discounted
expected cash flows using market rates commensurate with the credit quality and
maturity of the investment, with unrealized gains and losses and related hedge
effects reported in a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of
applicable income taxes. Declines in fair value that are determined to be other
than temporary are charged to earnings. Accrual of income is suspended on fixed
maturities that are in default, or on which it is likely that future interest
payments will not be made as scheduled.

                                       82

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Fixed maturities subject to prepayment risk are accounted for using the
retrospective method, where the principal amortization and effective yield are
recalculated each period based on actual historical and projected future cash
flows. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are included in
earnings on a specific identified cost basis.

    Citigroup's venture capital subsidiaries include subsidiaries registered as
Small Business Investment Companies and other subsidiaries that engage
exclusively in venture capital activities. Venture capital investments are
carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in other income.
The fair values of publicly-traded securities held by these subsidiaries are
generally based upon quoted market prices. In certain situations, including
thinly-traded securities, large-block holdings, restricted shares or other
special situations, the quoted market price is adjusted to produce an estimate
of the attainable fair value for the securities. For securities held by these
subsidiaries that are not publicly traded, estimates of fair value are made
based upon review of the investee's financial results, condition, and prospects,
together with comparisons to similar companies for which quoted market prices
are available.

    SECURITIES BORROWED AND SECURITIES LOANED are recorded at the amount of cash
advanced or received. With respect to securities loaned, the Company receives
cash collateral in an amount in excess of the market value of securities loaned.
The Company monitors the market value of securities borrowed and loaned on a
daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary.

    REPURCHASE AND RESALE AGREEMENTS are treated as collateralized financing
transactions and are carried at the amounts at which the securities will be
subsequently reacquired or resold, including accrued interest, as specified in
the respective agreements. The Company's policy is to take possession of
securities purchased under agreements to resell. The market value of securities
to be repurchased and resold is monitored, and additional collateral is obtained
where appropriate to protect against credit exposure.

    TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES include securities, commodities and
derivatives and are recorded at either market value or, when market prices are
not readily available, fair value, which is determined under an alternative
approach, such as matrix or model pricing. Obligations to deliver securities
sold but not yet purchased are also valued at market and included in trading
account liabilities. The determination of market or fair value considers various
factors, including: closing exchange or over-the-counter market price
quotations; time value and volatility factors underlying options, warrants and
derivatives; price activity for equivalent or synthetic instruments;
counterparty credit quality; the potential impact on market prices or fair value
of liquidating the Company's positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable
period of time under current market conditions; and derivatives transaction
maintenance costs during that period. Interest expense on trading account
liabilities is reported as a reduction of interest revenues.

    Commodities include physical quantities of commodities involving future
settlement or delivery, and related gains or losses are reported as principal
transactions.

    Derivatives used for trading purposes include interest rate, currency,
equity, credit, and commodity swap agreements, options, caps and floors,
warrants, and financial and commodity futures and forward contracts. The fair
values (unrealized gains and losses) associated with derivatives are reported
net by counterparty, provided a legally enforceable master netting agreement
exists, and are netted across products and against cash collateral when such
provisions are stated in the master netting agreement.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Derivatives in a net receivable position, as well as options owned and warrants
held, are reported as trading account assets. Similarly, derivatives in a net
payable position, as well as options written and warrants issued, are reported
as trading account liabilities. Revenues generated from derivative instruments
used for trading purposes are reported as principal transactions and include
realized gains and losses as well as unrealized gains and losses resulting from
changes in the market or fair value of such instruments.

    COMMISSIONS, UNDERWRITING AND PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS revenues and related
expenses are recognized in income on a trade date basis.

    CONSUMER LOANS includes loans managed by the Global Consumer business, The
Citigroup Private Bank and Associates. Consumer loans are generally written off
not later than a predetermined number of days past due primarily on a
contractual basis, or earlier in the event of bankruptcy. The number of days is
set at an appropriate level by loan product and by country. The policy for
suspending accruals of interest on consumer loans varies depending on the terms,
security and loan loss experience characteristics of each product, and in
consideration of write-off criteria in place.

    COMMERCIAL LOANS represent loans managed by the Global Corporate and
Investment Bank and Associates. Commercial loans are identified as impaired and
placed on a cash (nonaccrual) basis when it is determined that the payment of
interest or principal is doubtful of collection, or when interest or principal
is past due for 90 days or more, except when the loan is well secured and in the
process of collection. Any interest accrued is reversed and charged against
current earnings, and interest is thereafter included in earnings only to the
extent actually received in cash. When there is doubt regarding the ultimate
collectibility of principal, all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce
the recorded investment in the loan. Impaired commercial loans are written down
to the extent that principal is judged to be uncollectible. Impaired
collateral-dependent loans where repayment is expected to be provided solely by
the underlying collateral and there are no other available and reliable sources
of repayment are written down to the lower of cost or collateral value.
Cash-basis loans are returned to an accrual status when all contractual
principal and interest amounts are reasonably assured of repayment and there is
a sustained period of repayment performance in accordance with the contractual
terms.

    LEASE FINANCING TRANSACTIONS.  Loans include the Company's share of
aggregate rentals on lease financing transactions and residual values net of
related unearned income. Lease financing transactions substantially represent
direct financing leases and also include leveraged leases. Unearned income is
amortized under a method which substantially results in an approximate level
rate of return when related to the unrecovered lease investment. Gains and
losses from sales of residual values of leased equipment are included in other
income.

    SECURITIZATIONS include sales of credit card receivables, mortgages and home
equity loans.

    Revenue on securitized credit card receivables is recorded monthly as earned
over the term of each securitization transaction, which may range up to
12 years. The revolving nature of the receivables sold and the monthly
recognition of revenue result in a pattern of recognition that is similar to the
pattern that would be experienced if the receivables had not been sold.

    Net revenue on securitized credit card receivables is collected over the
life of each sale transaction. The net revenue is based upon the sum of finance
charges and fees received from cardholders and

                                       84

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
interchange revenue earned on cardholder transactions, less the sum of the yield
paid to investors, credit losses, transaction costs, and a contractual servicing
fee, which is also retained by certain Citigroup subsidiaries as servicers.

    The Company retains a seller's interest in the credit card receivables
transferred to the trust, which is not in securitized form. Accordingly, the
seller's interest is carried on a historical cost basis and classified as
consumer loans. Retained interests in securitized mortgage loans are classified
as investments.

    Servicing rights retained in the securitization of mortgage and home equity
loans are measured by allocating the carrying value of the loans between the
assets sold and the interest retained, based on the relative fair value at the
date of the securitization. The fair market values are determined using either
financial models, quoted market prices or sales of similar assets. Gain or loss
on sale is recognized at the time of the securitizations. Mortgage servicing
assets are amortized over the expected life of the loan and are evaluated
periodically for impairment.

    LOANS HELD FOR SALE.  Credit card and other receivables and mortgage loans
originated for sale are classified as loans held for sale, which are accounted
for at the lower of cost or market value in other assets with net credit losses
charged to other income.

    ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES represents management's estimate of probable
losses inherent in the portfolio. This evaluation includes an assessment of the
ability of borrowers with foreign currency obligations to obtain the foreign
exchange necessary for orderly debt servicing. Attribution of the allowance is
made for analytical purposes only, and the entire allowance is available to
absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. Additions to the
allowance are made by means of the provision for credit losses. Credit losses
are deducted from the allowance, and subsequent recoveries are added. Securities
received in exchange for loan claims in debt restructurings are initially
recorded at fair value, with any gain or loss reflected as a recovery or
charge-off to the allowance, and are subsequently accounted for as securities
available for sale.

    Larger-balance, non-homogenous exposures representing significant individual
credit exposures are evaluated based upon the borrower's overall financial
condition, resources, and payment record; the prospects for support from any
financially responsible guarantors; and, if appropriate, the realizable value of
any collateral. The allowance for loan losses attributed to these loans is
established via a process which begins with estimates of probable loss inherent
in the portfolio based upon various statistical analyses. These analyses
consider historical and projected default rates and loss severities; internal
risk ratings; geographic, industry, and other environmental factors; and model
imprecision. Management also considers overall portfolio indicators including
trends in internally risk rated exposures, classified exposures, cash-basis
loans, and historical and forecasted write-offs; a review of industry,
geographic, and portfolio concentrations, including current developments within
those segments; and the current business strategy and credit process including
credit limit setting and compliance, credit approvals, loan underwriting
criteria, and loan workout procedures. Within the allowance for credit losses, a
valuation allowance is maintained for larger-balance, non-homogenous loans that
have been individually determined to be impaired. This estimate considers all
available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected
future cash flows discounted at the loan's contractual effective rate, the
secondary market value of the loan, the fair value of collateral, and
environmental factors.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
    Each portfolio of smaller balance, homogenous loans, including consumer
mortgage, installment, revolving credit and most other consumer loans, is
collectively evaluated for impairment. The allowance for loan losses attributed
to these loans is established via a process which begins with estimates of
probable losses inherent in the portfolio, based upon various statistical
analyses. These include migration analysis, in which historical delinquency and
credit loss experience is applied to the current aging of the portfolio,
together with analyses which reflect current trends and conditions. Management
also considers overall portfolio indicators including historical credit losses,
delinquent, non-performing and classified loans, and trends in volumes and terms
of loans; an evaluation of overall credit quality and the credit process,
including lending policies and procedures; consideration of economic,
geographical, product, and other environmental factors; and model imprecision.

    REPOSSESSED ASSETS.  Upon repossession, loans are adjusted if necessary to
the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral and transferred to
Repossessed Assets, which is reported in other assets net of a valuation
allowance for selling costs and net declines in value as appropriate.

    RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES--DERIVATIVES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS USED
FOR NON-TRADING PURPOSES. The Company manages its exposures to market rate
movements outside of its trading activities by modifying the asset and liability
mix, either directly or through the use of derivative financial products
including interest rate swaps, futures, forwards, and purchased option positions
such as interest rate caps, floors, and collars. These end-user derivative
contracts include qualifying hedges and qualifying positions that modify the
interest rate characteristics of specified financial instruments. Derivative
instruments not qualifying as end-user positions are treated as trading
positions and carried at fair value.

    To qualify as a hedge, the swap, futures, forward, or purchased option
position must be designated as a hedge and be effective in reducing the market
risk of an existing asset, liability, firm commitment, or identified anticipated
transaction which is probable to occur. To qualify as a position modifying the
interest rate characteristics of an instrument, there must be a documented and
approved objective to synthetically alter the market risk characteristics of an
existing asset, liability, firm commitment or identified anticipated transaction
which is probable to occur, and the swap, forward or purchased option position
must be designated as such a position and effective in accomplishing the
underlying objective.

    The foregoing criteria are applied on a decentralized basis, consistent with
the level at which market risk is managed, but are subject to various limits and
controls. The underlying asset, liability, firm commitment or anticipated
transaction may be an individual item or a portfolio of similar items.

    The effectiveness of these contracts is evaluated on an initial and ongoing
basis using quantitative measures of correlation. If a contract is found to be
ineffective, it no longer qualifies as an end-user position and any excess gains
or losses attributable to such ineffectiveness as well as subsequent changes in
fair value are recognized in earnings.

    End-user contracts are primarily employed in association with on-balance
sheet instruments accounted for at amortized cost, including loans, deposits,
and long-term debt, and with credit card and other securitizations. These
qualifying end-user contracts are accounted for consistent with the risk
management strategy as follows. Amounts payable and receivable on interest rate
swaps and options are accrued according to the contractual terms and included
currently in the related revenue and expense category as an element of the yield
on the associated instrument (including the amortization of

                                       86

option premiums). Amounts paid or received over the life of futures contracts
are deferred until the contract is closed; accumulated deferred amounts on
futures contracts and amounts paid or received at settlement of forward
contracts are accounted for as elements of the carrying value of the associated
instrument, affecting the resulting yield.

    End-user contracts related to instruments that are carried at fair value are
also carried at fair value, with amounts payable and receivable accounted for as
an element of the yield on the associated instrument. When related to securities
available for sale, fair value adjustments are reported in stockholders' equity,
net of tax.

    If an end-user derivative contract is terminated, any resulting gain or loss
is deferred and amortized over the original term of the agreement provided that
the effectiveness criteria have been met. If the underlying designated items are
no longer held, or if an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur,
any previously unrecognized gain or loss on the derivative contract is
recognized in earnings and the contract is accounted for at fair value with
subsequent changes recognized in earnings.

    Foreign exchange contracts which qualify under applicable accounting
guidelines as hedges of foreign currency exposures, including net capital
investments outside the U.S., are revalued at the spot rate with any forward
premium or discount recognized over the life of the contract in interest revenue
or interest expense. Gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts which
qualify as a hedge of a firm commitment are deferred and recognized as part of
the measurement of the related transaction, unless deferral of a loss would lead
to recognizing losses on the transaction in later periods.

    In 2001 Citigroup adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities". This new
standard significantly changes the accounting treatment of derivatives and
foreign exchange contracts used for non-trading purposes. See Future Application
of Accounting Standards--Derivatives and hedge accounting section on page 90 for
further explanation.

    INSURANCE PREMIUMS from long-duration contracts, principally life insurance,
are earned when due. Premiums from short-duration insurance contracts are earned
over the related contract period. Short-duration contracts include primarily
property and casualty, including estimated ultimate premiums on retrospectively
rated policies, and credit life and accident and health policies.

    VALUE OF INSURANCE IN FORCE, included in other assets, represents the
actuarially determined present value of anticipated profits to be realized from
life and accident and health business on insurance in force at the date of the
Company's acquisition of its insurance subsidiaries using the same assumptions
that were used for computing related liabilities where appropriate. The value of
insurance in force acquired prior to December 31, 1993 is amortized over the
premium paying periods in relation to anticipated premiums. The value of
insurance in force relating to the 1993 acquisition of The Travelers Corporation
(old Travelers) was the actuarially determined present value of the projected
future profits discounted at interest rates ranging from 14% to 18% for the
business acquired. The value of insurance in force is amortized over the
contract period using current interest crediting rates to accrete interest and
using amortization methods based on the specified products. Traditional life
insurance is amortized over the period of anticipated premiums; universal life
in relation to estimated gross profits; and annuity contracts employing a level
yield method. The value of insurance in force is reviewed periodically for
recoverability to determine if any adjustment is required.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
    DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS, included in other assets, for the life
business represent the costs of acquiring new business, principally commissions,
certain underwriting and agency expenses and the cost of issuing policies.
Deferred policy acquisition costs for traditional life business are amortized
over the premium-paying periods of the related policies, in proportion to the
ratio of the annual premium revenue to the total anticipated premium revenue.
Deferred policy acquisition costs of other business lines are generally
amortized over the life of the insurance contract or at a constant rate based
upon the present value of estimated gross profits expected to be realized. For
certain property and casualty lines, acquisition costs (primarily commissions
and premium taxes) have been deferred to the extent recoverable from future
earned premiums and are amortized ratably over the terms of the related
policies. Deferred policy acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they
are recoverable from future income, including investment income, and, if not
recoverable, are charged to expense. All other acquisition expenses are charged
to operations as incurred.

    SEPARATE AND VARIABLE ACCOUNTS primarily represent funds for which
investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to, and
investment risk is borne by, the contractholders. Each account has specific
investment objectives. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are
not subject to claims that arise out of any other business of the Company. The
assets of these accounts are generally carried at market value. Amounts assessed
to the contractholders for management services are included in revenues.
Deposits, net investment income and realized investment gains and losses for
these accounts are excluded from revenues, and related liability increases are
excluded from benefits and expenses.

    INSURANCE POLICY AND CLAIMS RESERVES represent liabilities for future
insurance policy benefits. Insurance reserves for traditional life insurance,
annuities, and accident and health policies have been computed based upon
mortality, morbidity, persistency and interest rate assumptions (ranging from
2.5% to 8.1%) applicable to these coverages, including adverse deviation. These
assumptions consider Company experience and industry standards and may be
revised if it is determined that future experience will differ substantially
from that previously assumed. Property-casualty reserves include (1) unearned
premiums representing the unexpired portion of policy premiums, and
(2) estimated provisions for both reported and unreported claims incurred and
related expenses. The reserves are adjusted regularly based on experience.

    In determining insurance policy and claims reserves, the Company performs a
continuing review of its overall position, its reserving techniques and its
reinsurance. Reserves for property-casualty insurance losses represent the
estimated ultimate cost of all incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses.
Since the reserves are based on estimates, the ultimate liability may be more or
less than such reserves. The effects of changes in such estimated reserves are
included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimates are
changed. Such changes may be material to the results of operations and could
occur in a future period.

    CONTRACTHOLDER FUNDS represent receipts from the issuance of universal life,
pension investment and certain individual annuity contracts. Such receipts are
considered deposits on investment contracts that do not have substantial
mortality or morbidity risk. Account balances are increased by deposits received
and interest credited and are reduced by withdrawals, mortality charges and
administrative expenses charged to the contractholders. Calculations of
contractholder account balances for investment contracts reflect lapse,
withdrawal and interest rate assumptions (ranging from 3.5% to 10.0%) based

on contract provisions, the Company's experience and industry standards.
Contractholder funds also include other funds that policyholders leave on
deposit with the Company.

    EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE includes prior and current service costs of
pension and other postretirement benefit plans, which are accrued on a current
basis, contributions and unrestricted awards under other employee plans, the
amortization of restricted stock awards, and costs of other employee benefits.
There are no charges to earnings upon the grant or exercise of fixed stock
options or the subscription for or purchase of stock under stock purchase
agreements. Compensation expense related to performance-based stock options
granted in prior periods was recorded over the periods to the vesting dates.
Upon issuance of previously unissued shares under employee plans, proceeds
received in excess of par value are credited to additional paid-in capital. Upon
issuance of treasury shares, the difference between the proceeds received and
the average cost of treasury shares is recorded in additional paid-in capital.

    INCOME TAXES.  Deferred taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences
of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns,
based upon enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred tax assets are recognized
subject to management's judgment that realization is more likely than not. The
Company and its wholly owned domestic non-life insurance subsidiaries file a
consolidated federal income tax return. The major life insurance subsidiaries
are included in their own consolidated federal income tax return. Citicorp and
Associates each filed their own separate consolidated federal income tax returns
prior to the respective mergers.

    EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE is computed after recognition of preferred stock
dividend requirements. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income
available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period, excluding restricted stock. Diluted earnings per
share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised and has been computed after
giving consideration to the weighted average dilutive effect of the Company's
convertible securities, common stock warrants, stock options and the shares
issued under the Company's Capital Accumulation Plan and other restricted stock
plans.

    The Board of Directors on July 18, 2000 declared a four-for-three split in
Citigroup's common stock, which was paid in the form of a 33 1/3% stock dividend
on August 25, 2000. Prior year information has been restated to reflect the
stock split.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

    INSURANCE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS.  During the first quarter of 1999, the
Company adopted Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-3, "Accounting by Insurance and
Other Enterprises for Insurance-Related Assessments." SOP 97-3 provides guidance
for determining when an entity should recognize a liability for guaranty-fund
and other insurance-related assessments, how to measure that liability, and when
an asset may be recognized for the recovery of such assessments through premium
tax offsets or policy surcharges. The initial adoption resulted in a cumulative
catch-up adjustment recorded as a charge to earnings of $135 million after-tax
and minority interest.

    DEPOSIT ACCOUNTING.  During the first quarter of 1999, the Company adopted
SOP 98-7, "Deposit Accounting: Accounting for Insurance and Reinsurance
Contracts That Do Not Transfer Insurance

                                       89

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Risk." SOP 98-7 provides guidance on how to account for insurance and
reinsurance contracts that do not transfer insurance risk and applies to all
entities and all such contracts, except for long-duration life and health
insurance contracts. The method used to account for such contracts is referred
to as deposit accounting. The initial adoption resulted in a cumulative catch-up
adjustment recorded as a credit to earnings of $23 million after-tax and
minority interest.

    START-UP COSTS.  During the first quarter of 1999, the Company adopted SOP
98-5, "Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up Activities." SOP 98-5 requires costs
of start-up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred. The
initial adoption resulted in a cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded as a
charge to earnings of $15 million after-tax.

    ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES.  For periods prior to 1999, asset management and
administration fees earned by Citicorp subsidiaries are classified as
commissions and fees in the consolidated statement of income.

FUTURE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

    DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING.  On January 1, 2001 Citigroup adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended (SFAS 133), when the rules
became effective for calendar year companies.

    The new rules will change the accounting treatment of derivative contracts
(including foreign exchange contracts) that are employed to manage risk outside
of Citigroup's trading activities, as well as certain derivative-like
instruments embedded in other contracts. The rules require that all derivatives
be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value. The treatment of changes
in the fair value of derivatives depends on the character of the transaction.

    For fair value hedges, in which derivatives hedge the fair value of assets
and liabilities, changes in the fair value of derivatives will be reflected in
current earnings, together with changes in the fair value of the related hedged
item. Citigroup's fair value hedges will primarily include hedges of fixed rate
long-term debt, loans and available-for-sale securities. As a result, Citigroup
expects that the net amount reflected in current earnings under the new rules
will be substantially similar to the amounts under existing accounting practice.

    For cash flow hedges, in which derivatives hedge the variability of cash
flows related to floating rate assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions,
the accounting treatment will depend on the effectiveness of the hedge. To the
extent these derivatives are effective in offsetting the variability of the
hedged cash flows, changes in the derivatives' fair value will not be included
in current earnings but will be reported as other changes in stockholders'
equity from nonowner sources. These changes in fair value will be included in
earnings of future periods when earnings are also affected by the variability of
the hedged cash flows. To the extent these derivatives are not effective,
changes in their fair values will be immediately included in current earnings.
Citigroup's cash flow hedges will primarily include hedges of floating rate
credit card receivables and loans and foreign currency denominated funding. As a
result, while the earnings impact of cash flow hedges may be similar to existing
accounting practice, the amounts included in other changes in stockholders'
equity from nonowner sources may vary depending on market conditions.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
    For net investment hedges, in which derivatives hedge the foreign currency
exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, the accounting treatment
will similarly depend on the effectiveness of the hedge. The effective portion
of the change in fair value of the derivative, including any forward premium or
discount, is reflected in other changes in stockholders' equity from nonowner
sources as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment. The ineffective
portion will be reflected in current period earnings. Citigroup uses such
derivative contracts as part of its strategy for hedging its net foreign
investments. The impact on earnings and other changes in stockholders' equity
from nonowner sources is not expected to be materially different from the
current accounting practice.

    Non-trading derivatives that do not qualify as hedges under the new rules
will be carried at fair value with changes in value included in current
earnings.

    In order to adopt these new rules, the initial revaluation of these
derivatives along with the initial revaluations of other items discussed in the
preceding paragraphs, are required to be recorded as cumulative effects of a
change in accounting principle, after tax, either in net income if the hedging
relationship could have been considered a fair value type hedge prior to
adoption or in other changes in stockholders' equity from nonowner sources, if
the hedging relationship could have been considered a cash flow type hedge prior
to adoption. The initial transition adjustments required to adopt SFAS 133 are
not significant.

    Citigroup will likely change certain risk management strategies outside of
its trading activities, and it also anticipates a significant increase in the
complexity of the accounting and recordkeeping requirements for these hedging
activities, but overall it does not foresee a material ongoing impact on its
financial position or results of operations from implementing the new rules. The
FASB continues to deliberate potential changes to the new rules, the effects of
which cannot be presently anticipated.

    TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS.  In September 2000, FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers
and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, a
replacement of FASB Statement No. 125" (SFAS 140).

    Provisions of SFAS 140 primarily relating to transfers of financial assets
and securitizations that differ from provisions of SFAS 125 are effective for
transfers taking place after March 31, 2001. SFAS 140 also provides revised
guidance for an entity to be considered a qualifying special purpose entity
(QSPE). It is not expected that there will be a material effect on the financial
statements relating to a change in consolidation status for existing QSPEs under
SFAS 140.

    INTEREST INCOME AND IMPAIRMENT ON CERTAIN ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES.  In
November 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) of the FASB finalized
guidance on EITF Issue No. 99-20, "Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment
on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets."
EITF 99-20, which is effective for the quarter beginning April 1, 2001, provides
new guidance regarding income recognition and identification and determination
of impairment on certain asset-backed securities. The Company is evaluating the
potential impact of implementing the new accounting standard.

2.  SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

ACQUISITION OF ASSOCIATES

    On November 30, 2000, Citigroup Inc., completed its acquisition of
Associates First Capital Corporation (Associates). The acquisition was
consummated through a merger of a subsidiary of Citigroup with and into
Associates (with Associates as the surviving corporation) pursuant to which each
share of Associates common stock became a right to receive .7334 of a share of
Citigroup Inc. common stock (534.5 million shares). Subsequent to the
acquisition, Associates was contributed to and became a wholly owned subsidiary
of Citicorp and Citicorp issued a full and unconditional guarantee of the
outstanding long-term debt securities and commercial paper of Associates and
Associates Corporation of North America, a subsidiary of Associates (ACONA).
Associates' and ACONA's debt securities and commercial paper will no longer be
separately rated.

    The consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to the
acquisition in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests, with all
periods presented as if Citigroup and Associates had always been combined.
Certain reclassifications and adjustments have been recorded to conform the
accounting policies and presentations of Citigroup and Associates. The following
table sets forth the results of operations for the separate companies and the
combined amounts for periods prior to the acquisition.

of the conversion, the common stock investment in Nikko is accounted for under
the equity method and is reported in other assets. The Company's proportionate
share of Nikko's income is reflected in other income. The Consolidated
Statements of Financial Condition and Changes in Stockholders' Equity have been
restated to account for the original 9.5% ownership under the equity method from
the date of original acquisition in August 1998. Previously, this 9.5% ownership
was reported in available-for-sale securities with changes in fair value, net of
applicable taxes, recorded in stockholders' equity.

</TABLE>

    The resale and repurchase agreements represent collateralized financing
transactions used to generate net interest income and facilitate trading
activity. These instruments are collateralized principally by government and
government agency securities and generally have terms ranging from overnight to
up to a year. It is the Company's policy to take possession of the underlying
collateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due under the
agreements, and, when necessary, require prompt transfer of additional
collateral or reduction in the loan balance in order to maintain contractual
margin protection. In the event of counterparty default, the financing agreement
provides the Company with the right to liquidate the collateral held. Resale
agreements and repurchase agreements are reported net by counterparty, when
applicable, pursuant to FASB Interpretation 41, "Offsetting of Amounts Related
to Certain Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements" (FIN 41). Excluding the
impact of FIN 41, resale agreements totaled $118.9 billion and $122.4 billion at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

    Deposits paid for securities borrowed (securities borrowed) and deposits
received for securities loaned (securities loaned) are recorded at the amount of
cash advanced or received and are collateralized principally by government and
government agency securities, corporate debt and equity securities. Securities
borrowed transactions require the Company to deposit cash with the lender. With
respect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash collateral in an amount
generally in excess of the market value of securities loaned. The Company
monitors the market value of securities borrowed and securities loaned daily,
and additional collateral is obtained as necessary. Securities borrowed and
securities loaned are reported net by counterparty, when applicable, pursuant to
FAS Interpretation 39, "Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts" (FIN
39).

brokers and dealers or customers to pay for purchases or to deliver the
financial instrument sold, in which case the Company would have to sell or
purchase the financial instruments at prevailing market prices. Credit risk is
reduced to the extent that an exchange or clearing organization acts as a
counterparty to the transaction.

    The Company seeks to protect itself from the risks associated with customer
activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance
with regulatory and internal guidelines. Margin levels are monitored daily, and
customers deposit additional collateral as required. Where customers cannot meet
collateral requirements, the Company will liquidate sufficient underlying
financial instruments to bring the customer into compliance with the required
margin level.

    Exposure to credit risk is impacted by market volatility, which may impair
the ability of clients to satisfy their obligations to the Company. Credit
limits are established and closely monitored for customers and brokers and
dealers engaged in forward and futures and other transactions deemed to be
credit sensitive.

    Brokerage receivables and brokerage payables, which arise in the normal
course of business, consisted of the following at December 31:

    Impaired loans are those on which Citigroup believes it is not probable that
it will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of
the loan, excluding smaller-balance homogeneous loans that are evaluated
collectively for impairment, and are carried on a cash basis. Valuation
allowances for these loans are estimated considering all available evidence
including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected cash flows
discounted at the loan's contractual effective rate, the secondary market value
of the loan, the fair value of collateral, and environmental factors. The
following table presents information about impaired loans.

11.  SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY

    Citigroup and its subsidiaries securitize primarily credit card receivables,
mortgage and home equity loans.

    After securitization of credit card receivables, the Company continues to
maintain credit card customer account relationships and provides servicing for
receivables transferred to the trust. The Company also provides credit
enhancement to the trust using cash collateral accounts and put options. As
specified in certain of the sale agreements, the net revenue collected each
month is accumulated up to a predetermined maximum amount, and is available over
the remaining term of that transaction to make payments of yield, fees, and
transaction costs in the event that net cash flows from the receivables are not
sufficient. When the predetermined amount is reached net revenue is passed
directly to the Citigroup subsidiary that sold the receivables.

    The Company provides a wide range of mortgage and home equity products to a
diverse customer base. In connection with these loans, the servicing rights
entitle the Company to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding
principal balances of the loans and the contractual servicing fee. Failure to
service the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may lead to a
termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees. In
non-recourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the servicer is the cost of
temporary advances of funds. In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share
credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans such as FNMA or FHLMC or with a
private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing occur
primarily when foreclosure sale

    For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company recognized $79 million of
gains on securitizations of mortgage and home equity loans.

    As disclosed below, SFAS 140 requires that the effect on the fair value of
the retained interests of two adverse changes in each key assumption be
independently calculated. Because the key assumptions may be correlated, the net
effect of simultaneous adverse changes in the key assumptions may be less than
the sum of the individual effects disclosed below.

    Citigroup, Citicorp, Associates and certain of its affiliated companies, TPC
and The Travelers Insurance Company (TIC) issue commercial paper directly to
investors. Citigroup and Citicorp, both of which are bank holding companies,
maintain combined liquidity reserves of cash, securities, and unused bank lines
of credit at least equal to their combined outstanding commercial paper. All of
the commercial paper issued by Associates and its affiliates is guaranteed by
Citicorp, and Associates maintains unutilized credit facilities, all guaranteed
by Citicorp, in support of approximately 75% of its commercial paper. TPC and
TIC each maintains unused credit availability under their respective bank lines
of credit at least equal to the amount of outstanding commercial paper.

    Borrowings under bank lines of credit may be at interest rates based on
LIBOR, CD rates, the prime rate or bids submitted by the banks. Each company
pays its banks commitment fees for its lines of credit.

    Citicorp, Salomon Smith Barney, and some of their nonbank subsidiaries have
credit facilities with Citicorp's subsidiary banks, including Citibank, N.A.
Borrowings under these facilities must be secured in accordance with
Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.

    Citigroup and TIC have an agreement with a syndicate of banks to provide
$1.0 billion of revolving credit, to be allocated to Citigroup and TIC. The
participation of TIC in this agreement is limited to $250 million. The revolving
credit facility consists of a five-year revolving credit facility that expires
in June 2001. At December 31, 2000, all of the facility was allocated to
Citigroup. Under this facility the Company is required to maintain a certain
level of consolidated stockholders' equity (as defined in the agreement). The

    The Company issues both U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed
and variable rate debt. The Company utilizes derivative contracts, primarily
interest rate swaps, to effectively convert a portion of its fixed rate debt to
variable rate debt. The maturity structure of the derivatives generally
corresponds with the maturity structure of the debt being hedged. At
December 31, 2000, the Company entered into interest rate swaps to convert
$23.0 billion of its $62.5 billion of fixed rate debt to variable rate
obligations. At December 31, 2000, the Company's overall weighted average
interest rate for long-term debt was 6.49% on a contractual basis and 6.48%
including the effects of derivative contracts. In addition, the Company utilizes
other derivative contracts to manage the foreign exchange impact of certain debt
issuances.

</TABLE>

    The decreases in the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves in 2000
and 1999, from 1999 and 1998, respectively, were primarily attributable to net
payments of $341 million and $504 million, respectively, for environmental and
cumulative injury claims.

    In 2000, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses for claims arising
in prior years included approximately $76 million primarily relating to net
favorable development in certain Commercial Lines coverages, predominantly in
the commercial multi-peril line of business, and in certain Personal Lines
coverages, predominately personal umbrella coverages. In addition, in 2000
Commercial Lines experienced favorable loss development on loss sensitive
policies in various lines; however, since the business to which it relates is
subject to premium adjustments, there is no impact on results of operations.

    In 1999, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses for claims arising
in prior years included approximately $205 million primarily relating to net
favorable development in certain Personal Lines coverages, predominantly
automobile coverages, and in certain Commercial Lines coverages, predominantly
in the general liability and commercial multi-peril lines of business. In
addition, in 1999 Commercial Lines experienced favorable loss development on
loss sensitive policies in the workers' compensation line; however, since the
business to which it relates is subject to premium adjustments, there was no
impact on results of operations.

    In 1998, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses for claims arising
in prior years included approximately $176 million primarily relating to net
favorable developments in certain Personal Lines

coverages, predominantly automobile coverages. In addition, in 1998 Commercial
Lines experienced favorable prior-year loss development on loss sensitive
policies in the workers' compensation line; however, since the business to which
it relates is subject to premium adjustments, there was no impact on results of

    The property-casualty claims and claim adjustment expense reserves include
$1.364 billion and $1.503 billion for asbestos and environmental-related claims
net of reinsurance at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

    It is difficult to estimate the reserves for environmental and
asbestos-related claims due to the vagaries of court coverage decisions,
plaintiffs' expanded theories of liability, the risks inherent in major
litigation and other uncertainties, including without limitation, those which
are set forth below. Conventional actuarial techniques are not used to estimate
such reserves.

    For environmental claims, the Company estimates its financial exposure and
establishes reserves based upon an analysis of its historical claim experience
and the facts of the individual underlying environmental exposure of each
policyholder. The unique facts are evaluated individually and collectively. Due
consideration is given to the many variables presented by each policyholder.

    The reserving methodology for asbestos includes an evaluation of the
asbestos exposure presented by each insured. The following factors are
evaluated: available insurance coverage including the role of any umbrella or
excess insurance issued by the Company to the insured; limits and deductibles;
an analysis of each insured's potential liability; jurisdictional involvement;
past and anticipated future claim activity; past settlement values of similar
claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; potential role of other insurance;
the role, if any, of non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any
resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any,
including the determination as to whether an asbestos claim is a
products/completed operations or non-products/ operating claim and the available
coverage, if any, for such a claim. Once the gross ultimate exposure for
indemnity and allocated claim adjustment expense is determined for each insured
by each policy year, a ceded reinsurance projection is calculated based on any
applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, as well as past ceded experience.
Adjustments to the ceded projections also occur due to actual ceded claim
experience and reinsurance collections.

    Historically, the Company's experience has indicated that insureds with
potentially significant environmental and asbestos exposures may often have
potential cumulative injury other than asbestos (CIOTA) exposures or CIOTA
claims pending with the Company. Due to this experience and the fact that
settlement agreements with insureds may extinguish the Company's obligations for
all claims, including environmental, asbestos and CIOTA, the Company evaluates
and considers the environmental and asbestos reserves in conjunction with the
CIOTA reserve.

    The Company also compares its historical direct and net loss and expense
paid experience in environmental and asbestos, year-by-year, to assess any
emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid
activity. The comparison includes a review of the result derived from the
division of the ending direct and net reserves by last year's direct and net
paid activity, also known as the survival ratio.

    As a result of these processes and procedures, the reserves carried for
environmental and asbestos claims at December 31, 2000 are the Company's best
estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses based upon known facts
and current law. However, the uncertainties surrounding the final

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

13.  INSURANCE POLICY AND CLAIMS RESERVES (CONTINUED)
resolution of these claims continue. These include, without limitation, any
impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers, a
further increase or decrease in asbestos and environmental claims which cannot
now be anticipated as well as the role of any umbrella or excess policies issued
by the Company for such claims, the resolution or adjudication of certain
disputes pertaining to asbestos non-products/operations claims in a manner
inconsistent with the Company's previous assessment of such claims as well as
unanticipated developments pertaining to the Company's ability to recover
reinsurance for environmental and asbestos claims.

    It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative
environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and
environmental claims. Such development will be affected by future court
decisions and interpretations, as well as changes in legislation applicable to
such claims. Because of these future unknowns, and the uncertainties set forth
above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current
reserves. These additional amounts, or a range of these additional amounts,
cannot now be reasonably estimated, and could result in a liability exceeding
reserves by an amount that would be material to the Company's operating results
in a future period. However, in the opinion of the Company's management, it is
not likely that these claims will have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial condition or liquidity.

    The Company has a geographic exposure to catastrophe losses in certain areas
of the country. Catastrophes can be caused by various events including
hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, explosions and
fires, and the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently
unpredictable. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the
total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the
severity of the event. Most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic
areas; however, hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in
large, heavily populated areas. The Company generally seeks to reduce its
exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection and the purchase of
catastrophe reinsurance.

14.  REINSURANCE

    The Company's insurance operations participate in reinsurance in order to
limit losses, minimize exposure to large risks, provide additional capacity for
future growth and effect business-sharing arrangements. Life reinsurance is
accomplished through various plans of reinsurance, primarily coinsurance,
modified coinsurance and yearly renewable term. Property-casualty reinsurance is
placed on both a quota-share and excess of loss basis. The property-casualty
insurance subsidiaries also participate as a servicing carrier for, and a member
of, several pools and associations. Reinsurance ceded arrangements do not
discharge the insurance subsidiaries as the primary insurer, except for cases
involving a novation.

    During 2000, Citigroup recorded restructuring charges of $579 million,
primarily consisting of exit costs related to the acquisition of Associates. The
new initiatives are expected to be implemented over the next year. The charges
included $241 million related to employee severance, $154 million related to
exiting leasehold and other contractual obligations, and $184 million of asset
impairment charges.

    The implementation of these restructuring initiatives will cause some
related premises and equipment assets to become redundant. As a result, the
remaining depreciable lives of these assets were shortened, and accelerated
depreciation charges of $69 million will be recognized in subsequent periods.

    Of the $579 million charge, $474 million in the Associates business includes
the reconfiguration of certain branch operations, the exit from non-strategic
businesses and from activities as mandated by Federal bank regulations, and the
consolidation and integration of Corporate and middle and back office functions.
In the Global Consumer business, $51 million includes the reconfiguration of
certain branch operations outside the U.S. and the downsizing and consolidation
of certain back office functions in the U.S. Approximately $440 million of the
$579 million charge related to operations in the United States.

    The $241 million portion of the charge related to employee severance
reflects the costs of eliminating approximately 7,400 positions, including
approximately 4,600 in Associates and 700 in the Global Consumer business.
Approximately 5,000 of these positions relate to the United States. In 2000, a
reserve for $23 million was recorded, $20 million of which related to the
elimination of 1,600 non-U.S. positions of an acquired entity.

    The 2000 restructuring reserve utilization included $184 million of asset
impairment charges and $71 million of severance and other exit costs (of which
$40 million related to employee severance and $5 million related to leasehold
and other exit costs have been paid in cash and $26 million is legally
obligated), together with translation effects.

    In 1999, Citigroup recorded restructuring charges of $166 million, including
additional severance charges of $49 million as a result of the continuing
implementation of 1998 restructuring initiatives, as well as $82 million of exit
costs associated with new initiatives in the Global Consumer business primarily
related to the reconfiguration of certain branch operations outside the U.S.,
the downsizing of certain marketing operations, and the exit of a non-strategic
business. The 1999 restructuring reserve was fully utilized at June 30, 2000.

    The 1999 charge included $35 million of integration charges recorded by
Associates (the Avco charge) related to its January 6, 1999 acquisition of Avco
Financial Services, Inc. (Avco). The charge included $17 million related to
employee severance, $5 million related to branch closure, $7 million related to
training of employees and $6 million of other integration related expenses. In
addition to the

Avco charge, as part of the purchase price allocation of the Avco acquisition,
Associates recorded a $146 million reserve (the Avco integration cost reserve)
at the time of the acquisition. This reserve was established to reflect the
costs of exiting certain activities that would not be continued after the
acquisition. The costs primarily consisted of severance costs and related
expenses, lease termination costs and other contractual liabilities. The Avco
reserve was fully utilized at December 31, 1999.

    In 1998, Citigroup recorded a restructuring charge of $1.122 billion,
reflecting exit costs associated with business improvement and integration
initiatives. The 1998 restructuring reserve was fully utilized at December 31,
2000.

    The implementation of the 1999 and 1998 restructuring initiatives also
caused certain related premises and equipment assets to become redundant. The
remaining depreciable lives of these assets were shortened, and accelerated
depreciation charges of $68 million and $182 million (in addition to normal
scheduled depreciation on those assets) were recognized over the shortened lives
in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

(1) Represents additions to restructuring liabilities arising from acquisitions.

(2) Utilization amounts include translation effects on the restructuring
    reserve.

    Changes in estimates are attributable to facts and circumstances arising
subsequent to an original restructuring charge. During 2000 and 1999, changes in
estimates resulted in reductions in the reserve for 1998 restructuring
initiatives of $65 million and $151 million, respectively, attributable to lower
than anticipated costs of implementing certain projects and a reduction in the
scope of certain initiatives. Changes in estimates related to 1997 restructuring
initiatives, which were fully utilized as of December 31, 1999, were
$250 million and $392 million in 1999 and 1998, respectively, and were primarily
related to the Seven World Trade Center lease. Adjustments related to the Seven
World Trade Center lease during 1999 were attributable to the reassessment of
space needed due to the Travelers and Citicorp merger, which indicated the need
for increased occupancy and the utilization of space previously considered
excessive; adjustments during 1998 resulted from negotiations on a sublease

which indicated that excess space could be disposed of on terms more favorable
than had been originally estimated.

    During 2000, the Company also recorded $177 million of merger-related costs
which included legal, advisory and SEC filing fees, as well as other costs of
administratively closing the acquisition of Associates. During 1998, the Company
recorded $65 million of merger-related costs which included the direct and
incremental costs of administratively closing the Travelers and Citicorp merger.

    Foreign pretax earnings approximated $6.9 billion in 2000, $5.4 billion in
1999, and $2.8 billion in 1998. As a U.S. corporation, Citigroup is subject to
U.S. taxation currently on all foreign pretax earnings earned by a foreign
branch. Pretax earnings of a foreign subsidiary or affiliate are subject to U.S.
taxation when effectively repatriated. In addition, certain of Citigroup's U.S.
income is subject to foreign income tax where the payor of such income is
domiciled outside the United States. The Company provides income taxes on the
undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries except to the extent that such
earnings are indefinitely invested outside the United States. At December 31,
2000, $1.5 billion of accumulated undistributed earnings of non-U.S.
subsidiaries was indefinitely invested. At

16.  INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)
the existing U.S. federal income tax rate, additional taxes of $426 million
would have to be provided if such earnings were remitted.

    Income taxes are not provided for on the Company's life insurance
subsidiaries' "policyholders' surplus account" because under current U.S. tax
rules such taxes will become payable only to the extent such amounts are
distributed as a dividend or exceed limits prescribed by federal law.
Distributions are not contemplated from this account, which aggregated
$982 million (subject to a tax of $344 million) at December 31, 2000.

    The 2000 net change in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax
assets was a decrease of $94 million primarily relating to the elimination of
the $100 million valuation allowance in the life insurance group. This
elimination resulted from an analysis of the availability of capital gains to
offset capital losses. In management's opinion, there will be adequate capital
gains to make realization of any capital losses more likely than not. The
recognition of the benefit produced by the reversal of this portion of the
valuation allowance was recognized by reducing goodwill. The remaining valuation
allowance of $220 million at December 31, 2000 is primarily related to specific
state and local, and foreign tax carryforwards or tax law restrictions on
benefit recognition in the U.S. federal tax return and in the above
jurisdictions.

    Management believes that the realization of the recognized net deferred tax
asset of $4.255 billion is more likely than not based on existing carryback
ability and expectations as to future taxable income. The Company has reported
pretax financial statement income of approximately $17 billion, on average, over
the last three years and has generated federal taxable income exceeding
$10 billion, on average, each year during this same period.

17.  MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS

    The Company formed statutory business trusts under the laws of the state of
Delaware, which exist for the exclusive purposes of (i) issuing Trust Securities
representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust;
(ii) investing the gross proceeds of the Trust securities in junior subordinated
deferrable interest debentures (subordinated debentures) of its parent; and
(iii) engaging in only those activities necessary or incidental thereto. These
subordinated debentures and the related income effects are eliminated in the
consolidated financial statements. Distributions on the mandatorily redeemable
securities of subsidiary trusts below have been classified as interest expense
in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

REGULATORY CAPITAL

    Citigroup and Citicorp are subject to risk-based capital and leverage
guidelines issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB),
and their U.S. insured depository institution subsidiaries, including Citibank,
N.A., are subject to similar guidelines issued by their respective primary
regulators. These guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and include
the required minimums shown in the following table.

    To be "well capitalized" under federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a
depository institution must have a Tier 1 ratio of at least 6%, a combined Tier
1 and Tier 2 ratio of at least 10%, and a leverage ratio of at least 5%, and not
be subject to a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain
specific capital levels. The regulatory agencies are required by law to take
specific prompt actions with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum
capital standards. As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, all of Citigroup's U.S.
insured subsidiary depository institutions were "well capitalized." At
December 31, 2000, regulatory capital as set forth in guidelines issued by the
U.S. federal bank regulators is as follows:

    There are various legal limitations on the extent to which Citigroup's
banking subsidiaries may pay dividends to their parents. Citigroup's national
and state-chartered bank subsidiaries can declare dividends to their respective
parent companies in 2001, without regulatory approval, of approximately
$7.2 billion, adjusted by the effect of their net income (loss) for 2001 up to
the date of any such dividend declaration. In determining whether and to what
extent to pay dividends, each bank subsidiary must also consider the effect of
dividend payments on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio
requirements as well as policy statements of the federal regulatory agencies
that indicate that banking organizations should generally pay dividends out of
current operating earnings. Consistent with these considerations, Citigroup
estimates that its bank subsidiaries can distribute dividends to Citigroup of
approximately $6.4 billion of the available $7.2 billion, adjusted by the effect
of their net income (loss) up to the date of any such dividend declaration.

    The property-casualty insurance subsidiaries' statutory capital and surplus
at December 31, 2000 and 1999 was $7.634 billion (including Associates) and
$7.758 billion, respectively. The life insurance subsidiaries' statutory capital
and surplus at December 31, 2000 and 1999 was $6.079 billion and
$5.836 billion, respectively. Statutory capital and surplus are subject to
certain restrictions imposed by state insurance departments as to the transfer
of funds and payment of dividends. The property-

    During 2000, 1999 and 1998, weighted average options of 28.1 million shares,
42.7 million shares and 38.3 million shares with weighted average exercise
prices of $58.32 per share, $40.81 per share, and $31.28 per share,
respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS because the
options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the
Company's common stock.

21.  INCENTIVE PLANS

    The Company has adopted a number of compensation plans to attract, retain
and motivate officers and employees, to compensate them for their contributions
to the growth and profits of the Company, and to encourage employee stock
ownership. At December 31, 2000, approximately 325 million shares were available
for grant under Citigroup's stock option and restricted stock plans.

21.  INCENTIVE PLANS (CONTINUED)
STOCK OPTION PLANS

    The Company has a number of stock option plans that provide for the granting
of stock options to officers and employees. Options are granted at the fair
market value of Citigroup common stock at the time of grant for a period of ten
years. Generally, options granted under Travelers predecessor plans and options
granted since the date of the merger vest over a five-year period. Generally,
50% of the options granted under Citicorp predecessor plans prior to the merger
are exercisable beginning on the third anniversary and 50% beginning on the
fourth anniversary of the date of grant. Generally, options granted under
Associates predecessor plans vest over a three-year period. Certain of the plans
also permit an employee exercising an option to be granted new options (reload
options) in an amount equal to the number of common shares used to satisfy the
exercise price and the withholding taxes due upon exercise. The reload options
are granted for the remaining term of the related original option and vest after
six months.

    To further encourage employee stock ownership the Company's eligible
employees participate in either the WealthBuilder or CitiBuilder stock option
programs. Options granted under the WealthBuilder program vest over a five-year
period whereas options granted under the CitiBuilder program vest after five
years. These options do not have a reload feature.

    During 1998, a group of key Citicorp employees was granted 12,680,000
performance-based options at an equivalent Citigroup strike price of $24.13. At
December 31, 1998 12,010,000 of these options were unvested. During 1999
12,010,000 of these options vested when Citigroup's stock price reached $40.00
per share. The cost of performance-based options is measured as the difference
between the exercise price and market price required for vesting. After-tax
expense recognized on these performance-based options was $68 million and
$43 million in 1999 and 1998, respectively.

    Information with respect to stock option activity under Citigroup stock
option plans for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 is as follows:

THE RESTRICTED STOCK PLANS

    The Company through its Capital Accumulation Plan and other restricted stock
programs, issues shares of Citigroup common stock in the form of restricted
stock to participating officers and employees. The restricted stock generally
vests after a two or three-year period. Except under limited circumstances,
during this period the stock cannot be sold or transferred by the participant,
who is required to render service during the restricted period. Certain
participants may elect to receive part of their awards in restricted stock and
part in stock options. Unearned compensation expense associated with the
restricted stock grants represents the market value of Citigroup common stock at
the date of grant and is recognized as a charge to income ratably over the
vesting period. Information with respect to restricted stock awards is as
follows:

    In 1998 certain employees of SSB received Deferred Stock Awards (DSAs). A
DSA award is an unfunded promise to deliver shares at the end of a three-year
deferral period. It is comprised of a basic award representing a portion of the
participant's prior year incentive award, and an additional premium award
amounting to 33% of the basic award which vests one-third per year over a
three-year period. Participants may elect to receive a portion of their award in
the form of stock options. The basic portion of the award is expensed in the
bonus year that it was earned. The expense associated with the additional 33%
premium award is amortized over the appropriate vesting period. After-tax
expense of approximately $150 million was recognized during 1998 for 1998 awards
that were granted in January of 1999.

CITIBUILDER 401(k)

    Prior to 1999, under the Savings Incentive Plan, eligible Citicorp employees
received awards equal to 3% of their covered salary. Employees had the option of
receiving their award in cash or deferring some or all of it in various
investment funds. The Company granted an additional award equal to the amount
elected to be deferred by the employee. The after-tax expense associated with
the plan amounted to $68 million in 1998.

    During 1999, the CitiBuilder 401(k) plan replaced the Savings Incentive
Plan. Under the CitiBuilder 401(k) plan, eligible employees receive awards up to
3% of their total compensation deferred into the Citigroup common stock fund.
The after-tax expense associated with this plan amounted to $29 million in 2000
and $31 million in 1999.

STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

    The offering under the Citigroup 2000 Stock Purchase Plan allowed eligible
employees of Citigroup to enter into fixed subscription agreements to purchase
shares at the market value on the date of the agreements. Enrolled employees are
permitted to make one purchase prior to the expiration date. Shares of
Citigroup's common stock delivered under the 2000 Stock Purchase plan are to be
sourced from authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares.

    The offering under the 1997 Stock Purchase Plan allowed eligible employees
of Citicorp to enter into fixed subscription agreements to purchase shares at
the market value on the date of the agreements. Such shares could be purchased
from time to time through the expiration date. Shares of Citigroup's common
stock delivered under the Stock Purchase Plan were sourced from treasury shares.

    Following is the share activity under the 2000 and 1997 fixed-price
offerings for the purchase of shares at the equivalent Citigroup price of $52.92
and $22.65 per share, respectively. The 1997 offering expired on June 30, 1999.

PRO FORMA IMPACT OF SFAS NO. 123

    The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for its stock-based
compensation plans under which there is generally no charge to earnings for
employee stock option awards (other than performance-based options) and the
dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution
in the computation of earnings per share.

    Alternatively, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rules would
permit a method under which a compensation cost for all stock awards would be
calculated and recognized over the service period (generally equal to the
vesting period). This compensation cost would be determined in a

manner prescribed by the FASB using option pricing models, intended to estimate
the fair value of the awards at the grant date. Earnings per share dilution
would be recognized as well.

    Under both methods, an offsetting increase to stockholders' equity is
recorded equal to the amount of compensation expense charged.

    Had the Company applied SFAS No. 123 in accounting for the Company's stock
option plans, net income and net income per share would have been the pro forma

    The pro forma adjustments relate to stock options granted from 1995 through
2000, for which a fair value on the date of grant was determined using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model. No effect has been given to options granted
prior to 1995. The pro forma information above reflects the compensation expense
that would have been recognized under SFAS No. 123 for Travelers, Citicorp and
Associates. The fair values of stock-based awards are based on assumptions that
were determined at the grant date.

    SFAS No. 123 requires that reload options be treated as separate grants from
the related original grants. Under the Company's reload program, upon exercise
of an option, employees tender previously owned shares to pay the exercise price
and surrender shares otherwise to be received for related tax withholding, and
receive a reload option covering the same number of shares tendered for such
purposes. Reload options vest at the end of a six-month period. Reload options
are intended to encourage employees to exercise options at an earlier date and
to retain the shares so acquired, in furtherance of the Company's long-standing
policy of encouraging increased employee stock ownership. The result of this
program is that employees generally will exercise options as soon as they are
able and, therefore, these options have shorter expected lives. Shorter option
lives result in lower valuations using a Black-Scholes option model. However,
such values are expensed more quickly due to the shorter vesting period of
reload options. In addition, since reload options are treated as separate
grants, the existence of the reload feature results in a greater number of
options being valued.

    Shares received through option exercises under the reload program are
subject to restrictions on sale. Discounts (as measured by the estimated cost of
protection) have been applied to the fair value of options granted to reflect
these sale restrictions.

   The Company has several non-contributory defined benefit pension plans
covering substantially all U.S. employees and has various defined benefit
pension termination indemnity plans covering employees outside the United
States. During the 1999 first quarter, the U.S. defined benefit plan was amended
to convert the benefit formula for certain employees of Citicorp to a cash
balance formula. Employees satisfying certain age and service requirements
remain covered by the prior final pay formula. The Company also offers
postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible U.S.
retired employees, as well as to certain eligible employees outside the United
States. The following tables summarize the components of net benefit expense
recognized in the consolidated statement of income and the funded status and

(1) Excluding highly inflationary countries.

    As an indicator of sensitivity, increasing the assumed health care cost
trend rate by 1% in each year would have increased the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2000 by $38 million and the
aggregate of the benefits earned and interest components of 2000 net
postretirement benefit expense by $4 million. Decreasing the assumed health care
cost trend rate by 1% in each year would have decreased the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2000 by $36 million and the
aggregate of the benefits earned and interest components of 2000 net
postretirement benefit expense by $4 million.

(1) There is no balance sheet credit exposure for futures contracts because they
    settle daily in cash, and none for written options because they represent
    obligations (rather than assets) of Citigroup.

(2) The balance sheet credit exposure reflects $78.8 billion and $65.4 billion
    of master netting agreements in effect at December 31, 2000 and
    December 31, 1999, respectively. Master netting agreements mitigate credit
    risk by permitting the offset of amounts due from and to individual
    counterparties in the event of counterparty default. In addition, Citibank
    has securitized and sold net receivables, and the associated credit risk
    related to certain derivative and foreign exchange contracts via Markets
    Assets Trust, which amounted to $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion at
    December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999, respectively.

(3) Amounts for 1999 were reclassified to conform to the 2000 presentation.

    Citigroup enters into derivative and foreign exchange futures, forwards,
options, and swaps, which enable customers to transfer, modify, or reduce their
interest rate, foreign exchange, and other market risks, and also trades these
products for its own account. In addition, Citigroup uses derivatives and other
instruments, primarily interest rate products, as an end-user in connection with
its risk management activities. Derivatives are used to manage interest rate
risk relating to specific groups of on-balance sheet assets and liabilities,
including investments, commercial and consumer loans, deposit liabilities,
long-term debt, and other interest-sensitive assets and liabilities, as well as
credit card securitizations, redemptions and sales. In addition, foreign
exchange contracts are used to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated debt, net
capital exposures, and foreign exchange transactions. Through the effective use
of derivatives, Citigroup has been able to modify the volatility of its revenue
from asset and liability positions. Derivative instruments with leverage
features are not utilized in connection

23.  TRADING SECURITIES, COMMODITIES, DERIVATIVES, AND RELATED RISKS (CONTINUED)
with risk management activities. The preceding table presents the aggregate
notional principal amounts of Citigroup's outstanding derivative and foreign
exchange contracts at December 31, 2000 and 1999, along with the related balance
sheet credit exposure. The table includes all contracts with third parties,
including both trading and end-user positions.

    Futures and forward contracts are commitments to buy or sell at a future
date a financial instrument, commodity, or currency at a contracted price, and
may be settled in cash or through delivery. Swap contracts are commitments to
settle in cash at a future date or dates which may range from a few days to a
number of years, based on differentials between specified financial indices, as
applied to a notional principal amount. Option contracts give the purchaser, for
a fee, the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell within a limited time,
a financial instrument or currency at a contracted price that may also be
settled in cash, based on differentials between specified indices.

    Citigroup also sells various financial instruments that have not been
purchased (short sales). In order to sell securities short, the securities are
borrowed or received as collateral in conjunction with short-term financing
agreements and, at a later date, must be delivered (i.e. replaced) with like or
substantially the same financial instruments or commodities to the parties from
which they were originally borrowed.

    Derivatives and short sales may expose Citigroup to market risk or credit
risk in excess of the amounts recorded on the balance sheet. Market risk on a
derivative, short sale, or foreign exchange product is the exposure created by
potential fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and other
values, and is a function of the type of product, the volume of transactions,
the tenor and terms of the agreement, and the underlying volatility. Credit risk
is the exposure to loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the
transaction and if the value of collateral held, if any, was not adequate to
cover such losses. The recognition in earnings of unrealized gains on these
transactions is subject to management's assessment as to collectibility.
Liquidity risk is the potential exposure that arises when the size of the
derivative position may not be able to be rapidly adjusted in times of high
volatility and financial stress at a reasonable cost.

23.  TRADING SECURITIES, COMMODITIES, DERIVATIVES, AND RELATED RISKS (CONTINUED)
tables are intended to provide an overview of these components of the end-user
portfolio, but should be viewed only in the context of Citigroup's related
assets and liabilities. Contract maturities are related to the underlying risk
management strategy.

    The majority of derivative positions used in Citigroup's asset and liability
management activities are established via intercompany transactions with
independently managed Citigroup dealer units, with the dealer acting as a
conduit to the marketplace.

    Citigroup's utilization of these instruments is modified from time to time
in response to changing market conditions as well as changes in the
characteristics and mix of the related assets and liabilities. In this
connection, during 2000 interest rate futures, swaps, and options with a
notional principal amount of $60.2 billion were closed out which resulted in a
net deferred gain of approximately $73 million. Total unamortized net deferred
gains, including those from prior year close-outs, were approximately
$127 million at December 31, 2000, which will be amortized into earnings over
the remaining life of the original contracts (approximately 20% in 2001, 18% in
2002, and 62% in subsequent years), consistent with the risk management
strategy.

24.  CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

    Concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic, industry or
geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate
credit exposure is material in relation to Citigroup's total credit exposure.
Although Citigroup's portfolio of financial instruments is broadly diversified
along industry, product, and geographic lines, material transactions are
completed with other financial institutions, particularly in the securities
trading, derivative, and foreign exchange businesses.

25.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

    The table below presents the carrying value and fair value of Citigroup's
financial instruments, as defined in accordance with applicable requirements.
Accordingly, as required, the disclosures exclude leases, affiliate investments,
and pension and benefit obligations, and contractholder funds amounts exclude
certain insurance contracts. Also as required, the disclosures exclude the
effect of taxes, do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from
offering for sale at one time the entire holdings of a particular instrument,
the excess fair value associated with deposits with no fixed maturity, as well
as other expenses that would be incurred in a market transaction. In addition,
the table excludes the values of nonfinancial assets and liabilities, as well as
a wide range of franchise, relationship, and intangible values, which are
integral to a full assessment of Citigroup's financial position and the value of
its net assets.

    The data represents management's best estimates based on a range of
methodologies and assumptions. The carrying value of short-term financial
instruments as well as receivables and payables arising in the ordinary course
of business, approximates fair value because of the relatively short period of
time between their origination and expected realization. Quoted market prices
are used for most investments, for loans where available, and for both trading
and end-user derivative and foreign exchange contracts, as well as for
liabilities, such as long-term debt, with quoted prices. For performing loans
where no quoted market prices are available, contractual cash flows are
discounted at quoted secondary market rates or estimated market rates if
available. Otherwise, sales of comparable loan

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

25.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
portfolios or current market origination rates for loans with similar terms and
risk characteristics are used. For loans with doubt as to collectibility,
expected cash flows are discounted using an appropriate rate considering the
time of collection and a premium for the uncertainty of the flows. The value of
collateral is also considered. For liabilities such as long-term debt without
quoted market prices, market borrowing rates of interest are used to discount
contractual cash flows.

    Fair values of credit card securitizations reflect the various components of
these transactions but principally arise from fixed rates payable to certificate
holders. Under the applicable requirements, the estimated fair value of deposits
with no fixed maturity in the following table excludes the premium values
available in the market for such deposits, and the estimated value is shown in
the table as being equal to the carrying value.

    reasonable estimate of fair value, and the carrying value and estimated fair
    value of financial instruments included in other assets on the Consolidated
    Statement of Financial Position.

(3) Includes brokerage payables, separate and variable accounts, investment
    banking and brokerage borrowings, short-term borrowings, for which the
    carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value, and the carrying
    value and estimated fair value of financial instruments included in other
    liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

    Fair values vary from period to period based on changes in a wide range of
factors, including interest rates, credit quality, and market perceptions of
value, and as existing assets and liabilities run off and new items are entered
into.

    The estimated fair values of loans reflect changes in credit status since
the loans were made, changes in interest rates in the case of fixed-rate loans,
and premium values at origination of certain loans. The estimated fair values of
Citigroup's loans, in the aggregate, exceeded carrying values (reduced by the
allowance for credit losses) by $16.5 billion at year-end 2000 and
$13.5 billion in 1999. Within these totals, estimated fair values exceeded
carrying values for consumer loans net of the allowance by $12.9 billion, an
increase of $2.8 billion from year-end 1999, and for commercial loans net of the
allowance by $3.6 billion, which was an increase of $0.2 billion from year-end
1999.

    The increase in estimated fair values in excess of carrying values of
consumer loans is primarily due to the lower interest rate environment.

    The estimated fair value of credit card securitizations was $0.3 billion
more than their carrying value at December 31, 2000, which is $0.5 billion less
than December 31, 1999, when the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair
value by $0.8 billion. This decrease is due to the effects of a lower interest
rate environment on the fixed-rate investor certificates.

    For all derivative and foreign exchange contracts in the previous tables,
the gross difference between the fair value and carrying amount as of
December 31, 2000 and1999 was $0.8 billion and $0.4 billion for contracts whose
fair value exceeds carrying value, and $0.5 billion and $1.9 billion at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, for contracts whose carrying value
exceeds fair value.

    In addition, included in cash and due from banks at December 31, 2000 and
1999 is $2.698 billion and $2.421 billion, respectively, of cash segregated
under federal and other brokerage regulations or deposited with clearing
organizations.

    At December 31, 2000 the Company had $1.4 billion of outstanding letters of
credit from banks to satisfy various collateral and margin requirements.

COLLATERAL

    At December 31, 2000, the approximate market value of collateral received by
the Company that may be sold or repledged by the Company, excluding amounts
netted in accordance with FIN 39 and FIN 41, was $236.6 billion. This collateral
was received in connection with resale agreements, securities borrowings and
loans, derivative transactions, and margined broker loans.

    At December 31, 2000, a substantial portion of the collateral received by
the Company had been sold or repledged in connection with repurchase agreements,
securities sold, not yet purchased, securities borrowings and loans, pledges to
clearing organizations, segregation requirements under securities laws and
regulations, derivative transactions, and bank loans.

    In addition, at December 31, 2000, the Company had pledged $47.5 billion of
collateral that may not be sold or repledged by the secured parties.

LEASE COMMITMENTS

    Rental expense (principally for offices and computer equipment) was
$1.502 billion, $1.386 billion and $1.203 billion for the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Unused credit card and other consumer revolving
  commitments...............................................   $353.5     $311.4
</TABLE>

    The majority of unused commitments are contingent upon customers maintaining
specific credit standards. Commercial commitments generally have floating
interest rates and fixed expiration dates and may require payment of fees. Such
fees (net of certain direct costs) are deferred and, upon exercise of the
commitment, amortized over the life of the loan or, if exercise is deemed
remote, amortized over the commitment period. The table does not include
commercial letters of credit issued on behalf of customers and collateralized by
the underlying shipment of goods which totaled $6.8 billion and $5.3 billion at
December 31, 2000 and 1999.

------------------------

(1) Residential mortgages represent 71% of amounts in 2000 and 91% in 1999.

(2) Government National Mortgage Association sales/servicing agreements covering
    securitized residential mortgages.

    Citigroup and its subsidiaries are obligated under various credit
enhancements related to certain sales of loans or sales of participations in
pools of loans, as summarized above.

    Net revenue on securitized credit card receivables is collected over the
life of each sale transaction. The net revenue is based upon the sum of finance
charges and fees received from cardholders and interchange revenue earned on
cardholder transactions, less the sum of the yield paid to investors, credit
losses, transaction costs, and a contractual servicing fee, which is also
retained by certain Citigroup subsidiaries as servicers. As specified in certain
of the sale agreements, the net revenue collected each month is accumulated up
to a predetermined maximum amount, and is available over the remaining term of
that transaction to make payments of yield, fees, and transaction costs in the
event that net cash flows from the receivables are not sufficient. When the
predetermined amount is reached, net revenue is passed directly to the Citigroup
subsidiary that sold the receivables. The amount contained in these accounts is
included in other assets and was $66 million at December 31, 2000 and
$60 million at December 31, 1999. Net revenue from securitized credit card
receivables included in other revenue was $2.4 billion, $2.1 billion, and
$1.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998,
respectively.

    Various put options were written during 2000 and 1999 which require
Citigroup to purchase, upon request of the holders, securities issued in certain
securitization transactions in order to broaden the investor base and improve
execution in connection with the securitizations. These put options at year end
2000 include: a put option, exercisable in October of each year beginning in
October 2000, with respect to an aggregate of up to approximately $2 billion
principal amount of certificates backed by manufactured housing contract
receivables, of which approximately $133 million was exercised in 2000; a put
option, exercisable at any time after June 15, 2000, with respect to an
aggregate of up to

approximately $1 billion principal amount of notes secured by home equity loan
receivables only to the extent the securitization trust cannot meet its
obligation under a separate put option by the trust which is exercisable at any
time after March 15, 2000, and a put option, orginally exercisable at any time
after September 15, 2000, the exercise of which has been extended to April 12,
2001, with respect to an aggregate of up to approximately $1.25 billion of notes
secured by home equity loan receivables only to the extent the notes are not
purchased by the securitization trust pursuant to a separate put option issued
by the trust and exercisable at any time after June 15, 2000. In each case, if
exercised, the Company will be obligated to purchase the certificates or notes
at par plus accrued interest. The aggregate amortized amount of these options
was approximately $3.4 billion at December 31, 2000. Two option contracts from
1999 that were exercised in 2000 were the following: a put option, exercisable
any time after February 17, 2000, with respect to an aggregate of up to
$500 million principal amounts of certificates backed by credit card
receivables; and a put option, exercisable at any time after June 15, 2000, with
respect to an aggregate of up to approximately $1 billion of notes secured by
home equity loan receivables only to the extent the notes are not purchased by
the securitization trust pursuant to a separate put option issued by the trust
and exercisable at any time after March 15, 2000. The Company has recorded
liabilities totaling approximately $17 million at December 31, 2000 and
$23 million at December 31, 1999 in connection with these options. Subsequent to
their initial issuance, such options are marked to market with the fluctuation
being reflected in the statement of earnings.

FINANCIAL GUARANTEES

    Financial guarantees are used in various transactions to enhance the credit
standing of Citigroup customers. They represent irrevocable assurances, subject
to the satisfaction of certain conditions, that Citigroup will make payment in
the event that the customer fails to fulfill its obligations to third parties.

    Citicorp issues financial standby letters of credit which are obligations to
pay a third-party beneficiary when a customer fails to repay an outstanding loan
or debt instrument, such as assuring payments by a foreign reinsurer to a U.S.
insurer, to act as a substitute for an escrow account, to provide a payment
mechanism for a customer's third-party obligations, and to assure payment of
specified financial obligations of a customer. Fees are recognized ratably over
the term of the standby letter of credit. The following table summarizes
financial standby letters of credit issued by Citicorp. The table does not
include securities lending indemnifications issued to customers, which are fully

OTHER COMMITMENTS

    Salomon Smith Barney and a principal broker-dealer subsidiary have each
provided a portion of a residual value guarantee in the amount of $586 million
in connection with the lease of the buildings occupied by Salomon Smith Barney's
executive offices and New York operations.

    The Company makes commitments to fund partnership investments and transfers
receivables to third parties with recourse from time to time. The off-balance
sheet risks of these financial instruments were not significant at December 31,
2000 or 1999.

27.  CONTINGENCIES

    In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup and/or its subsidiaries are
defendants or co-defendants in various litigation matters, other than
environmental and asbestos property and casualty insurance claims as discussed
in Note 13. Although there can be no assurances, the Company believes, based on
information currently available, that the ultimate resolution of these legal
proceedings would not be likely to have a material adverse effect on its results
of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.

(1) Accounting changes include the 1999 first quarter adoption of Statement of
    Position (SOP) 97-3, "Accounting by Insurance and Other Enterprises for
    Insurance-Related Assessments" of ($135) million; SOP 98-7, "Deposit
    Accounting: Accounting for Insurance and Reinsurance Contracts That Do Not
    Transfer Insurance Risk" of $23 million; and SOP 98-5, "Reporting on the
    Costs of Start-Up Activities" of ($15) million. See Note 1.

(2) Amounts represent Citigroup's historical dividends per common share.

    The selected quarterly financial data gives retroactive effect to the
acquisition of Associates in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of
interests. The pooling of interests method of accounting requires the
restatement of all periods presented as if the companies had always been
combined. Certain reclassifications and adjustments have been recorded to
conform the accounting policies and presentations of Citigroup and Associates
(see Note 2).

    Due to changes in the number of average shares outstanding, quarterly
earnings per share of common stock may not add to the totals for the years. Per
share data have been adjusted to give effect to the four-for-three split in
Citigroup's common stock as discussed in Note 1.

    The fourth, third, and second quarters of 2000 include $381 million
after-tax ($538 million pretax), $15 million after-tax ($24 million pretax), and
$11 million after-tax ($17 million pretax), respectively, of restructuring
charges, and in the 2000 fourth and third quarters, include $119 million
after-tax ($143 million pretax) and $22 million after-tax ($34 million pretax),
respectively, of merger-related costs. The fourth quarter of 2000 includes a
$135 million after-tax ($210 million pretax) transportation loss provision
related to Associates' truck loan and leasing portfolio. The first quarter of
2000 includes a $71 million after-tax ($112 million pretax) charge related to
the discontinuation of Associates Housing Finance loan originations. The fourth,
third, and first quarters of 1999 include $51 million after-tax ($82 million
pretax), $31 million after-tax ($49 million pretax), and $22 million after-tax
($35 million pretax), respectively, of restructuring charges. The fourth and
second quarters of 2000

reductions of prior charges of $76 million after-tax ($122 million pretax),
$41 million after-tax ($68 million pretax), and $125 million after-tax

quarters also include $4 million after-tax ($7 million pretax), $8 million
after-tax ($12 million pretax), $19 million after-tax ($29 million pretax), and
$12 million after-tax ($20 million pretax), respectively, of

(1) Consumer credit losses and recoveries primarily relate to revolving credit
    and installment loans.

(2) In 2000 and 1999, primarily includes the addition of allowance for credit
    losses related to acquisitions and foreign currency translation effects. In
    1998, reflects the addition of $320 million of credit loss reserves related
    to the acquisition of the Universal Card portfolio. In 1997, $373 million
    was restored to the allowance for credit losses that had previously been
    attributed to credit card securitization transactions where the exposure to
    credit losses was contractually limited to the cash flows from the
    securitized receivables, $50 million attributable to standby letters of
    credit and guarantees was reclassified to other liabilities, and
    $50 million attributable to derivative and foreign exchange contracts was
    reclassified as a deduction from trading account assets.

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY RESERVES

    Property and casualty claim reserves are established to account for the
estimated ultimate costs of claims and claim adjustment expenses for claims that
have been reported but not yet settled and claims that have been incurred but
not reported. The Company establishes reserves by major product line, coverage
and year.

    The table on page 165 sets forth the year-end reserves from 1990 through
2000, and the subsequent changes in those reserves, presented on a historical
basis for the Company. The original estimates, cumulative amounts paid, and
reestimated reserves in the table for the years 1990 - 1995 have not been
restated to include the property-casualty insurance businesses acquired by the
Company from Aetna Services, Inc. in 1996 (Aetna P&C). Beginning in 1996, the
table includes the reserve activity of Aetna P&C. The data in the table is
presented in accordance with reporting requirements of the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Care must be taken to avoid misinterpretation by those
unfamiliar with such information or familiar with other data commonly reported
by the insurance industry. The following data is not accident year data, but
rather a display of 1990 - 2000 year-end reserves and the subsequent changes in
those reserves. For instance, the "cumulative deficiency or redundancy" shown in
the table for each year represents the aggregate amount by which original
estimates of reserves as of that year-end have changed in subsequent years.
Accordingly, the cumulative deficiency for a year relates only to reserves at
that year-end and such amounts are not additive. Expressed another way, if the
original reserves at the end of 1990 included $4 million for a loss that is
finally paid in 2000 for $5 million, the $1 million deficiency (the excess of
the actual payment of $5 million over the original estimate of $4 million) would
be included in the cumulative deficiencies in each of the years 1990 - 1999
shown in the table.

    Certain factors may distort the reestimated reserves and cumulative
deficiency or redundancy shown in the table. For example, a substantial portion
of the cumulative deficiencies shown in the table arise from claims on policies
written prior to the mid-1970s involving liability exposures such as
environmental, asbestos, and other cumulative injury claims. In the post-1984
period, the Company developed more stringent underwriting standards and policy
exclusions and significantly contracted or terminated the writing of such risks.

Condition and Results of Operations--Environmental Claims, Asbestos Claims and
Cumulative Injury Other than Asbestos Claims." General conditions and trends
that have affected the development of these liabilities in the past will not
necessarily recur in the future.

    Other factors that affect the data in the table include the discounting of
workers' compensation reserves and the use of retrospectively rated insurance
policies. To the extent permitted under applicable accounting practices,
workers' compensation reserves are discounted to reflect the time value of
money, due to the relatively long time period over which these claims are to be
paid. Apparent deficiencies will continue to occur as the discount on these
workers' compensation reserves is accreted at the appropriate interest rates.
Also, a portion of National Accounts business is underwritten with
retrospectively rated insurance policies in which the ultimate loss experience
is primarily borne by the insured. For this business, increases in loss
experience result in an increase in reserves, and an offsetting increase in
amounts recoverable from insureds. Likewise, decreases in loss experience result
in a decrease in reserves, and an offsetting decrease in amounts recoverable
from these insureds. The amounts recoverable on these retrospectively rated
policies mitigate the impact of the cumulative deficiencies or redundancies but
are not reflected in the table.

    Because of these and other factors, it is difficult to develop a meaningful
extrapolation of estimated future redundancies or deficiencies in loss reserves
from the data in the table. The differences between the reserves for claims and
claim adjustment expenses shown in the table, which is prepared in accordance
with GAAP, and those reported in the annual statements of the Company's
subsidiaries filed with state insurance departments, which are prepared in
accordance with statutory accounting practices, were: $9 million, $38 million,
and $37 million for the years 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY REINSURANCE

    TPC reinsures a portion of the risks it underwrites in order to control its
exposure to losses, stabilize earnings, and protect capital resources. TPC cedes
to reinsurers a portion of these risks and pays premiums based upon the risk and
exposure of the policies subject to such reinsurance.

                                      165
<PAGE>
Reinsurance involves credit risk and is generally subject to aggregate loss
limits. Although the reinsurer is liable to TPC to the extent of the reinsurance
ceded, TPC remains primarily liable as the direct insurer on all risks
reinsured. TPC also holds collateral, including escrow funds and letters of
credit, under certain reinsurance agreements. TPC monitors the financial
condition of reinsurers on an ongoing basis, and reviews its reinsurance
arrangements periodically. Reinsurers are selected based on their financial
condition, business practices, and the price of their product offerings. For
additional information concerning reinsurance, see Note 14 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

    TPC utilizes a variety of reinsurance agreements to control its exposure to
large property and casualty losses.

    NET RETENTION POLICY.  The descriptions below relate to reinsurance
arrangements of TPC in effect at January 1, 2001. For third-party liability,
including automobile no-fault, the reinsurance agreements used by Construction,
and Select Accounts limit the net retention to a maximum of $4 million per
insured, per occurrence and for Commercial Accounts limits the net retention to
a maximum of $6 million per insured, per occurrence. Gulf Insurance Company, a
wholly-owned subsidiary, in its specialty lines of business utilizes various
reinsurance mechanisms and has limited its net retention to a maximum of
$3.8 million per risk for any line of business. For commercial property
insurance, there is a $5 million maximum retention per risk with 100%
reinsurance coverage for risks with higher limits. The reinsurance agreement in
place for workers' compensation policies written by Commercial Accounts,
Construction, National Accounts, Select Accounts, and some segments of
Alternative Markets and Gulf Specialty covers 100% of each loss between
$1 million and $10 million and 90% of each loss between $10 million and
$20 million. For National Accounts, reinsurance arrangements are typically
tiered, or layered, such that only levels of risk acceptable to TPC are
retained. Personal Lines retains the first $5 million of umbrella policies and
purchases facultative reinsurance for limits over $5 million. For personal
property insurance, there is a $6 million maximum retention per risk. For
executive liability coverages such as errors and omissions liability, directors'
and officers' liability, employment practices liability and blended insurance,
Bond Specialty retains from $2 million up to $5 million per risk. For surety
protection, Bond Specialty generally retains up to $10 million per principal.
The risk tolerance of Bond Specialty varies by line of business and by risk.

    CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE.  TPC utilizes reinsurance agreements with
nonaffiliated reinsurers to control its exposure to losses resulting from one
occurrence. For the accumulation of net property losses arising out of one
occurrence, reinsurance agreements cover 40% of total losses between
$250 million and $750 million. For multiple workers' compensation losses arising
from a single occurrence, reinsurance agreements cover 100% of losses between
$20 million and $250 million and, for workers' compensation losses caused by
property perils, reinsurance agreements cover 40% of losses between
$250 million and $750 million.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

    BANK HOLDING COMPANY REGULATION.  The Company is a bank holding company
within the meaning of the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act)
registered with, and subject to examination by, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB).
The subsidiary depository institutions of the Company (the banking
subsidiaries), including its principal bank subsidiary, Citibank, N.A.
(Citibank), are subject to supervision and examination by their respective
federal and state banking authorities. The nationally chartered subsidiary
banks, including Citibank, are supervised and examined by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC); federal savings association subsidiaries are
regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS); and state-chartered
depository institutions are supervised by the banking departments within their
respective states (New York, Delaware, South Dakota, and Utah), as well as the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC also has back-up
enforcement authority with respect to each of the banking subsidiaries, the
deposits of which are insured by the FDIC, up to applicable limits. The Company
also controls (either directly or indirectly) overseas banks, branches,

                                      166
<PAGE>
and agencies. In general, the Company's overseas activities are regulated by the
FRB and OCC, and are also regulated by supervisory authorities of the host
countries.

    The Company's banking subsidiaries are also subject to requirements and
restrictions under federal, state, and foreign law, including requirements to
maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of
loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged thereon, and
limitations on the types of investments that may be made and the types of
services that may be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect
the operations of the Company's banking subsidiaries.

    The activities of U.S. bank holding companies are generally limited to the
business of banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities that
the FRB determines to be so closely related to banking or managing or
controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. In addition, under the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the GLB Act), which became effective in most significant
respects on March 11, 2000, bank holding companies, such as the Company, all of
whose controlled depository institutions are "well capitalized" and "well
managed", as defined in Federal Reserve Regulation Y, and which obtain
satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act ratings, have the ability to declare
themselves to be "financial holding companies" and engage in a broader spectrum
of activities, including insurance underwriting and brokerage (including
annuities), and underwriting and dealing securities without a revenue limit and
without limits on the amounts of equity securities it may hold in conducting its
underwriting and dealing activities. The Company's declaration to become a
financial holding company became effective on the first eligible date, and as a
result, it is permitted to continue to operate its insurance businesses as
currently structured and, if it so determines, to expand those businesses.
Financial holding companies that do not continue to meet all of the requirements
for such status will, depending on which requirement they fail to meet, face not
being able to undertake new activities or acquisitions that are financial in
nature, or losing their ability to continue those activities that are not
generally permissible for bank holding companies. Under the BHC Act, after two
years from the date as of which the Company became a bank holding company, the
Company was required to conform any activities that were not considered to be
closely related to banking or financial in nature under the BHC Act. This
two-year period may be extended by the FRB for three additional one-year
periods, upon application by the Company and finding by the FRB that such an
extension would not be detrimental to the public interest. The Company obtained
such an extension with respect to several activities in October 2000.

    Section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibited a member bank of the
Federal Reserve System, such as Citibank, from being affiliated with a company
that is principally engaged in underwriting and dealing in securities, was
repealed, effective March 11, 2000, as part of the GLB Act. Accordingly, the
Company is permitted to operate without regard to revenue limits on "ineligible"
securities activities and to acquire other securities firms without regard to
such limits. The repeal of Section 20 also permits the Company's securities
subsidiaries to organize, sponsor, distribute, and advise open-end mutual funds
in the United States, as well as outside the United States.

    Under the BHC Act, nonbank acquisitions in the U.S. have generally been
limited to 5% of voting shares unless the FRB determines that the acquisition is
so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to banking or managing
or controlling banks. Under the GLB Act, financial holding companies are able to
make acquisitions in companies that engage in activities that are financial in
nature, both in the U.S. and outside of the United States. No prior approval of
the FRB is generally required for such acquisitions except for the acquisition
of U.S. depository institutions and foreign banks. In addition, under a new
merchant banking authority added by the GLB Act, financial holding companies are
authorized to invest in companies that engage in activities that are not
financial in nature, as long as the financial holding company makes its
investment with the intention of limiting the investment in duration, does not
manage the company on a day-to-day basis, and the investee company does not
cross-market with any of the financial holding company's controlled depository
institutions. This

                                      167
<PAGE>
authority applies to investments both in the U.S. and outside the United States.
Regulations interpreting and conditioning this authority have been promulgated.
Bank holding companies also retain their authority, subject to prior specific or
general FRB consent, to acquire less than 20 percent of the voting securities of
a company that does not do business in the United States, and 20 percent or more
of the voting securities of any such company if the FRB finds by regulation or
order that its activities are usual in connection with banking or finance
outside the United States. In general, bank holding companies that are not
financial holding companies may engage in a broader range of activities outside
the United States than they may engage in inside the United States, including
sponsoring, distributing, and advising open-end mutual funds, and underwriting
and dealing in debt, and to a limited extent, equity securities, subject to
local country laws.

    Subject to certain limitations and restrictions, a U.S. bank holding
company, with the prior approval of the FRB, may acquire an out-of-state bank.
Banks in states that do not prohibit out-of-state mergers may merge with the
approval of the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency. A national or state
bank may establish a de novo branch out of state if such branching is expressly
permitted by the other state. A federal savings association is generally
permitted to open a de novo branch in any state.

    Outside the U.S., subject to certain requirements for prior FRB consent or
notice, the Company may acquire banks and Citibank may establish branches
subject to local laws and to U.S. laws prohibiting companies from doing business
in certain countries.

    The Company's earnings and activities are affected by legislation, by
actions of its regulators, and by local legislative and administrative bodies
and decisions of courts in the foreign and domestic jurisdictions in which the
Company and its subsidiaries conduct business. For example, these include
limitations on the ability of certain subsidiaries to pay dividends to their
intermediate holding companies and on the abilities of those holding companies
to pay dividends to the Company (see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements). It is the policy of the FRB that bank holding companies should pay
cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year
and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization's
expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that bank
holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines
the bank holding company's ability to serve as a source of strength to its
banking subsidiaries.

    Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends
that subsidiary banks and savings associations can pay to their holding
companies without regulatory approval. In addition to these explicit
limitations, the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a
banking subsidiary or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound
banking practice. Depending upon the circumstances, the agencies could take the
position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking
practice.

    Numerous other federal and state laws also affect the Company's earnings and
activities including federal and state consumer protection laws. Legislation may
be enacted or regulation imposed in the U.S. or its political subdivisions, or
in any other jurisdiction in which the Company does business, to further
regulate banking and financial services or to limit finance charges or other
fees or charges earned in such activities. There can be no assurance whether any
such legislation or regulation will place additional limitations on the
Company's operations or adversely affect its earnings.

    There are various legal restrictions on the extent to which a bank holding
company and certain of its nonbank subsidiaries can borrow or otherwise obtain
credit from banking subsidiaries or engage in certain other transactions with or
involving those banking subsidiaries. In general, these restrictions require
that any such transactions must be on terms that would ordinarily be offered to
unaffiliated entities and secured by designated amounts of specified collateral.
Transactions between a banking subsidiary and the holding company or any nonbank
subsidiary are limited to 10 percent of the banking

                                      168
<PAGE>
subsidiary's capital stock and surplus, and as to the holding company and all
such nonbank subsidiaries in the aggregate, to 20 percent of the bank's capital
stock and surplus.

    The Company's right to participate in the distribution of assets of any
subsidiary upon the subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization will be subject
to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors. In the event of a liquidation
or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of
depositors and other general or subordinated creditors are entitled to a
priority of payment over the claims of holders of any obligation of the
institution to its stockholders, including any depository institution holding
company (such as the Company) or any stockholder or creditor thereof.

    In the liquidation or other resolution of a failed U.S. insured depository
institution, deposits in U.S. offices and certain claims for administrative
expenses and employee compensation are afforded a priority over other general
unsecured claims, including deposits in offices outside the U.S., non-deposit
claims in all offices, and claims of a parent such as the Company. Such priority
creditors would include the FDIC, which succeeds to the position of insured
depositors.

    A financial institution insured by the FDIC that is under common control
with a failed or failing FDIC-insured institution can be required to indemnify
the FDIC for losses resulting from the insolvency of the failed institution,
even if this causes the affiliated institution also to become insolvent. Any
obligations or liability owed by a subsidiary depository institution to its
parent company is subordinate to the subsidiary's cross-guarantee liability with
respect to commonly controlled insured depository institutions and to the rights
of depositors.

    Under FRB policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of
financial strength to each of its banking subsidiaries and commit resources to
their support. As a result of that policy, the Company may be required to commit
resources to its subsidiary banks in certain circumstances. However, under the
GLB Act, the FRB is not able to compel a bank holding company to remove capital
from its regulated securities or insurance subsidiaries in order to commit such
resources to its subsidiary banks.

    The Company and its U.S. insured depository institution subsidiaries are
subject to risk-based capital and leverage guidelines issued by U.S. regulators
for banks, savings associations, and bank holding companies. The regulatory
agencies are required by law to take specific prompt actions with respect to
institutions that do not meet minimum capital standards and have defined five
capital tiers, the highest of which is "well-capitalized." As of December 31,
2000, the Company's bank and thrift subsidiaries, including Citibank, were "well
capitalized." See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations" for capital analysis.

    A bank is not required to repay a deposit at a branch outside the U.S. if
the branch cannot repay the deposit due to an act of war, civil strife, or
action taken by the government in the host country, unless the bank has
expressly agreed in writing to do so.

    The GLB Act included the most extensive consumer privacy provisions ever
enacted by Congress. These provisions, among other things, require full
disclosure of the Company's privacy policy to consumers and mandate offering the
consumer the ability to "opt out" of having non-public customer information
disclosed to third parties. Pursuant to these provisions, the federal banking
regulators have adopted privacy regulations. In addition, the states are
permitted to adopt more extensive privacy protections through legislation or
regulation. There can be no assurance whether any such legislation or regulation
will place additional limitations on the Company's operations or adversely
affect its earnings. The preceding statement is a forward-looking statement
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. See
"Forward-Looking Statements" on page 59.

    The earnings of the Company, Citibank, and their subsidiaries and affiliates
are affected by general economic conditions and the conduct of monetary and
fiscal policy by the U.S. government and by governments in other countries in
which they do business.

                                      169
<PAGE>
    Legislation is from time to time introduced in Congress that may change
banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company and its banking
subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways. The Company cannot determine
whether any such proposed legislation will be enacted, and if enacted, the
ultimate effect that any such potential legislation or implementing regulations
would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of the Company
or its subsidiaries.

INSURANCE--STATE REGULATION

    The Company's insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the
various states and jurisdictions in which they transact business. The
regulation, supervision and administration relate, among other things, to the
standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, the licensing of insurers
and their agents, the lines of insurance in which they may engage, the nature of
and limitations on investments, premium rates, restrictions on the size of risks
that may be insured under a single policy, reserves and provisions for unearned
premiums, losses and other obligations, deposits of securities for the benefit
of policyholders, approval of policy forms and the regulation of market conduct
including the use of credit information in underwriting as well as other
underwriting and claims practices. In addition, many states have enacted
variations of competitive rate-making laws which allow insurers to set certain
premium rates for certain classes of insurance without having to obtain the
prior approval of the state insurance department. State insurance departments
also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and
require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial
condition of companies and other matters.

    Although the Company is not regulated as an insurance company, it is the
owner, through various holding company subsidiaries, of the capital stock of its
insurance subsidiaries and as such is subject to state insurance holding company
statutes, as well as certain other laws, of each of the states of domicile of
its insurance subsidiaries. All holding company statutes, as well as certain
other laws, require disclosure and, in some instances, prior approval of
material transactions between an insurance company and an affiliate.

    The Company's insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory
and regulatory restrictions in each company's state of domicile, which limit the
amount of dividends or distributions by an insurance company to its
stockholders. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

    The Company's property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are also required
to participate in various involuntary assigned risk pools, principally involving
workers' compensation and automobile insurance, which provide various insurance
coverages to individuals or other entities that otherwise are unable to purchase
such coverage in the voluntary market. Participation in these pools in most
states is generally in proportion to voluntary writings of related lines of
business in that state.

    Many state insurance regulatory laws intended primarily for the protection
of policyholders contain provisions that require advance approval by state
agencies of any change in control of an insurance company that is domiciled (or,
in some cases, having such substantial business that it is deemed to be
commercially domiciled) in that state. "Control" is generally presumed to exist
through the ownership of 10% or more of the voting securities of a domestic
insurance company or of any company that controls a domestic insurance company.
In addition, many state insurance regulatory laws contain provisions that
require prenotification to state agencies of a change in control of a
nondomestic admitted insurance company in that state. Such requirements may
deter, delay or prevent certain transactions affecting the control of or the
ownership of the Company's common stock, including transactions that could be
advantageous to the stockholders of the Company.

                                      170
<PAGE>
SECURITIES REGULATION

    Certain U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries are subject to various securities and
commodities regulations and capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the
regulatory and exchange authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate.

    The Company's registered broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the
Securities and Exchange Commission's (the SEC) net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1
(the Net Capital Rule), promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Net Capital Rule
requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, as defined. The Net Capital
Rule also limits the ability of broker-dealers to transfer large amounts of
capital to parent companies and other affiliates. Compliance with the Net
Capital Rule could limit those operations of the Company that require the
intensive use of capital, such as underwriting and trading activities and the
financing of customer account balances, and also could restrict Salomon Smith
Barney Holdings Inc.'s ability to withdraw capital from its broker-dealer
subsidiaries, which in turn could limit Salomon Smith Barney Holdings Inc.'s
ability to pay dividends and make payments on its debt. See Notes 12 and 18 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of the Company's broker-
dealer subsidiaries are also subject to regulation in the countries outside of
the U.S. in which they do business. Such regulations include requirements to
maintain specified levels of net capital or its equivalent.

    The Company is the indirect parent of investment advisers registered and
regulated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who provide investment
advice to investment companies subject to regulation under the Investment
Company Act of 1940. Under these Acts, advisory contracts between the Company's
investment adviser subsidiaries and these investment companies (Affiliated
Funds) would automatically terminate upon an assignment of such contracts by the
investment adviser. Such an assignment would be presumed to have occurred if any
party were to acquire more than 25% of the Company's voting securities. In that
event, consent to the assignment from the shareholders of the Affiliated Funds
involved would be needed for the advisory relationship to continue. In addition,
subsidiaries of the Company and the Affiliated Funds are subject to certain
restrictions in their dealings with each other.

COMPETITION

    The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to intense competition in all
aspects of their businesses from both bank and non-bank institutions that
provide financial services and, in some of their activities, from government
agencies.

GENERAL BUSINESS FACTORS

    In the judgment of the Company, no material part of the business of the
Company and its subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or group of
customers, the loss of any one of which would have a materially adverse effect
on the Company, and no one customer or group of affiliated customers accounts
for as much as 10% of the Company's consolidated revenues.

    At December 31, 2000, the Company had approximately 138,000 full-time and
9,000 part-time employees in the United States and approximately 95,000
employees outside of the United States.

PROPERTIES

    The Company's executive offices are located at 399 Park Avenue, New York,
New York. 399 Park Avenue is a 39-story office building of which two-thirds is
presently owned by Citibank and is occupied by the Company and certain of its
subsidiaries, including the principal offices of Citicorp and Citibank. Citibank
has entered into a contract to purchase the balance of 399 Park Avenue, in
exchange for its

                                      171
<PAGE>
ownership interest in Citigroup Center. The exchange is scheduled to close
before the end of the first quarter 2001.

    Citibank currently owns one-third of Citigroup Center, a 59-story multi-use
complex located at 153 East 53rd Street, New York, New York. The Company and
certain of its subsidiaries occupy this office space in Citigroup Center and
will, after the exchange described above, continue to occupy it under a
long-term lease. Citibank owns a building in Long Island City, New York and
leases a building located at 111 Wall Street in New York City, which are totally
occupied by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.

    The Company's property-casualty insurance subsidiaries lease 180 field
offices throughout the United States. The principal offices of TIC, TLAC, and
TPC are located in Hartford, Connecticut. All of such occupied space is owned by
TIC. TPC also rents space from Aetna Services, Inc. at CityPlace, located in
Hartford, Connecticut.

    The Company's life insurance subsidiaries lease office space at
approximately 20 locations throughout the United States. TIC and/or The
Travelers Insurance Group Inc. lease two other buildings in Hartford,
Connecticut, most of which is subleased to third parties. TIC also owns a
building in Norcross, Georgia that is occupied by its information systems
department.

    Salomon Smith Barney leases two buildings located at 388 and 390 Greenwich
Street in New York City. These leases, which expire in 2003, include a purchase
option with respect to the related properties. The principal offices of Salomon
Smith Barney are located at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York.
Additionally, Salomon Smith Barney leases space at 7 World Trade Center.

    Associates maintains its principal offices in Irving, Texas, in facilities
which are, in part, owned and, in part, leased by it. Associates has office and
branch sites for its business units throughout the United States, Canada, Asia
(Japan, Taiwan, Philippines and Hong Kong), Europe and Latin America. The
majority of these sites are leased, and, although numerous, none is material to
Associates' operations.

    Other offices and certain warehouse space are owned, none of which is
material to the Company's financial condition or operations.

    The Company believes its properties are adequate and suitable for its
business as presently conducted and are adequately maintained. For further
information concerning leases, see Note 26 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup and its subsidiaries are
defendants or co-defendants in various litigation matters incidental to and
typical of the businesses in which they are engaged. These include civil
actions, arbitration proceedings and other matters in which the Company's
broker-dealer subsidiaries have been named, arising in the normal course of
business out of activities as a broker and dealer in securities, as an
underwriter of securities, as an investment banker or otherwise. These also
include numerous matters in which the Company's insurance subsidiaries are
named, arising in the normal course of their business. In the opinion of the
Company's management, the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings would
not be likely to have a material adverse effect on the results of the Company
and its subsidiaries' operations, financial condition, or liquidity.
