Business       General       Bank of America Corporation (together, with its consolidated     subsidiaries, Bank of America, the Corporation, our company, we     or us) is a Delaware corporation, a bank holding company and a     financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. When     used in this report, the Corporation may refer to     the Corporation individually, the Corporation and its     subsidiaries, or certain of the Corporations subsidiaries     or affiliates. Our principal executive offices are located in     the Bank of America Corporate Center, 100 North Tryon Street,     Charlotte, North Carolina 28255.       Bank of America is one of the worlds largest financial     institutions, serving individual consumers, small- and     middle-market businesses, large corporations and governments     with a full range of banking, investing, asset management and     other financial and risk management products and services.     Through our banking subsidiaries (the Banks) and various     nonbanking subsidiaries throughout the United States and in     certain international markets, we provide a diversified range of     banking and nonbanking financial services and products through     six business segments: Deposits, Global Card Services, Home     Loans & Insurance, Global Commercial Banking, Global     Banking & Markets (GBAM) and Global     Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), with the     remaining operations recorded in All Other. Effective     January 1, 2010, we realigned the Global Corporate and     Investment Banking portion of the former Global Banking     business segment with the former Global Markets     business segment to form GBAM and to reflect     Global Commercial Banking as a standalone segment.       We are a global franchise, serving customers and clients around     the world with operations in all 50 U.S. states, the     District of Columbia and more than 40     non-U.S. countries.

Bank of America     2010     1     Table of Contents         Competition       We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors     include banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment banking firms,     investment advisory firms, brokerage firms, investment     companies, insurance companies, mortgage banking companies,     credit card issuers, mutual fund companies and     e-commerce     and other internet-based companies in addition to those     competitors discussed more specifically below. We compete with     some of these competitors globally and with others on a regional     or product basis. Competition is based on a number of factors     including, among others, customer service, quality and range of     products and services offered, price, reputation, interest rates     on loans and deposits, lending limits and customer convenience.     Our ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in     large part on our ability to attract new employees and retain     and motivate our existing employees, while managing compensation     and other costs.       More specifically, our Deposits business segment competes     with banks, thrifts, credit unions, finance companies and other     nonbank organizations offering financial services. Our Global     Commercial Banking business segment competes with local,     regional and international banks and nonbank financial     organizations. Our GBAM and GWIM business segments     compete with U.S. and international commercial banking and     investment banking firms, investment advisory firms, brokerage     firms, investment companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, private     equity funds, trust banks, multi-family offices, advice     boutiques and other organizations offering similar services and     other investment alternatives available to investors. Our     Home Loans & Insurance business segment     competes with banks, thrifts, mortgage brokers, Fannie Mae     (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (collectively, the government     sponsored enterprises (GSEs)), and other nonbank organizations     offering mortgage banking, mortgage and insurance related     services. Our Global Card Services business segment     competes in the United States and internationally with banks,     consumer finance companies and retail stores with private label     credit and debit cards.       We also compete actively for funds. A primary source of funds     for the Banks is deposits, and competition for deposits includes     other deposit-taking organizations, such as banks, thrifts and     credit unions, as well as money market mutual funds. Investment     banks and other entities that became bank holding companies and     financial holding companies as a result of the recent financial     crisis are also competitors for deposits. In addition, we     compete for funding in the domestic and international short-term     and long-term debt securities capital markets.       Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry     have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a     broad range of financial services have been acquired by or     merged into other firms or have declared bankruptcy. As a     result, this consolidation within the financial services     industry has significantly increased the capital base and     geographic reach of some of our competitors and also hastened     the globalization of the securities markets. These developments     could result in our remaining competitors gaining greater     capital and other resources or having stronger local presences     and longer operating histories outside the United States.             Our ability to expand certain of our banking operations in     additional U.S. states remains subject to various federal     and state laws. See Government Supervision and     Regulation  General below for a more detailed     discussion of interstate banking and branching legislation and     certain state legislation.     Employees       As of December 31, 2010, there were approximately     288,000 full-time equivalent employees with Bank of     America. Of these employees, approximately 80,700 were employed     within Deposits, approximately 15,000 were employed     within Global Card Services, approximately 58,200 were     employed within Home Loans & Insurance,     approximately 7,100 were employed within Global Commercial     Banking, approximately 34,300 were employed within GBAM     and approximately 40,300 were employed within GWIM.     The remainder were employed elsewhere within our company     including various staff and support functions.       None of our domestic employees is subject to a collective     bargaining agreement. Management considers our employee     relations to be good.     Acquisition and     Disposition Activity       As part of our operations, we regularly evaluate the potential     acquisition of, and hold discussions with, various financial     institutions and other businesses of a type eligible for     financial holding company ownership or control. In addition, we     regularly analyze the values of, and submit bids for, the     acquisition of customer-based funds and other liabilities and     assets of such financial institutions and other businesses. We     also regularly consider the potential disposition of certain of     our assets, branches, subsidiaries or lines of businesses. As a     general rule, we publicly announce any material acquisitions or     dispositions when a material definitive agreement has been     reached.       On January 1, 2009, we completed the acquisition of Merrill     Lynch. Additional information on our acquisitions is included in     Note 2  Merger and Restructuring Activity     to the Consolidated Financial Statements which is     incorporated herein by reference.     Government     Supervision and Regulation       The following discussion describes, among other things, elements     of an extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding     companies, financial holding companies and banks, including     specific information about Bank of America. U.S. federal     regulation of banks, bank holding companies and financial     holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of     depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) rather than for     the protection of stockholders and creditors. For additional     information about recent regulatory programs, initiatives and     legislation that impact us, see Regulatory Matters in the     MD&A beginning on page 56.               2     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents         General       As a registered financial holding company and bank holding     company, Bank of America Corporation is subject to the     supervision of, and regular inspection by, the Board of     Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board).     The Banks are organized as national banking associations, which     are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the     Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (Comptroller or OCC),     the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal     Reserve Board and other federal and state regulatory agencies.       A U.S. financial holding company, and the companies under     its control, are permitted to engage in activities considered     financial in nature as defined by the     Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related Federal Reserve Board     interpretations (including, without limitation, insurance and     securities activities), and therefore may engage in a broader     range of activities than permitted for bank holding companies     and their subsidiaries, which are only permitted to engage in     activities that are closely related to the business of banking.     Unless otherwise limited by the Federal Reserve Board, a     financial holding company may engage directly or indirectly in     activities considered financial in nature, either de novo or by     acquisition, provided the financial holding company gives the     Federal Reserve Board     after-the-fact     notice of the new activities. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also     permits national banks, such as the Banks, to engage in     activities considered financial in nature through a financial     subsidiary, subject to certain conditions and limitations and     with the approval of the OCC. If the Federal Reserve Board finds     that any of the Banks is not well-capitalized or well-managed,     we would be required to enter into an agreement with the Federal     Reserve Board to comply with all applicable capital and     management requirements, which may contain additional     limitations or conditions relating to our activities.       U.S. bank holding companies (including bank holding     companies that also are financial holding companies) are also     required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve     Board before acquiring more than five percent of any class of     voting stock of any non-affiliated bank. Pursuant to the     Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of     1994 (Interstate Banking and Branching Act), a bank holding     company may acquire banks located in states other than its home     state without regard to the permissibility of such acquisitions     under state law, but subject to any state requirement that the           bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of     time, not to exceed five years, and the federal requirement that     the bank holding company, after and as a result of the proposed     acquisition, controls no more than 10 percent of the total     amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the     United States and no more than 30 percent or such lesser or     greater amount set by state law of such deposits in that state.     Subject to certain restrictions, the Interstate Banking and     Branching Act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines     to create interstate banks. At December 31, 2010, we     controlled approximately 12 percent of the total amount of     deposits of insured depository institutions in the United States.       In addition to banking laws, regulations and regulatory     agencies, we are subject to various other laws and regulations,     as well as supervision and examination by other regulatory     agencies, all of which directly or indirectly affect our     operations and management and our ability to make distributions     to stockholders. For example, our U.S. broker dealer     subsidiaries are subject to regulation by and supervision of the     Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York Stock     Exchange and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority     (FINRA); our commodities businesses in the United States are     subject to regulation by and supervision of the Commodities     Futures Trading Commission (CFTC); and our insurance activities     are subject to licensing and regulation by state insurance     regulatory agencies.       Our     non-U.S. businesses     are also subject to extensive regulation by various     non-U.S. regulators,     including governments, securities exchanges, central banks and     other regulatory bodies, in the jurisdictions in which those     businesses operate. Our financial services operations in the     United Kingdom (U.K.) are subject to regulation by and     supervision of the Financial Services Authority (FSA). In July     of 2010, the U.K. proposed abolishing the FSA and replacing it     with the Financial Policy Committee within the Bank of England     (FPC) and two new Regulators, the Prudential Regulatory     Authority (PRA) and the Consumer Protection and Markets     Authority (CPMA). Our U.K. regulated entities will be subject to     the supervision of the FPC within the Bank of England for     prudential matters and the CPMA for conduct of business matters.     The new financial regulatory structure is intended to be in     place by the end of 2012. We continue to monitor the development     and potential impact of this regulatory restructuring.               Bank of America     2010     3     Table of Contents         Changes in     Legislation and Regulations       Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the     banking and financial services industries are frequently     introduced in Congress, in state legislatures and before the     various bank regulatory or financial regulatory agencies as well     as by lawmakers and regulators in jurisdictions outside the     United States where we operate. Congress and the federal     government have continued to evaluate and develop legislation,     programs and initiatives designed to, among other things,     stabilize the financial and housing markets, stimulate the     economy, including the federal governments foreclosure     prevention program, and prevent future financial crises by     further regulating the financial services industry. As a result     of the recent financial crisis and the ongoing challenging     economic environment, we anticipate additional legislative and     regulatory proposals and initiatives as well as continued     legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services     industry. However, at this time we cannot determine the final     form of any proposed programs or initiatives or related     legislation, the likelihood and timing of any other future     proposals or legislation, and the impact they might have on us.       On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and     Consumer Protection Act (Financial Reform Act) was signed into     law. The Financial Reform Act provides for sweeping financial     regulatory reform and will alter the way in which we conduct     certain businesses.       The Financial Reform Act contains a broad range of significant     provisions that could affect our businesses, including, without     limitation, the following:                   mandating that the Federal Reserve Board limit debit card     interchange fees;               banning banking organizations from engaging in proprietary     trading and restricting their sponsorship of, or investing in,     hedge funds and private equity funds, subject to limited     exceptions;               increasing regulation of the derivative markets through measures     that broaden the derivative instruments subject to regulation     and requiring clearing and exchange trading as well as imposing     additional capital and margin requirements for derivative market     participants;               changing the assessment base used in calculating FDIC deposit     insurance fees from assessable deposits to total assets less     tangible capital;               providing for heightened capital, liquidity, and prudential     regulation and supervision over systemically important financial     institutions;               providing for new resolution authority to establish a process to     unwind large systemically important financial institutions and     requiring the development and implementation of recovery and     resolution plans;               creating a new regulatory body to set requirements around the     terms and conditions of consumer financial products and     expanding the role of state regulators in enforcing consumer     protection requirements over banks.               disqualifying trust preferred securities and certain other     hybrid capital securities from Tier 1 capital;               including a variety of corporate governance and executive     compensation provisions and requirements; and               requiring securitizers to retain a portion of the risk that     would otherwise be transferred into certain securitization     transactions.         The Financial Reform Act has had, and will continue to have, a     significant and negative impact on our earnings through fee     reductions, higher costs and new restrictions, by reducing     available capital. The Financial Reform Act also has had and may     continue to have a material adverse impact on the value of     certain assets and liabilities held on our balance sheet. As     previously announced on July 16, 2010, as a result of the     Financial Reform Act and its related rules and subject to final     rulemaking over the next year, we believe that our debit card     revenue will be adversely impacted beginning in the third     quarter of 2011. In 2010, our estimate of revenue loss due to     the Financial           Reform Act was approximately $2.0 billion annually. As a     result, we recorded a non-tax deductible goodwill impairment     charge for Global Card Services of $10.4 billion in     2010. The goodwill impairment analysis includes limited     mitigation actions within Global Card Services to     recapture the lost revenue. We have identified other potential     mitigation actions, but they are in the early stages of     development and some of them may impact other segments. For     additional information, refer to Complex Accounting     Estimates  Goodwill and Intangible Assets      Global Card Services Impairment, in the     MD&A beginning on page 110 and     Note 10  Goodwill and Intangible Assets     to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       We anticipate that the final regulations associated with the     Financial Reform Act will include limitations on certain     activities, including limitations on the use of a banks     own capital for proprietary trading and sponsorship or     investment in hedge funds and private equity funds (Volcker     Rule). Regulations implementing the Volcker Rule are required to     be in place by October 21, 2011, and the Volcker Rule     becomes effective 12 months after such rules are final or     on July 21, 2012, whichever is earlier. The Volcker Rule     then gives banking entities two years from the effective date     (with opportunities for additional extensions) to bring     activities and investments into conformance. In anticipation of     the adoption of the final regulations, we have begun winding     down our proprietary trading line of business. The ultimate     impact of the Volcker Rule or the winding down of this business,     and the time it will take to comply or complete, continues to     remain uncertain. The final regulations issued may impose     additional operational and compliance costs on us.       Additionally, the Financial Reform Act includes measures to     broaden the scope of derivative instruments subject to     regulation by requiring clearing and exchange trading of certain     derivatives, imposing new capital and margin requirements for     certain market participants and imposing position limits on     certain     over-the-counter     derivatives. The Financial Reform Act grants the     U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the     SEC substantial new authority and requires numerous rulemakings     by these agencies. Generally, the CFTC and SEC have until     July 16, 2011 to promulgate the rulemakings necessary to     implement these regulations. The ultimate impact of these     derivatives regulations, and the time it will take to comply,     continues to remain uncertain. The final regulations will impose     additional operational and compliance costs on us and may     require us to restructure certain businesses and negatively     impact our revenues and results of operations.       Although the ratings agencies have indicated that our credit     ratings currently reflect their expectation that, if necessary,     we would receive significant support from the     U.S. government, all three major ratings agencies have     indicated they will reevaluate, and could reduce the uplift they     include in our ratings for government support for reasons     arising from financial services regulatory reform proposals or     legislation. In the event of certain credit ratings downgrades,     our access to credit markets, liquidity and our related funding     costs would be materially adversely affected. For additional     information about our credit ratings, see Capital Management and     Liquidity Risk in the MD&A beginning on pages 63 and 67,     respectively.       Most provisions of the Financial Reform Act require various     federal banking and securities regulators to issue regulations     to clarify and implement its provisions or to conduct studies on     significant issues. These proposed regulations and studies are     generally subject to a public notice and comment period. The     timing of issuance of final regulations, their effective dates     and their potential impacts to our businesses will be determined     over the coming months and years. As a result, the ultimate     impact of the Financial Reform Acts final rules on our     businesses and results of operations will depend on regulatory     interpretation and rulemaking, as well as the success of any of     our actions to mitigate the negative earnings impact of certain     provisions.               4     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents         Capital and     Operational Requirements       The Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC have issued     substantially similar risk-based and leverage capital guidelines     applicable to U.S. banking organizations. In addition,     these regulatory agencies may from time to time require that a     banking organization maintain capital above the minimum     prescribed levels, whether because of its financial condition or     actual or anticipated growth. The Federal Reserve Boards     risk-based guidelines define a three-tier capital framework.     Tier 1 capital includes common shareholders equity,     common equivalent securities (CES), trust preferred securities     and noncontrolling interests in limited amounts and qualifying     preferred stock, less goodwill and other adjustments. The     Financial Reform Act includes a provision under which our     previously issued and outstanding trust preferred securities in     the aggregate amount of $19.9 billion (approximately     137 basis points (bps) of Tier 1 capital) at     December 31, 2010, will no longer qualify as Tier 1     capital effective January 1, 2013. Tier 2 capital     consists of preferred stock not qualifying as Tier 1     capital, mandatorily convertible debt, limited amounts of     subordinated debt, other qualifying term debt, the allowance for     credit losses up to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets     and other adjustments. Tier 3 capital includes subordinated     debt that (i) is unsecured, (ii) is fully paid,     (iii) has an original maturity of at least two years,     (iv) is not redeemable before maturity without prior     approval by the Federal Reserve Board and (v) includes a     lock-in clause precluding payment of either interest or     principal if the payment would cause the issuing banks     risk-based capital ratio to fall or remain below the required     minimum. The sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital less     investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries represents qualifying     total capital. Risk-based capital ratios are calculated by     dividing Tier 1 and total capital by risk-weighted assets,     which is calculated by assigning assets and off-balance sheet     exposures to one of four categories of risk-weights, based     primarily on relative credit risk. The minimum Tier 1     capital ratio is four percent and the minimum total capital     ratio is eight percent. A well-capitalized     institution must generally maintain capital ratios 200 bps     higher than the minimum guidelines.       Our Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios under these     guidelines at December 31, 2010 were 11.24 percent and     15.77 percent. At December 31, 2010, we had no     subordinated debt that qualified as Tier 3 capital. While     not an explicit requirement of law or regulation, bank     regulatory agencies have stated that they expect shares of     common stock to be the primary component of a financial holding     companys Tier 1 capital and that financial holding     companies should maintain a Tier 1 common capital ratio of     at least four percent. The Tier 1 common capital ratio is     determined by dividing Tier 1 common capital by     risk-weighted assets. We calculate Tier 1 common capital as     Tier 1 capital, which includes CES, less preferred stock,     trust preferred securities, hybrid securities and noncontrolling     interest. As of December 31, 2010, our Tier 1 common     capital ratio was 8.60 percent.       The leverage ratio is determined by dividing Tier 1 capital     by adjusted quarterly average total assets, after certain     adjustments. Well-capitalized bank holding companies     must have a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of four percent     and not be subject to a Federal Reserve Board directive to     maintain higher capital levels. Well-Capitalized     national banks must maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at     least five percent and not be subject to a Federal Reserve Board     directive to maintain higher capital levels. Our leverage ratio     at December 31, 2010 was 7.21 percent, which exceeded     our leverage ratio requirement. For additional information about     our calculation of regulatory capital and capital composition,     see Capital Management  Regulatory Capital in the     MD&A beginning on page 63, and     Note 18  Regulatory Requirements and     Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of     1991 (FDICIA), among other things, identifies five capital     categories for insured           depository institutions (well-capitalized, adequately     capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized     and critically undercapitalized) and requires the respective     federal regulatory agencies to implement systems for     prompt corrective action for insured depository     institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements     within such categories. FDICIA imposes progressively restrictive     constraints on operations, management and capital distributions,     depending on the category in which an institution is classified.     Failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a     banking institution to capital-raising requirements. An     undercapitalized bank must develop a capital     restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee     that banks compliance with the plan. The liability of the     parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to     the lesser of five percent of the banks assets at the time     it became undercapitalized or the amount needed to     comply with the plan. Furthermore, in the event of the     bankruptcy of the parent holding company, such guarantee would     take priority over the parents general unsecured     creditors. In addition, FDICIA requires the various regulatory     agencies to prescribe certain non-capital standards for safety     and soundness relating generally to operations and management,     asset quality and executive compensation, and permits regulatory     action against a financial institution that does not meet such     standards.       The various regulatory agencies have adopted substantially     similar regulations that define the five capital categories     identified by FDICIA, using the total risk-based capital,     Tier 1 risk-based capital and leverage capital ratios as     the relevant capital measures. Such regulations establish     various degrees of corrective action to be taken when an     institution is considered undercapitalized. Under the     regulations, a well-capitalized institution must     have a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least six     percent, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least ten     percent and a leverage ratio of at least five percent and not be     subject to a capital directive order. Under these guidelines,     each of the Banks was considered well capitalized as of     December 31, 2010.       Pursuant to FDICIA, regulators also must take into     consideration: (a) concentrations of credit risk;     (b) interest rate risk; and (c) risks from     non-traditional banking activities, such as derivatives,     securities and insurance activities, as well as an     institutions ability to manage those risks, when     determining the adequacy of an institutions capital. This     evaluation is made as a part of the institutions regular     safety and soundness examination. In addition, Bank of America     Corporation, and any Bank with significant trading activity,     must incorporate a measure for market risk in their regulatory     capital calculations.       In June 2004, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the     Basel Committee) published the Basel II Accord with the     intent of more closely aligning regulatory capital requirements     with underlying risks, similar to economic capital. While     economic capital is measured to cover unexpected losses, the     Corporation also manages regulatory capital to adhere to     regulatory standards of capital adequacy. The Basel Committee,     which consists of central banks and bank supervisors from 13     countries including the United States, does not possess any     formal supervisory or legal authority over institutions in its     member countries. Instead, the Basel Committee formulates     supervisory guidelines that it recommends to its member     countries with the expectation that these guidelines will be     implemented in a manner best suited to each countrys own     national system.       The Basel II Final Rule (Basel II) was published in     December 2007 and established requirements for     U.S. implementation of the Basel II Rules and provided     detailed requirements for a new regulatory capital framework.     This regulatory capital framework includes requirements related     to credit and operational risk (Pillar 1), supervisory     requirements (Pillar 2) and disclosure requirements (Pillar     3). The Corporation began Basel II parallel implementation     on April 1, 2010.               Bank of America     2010     5     Table of Contents           Designated U.S. financial institutions are required to     complete a minimum parallel qualification period under     Basel II of four consecutive successful quarters before     receiving regulatory approval to report regulatory capital using     the Basel II methodology and exiting the parallel period.     During the parallel period, the resulting capital calculations     under both the current risk-based capital rules (Basel     I) and Basel II will be reported to the financial     institutions regulatory supervisors. Once the parallel     period is successfully completed and we have received approval     to exit parallel, we will transition to Basel II as the     methodology for calculating regulatory capital. Basel II     provides for a three-year transitional floor subsequent to     exiting parallel, after which Basel I may be discontinued. The     Collins Amendment within the Financial Reform Act and the     U.S. banking regulators subsequent Notice of Proposed     Rulemaking published by the Federal Reserve Board on     December 14, 2010 propose however that the current     three-year transitional floors under Basel II be replaced     with a permanent risk based capital floor as defined under Basel     I.       On December 16, 2010, U.S. regulators issued a Notice     of Proposed Rulemaking on the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines for     Market Risk (Market Risk Rules), reflecting partial adoption of     the Basel Committees July 2009 consultative document on     the topic. We anticipate U.S. regulators will adopt the     Market Risk Rules in mid-2011. This change is expected to     significantly increase the capital requirements for our trading     assets and liabilities, including derivatives exposures which     meet the definition established by the regulatory agencies. We     continue to evaluate the capital impact of the proposed rules     and currently anticipate being fully compliant with any final     rules by the projected implementation date of year-end 2011.       On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee issued     Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more     resilient banks and banking systems (Basel III), proposing     a January 2013 implementation date for Basel III. If implemented     by U.S. regulators as proposed, Basel III could     significantly increase our capital requirements. Basel III     and the Financial Reform Act propose the disqualification of     trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital, with the     Financial Reform Act proposing that the disqualification be     phased in from 2013 to 2015. Basel III also proposes the     deduction of certain assets from capital (deferred tax assets,     mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), investments in financial firms     and pension assets, among others, within prescribed     limitations), the inclusion of other comprehensive income in     capital, increased capital for counterparty credit risk, and new     minimum capital and buffer requirements. The phase-in period for     the capital deductions is proposed to occur in 20 percent     increments from 2014 through 2018 with full implementation by     December 31, 2018. The increase in capital requirements for     counterparty credit risk is proposed to be effective January     2013. The phase-in period for the new minimum capital     requirements and related buffers is proposed to occur between     2013 and 2019. U.S. regulators are expected to begin the     final rulemaking processes for Basel III in early 2011 and     have indicated a goal to adopt final rules by year-end 2011 or     early 2012. For additional information on our MSRs, refer to     Note 25  Mortgage Servicing Rights to the     Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on     deferred tax assets, refer to Note 21  Income     Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       If Basel III is implemented in the U.S. consistent     with Basel Committee rules, beginning in January 2013, we would     be required to maintain minimum capital ratio requirements of     6.0 percent for Tier 1 capital and 8.0 percent     for Total capital. The proposed minimum requirement for common     equity Tier 1 capital is 3.5 percent in 2013 and would     increase to 4.5 percent in 2015. Basel III also     includes three capital buffers which would be phased in over     time and impact all three capital ratios. These buffers include     a capital conservation buffer that would start at     0.63 percent in 2016 and increase to 2.5 percent in     2019. Thus, the minimum capital ratio requirements including the     capital conservation buffer in 2019 would be 7.0 percent     for common equity Tier 1 capital, 8.5 percent for     Tier 1 capital and 10.5 percent           for Total capital. If ratios fall below the minimum requirement     plus the capital conservation buffer, such as 10.5 percent     for Total capital, an institution would be required to restrict     dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonuses.     Additionally, Basel III also includes a countercyclical     buffer of up to 2.5 percent that regulators could require     in periods of excess credit growth. The countercyclical buffer     is to be comprised of loss-absorbing capital, such as common     equity, and is meant to retain additional capital during periods     of strong credit expansion, providing incremental protection in     the event of a material market downturn. The ratios presented     above do not include the third buffer requirement for     systemically important financial institutions, which the Basel     Committee continues to assess and has not yet quantified. The     countercyclical and systemic buffers are scheduled to be phased     in from 2013 through 2019. U.S. regulators are expected to     begin the rulemaking processes for Basel III in early 2011     and have indicated a goal to adopt final rules by end of 2011 or     early 2012.       These regulatory changes also require approval by the regulatory     agencies of analytical models used as part of our capital     measurement and assessment, especially in the case of more     complex models. If these more complex models are not approved,     it could require financial institutions to hold additional     capital, which in some cases could be significant.       We expect to maintain a Tier 1 common capital ratio in     excess of 8 percent as the regulatory rule changes are     implemented without needing to raise new equity capital. We have     made the implementation and mitigation of these regulatory     changes a strategic priority. We also note there remains     significant uncertainty on the final impacts as the     U.S. has issued only final rules for Basel II and a     Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the Market Risk Rules at this     time. Impacts may change as the U.S. finalizes rules for     Basel III and the regulatory agencies interpret the final     rules during the implementation process.       In addition to the capital proposals, in December 2010 the Basel     Committee proposed two measures of liquidity risk. The Liquidity     Coverage Ratio identifies the amount of unencumbered, high     quality liquid assets a financial institution holds that can be     used to offset the net cash outflows the institution would     encounter under an acute     30-day     stress scenario. The Net Stable Funding Ratio measures the     amount of longer-term, stable sources of funding employed by a     financial institution relative to the liquidity profiles of the     assets funded and the potential for contingent calls on funding     liquidity arising from off-balance sheet commitments and     obligations, over a one-year period. These two minimum liquidity     standards are also considered part of Basel III. The Basel     Committee expects the Liquidity Coverage Ratio to be implemented     in January 2015 and the Net Stable Funding Ratio to be     implemented in January 2018, following observation periods     beginning in 2012. We continue to monitor the development and     potential impact of these capital proposals.     Distributions       Our funds for cash distributions to our stockholders are derived     from a variety of sources, including cash and temporary     investments. The primary source of such funds, and funds used to     pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, is dividends     received from the Banks. Each of the Banks is subject to various     regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of     dividends, including requirements to maintain capital above     regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal regulatory     authority is authorized to determine, under certain     circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or     bank holding company, that the payment of dividends would be an     unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. For     additional information regarding the restrictions on our ability     to receive dividends or other distributions from the Banks, see     Item 1A. Risk Factors.               6     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           In addition, the ability of Bank of America Corporation and the     Banks to pay dividends may be affected by the various minimum     capital requirements and the capital and non-capital standards     established under FDICIA, as described above. The right of Bank     of America Corporation, our stockholders and our creditors to     participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of our     subsidiaries is further subject to the prior claims of creditors     of the respective subsidiaries.       For additional information regarding the requirements relating     to the payment of dividends, including the minimum capital     requirements, see Note 15  Shareholders     Equity and Note 18  Regulatory     Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial     Statements.     Source of     Strength       According to the Financial Reform Act and Federal Reserve Board     policy, bank holding companies are expected to act as a source     of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit     resources to support each such subsidiary. This support may be     required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to     provide such support. Similarly, under the cross-guarantee     provisions of the FDICIA, in the event of a loss suffered or     anticipated by the FDIC  either as a result of     default of a banking subsidiary or related to FDIC assistance     provided to such a subsidiary in danger of default      the affiliate banks of such a subsidiary may be assessed for the     FDICs loss, subject to certain exceptions.     Deposit     Insurance       Deposits placed at the U.S. Banks are insured by the FDIC,     subject to limits and conditions of applicable law and the     FDICs regulations. Pursuant to the Financial Reform Act,     FDIC insurance coverage limits were permanently increased to     $250,000 per customer. The Financial Reform Act also provides     for unlimited FDIC insurance coverage for non-interest bearing     demand deposit accounts for a two-year period beginning on     December 31, 2010 and ending on January 1, 2013. The     FDIC administers the DIF, and all insured depository     institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC that     fund the DIF. The Financial Reform Act changed the methodology     for calculating deposit insurance assessments from the amount of     an insured depository institutions domestic deposits to     its total assets minus tangible capital. On February 7,     2011 the FDIC issued a new regulation implementing revisions to     the assessment system mandated by the Financial Reform Act. The     new regulation will be effective April 1, 2011 and will be     reflected in the June 30, 2011 FDIC fund balance and the     invoices for assessments due September 30, 2011. As a     result of the new regulations, we expect to incur higher annual     deposit insurance assessments. We have identified potential     mitigation actions, but they are in the early stages of     development and we are not able to directly control the basis or     the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC     insurance or for other fees or assessment obligations imposed on     financial institutions. Any future increases in required deposit     insurance premiums or other bank industry fees could have a     significant adverse impact on our financial condition and     results of operations.       The FDIC is required to maintain at least a designated minimum     ratio of the DIF to insured deposits in the United States. The     Financial Reform Act requires the FDIC to assess insured     depository institutions to achieve a DIF ratio of at least     1.35 percent by September 30, 2020. The FDIC has     recently adopted new regulations that establish a long-term     target DIF ratio of greater than two percent. As a result of the     ongoing instability in the economy and the failure of other     U.S. depository institutions, the DIF ratio is currently     below the required targets and the FDIC has adopted a     restoration plan that will result in           substantially higher deposit insurance assessments for all     depository institutions over the coming years. Deposit insurance     assessment rates are subject to change by the FDIC and will be     impacted by the overall economy and the stability of the banking     industry as a whole.     Transactions with     Affiliates       The U.S. Banks are subject to restrictions under federal     law that limit certain types of transactions between the Banks     and their non-bank affiliates. In general, the U.S. Banks     are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions     of credit, purchases of assets and certain other transactions     involving Bank of America and its non-bank affiliates.     Transactions between the U.S. Banks and their non-bank     affiliates are required to be on arms length terms.     Privacy and     Information Security       We are subject to many U.S., state and international laws and     regulations governing requirements for maintaining policies and     procedures to protect the non-public confidential information of     our customers. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires the Banks to     periodically disclose Bank of Americas privacy policies     and practices relating to sharing such information and enables     retail customers to opt out of our ability to market to     affiliates and non-affiliates under certain circumstances.

Risk     Factors         In the course of conducting our business operations, we are     exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in the     financial services industry and others of which are more     specific to our own businesses. The following discussion     addresses some of the key risks that could affect our     businesses, operations, and financial condition. Other factors     that could affect our financial condition and operations are     discussed in Forward-looking Statements in the MD&A.     However, other factors besides those discussed below or     elsewhere in this report could also adversely affect our     businesses, operations, and financial condition. Therefore, the     risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of     potential risks that we may face.   Our businesses and results of operations have been, and may     continue to be, materially and adversely affected by the     U.S. and international financial markets and economic     conditions generally.       Our businesses and results of operations are materially affected     by the financial markets and general economic conditions in the     United States and abroad, including factors such as the level     and volatility of short-term and long-term interest rates,     inflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment     levels, bankruptcies, household income, consumer spending,     fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, liquidity     of the global financial markets, the availability and cost of     capital and credit, investor sentiment and confidence in the     financial markets, and the strength of the U.S. economy and     the     non-U.S. economies     in which we operate. The deterioration of any of these     conditions can adversely affect our consumer and commercial     businesses and securities portfolios, our level of charge-offs     and provision for credit losses, our capital levels and     liquidity and our results of operations.       U.S. financial markets have improved from the severe     financial crisis that dominated the domestic economy in the     second half of 2008 and early 2009, but mortgage markets remain     fragile. The financial crisis that gripped the European Union     beginning in spring 2010 directly affected U.S. financial     market behavior and the financial services industry. Any     intensification of Europes financial crisis or the     inability to address the sources of future financial turmoil in     Europe may adversely affect the U.S. and international     financial markets and the financial services industry. Such     adverse effect may involve declines in liquidity, loss of     investor confidence in the financial services industry,     disruptions in credit markets, declines in the values of many     asset classes, reductions in home prices and increased     unemployment.       Although the U.S. economy has continued to recover     throughout 2010 and growth of real Gross Domestic Product     strengthened in the second half of 2010, the elevated levels of     unemployment and household debt, along with continued stress in     the consumer and commercial real estate markets, pose challenges     for domestic economic performance and the banking environment.     Consumer spending, exports and business investment in equipment     and software rose during 2010, and showed accelerated momentum     in the second half of 2010, but labor markets and housing     markets remain weak and pose risks. The sustained high     unemployment rate and the lengthy duration of unemployment have     directly impaired consumer finances and pose risks to the     financial services sector. The housing market remains weak and     the elevated levels of distressed and delinquent mortgages add a     significant degree of risk to the mortgage market, in addition     to risks inherent to the business of banking. The risks related     to the distressed mortgage market may be accentuated by attempts     to forestall foreclosure proceedings, as well as state and     federal investigations into foreclosure practices throughout the     financial services industry. These factors may adversely affect     credit quality, bank lending and the general financial services     sector.       These conditions, as well as any further challenges stemming     from the continuing global economic recovery and recent     financial reform initiatives, such as the Financial Reform Act,     could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and     results of operations in the future.             For additional information about economic conditions and     challenges discussed above, see Executive Summary      2010 Economic and Business Environment in the MD&A     beginning on page 25.     Liquidity     Risk   Liquidity Risk is     the Potential Inability to Meet Our Contractual and Contingent     Financial Obligations, on- or Off-Balance Sheet, as they Become     Due.   Adverse changes to our credit ratings from the major credit     ratings agencies could have a material adverse effect on our     liquidity, cash flows, competitive position, financial condition     and results of operations by significantly limiting our access     to the funding or capital markets, increasing our borrowing     costs, or triggering additional collateral or funding     requirements under certain bilateral provisions of our trading     and collateralized financing contracts.       Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly     impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may     be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in     certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain     transactions including OTC derivatives. Credit ratings and     outlooks are opinions on our creditworthiness and that of our     obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term     borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including     asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing     review by the ratings agencies and thus may change from time to     time based on a number of factors, including our own financial     strength and operations as well as factors not under our     control, such as rating-agency-specific criteria or frameworks     for our industry or certain security types, which are subject to     revision from time to time, and conditions affecting the     financial services industry generally.       There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current     ratings. A reduction in certain of our credit ratings or the     ratings of certain asset-backed securitizations would likely     have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, access to     credit markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and on     certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where     counterparty creditworthiness is critical. In connection with     certain     over-the-counter     (OTC) derivatives contracts and other trading agreements,     counterparties may require us to provide additional collateral     or to terminate these contracts and agreements and collateral     financing arrangements in the event of a credit ratings     downgrade. Termination of these contracts and agreements could     cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring     us to make significant cash payments or securities movements. If     Bank of America Corporations or Bank of America,     N.A.s commercial paper or short-term credit ratings (which     currently have the following ratings:     P-1 by     Moodys,     A-1 by     S&P and F1+ by Fitch) were downgraded by one or more     levels, the potential loss of short-term funding sources such as     commercial paper or repurchase agreement financing and the     effect on our incremental cost of funds would be material.       The ratings agencies have indicated that, as a systemically     important financial institution, our credit ratings currently     reflect their expectation that, if necessary, we would receive     significant support from the U.S. government. All three     major ratings agencies, however, have indicated they will     reevaluate and could reduce the uplift they include in our     ratings for government support for reasons arising from     financial services regulatory reform proposals or legislation.     In February 2010, S&P affirmed our current credit ratings     but revised the outlook to negative from stable based on its     belief that it is less certain whether the U.S. government     would be willing to provide extraordinary support. On     July 27, 2010, Moodys affirmed our current ratings     but revised the outlook to negative from stable due to its     expectation for lower levels of government support over time as     a result of the passage of the Financial Reform Act. Also, on     October 22, 2010, Fitch placed our credit ratings on Rating     Watch Negative from stable outlook due to proposed rulemaking     that could negatively impact its assessment of future systemic     government              8     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           support. Any expectation that government support may be     diminished or withheld in the future would likely have a     negative impact on the companys credit ratings. The timing     of the agencies assessment of potential government     support, as well as its impact on our ratings, is currently     uncertain.       For additional information about the companys credit     ratings, see Liquidity Risk  Credit     Ratings in the MD&A beginning on page 70.   Our liquidity, cash flows, financial condition and results of     operations, and competitive position may be significantly     adversely affected if we are unable to access capital markets,     continue to raise deposits, sell assets on favorable terms, or     if there is an increase in our borrowing costs.       Liquidity is essential to our businesses. We fund our assets     primarily with globally sourced deposits in our bank entities,     as well as secured and unsecured liabilities transacted in the     capital markets. We rely on certain unsecured and secured     funding sources, such as the commercial paper and repo markets,     which are typically short-term and credit-sensitive in nature.     We also engage in asset securitization transactions to fund     consumer lending activities. Our liquidity could be     significantly adversely affected by an inability to access the     capital markets; illiquidity or volatility in the capital     markets; unforeseen outflows of cash, including customer     deposits, funding for commitments and contingencies; inability     to sell assets on favorable terms; or negative perceptions about     our short- or long-term business prospects, including changes in     our credit ratings. Several of these factors may arise due to     circumstances beyond our control, such as a general market     disruption, negative views about the financial services industry     generally, changes in the regulatory environment, actions by     credit ratings agencies or an operational problem that affects     third parties or us. For example, during the recent financial     crisis our ability to raise funding was at times adversely     affected in the U.S. and international markets.       Our cost of obtaining funding is directly related to prevailing     market interest rates and to our credit spreads. Credit spreads     are the amount in excess of the interest rate of     U.S. Treasury securities, or other benchmark securities, of     the same maturity that we need to pay to our funding providers.     Increases in interest rates and our credit spreads can     significantly increase the cost of our funding. Changes in our     credit spreads are market-driven, and may be influenced by     market perceptions of our creditworthiness. Changes to interest     rates and our credit spreads occur continuously and may be     unpredictable and highly volatile.       For additional information about our liquidity position and     other liquidity matters, including credit ratings and outlooks     and the policies and procedures we use to manage our liquidity     risks, see Capital Management and Liquidity Risk in the     MD&A beginning on pages 63 and 67, respectively.   Bank of America Corporation is a holding company and as such     we are dependent upon our subsidiaries for liquidity, including     our ability to pay dividends to stockholders.       Bank of America Corporation is a separate and distinct legal     entity from our banking and nonbanking subsidiaries. We evaluate     and manage liquidity on a legal entity basis. Legal entity     liquidity is an important consideration as there are legal and     other limitations on our ability to utilize liquidity from one     legal entity to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another,     including Bank of America Corporation. For instance, Bank of     America Corporation depends on dividends, distributions and     other payments from our banking and nonbanking subsidiaries to     fund dividend payments on our common stock and preferred stock     and to fund all payments on our other obligations, including     debt obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including our bank     and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws that     restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to     block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to     Bank of America Corporation. In addition, our bank and     broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their     ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum     regulatory capital requirements, as well as restrictions on     their ability to use funds deposited with them in bank or     brokerage accounts to fund their businesses. Additional     restrictions on           related-party transactions, increased capital requirements and     additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or     brokerage accounts, as well as lower earnings, can reduce the     amount of funds available to meet the obligations of Bank of     America Corporation and even require Bank of America Corporation     to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries. Regulatory     action of that kind could impede access to funds we need to make     payments on our obligations or dividend payments. In addition,     our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a     subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to     the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors. For a     further discussion regarding our ability to pay dividends, see     Note 15  Shareholders Equity and     Note 18  Regulatory Requirements and     Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements.     Mortgage     and Housing Market-Related Risk   We have been, and expect to continue to be, required to     repurchase loans     and/or     reimburse the GSEs and monoline bond insurance companies     (monolines) for losses due to claims related to representations     and warranties made in connection with mortgage-backed     securities and other loans, and have received similar claims,     and may receive additional claims, from whole loan purchasers     and private-label securitization investors. The resolution of     these claims could have a material adverse effect on our cash     flows, financial condition, and results of operations.       We have securitized and continue to securitize first-lien     mortgage loans generally in the form of mortgage-backed     securities (MBS) guaranteed by the GSEs or, in the case of     Federal Housing Administration insured and U.S. Department     of Veterans Affairs guaranteed mortgage loans, by the Government     National Mortgage Association. We and our legacy companies and     certain subsidiaries have also sold pools of first-lien     mortgages and home equity loans as private-label securitizations     or in the form of whole loans. In certain cases, all or a     portion of the private-label MBS were insured by monolines or     other non-GSE counterparties. In connection with these     securitizations and other transactions, we or our subsidiaries     or legacy companies made various representations and warranties.     Breaches of these representations and warranties may result in a     requirement that we repurchase mortgage loans, or indemnify or     provide other remedies to counterparties.       On December 31, 2010, we reached agreements with Freddie Mac     (FHLMC) and Fannie Mae (FNMA), collectively the GSEs, where the     Corporation paid $2.8 billion to resolve repurchase claims     involving first-lien residential mortgage loans sold directly to     the GSEs by entities related to legacy Countrywide     (Countrywide). The agreement with FHLMC extinguishes all     outstanding and potential mortgage repurchase and make-whole     claims arising out of any alleged breaches of selling     representations and warranties related to loans sold directly by     legacy Countrywide to FHLMC through 2008, subject to certain     exceptions we do not believe will be material. The agreement     with FNMA substantially resolves the existing pipeline of     repurchase and make-whole claims outstanding as of     September 20, 2010 arising out of alleged breaches of     selling representations and warranties related to loans sold     directly by legacy Countrywide to FNMA. These agreements with     the GSEs do not cover outstanding and potential mortgage     repurchase and make-whole claims arising out of any alleged     breaches of selling representations and warranties to legacy     Bank of America first-lien residential mortgage loans sold     directly to the GSEs, loans sold to the GSEs other than     described above, loan servicing obligations, other contractual     obligations or loans contained in private-label securitizations.     In addition, we have other unresolved representation and     warranty claims from the GSEs and certain monolines, and other     non-GSE counterparties, and certain monolines have instituted     litigation against us with respect to representations and     warranties claims.       We have experienced increasing repurchase and similar requests     from non-GSE counterparties, including monolines, private-label     MBS securitization investors and whole loan purchasers. We     expect additional activity in this              Bank of America     2010     9     Table of Contents           area going forward and the volume of repurchase requests from     monolines, whole loan purchasers and investors in private-label     MBS could increase in the future. It is reasonably possible that     future losses may occur and our estimate is that the upper range     of loss related to non-GSE sales could be $7.0 billion to     $10.0 billion over existing accruals. This estimate does     not represent a probable loss, is based on currently available     information, significant judgment, and a number of assumptions     that are subject to change. A significant portion of this     estimate relates to loans originated through legacy Countrywide,     and the repurchase liability is generally limited to the     original seller of the loan. Future provisions and possible loss     or range of loss may be impacted if actual results are different     from our assumptions regarding economic conditions, home prices     and other matters and may vary by counterparty. We expect that     the resolution of the repurchase claims process with the non-GSE     counterparties will likely be a protracted process, and we will     vigorously contest any request for repurchase if we conclude     that a valid basis for the repurchase claim does not exist.       The resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these     representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have     a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows     and results of operations, and could exceed existing estimates     and accruals. In addition, any accruals or estimates we have     made are based on assumptions which are subject to change.       For additional information about our representations and     warranties exposure and past activities, see Recent     Events  Representations and Warrants Liability, in     the MD&A on page 33, Recent Events      Private-label Residential Mortgage-backed Securities Matters, in     the MD&A on page 35, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements     and Contractual Obligations  Representations and     Warranties, in the MD&A beginning on page 52, and     Note 9  Representations and Warranties     Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated     Financial Statements and Representations.   Continued, or increasing, declines in the domestic and     international housing markets, including home prices, may     adversely affect the companys consumer and commercial     portfolios and have a significant adverse effect on our     financial condition and results of operations.       Economic deterioration throughout 2009 and weakness in the     economic recovery in 2010 was accompanied by continued stress in     the U.S. and international housing markets, including     declines in home prices. These declines in the housing market,     with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures, have     negatively impacted the demand for many of our products and the     credit performance of our consumer and commercial portfolios.     Additionally, our mortgage loan production volume is generally     influenced by the rate of growth in residential mortgage debt     outstanding and the size of the residential mortgage market,     which has declined due to reduced activity in the housing     market. Continued high unemployment rates in the U.S. have     added another element to the financial challenges facing     U.S. consumers and further compounded these stresses in the     U.S. housing market as employment conditions may be     compelling some consumers to delay new home purchases or miss     payments on existing mortgages.       Conditions in the housing market have also resulted in     significant write-downs of asset values in several asset     classes, notably mortgage-backed securities and exposure to     monolines. These conditions may negatively affect the value of     real estate which could negatively affect our exposure to     representations and warranties. While there were continued     indications throughout the past year that the U.S. economy     is stabilizing, the performance of our overall consumer and     commercial portfolios may not significantly improve in the near     future. A protracted continuation or worsening of these     difficult housing market conditions would likely exacerbate the     adverse effects outlined above and have a significant adverse     effect on our financial condition and results of operations.   We temporarily suspended our foreclosure sales nationally in     the fourth quarter of 2010 to conduct an assessment of our     foreclosure processes. Subsequently, numerous state and federal     investigations of foreclosure        processes across our industry have been initiated. Those     investigations and any irregularities that might be found in our     foreclosure processes, along with any remedial steps taken in     response to governmental investigations or to our own internal     assessment, could have a material adverse effect on our     financial condition and results of operations.       On October 1, 2010, we voluntarily stopped taking     residential mortgage foreclosure proceedings to judgment in     states where foreclosure requires a court order following a     legal proceeding (judicial states). On October 8, 2010, we     stopped foreclosure sales in all states in order to complete an     assessment of the related business processes. These actions     generally did not affect the initiation and processing of     foreclosures prior to judgment or sale of vacant real estate     owned properties. We took these precautionary steps in order to     ensure our processes for handling foreclosures include the     appropriate controls and quality assurance. Our review has     involved an assessment of the foreclosure process, including a     review of completed foreclosure affidavits in pending     proceedings.       As a result of that review, we identified and implemented     process and control enhancements, and we intend to monitor     ongoing quality results of each process. After these     enhancements were put in place, we resumed foreclosure sales in     most states where foreclosures are handled without judicial     supervision (non-judicial states) during the fourth quarter of     2010, and expect sales to resume in the remaining non-judicial     states in the first quarter of 2011. We also commenced a rolling     process of preparing, as necessary, affidavits of indebtedness     in pending foreclosure proceedings in order to resume the     process of taking these foreclosure proceedings to judgment in     judicial states, beginning with properties believed to be     vacant, and with properties for which the mortgage was     originated on a non-owner-occupied basis. The process of     preparing affidavits in pending proceedings is expected to     continue in the first quarter of 2011, and could result in     prolonged adversary proceedings that delay certain foreclosure     sales.       Law enforcement authorities in all 50 states and the     U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies,     including certain bank supervisory authorities, continue to     investigate alleged irregularities in the foreclosure practices     of residential mortgage servicers. Authorities have publicly     stated that the scope of the investigations extends beyond     foreclosure documentation practices to include mortgage loan     modification and loss mitigation practices. The Corporation is     cooperating with these investigations and is dedicating     significant resources to address these issues. The current     environment of heightened regulatory scrutiny has the potential     to subject the Corporation to inquiries or investigations that     could significantly adversely affect its reputation. Such     investigations by state and federal authorities, as well as any     other governmental or regulatory scrutiny of our foreclosure     processes, could result in material fines, penalties, equitable     remedies (including requiring default servicing or other process     changes), or other enforcement actions, and result in     significant legal costs in responding to governmental     investigations and additional litigation.       While we cannot predict the ultimate impact of the temporary     delay in foreclosure sales, or any issues that may arise as a     result of alleged irregularities with respect to previously     completed foreclosure activities, we may be subject to     additional borrower and non-borrower litigation and governmental     and regulatory scrutiny related to our past and current     foreclosure activities. This scrutiny may extend beyond our     pending foreclosure matters to issues arising out of alleged     irregularities with respect to previously completed foreclosure     activities. Our costs increased in the fourth quarter of 2010     and we expect that additional costs incurred in connection with     our foreclosure process assessment will continue into 2011 due     to the additional resources necessary to perform the foreclosure     process assessment, to revise affidavit filings and to implement     other operational changes. This will likely result in higher     noninterest expense, including higher servicing costs and legal     expenses, in Home Loans & Insurance. It is also     possible that the temporary suspension of foreclosure sales may     result in additional costs and              10     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           expenses, including costs associated with the maintenance of     properties or possible home price declines, while foreclosures     are delayed. In addition, required process changes could     increase our default servicing costs over the longer term.     Finally, the time to complete foreclosure sales may increase     temporarily, which may result in an increase in non-performing     loans and servicing advances and may impact the collectability     of such advances and the value of our MSRs, MBS and real estate     owned properties. An increase in the time to complete     foreclosure sales also may inflate the amount of highly     delinquent loans in the Corporations mortgage statistics,     result in increasing levels of consumer nonperforming loans, and     could have a dampening effect on net interest margin as     non-performing assets rise. Accordingly, delays in foreclosure     sales, including any delays beyond those currently anticipated,     and our continued process enhancements and any issues that may     arise out of alleged irregularities in our foreclosure process     could increase the costs associated with our mortgage operations.       Loan sales have not been materially impacted by the temporary     delay in foreclosure sales or the review of our foreclosure     process. However, delays in foreclosure sales could negatively     affect the valuation of our real estate owned properties and MBS     that are serviced by us. With respect to GSE MBS, while there     would be no credit impairment to security holders due to the     guarantee provided by the agencies, the valuation of certain MBS     could be negatively affected under certain scenarios due to     changes in the timing of cash flows. The impact on GSE MBS     depends on, among other factors, how long the underlying loans     are affected by foreclosure delays and would vary among     securities. With respect to non-GSE MBS, under certain scenarios     the timing and amount of cash flows could be negatively     affected. The ultimate impact on non-GSE MBS depends on the same     factors that impact GSE MBS, as well as the level of credit     enhancement, including subordination. In addition, as a result     of our foreclosure process assessment and related control     enhancements that we have implemented, there may continue to be     delays in foreclosure sales, including a continued backlog of     foreclosure proceedings, and evictions from real estate owned     properties.   Failure to satisfy our obligations as servicer in the     residential mortgage securitization process, including     obligations related to residential mortgage foreclosure actions,     along with other losses we could incur in our capacity as     servicer, could have a material adverse effect on our financial     condition and results of operations.       Bank of America and its legacy companies have securitized, and     continue to securitize, a significant portion of the residential     mortgage loans that they have originated or acquired. The     Corporation services a large portion of the loans it or its     subsidiaries have securitized and also services loans on behalf     of third-party securitization vehicles. In addition to     identifying specific servicing criteria, pooling and servicing     arrangements entered into in connection with a securitization or     whole loan sale typically impose standards of care on the     servicer, with respect to its activities, that may include the     obligation to adhere to the accepted servicing practices of     prudent mortgage lenders     and/or to     exercise the degree of care and skill that the servicer employs     when servicing loans for its own account. Many non-GSE     residential mortgage-backed securitizations and whole loan     servicing agreements also require the servicer to indemnify the     trustee or other investor for or against failures by the     servicer to perform its servicing obligations or acts or     omissions that involve willful malfeasance, bad faith, or gross     negligence in the performance of, or reckless disregard of, the     servicers duties.       Servicing agreements with the GSEs generally provide the GSEs     with broader rights relative to the servicer than are found in     servicing agreements with private investors. For example, each     GSE typically has the right to demand           that the servicer repurchase loans that breach the sellers     representations and warranties made in connection with the     initial sale of the loans, even if the servicer was not the     seller. The GSEs also reserve the contractual right to demand     indemnification or loan repurchase for certain servicing     breaches. In addition, our agreements with the GSEs and their     first mortgage seller/servicer guides provide for timelines to     resolve delinquent loans through workout efforts or liquidation,     if necessary.       With regard to alleged irregularities in foreclosure     process-related activities referred to above, a servicer may     incur costs or losses if the servicer elects or is required to     re-execute or re-file documents or take other action in its     capacity as a servicer in connection with pending or completed     foreclosures. The servicer also may incur costs or losses if the     validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower. If     a court were to overturn a foreclosure because of errors or     deficiencies in the foreclosure process, the servicer may have     liability to a title insurer of the property sold in     foreclosure. These costs and liabilities may not be reimbursable     to the servicer. A servicer may also incur costs or losses     associated with private-label securitizations or other loan     investors relating to delays or alleged deficiencies in     processing documents necessary to comply with state law     governing foreclosures.       The servicer may be subject to deductions by insurers for     mortgage insurance or guarantee benefits relating to delays or     alleged deficiencies. Additionally, if the servicer commits a     material breach of its servicing obligations that is not cured     within specified timeframes, including those related to default     servicing and foreclosure, it could be terminated as servicer     under servicing agreements under certain circumstances. Any of     these actions may harm the servicers reputation, increase     its servicing costs or otherwise adversely affect its financial     condition and results of operations.       Mortgage notes, assignments or other documents are often     required to be maintained and are often necessary to enforce     mortgages loans. There has been significant public commentary     regarding the common industry practice of recording mortgages in     the name of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc.     (MERS), as nominee on behalf of the note holder, and whether     securitization trusts own the loans purported to be conveyed to     them and have valid liens securing those loans. We currently use     the MERS system for a substantial portion of the residential     mortgage loans that we originate, including loans that have been     sold to investors or securitization trusts. Additionally,     certain legal challenges have been made to the process for     transferring mortgage loans to securitization trusts, asserting     that having a mortgagee of record that is different than the     holder of the mortgage note could break the chain of     title and cloud the ownership of the loan. In order to     foreclose on a mortgage loan, in certain cases it may be     necessary or prudent for an assignment of the mortgage to be     made to the holder of the note, which in the case of a mortgage     held in the name of MERS as nominee would need to be completed     by MERS. As such, our practice is to obtain assignments of     mortgages from MERS prior to instituting foreclosure. If certain     required documents are missing or defective, or if the use of     MERS is found not to be effective, we could be obligated to cure     certain defects or in some circumstances be subject to     additional costs and expenses, which could have a material     adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and     results of operations.       We may also face negative reputational costs from these     servicing risks, which could reduce our future business     opportunities in this area or cause that business to be on less     favorable terms to us.       For additional information concerning our servicing risks, see     Recent Events  Certain Servicing-related Issues, in     the MD&A beginning on page 34.           Bank of America     2010     11     Table of Contents         Credit     Risk   Credit Risk is     the Risk of Loss Arising from a Borrower, Obligor or     Counterparty Default when a Borrower, Obligor or Counterparty     does not Meet its Obligations.   Increased credit risk, due to economic or market disruptions,     insufficient credit loss reserves or concentration of credit     risk, may necessitate increased provisions for credit losses and     could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and     results of operations.       When we loan money, commit to loan money or enter into a letter     of credit or other contract with a counterparty, we incur credit     risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their     loans or our counterparties fail to perform according to the     terms of their agreements. A number of our products expose us to     credit risk, including loans, leases and lending commitments,     derivatives, trading account assets and assets     held-for-sale.     As one of the nations largest lenders, the credit quality     of our consumer and commercial portfolios has a significant     impact on our earnings.       Although credit quality generally continued to show improvement     throughout 2010, net charge-offs, nonperforming loans, leases     and foreclosed properties remained elevated. Global and national     economic conditions continue to weigh on our credit portfolios.     Economic or market disruptions are likely to increase our credit     exposure to customers, obligors or other counterparties due to     the increased risk that they may default on their obligations to     us. These potential increases in delinquencies and default rates     could adversely affect our consumer credit card, home equity,     consumer real estate and purchased credit-impaired portfolios,     through increased charge-offs and provisions for credit losses.     In addition, this increased credit risk could also adversely     affect our commercial loan portfolios where we have experienced     continued losses, particularly in our commercial real estate     portfolios, reflecting broad-based stress across industries,     property types and borrowers.       We estimate and establish an allowance for credit risks and     credit losses inherent in our lending activities (including     unfunded lending commitments), excluding those measured at fair     value, through a charge to earnings. The amount of allowance is     determined based on our evaluation of the potential credit     losses included within our loan portfolio. The process for     determining the amount of the allowance, which is critical to     our operating results and financial condition, requires     difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts     of economic conditions and how our borrowers will react to those     conditions. Our ability to assess future economic conditions or     the creditworthiness of our customers, obligors or other     counterparties is imperfect. The ability of our borrowers to     repay their loans will likely be impacted by changes in economic     conditions, which in turn could impact the accuracy of our     forecasts. As with any such assessments, there is also the     chance that we will fail to identify the proper factors or that     we will fail to accurately estimate the impacts of factors that     we identify. In addition, we may underestimate the credit losses     in our loan portfolios and suffer unexpected losses if the     models and approaches we use to establish reserves and make     judgments in extending credit to our borrowers and other     counterparties become less predictive of future behaviors,     valuations, assumptions or estimates. Although we believe that     our allowance for credit losses was in compliance with     applicable standards at December 31, 2010, there is no     guarantee that it will be sufficient to address future credit     losses, particularly if economic conditions worsen. In such an     event we may need to increase the           size of our allowance in 2011, which would adversely affect our     financial condition and results of operations.       In the ordinary course of our business, we also may be subject     to a concentration of credit risk to a particular industry,     country, counterparty, borrower or issuer. A deterioration in     the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or     a failure or downgrade of, or default by, any particular entity     or group of entities could have a material adverse impact on our     businesses, and the processes by which we set limits and monitor     the level of our credit exposure to individual entities,     industries and countries may not function as we have     anticipated. While our activities expose us to many different     industries and counterparties, we routinely execute a high     volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial     services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial     banks, investment funds and insurers. This has resulted in     significant credit concentration with respect to this industry.       In the ordinary course of business, we also enter into     transactions with sovereign nations, U.S. states and     U.S. municipalities. Unfavorable economic or political     conditions, disruptions to capital markets, currency     fluctuations, social instability and changes in government     policies could impact the operating budgets or credit ratings of     sovereign nations, U.S. states and U.S. municipalities     and expose us to credit risk.       We also have a concentration of credit risk with respect to our     consumer real estate, consumer credit card and commercial real     estate portfolios, which represent a large percentage of our     overall credit portfolio. The economic downturn has adversely     affected these portfolios and further exposed us to this     concentration of risk. Continued economic weakness or     deterioration in real estate values or household incomes could     result in materially higher credit losses.       For additional information about our credit risk and credit risk     management policies and procedures, see Credit Risk Management     in the MD&A beginning on page 71 and     Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting     Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   We could suffer losses as a result of the actions of or     deterioration in the commercial soundness of our counterparties     and other financial services institutions.       Our ability to engage in routine trading and funding     transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and     commercial soundness of other market participants. We have     exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we     routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the     financial services industry, including brokers and dealers,     commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and     other institutional clients. Financial services institutions and     other counterparties are inter-related because of trading,     funding, clearing or other relationships. As a result, defaults     by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial     services institutions, or the financial services industry     generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could     lead to significant future liquidity problems, including losses     or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these     transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of     a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be     impacted when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is     liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount     of the loan or derivatives exposure due us. Any such losses     could materially adversely affect our financial condition and     results of operations.               12     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents       Our derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected risks     and potential losses.       We are party to a large number of derivatives transactions,     including credit derivatives. Our derivatives businesses may     expose us to unexpected market, credit and operational risks     that could cause us to suffer unexpected losses and have an     adverse effect on our financial condition and results of     operations. Severe declines in asset values, unanticipated     credit events or unforeseen circumstances that may cause     previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice     versa) may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately     taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of     a derivative instrument.       Many derivative instruments are individually negotiated and     non-standardized, which can make exiting, transferring or     settling some positions difficult. Many derivatives require that     we deliver to the counterparty the underlying security, loan or     other obligation in order to receive payment. In a number of     cases, we do not hold, and may not be able to obtain, the     underlying security, loan or other obligation. This could cause     us to forfeit the payments due to us under these contracts or     result in settlement delays with the attendant credit and     operational risk, as well as increased costs to us.       Derivatives contracts and other transactions entered into with     third parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties or     settled on a timely basis. While a transaction remains     unconfirmed or during any delay in settlement, we are subject to     heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of     default may find it more difficult to enforce the contract. In     addition, as new and more complex derivatives products have been     created, covering a wider array of underlying credit and other     instruments, disputes about the terms of the underlying     contracts may arise, which could impair our ability to     effectively manage our risk exposures from these products and     subject us to increased costs.       For a further discussion of our derivatives exposure, see     Note 4  Derivatives to the Consolidated     Financial Statements.     Market     Risk   Market Risk is     the Risk that Values of Assets and Liabilities or Revenues will     be Adversely Affected by Changes in Market Conditions Such as     Market Volatility. Market Risk is Inherent in the Financial     Instruments Associated with our Operations and Activities,     Including Loans, Deposits, Securities, Short-Term Borrowings,     Long-Term Debt, Trading Account Assets and Liabilities, and     Derivatives.   Our businesses and results of operations have been, and may     continue to be, significantly adversely affected by changes in     the levels of market volatility and by other financial or     capital market conditions.       Our businesses and results of operations may be adversely     affected by market risk factors such as changes in interest and     currency exchange rates, equity and futures prices, the implied     volatility of interest rates, credit spreads and other economic     and business factors. These market risks may adversely affect,     for example, (i) the value of our on- and off-balance sheet     securities, trading assets, other financial instruments, and     MSRs, (ii) the cost of debt capital and our access to     credit markets, (iii) the value of assets under management,     which could reduce our fee income relating to those assets,     (iv) customer allocation of capital among investment     alternatives, (v) the volume of client activity in our     trading operations, and (vi) the general profitability and     risk level of the transactions in which we engage. Any of these     developments could have a significant adverse impact on our     financial condition and results of operations.             We use various models and strategies to assess and control our     market risk exposures but those are subject to inherent     limitations. For example, our models, which rely on historical     trends and assumptions, may not be sufficiently predictive of     future results due to limited historical patterns, extreme or     unanticipated market movements and illiquidity, especially     during severe market downturns or stress events. The models that     we use to assess and control our market risk exposures also     reflect assumptions about the degree of correlation or lack     thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market     indicators. In times of market stress or other unforeseen     circumstances, such as the market conditions experienced in 2008     and 2009, previously uncorrelated indicators may become     correlated, or previously correlated indicators may move in     different directions. These types of market movements have at     times limited the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and     have caused us to incur significant losses, and they may do so     in the future. These changes in correlation can be exacerbated     where other market participants are using risk or trading models     with assumptions or algorithms that are similar to ours. In     these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk     positions due to the activity of other market participants or     widespread market dislocations, including circumstances where     asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for     certain assets. To the extent that we make investments directly     in securities that do not have an established liquid trading     market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or     hedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and     therefore reduce our risk associated with such positions.       For additional information about market risk and our market risk     management policies and procedures, see Market Risk Management     in the MD&A beginning on page 100.   Declines in the value of certain of our assets could have an     adverse effect on our results of operations.       We have a large portfolio of financial instruments that we     measure at fair value including, among others, certain corporate     loans and loan commitments, loans     held-for-sale,     repurchase agreements and long-term deposits. We also have     trading account assets and liabilities, derivatives assets and     liabilities,     available-for-sale     debt and marketable equity securities, consumer-related MSRs and     certain other assets that are valued at fair value. We determine     the fair values of these instruments based on the fair value     hierarchy under applicable accounting guidance. The fair values     of these financial instruments include adjustments for market     liquidity, credit quality and other transaction specific     factors, where appropriate.       Gains or losses on these instruments can have a direct and     significant impact on our results of operations, unless we have     effectively hedged our exposures. For example,     changes in interest rates, among other things, can impact the     value of our MSRs and can result in substantially higher or     lower mortgage banking income and earnings, depending upon our     ability to fully hedge the performance of our MSRs. Fair values     may be impacted by declining values of the underlying assets or     the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the     continued availability of these transactions. The financial     strength of counterparties, such as monolines, with whom we have     economically hedged some of our exposure to these assets, also     will affect the fair value of these assets. Sudden declines and     significant volatility in the prices of assets may substantially     curtail or eliminate the trading activity for these assets,     which may make it very difficult to sell, hedge or value such     assets. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets     reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the     difficulty in valuing assets may increase our risk-weighted     assets, which requires us to maintain additional capital and     increases our funding costs.               Bank of America     2010     13     Table of Contents           Asset values also directly impact revenues in our asset     management businesses. We receive asset-based management fees     based on the value of our clients portfolios or     investments in funds managed by us and, in some cases, we also     receive incentive fees based on increases in the value of such     investments. Declines in asset values can reduce the value of     our clients portfolios or fund assets, which in turn can     result in lower fees earned for managing such assets.       For additional information about fair value measurements, see     Note 22  Fair Value Measurements to the     Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information     about our asset management businesses, see Business Segment     Operations  Global Wealth & Investment     Management in the MD&A beginning on page 48.   Our commodities activities, particularly our physical     commodities business, subject us to performance, environmental     and other risks that may result in significant cost and     liabilities.       As part of our commodities business, we enter into     exchange-traded contracts, financially settled OTC derivatives,     contracts for physical delivery and contracts providing for the     transportation, transmission     and/or     storage rights on or in vessels, barges, pipelines, transmission     lines or storage facilities. Commodity, related storage,     transportation or other contracts expose us to the risk that the     price of the underlying commodity or the cost of storing or     transporting commodities may rise or fall. In addition,     contracts relating to physical ownership     and/or     delivery can expose us to numerous other risks, including     performance and environmental risks. For example, our     counterparties may not be able to pass changes in the price of     commodities to their customers and therefore may not be able to     meet their performance obligations. Our actions to mitigate the     aforementioned risks may not prove adequate to address every     contingency. In addition, insurance covering some of these risks     may not be available, and the proceeds, if any, from insurance     recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respect     to particular incidents. As a result, our financial condition     and results of operations may be adversely affected by such     events.     Regulatory     and Legal Risk   Bank regulatory agencies may require us to hold higher levels     of regulatory capital, increase our regulatory capital ratios,     or increase liquidity which could result in the need to issue     additional securities that qualify as regulatory capital or to     liquidate company assets.       We are subject to the risk-based capital guidelines issued by     the Federal Reserve Board. These guidelines establish regulatory     capital requirements for banking institutions to meet minimal     requirements as well as to qualify as a     well-capitalized institution. (A     well-capitalized institution must generally maintain     capital ratios 200 bps higher than the minimum guidelines.)     The risk-based capital rules have been further supplemented by     required leverage ratios, defined as so-called Tier 1 (the     highest grade) capital divided by quarterly average total     assets, after certain adjustments. If any of our insured     depository institutions fails to maintain its status as     well- capitalized under the capital rules of their     primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve Board will     require us to enter into an agreement to bring the insured     depository institution or institutions back into a     well-capitalized status. For the duration of such an     agreement, the Federal Reserve Board may impose restrictions on     the activities in which we may engage. If we were to fail to     enter into such an agreement, or fail to comply with the terms     of such agreement, the Federal Reserve Board may impose more     severe restrictions on the activities in which we may engage,     including requiring us to cease and desist in activities     permitted under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.       It is possible that in the future increases in regulatory     capital requirements, changes in how regulatory capital is     calculated or increases to liquidity requirements, may cause the     loss of our well-capitalized status unless we     increase our capital levels by issuing additional common stock,     thus diluting           our existing shareholders, or by selling assets. For example,     the Financial Reform Act includes a provision under which our     previously issued and outstanding trust preferred securities     will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital effective     January 1, 2013. The exclusion of trust preferred     securities from Tier 1 capital will be phased in     incrementally over a three-year phase-in period. The treatment     of trust preferred securities during the phase-in period remains     unclear and is subject to future rulemaking.       On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee issued Basel III,     proposing a January 2013 implementation date for Basel III. If     implemented by U.S. regulators as proposed, Basel III     could significantly increase our capital requirements.     Basel III and the Financial Reform Act propose the     disqualification of trust preferred securities from Tier 1     capital, with the Financial Reform Act proposing that the     disqualification be phased in from 2013 to 2015. Basel III     also proposes the deduction of certain assets from capital     (deferred tax assets, mortgage servicing rights (MSRs),     investments in financial firms and pension assets, among others,     within prescribed limitations), the inclusion of other     comprehensive income in capital, increased capital for     counterparty credit risk, and new minimum capital and buffer     requirements. U.S. regulators are expected to begin the     final rulemaking processes for Basel III in early     2011 and have indicated a goal to adopt final rules by     year-end 2011 or early 2012. In addition to the capital     proposals, in December 2010 the Basel Committee proposed two     measures of liquidity risk. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio     identifies the amount of unencumbered, high quality liquid     assets a financial institution holds that can be used to offset     the net cash outflows the institution would encounter under an     acute 30-day     stress scenario. The Net Stable Funding Ratio measures the     amount of longer-term, stable sources of funding employed by a     financial institution relative to the liquidity profiles of the     assets funded and the potential for contingent calls on funding     liquidity arising from off-balance sheet commitments and     obligations, over a one-year period. The Basel Committee expects     the Liquidity Coverage Ratio to be implemented in January 2015     and the Net Stable Funding Ratio to be implemented in January     2018, following observation periods beginning in 2012.       Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital,     regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could have a material     adverse effect on our financial condition and results of     operations, as we may need to liquidate certain assets, perhaps     on terms unfavorable to us and contrary to our business plans.     Such a requirement could also compel us to issue additional     securities, which could dilute our current common     stockholders.For additional information about the proposals     described above and their potential effect on our required     levels of regulatory capital, see Item 1.     Business  Capital and Operational Requirements on     page 5 and Capital Management  Regulatory     Capital in the MD&A beginning on page 63.   Government measures to regulate the financial industry,     including the Financial Reform Act, either individually, in     combination or in the aggregate, could require us to change     certain of our business practices, impose significant additional     costs on us, limit the products that we offer, limit our ability     to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, require     us to increase our regulatory capital, impact the value of     assets that we hold, significantly reduce our revenues or     otherwise materially and adversely affect our businesses,     financial condition or results of operations.       As a financial institution, we are heavily regulated at the     state, federal and international levels. As a result of the     financial crisis and related global economic downturn that began     in 2007, we have faced and expect to continue to face increased     public and legislative scrutiny as well as stricter and more     comprehensive regulation of our financial services practices.     These regulatory and legislative measures, either individually,     in combination or in the aggregate, could require us to change     certain of our business practices, impose significant additional     costs on us, limit the products that we offer, limit our ability     to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, require     us to increase our regulatory capital, impact the value of     assets that we hold,              14     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           significantly reduce our revenues or otherwise materially and     adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, or results     of operations.       Throughout 2009 and 2010, several major regulatory and     legislative initiatives were adopted that will have significant     future impacts on our businesses and financial results. For     example, in November 2009, the Federal Reserve Board issued     amendments to Regulation E, which implements the Electronic     Fund Transfer Act. The rules became effective on     July 1, 2010 for new customers and August 16, 2010 for     existing customers. These amendments limit the way we and other     banks charge an overdraft fee for non-recurring debit card     transactions that overdraw a consumers account unless the     consumer affirmatively consents to the banks payment of     overdrafts for those transactions. In addition, in May 2009, the     Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure     (CARD) Act of 2009 was signed into law. The majority     of the CARD Act provisions became effective in February 2010.     The CARD Act legislation contains comprehensive credit card     reform related to credit card industry practices, including     significantly restricting banks ability to change interest     rates and assess fees to reflect individual consumer risk,     changing the way payments are applied and requiring changes to     consumer credit card disclosures. Complying with the     Regulation E amendments and the CARD Act has required us to     invest significant management attention and resources to make     the necessary disclosure and systems changes and has adversely     affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect, our     earnings.       In July 2010, the Financial Reform Act was signed into law. The     Financial Reform Act, among other reforms, (i) mandates     that the Federal Reserve Board limit debit card interchange     fees; (ii) bans banking organizations from engaging in     proprietary trading and restricts their sponsorship of, or     investing in, hedge funds and private equity funds, subject to     limited exceptions; (iii) increases regulation of the     over-the-counter     derivative markets through measures that broaden the derivative     instruments subject to regulation, requiring clearing and     exchange trading and imposing additional capital and margin     requirements for derivative market participants;     (iv) changes the assessment base used in calculating FDIC     deposit insurance fees from assessable deposits to total assets     less tangible capital; (v) provides for heightened capital,     liquidity, and prudential regulation and supervision over     systemically important financial institutions;     (vi) provides for resolution authority to establish a     process to unwind large systemically important financial     companies; (vii) creates a new regulatory body to set     requirements around the terms and conditions of consumer     financial products and expands the role of state regulators in     enforcing consumer protection requirements over banks;     (viii) disqualifies trust preferred securities and other     hybrid capital securities from Tier 1 capital;     (ix) includes a variety of corporate governance and     executive compensation provisions and requirements; and     (x) requires securitizers to retain a portion of the risk     that would otherwise be transferred into certain securitization     transactions.       Many of these provisions have begun to be or will be phased in     over the next several months or years and will be subject both     to further rulemaking and the discretion of applicable     regulatory bodies. The ultimate impact of the final rules on our     businesses and results of operations will depend on regulatory     interpretation and rulemaking, as well as the success of any of     our actions to mitigate the negative earnings impact of certain     provisions. For instance, in December 2010, the Federal Reserve     Board requested comment on a proposed rule that would establish     debit card interchange fee standards and prohibit network     exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions. The proposed     rule would establish standards for determining whether a debit     card interchange fee received by a card issuer is reasonable and     proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer for the     transaction. Depending upon which cap is ultimately adopted, the     final rule could have a significant adverse effect on our     financial condition and results of operations and could result     in additional goodwill impairment charges within our Global     Card Services business segment.       We also anticipate that the final regulations associated with     the Financial Reform Act will include limitations on certain     activities, including limitations on           the use of a banks own capital for proprietary trading and     sponsorship or investment in hedge funds and private equity     funds (Volcker Rule). Regulations implementing the Volcker Rule     are required to be in place by October 21, 2011, and the     Volcker Rule becomes effective 12 months after such rules     are final or on July 21, 2012, whichever is earlier. The     Volcker Rule then gives banking entities two years from the     effective date (with opportunities for additional extensions) to     bring activities and investments into conformance. In     anticipation of the adoption of the final regulations, we have     begun winding down our proprietary trading line of business. The     ultimate impact of the Volcker Rule or the winding down of this     business, and the time it will take to comply or complete,     continues to remain uncertain. The final regulations issued may     impose additional operational and compliance costs on us.       Additionally, the Financial Reform Act includes measures to     broaden the scope of derivative instruments subject to     regulation by requiring clearing and exchange trading of certain     derivatives, imposing new capital and margin requirements for     certain market participants and imposing position limits on     certain     over-the-counter     derivatives. The Financial Reform Act grants the     U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the     SEC substantial new authority and requires numerous rulemakings     by these agencies. Generally, the CFTC and SEC have until     July 16, 2011 to promulgate the rulemakings necessary to     implement these regulations. The ultimate impact of these     derivatives regulations, and the time it will take to comply,     continues to remain uncertain. The final regulations will impose     additional operational and compliance costs on us and may     require us to restructure certain businesses and negatively     impact our revenues and results of operations.       The Financial Reform Act provided for a new resolution authority     to establish a process to unwind large systemically important     financial institutions. As part of that process we will be     required to develop and implement a recovery and resolution plan     which will be subject to review by the FDIC and the Federal     Reserve Board to determine whether our plan is credible and     viable. As a result of FDIC and Federal Reserve Board review, we     could be required to take certain actions over the next several     years which could impose operational costs and could potentially     result in the divestiture or restructuring of certain businesses     and subsidiaries.       Although we cannot predict the full effect of the Financial     Reform Act on our operations, it, as well as the future rules     implementing its reforms, could result in a significant loss of     revenue, impose additional costs on us, require us to increase     our regulatory capital or otherwise materially adversely affect     our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.       In addition, Congress and the Administration have signaled     growing interest in reforming the U.S. corporate income     tax. While the timing of consideration of such legislative     reform is unclear, possible approaches include lowering the 35%     corporate tax rate, modifying the taxation of income earned     outside of the U.S. and limiting or eliminating various     other deductions, tax credits     and/or other     tax preferences. It is not possible at this time to quantify     either the one-time impact from remeasuring deferred tax assets     and liabilities that might result upon enactment of tax reform     or the ongoing impact reform might have on income tax expense,     but it is possible either of these impacts could adversely     affect our financial condition and results of operations.       Other countries have also proposed and, in some cases, adopted     certain regulatory changes targeted at financial institutions or     that otherwise affect us. For example, the European Union has     adopted increased capital requirements and the U.K. has     (i) increased liquidity requirements for local financial     institutions, including regulated U.K. subsidiaries of non-U.K.     bank holding companies and other financial institutions as well     as branches of non-U.K. banks located in the U.K;     (ii) adopted a Bank Tax Levy which will apply to the     aggregate balance sheet of branches and subsidiaries of non-U.K.     banks and banking groups operating in the U.K.;     (iii) proposed the creation and production of recovery and     resolution plans (commonly referred to as living wills) by U.K.     regulated entities; and (iv) announced the expectation of     corporate              Bank of America     2010     15     Table of Contents           income tax rate reductions of one percent to be enacted during     each of 2011, 2012 and 2013 that would favorably impact income     tax expense on future earnings but which would result in     adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and     related one-time charges to income tax expenses of nearly     $400 million for each one percent reduction (however, it is     possible that the full three percent rate reductions could be     enacted in 2011, which would result in a 2011 charge of     approximately $1.1 billion). We are also monitoring other     international legislative proposals that could materially impact     us, such as changes to income tax laws. Currently, in the U.K.,     net operating loss carry forwards (NOLs) have an indefinite     life. Were the U.K. taxing authorities to introduce limitations     on the future utilization of NOLs and the Corporation was unable     to document its continued ability to fully utilize its NOLs, it     would be required to establish a valuation allowance by a charge     to income tax expense. Depending upon the nature of the     limitations, such a change could be material in the period of     enactment. In addition, in 2010 the FSA issued a policy     statement regarding payment protection insurance (PPI) that     requires companies to review their sales practices and to     proactively remediate certain problems, if discovered. As a     result of this review, we may be required to record additional     liabilities.       For additional information about the regulatory initiatives     discussed above, see Regulatory Matters in the MD&A     beginning on page 56. For additional information about PPI,     see Note 14  Commitments and     Contingencies  Payment Protection     Insurance Claims Matter to the Consolidated Financial     Statements.       During the last ten years, the Corporation and its subsidiaries     and legacy companies have sold over $2.0 trillion of loans to     the GSEs. Each GSE is currently in a conservatorship, with its     primary regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, acting as     conservator. We cannot predict if, when or how the     conservatorships will end, or any associated changes to the     GSEs business structure that could result. We also cannot     predict whether the conservatorships will end in receivership.     There are several proposed approaches to reform the GSEs which,     if enacted, could change the structure of the GSEs and the     relationship among the GSEs, the government, and the private     markets. We expect dialogue concerning GSE reform to continue     and additional proposals to be advanced. We cannot predict the     prospects for the enactment, timing or content of legislative or     rulemaking proposals regarding the future status of the GSEs.     Accordingly, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the     future of the GSEs, including whether they will continue to     exist in their current form. GSE reform, if enacted, could     result in a significant change to the business operations of     Home Loans & Insurance.       Finally, since the financial crisis began several years ago, an     increasing number of bank failures has imposed significant costs     on the FDIC in resolving those failures, and the     regulators deposit insurance fund has been depleted. In     order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve     ratios of the deposit insurance fund, the FDIC has increased,     and may increase in the future, assessment rates of insured     institutions, including Bank of America.       Deposits placed at the U.S. Banks are insured by the FDIC,     subject to limits and conditions of applicable law and the     FDICs regulations. Pursuant to the Financial Reform Act,     FDIC insurance coverage limits were permanently increased to     $250,000 per customer. The Financial Reform Act also provides     for unlimited FDIC insurance coverage for non-interest bearing     demand deposit accounts for a two-year period beginning on     December 31, 2010 and ending on January 1, 2013. The     FDIC administers the DIF, and all insured depository     institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC that     fund the DIF. The Financial Reform Act changed the methodology     for calculating deposit insurance assessments from the amount of     an insured depository institutions domestic deposits to     its total assets minus tangible capital. On February 7,     2011 the FDIC issued a new regulation implementing revisions to     the assessment system mandated by the Financial Reform Act. The     new regulation will be effective April 1, 2011 and will be     reflected in the June 30, 2011 FDIC fund balance and the     invoices for assessments due           September 30, 2011. As a result of the new regulations, we     expect to incur higher annual deposit insurance assessments. We     have identified potential mitigation actions, but they are in     the early stages of development and we are not able to directly     control the basis or the amount of premiums that we are required     to pay for FDIC insurance or for other fees or assessment     obligations imposed on financial institutions. Any future     increases in required deposit insurance premiums or other bank     industry fees could have a significant adverse impact on our     financial condition and results of operations.   We face substantial potential legal liability and significant     regulatory action, which could have material adverse effects on     our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations,     or cause significant reputational harm to us.       We face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the     volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in     litigation and regulatory proceedings against us and other     financial institutions remain high and are increasing. Increased     litigation costs, substantial legal liability or significant     regulatory action against us could have material adverse effects     on our financial condition and results of operations or cause     significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could     adversely impact our business prospects. In addition, we     continue to face increased litigation risk and regulatory     scrutiny as a result of the Countrywide and Merrill Lynch     acquisitions. As a result of ongoing challenging economic     conditions and the increased level of defaults over recent     years, we have continued to experience increased litigation and     other disputes with counterparties regarding relative rights and     responsibilities. These litigation and regulatory matters and     any related settlements could have a material adverse effect on     our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.     They could also negatively impact our reputation and lead to     volatility of our stock price. For a further discussion of     litigation risks, see Note 14  Commitments     and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   Changes in governmental fiscal and monetary policy could     adversely affect our financial condition and results of     operations.       Our businesses and earnings are affected by domestic and     international fiscal and monetary policy. For example, the     Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money and credit     in the United States and its policies determine in large part     our cost of funds for lending, investing and capital raising     activities and the return we earn on those loans and     investments, both of which affect our net interest margin. The     actions of the Federal Reserve Board also can materially affect     the value of financial instruments we hold, such as debt     securities and MSRs, and its policies also can affect our     borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to     repay their loans. Our businesses and earnings are also affected     by the fiscal or other policies that are adopted by various     U.S. regulatory authorities,     non-U.S. governments     and international agencies. Changes in domestic and     international fiscal and monetary policies are beyond our     control and difficult to predict but could have an adverse     impact on our capital requirements and the costs of running our     businesses, in turn adversely impacting our financial condition     and results of operations.     Risk     of the Competitive Environment in which We Operate   We face significant and increasing competition in the     financial services industry.       We operate in a highly competitive environment.  Over     time, there has been substantial consolidation among companies     in the financial services industry, and this trend accelerated     in recent years as the credit crisis led to numerous mergers and     asset acquisitions among industry participants and in certain     cases reorganization, restructuring, or even bankruptcy. This     trend has also hastened the globalization of the securities and     financial services markets. We will continue to experience     intensified competition as further              16     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           consolidation in the financial services industry in connection     with current market conditions may produce larger,     better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies     that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products     and services at more competitive prices. To the extent we expand     into new business areas and new geographic regions, we may face     competitors with more experience and more established     relationships with clients, regulators and industry participants     in the relevant market, which could adversely affect our ability     to compete. In addition, technological advances and the growth     of     e-commerce     have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer     products and services that traditionally were banking products,     and for financial institutions to compete with technology     companies in providing electronic and internet-based financial     solutions. Increased competition may negatively affect our     results of operations by creating pressure to lower prices on     our products and services and reducing market share.   Damage to our reputation could significantly harm our     businesses, including our competitive position and business     prospects.       Our ability to attract and retain investors, customers, clients     and employees could be adversely affected to the extent our     reputation is damaged. Significant harm to our reputation can     arise from many sources, including employee misconduct,     litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver minimum     standards of service and quality, compliance failures, unethical     behavior, unintended disclosure of confidential information, and     the activities of our clients, customers and counterparties.     Actions by the financial services industry generally or by     certain members or individuals in the industry also can     significantly adversely affect our reputation.       Our actual or perceived failure to address various issues also     could give rise to reputational risk that could cause     significant harm to us and our business prospects, including     failure to properly address operational risks. These issues     include legal and regulatory requirements, privacy, properly     maintaining customer and associate personal information, record     keeping, protecting against money-laundering, sales and trading     practices, ethical issues, and the proper identification of the     legal, reputational, credit, liquidity and market risks inherent     in our products.       We could suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to     properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest.     Management of potential conflicts of interests has become     increasingly complex as we expand our business activities     through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests     with and among our clients. The failure to adequately address,     or the perceived failure to adequately address, conflicts of     interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with     us, or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions, which     could adversely affect our businesses.       We continue to face increased public and regulatory scrutiny     resulting from the financial crisis, including our foreclosure     practices, modifications of mortgages, volume of lending,     compensation practices, our acquisitions of Countrywide and     Merrill Lynch, and the suitability of certain trading and     investment businesses. Failure to appropriately address any of     these issues could also give rise to additional regulatory     restrictions, legal risks and reputational harm, which could,     among other consequences, increase the size and number of     litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to     enforcement actions, fines and penalties and cause us to incur     related costs and expenses.   Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is     critical to the success of our businesses and failure to do so     could adversely affect our business prospects, including our     competitive position and results of operations.       Our performance is heavily dependent on the talents and efforts     of highly skilled individuals. Competition for qualified     personnel within the financial services industry and from     businesses outside the financial services industry has been, and     is expected to continue to be, intense even during difficult     economic times. Our competitors include     non-U.S.-based     institutions and institutions otherwise not subject to     compensation and hiring regulations imposed on     U.S. institutions and financial institutions in particular.     The difficulty we face in competing for key personnel is     exacerbated in emerging markets, where we           are often competing for qualified employees with entities that     may have a significantly greater presence or more extensive     experience in the region.       In order to attract and retain qualified personnel, we must     provide market-level compensation. As a large financial and     banking institution, we may be subject to limitations on     compensation practices (which may or may not affect our     competitors) by the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC or other     regulators around the world. Any future limitations on executive     compensation imposed by legislators and regulators could     adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain qualified     employees. Furthermore, a substantial portion of our annual     bonus compensation paid to our senior employees has in recent     years taken the form of long-term equity awards. The value of     long-term equity awards to senior employees generally has been     negatively affected by the significant decline in the market     price of our common stock. If we are unable to continue to     attract and retain qualified individuals, our business     prospects, including our competitive position and results of     operations, could be adversely affected.   Our inability to adapt our products and services to evolving     industry standards and consumer preferences could harm our     businesses.       Our business model is based on a diversified mix of businesses     that provide a broad range of financial products and services,     delivered through multiple distribution channels. Our success     depends, in part, on our ability to adapt our products and     services to evolving industry standards. There is increasing     pressure by competitors to provide products and services at     lower prices. This can reduce our net interest margin and     revenues from our fee-based products and services. In addition,     the widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet     services, could require us to incur substantial expenditures to     modify or adapt our existing products and services. We might not     be successful in developing or introducing new products and     services, responding or adapting to changes in consumer spending     and saving habits, achieving market acceptance of our products     and services, or sufficiently developing and maintaining loyal     customers.     Risks     Related to Risk Management   Our risk management framework may not be effective in     mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant     losses.       Our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and     loss to us. We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and     control our exposure to the types of risk to which we are     subject, including strategic, credit, market, liquidity,     compliance, fiduciary, operational and reputational risks, among     others. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk     monitoring and mitigation techniques, those techniques are     inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence     or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown     risks. For example, recent economic conditions, heightened     legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services     industry and increases in the overall complexity of our     operations, among other developments, have resulted in the     creation of a variety of previously unanticipated or unknown     risks, highlighting the intrinsic limitations of our risk     monitoring and mitigation techniques. As such, we may incur     future losses due to the development of such previously     unanticipated or unknown risks.       For additional information about our risk management policies     and procedures, see Managing Risk in the MD&A beginning on     page 59.   A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems     or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could disrupt our     businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information     or damage our reputation. Any such failure also could have a     significant adverse effect on our reputation, cash flows,     financial condition, and results of operations.       Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process     and monitor, on a continuous basis, a large number of     transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous     and diverse markets in many currencies. The potential for     operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization,     including losses resulting from unauthorized trades by any     employees.              Bank of America     2010     17     Table of Contents           Integral to our performance is the continued efficacy of our     internal processes, systems, relationships with third parties     and the vast array of employees and key executives in our     day-to-day     and ongoing operations. Our financial, accounting, data     processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to     operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that     are wholly or partially beyond our control and adversely affect     our ability to process these transactions or provide these     services. We must continuously update these systems to support     our operations and growth. This updating entails significant     costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems     and integrating them with existing ones.       In addition, we also face the risk of operational failure,     termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing     agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial     intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions.     In recent years, there has been significant consolidation among     clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses, which has     increased our exposure to operational failure, termination or     capacity constraints of the particular financial intermediaries     that we use and could affect our ability to find adequate and     cost-effective alternatives in the event of any such failure,     termination or constraint. Industry consolidation, whether among     market participants or financial intermediaries, increases the     risk of operational failure as disparate complex systems need to     be integrated, often on an accelerated basis.       Furthermore, the interconnectivity of multiple financial     institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses,     and the increased centrality of these entities under proposed     and potential regulation, increases the risk that an operational     failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide     operational failure that could adversely impact our own business     operations. Any such failure, termination or constraint could     adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our     clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses     and could have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity,     financial condition, and results of operations.       Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and     transmission of confidential and other information in our     computer systems and networks. Although we take protective     measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant,     the security of our computer systems, software and networks may     be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer     viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have     a security impact. Additionally, breaches of security may occur     through intentional or unintentional acts by those having     authorized or unauthorized access to our or our clients or     counterparties confidential or other information. If one     or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize     our or our clients or counterparties confidential     and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted     through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause     interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients, our     counterparties or third parties operations, which     could result in significant losses or reputational damage to us.     We may be required to expend significant additional resources to     modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate     vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and     security risks, and we may be subject to litigation and     financial losses that are either not insured against or not     fully covered through any insurance maintained by us.       We routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and     proprietary information by     e-mail and     other electronic means. We have discussed and worked with     clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other     third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities, but     we do not have, and may be unable to put in place, secure     capabilities with all of our clients, vendors, service     providers, counterparties and other third parties, and we may     not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate     controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the     information. Any interception, misuse or mishandling of     personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to     or received from a client, vendor, service provider,     counterparty or other third party could result in legal     liability, regulatory action and           reputational harm for us and could have a significant adverse     effect on our competitive position, financial condition and     results of operations.       With regard to the physical infrastructure that supports our     operations, we have taken measures to implement backup systems     and other safeguards, but our ability to conduct business may be     adversely affected by any disruption to that infrastructure.     Such disruptions could involve electrical, communications,     internet, transportation or other services used by us or third     parties with whom we conduct business. These disruptions may     occur as a result of events that affect only our facilities or     those of our clients or other business partners but they could     also be the result of events with a broader impact globally,     regionally or in the cities where those facilities are located.     The costs associated with such disruptions, including any loss     of business, could have a significant adverse effect on our     results of operations or financial condition.       Any of these operational and security risks could lead to     significant and negative consequences, including reputational     harm as well as loss of customers and business opportunities,     which in turn could have a significant adverse effect on our     businesses, financial condition and results of operations. For a     further discussion of operational risks and our operational risk     management, see Operational Risk Management in the MD&A     beginning on page 106.     Risk     Related to Past Acquisitions   Any failure to successfully integrate or otherwise realize     the expected benefits from our recent acquisitions could     adversely affect our results of operations.       There are significant risks and uncertainties associated with     mergers and acquisitions. We have made several significant     acquisitions in the last several years, including Merrill Lynch     and Countrywide, and the success of these acquisitions faces     numerous challenges. In particular, the success of our     acquisition of Merrill Lynch in 2009 will continue to depend, in     part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and     cost savings from combining the businesses of Bank of America     and Merrill Lynch. If we are not able to successfully integrate     these businesses, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of     the acquisition may not be realized fully or may take longer to     realize than expected. For example, we may fail to realize the     growth opportunities and cost savings anticipated to be derived     from the acquisition. With regard to any of our acquisitions, a     significant decline in asset valuations or cash flows may also     cause us not to realize expected benefits. These failures could     in turn negatively affect our financial condition, including     adversely impacting the carrying value of the acquisition     premium or goodwill. Our ability to achieve these objectives has     also been made more difficult as a result of the substantial     challenges that we are facing in our businesses because of the     current economic environment.       In addition, it is possible that the integration process could     result in disruption of our and Merrill Lynchs ongoing     businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures     and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain     sufficiently strong relationships with clients, customers,     depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits     of the acquisition. Integration efforts may also divert     management attention and resources. These integration matters     could have an adverse effect on us for an undetermined period.     We will be subject to similar risks and difficulties in     connection with any future acquisitions or decisions to     downsize, sell or close units or otherwise change the business     mix of the Corporation.     Risk     of Being an International Business   We are subject to numerous political, economic, market,     reputational, operational, legal, regulatory and other risks in     the     non-U.S. jurisdictions     in which we operate which could adversely impact our     businesses.       We do business throughout the world, including in developing     regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets. Our     businesses and revenues derived from     non-U.S. jurisdictions     are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations, social     or judicial instability, changes in governmental              18     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           policies or policies of central banks, expropriation,     nationalization     and/or     confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls,     exchange controls, other restrictive actions, unfavorable     political and diplomatic developments and changes in     legislation. These risks are especially acute in emerging     markets. As in the United States, many     non-U.S. jurisdictions     in which we do business have been negatively impacted by     recessionary conditions. While a number of these jurisdictions     are showing signs of recovery, others continue to experience     increasing levels of stress. In addition, the risk of default on     sovereign debt in some     non-U.S. jurisdictions     is increasing and could expose us to substantial losses. Any     such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an     adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations.       Our     non-U.S. businesses     are also subject to extensive regulation by various     non-U.S. regulators,     including governments, securities exchanges, central banks and     other regulatory bodies, in the jurisdictions in which those     businesses operate. In many countries, the laws and regulations     applicable to the financial services and securities industries     are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to     determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market     or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various     jurisdictions. Our inability to remain in compliance with local     laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with     regulators could have a significant and adverse effect not only     on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation     generally.       We also invest or trade in the securities of corporations and     governments located in     non-U.S. jurisdictions,     including emerging markets. Revenues from the trading of     non-U.S. securities     may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above     factors. Furthermore, the impact of these fluctuations could be     magnified, because     non-U.S. trading     markets, particularly in emerging market countries, are     generally smaller, less liquid and more volatile than     U.S. trading markets.       We are subject to geopolitical risks, including acts or threats     of terrorism, and actions taken by the U.S. or other     governments in response     and/or     military conflicts, that could adversely affect business and     economic conditions abroad as well as in the United States.             For a further discussion of our     non-U.S. credit     and trading portfolio, see Credit Risk Management      Non-U.S. Portfolio     in the MD&A beginning on page 94.     Risk     from Accounting Changes   Changes in accounting standards or inaccurate estimates or     assumptions in the application of accounting policies could     adversely affect our financial condition and results of     operations.       Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we     record and report our financial condition and results of     operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and     assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or     liabilities and results of operations and are critical because     they require management to make difficult, subjective and     complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.     If those assumptions, estimate or judgments were incorrectly     made, we could be required to correct and restate prior period     financial statements.       Accounting standard-setters and those who interpret the     accounting standards (such as the Financial Accounting Standards     Board (FASB), the SEC, banking regulators and our independent     registered public accounting firm) may also amend or even     reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how     various standards should be applied. These changes can be hard     to predict and can materially impact how we record and report     our financial condition and results of operations. In some     cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard     retroactively, resulting in the Corporation needing to revise     and republish prior period financial statements. For a further     discussion of some of our critical accounting policies and     standards and recent accounting changes, see Complex Accounting     Estimates in the MD&A beginning on page 107 and     Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting     Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

These statements can     be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to     historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often     use words such as expects, anticipates,     believes, estimates,     targets, intends, plans,     goal and other similar expressions or future or     conditional verbs such as will, may,     might, should, would and     could. The forward-looking statements made represent     the current expectations, plans or forecasts of the Corporation     regarding the Corporations future results and revenues,     and future business and economic conditions more generally,     including statements concerning: the adequacy of the liability     for the remaining representations and warranties exposure to the     government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and the future impact to     earnings; the potential assertion and impact of additional     claims not addressed by the GSE agreements; the expected     repurchase claims on the     2004-2008     loan vintages; representations and warranties liabilities (also     commonly referred to as reserves), and range of possible loss     estimates, expenses and repurchase claims and resolution of     those claims; the proposal to modestly increase dividends in the     second half of 2011; the charge to income tax expense resulting     from a reduction in the United Kingdom (U.K.) corporate income     tax rate; future payment protection insurance claims in the     U.K.; future risk-weighted assets and any mitigation efforts to     reduce risk-weighted assets; net interest income; credit trends     and conditions, including credit losses, credit reserves,     charge-offs, delinquency trends and nonperforming asset levels;     consumer and commercial service charges, including the impact of     changes in the Corporations overdraft policy as well as     from the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and the     Corporations ability to mitigate a decline in revenues;     liquidity; capital levels determined by or established in     accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the     United States of America (GAAP) and with the requirements of     various regulatory agencies, including our ability to comply     with any Basel capital requirements endorsed by     U.S. regulators without raising additional capital; the     revenue impact of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility     and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the CARD Act); the revenue impact     resulting from, and any mitigation actions taken in response to,     the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act     (the Financial Reform Act) including the impact of the Volcker     Rule and derivatives regulations; mortgage production levels;     long-term debt levels; run-off of loan portfolios; the impact of     various legal proceedings discussed in Litigation and     Regulatory Matters in Note 14  Commitments     and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements; the     number of delayed foreclosure sales and the resulting financial     impact and other similar matters; and other matters relating to     the Corporation and the securities that we may offer from time     to time. The foregoing is not an exclusive list of all     forward-looking statements the Corporation makes. These     statements are not guarantees of future results or performance     and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that     are difficult to predict and often are beyond the     Corporations control. Actual outcomes and results may     differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the     Corporations forward-looking statements.   You should not place undue     reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider     the following uncertainties and risks, as well as the risks and     uncertainties more fully discussed elsewhere in this report,     including Item 1A. Risk Factors, and in any of     the Corporations subsequent Securities and Exchange     Commission (SEC) filings: the Corporations resolution of     certain        representations and warranties     obligations with the GSEs and our ability to resolve any     remaining claims; the Corporations ability to resolve any     representations and warranties obligations with monolines and     private investors; failure to satisfy our obligations as     servicer in the residential mortgage securitization process; the     adequacy of the liability     and/or range     of possible loss estimates for the representations and     warranties exposures to the GSEs, monolines and private-label     and other investors; the potential assertion and impact of     additional claims not addressed by the GSE agreements; the     foreclosure review and assessment process, the effectiveness of     the Corporations response and any governmental or private     third-party claims asserted in connection with these foreclosure     matters; the adequacy of the reserve for future payment     protection insurance claims in the U.K.; negative economic     conditions generally including continued weakness in the     U.S. housing market, high unemployment in the U.S., as well     as economic challenges in many     non-U.S. countries     in which we operate and sovereign debt challenges; the     Corporations mortgage modification policies and related     results; the level and volatility of the capital markets,     interest rates, currency values and other market indices;     changes in consumer, investor and counterparty confidence in,     and the related impact on, financial markets and institutions,     including the Corporation as well as its business partners; the     Corporations credit ratings and the credit ratings of its     securitizations; estimates of the fair value of certain of the     Corporations assets and liabilities; legislative and     regulatory actions in the U.S. (including the impact of the     Financial Reform Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the     CARD Act and related regulations and interpretations) and     internationally; the identification and effectiveness of any     initiatives to mitigate the negative impact of the Financial     Reform Act; the impact of litigation and regulatory     investigations, including costs, expenses, settlements and     judgments as well as any collateral effects on our ability to do     business and access the capital markets; various monetary, tax     and fiscal policies and regulations of the U.S. and     non-U.S. governments;     changes in accounting standards, rules and interpretations     (including new consolidation guidance), inaccurate estimates or     assumptions in the application of accounting policies, including     in determining reserves, applicable guidance regarding goodwill     accounting and the impact on the Corporations financial     statements; increased globalization of the financial services     industry and competition with other U.S. and international     financial institutions; adequacy of the Corporations risk     management framework; the Corporations ability to attract     new employees and retain and motivate existing employees;     technology changes instituted by the Corporation, its     counterparties or competitors; mergers and acquisitions and     their integration into the Corporation, including the     Corporations ability to realize the benefits and cost     savings from and limit any unexpected liabilities acquired as a     result of the Merrill Lynch and Countrywide acquisitions; the     Corporations reputation, including the effects of     continuing intense public and regulatory scrutiny of the     Corporation and the financial services industry; the effects of     any unauthorized disclosures of our or our customers     private or confidential information and any negative publicity     directed toward the Corporation; and decisions to downsize, sell     or close units or otherwise change the business mix of the     Corporation.   Forward-looking statements speak     only as of the date they are made, and the Corporation     undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement     to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise     after the date the forward-looking statement was made.       Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to in     the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial     Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) are incorporated     by reference into the MD&A. Certain prior period amounts     have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.               Bank of America     2010     23     Table of Contents          Executive     Summary      Business     Overview       The Corporation is a Delaware corporation, a bank holding     company and a financial holding company. When used in this     report, the Corporation may refer to the Corporation     individually, the Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain     of the Corporations subsidiaries or affiliates. Our     principal executive offices are located in the Bank of America     Corporate Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. Through our     banking and various nonbanking subsidiaries throughout the     United States and in certain international markets, we provide a     diversified range of banking and nonbanking financial services     and products through six business segments: Deposits, Global     Card Services, Home Loans & Insurance, Global     Commercial Banking, Global Banking & Markets     (GBAM) and Global Wealth & Investment     Management (GWIM), with the remaining operations recorded in     All Other. Effective January 1, 2010, we realigned     the Global Corporate and Investment Banking portion of the     former Global Banking business segment with the former     Global Markets business segment to form GBAM     and to reflect Global Commercial Banking as a     standalone segment. At December 31, 2010, the Corporation     had $2.3 trillion in assets and approximately     288,000 full-time equivalent employees.             On January 1, 2009, we acquired Merrill Lynch &     Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch) and, as a result, we now have one of     the largest wealth management businesses in the world with     nearly 17,000 wealth advisors, an additional 3,000 client-facing     professionals and more than $2.2 trillion in client assets.     Additionally, we are a global leader in corporate and investment     banking and trading across a broad range of asset classes     serving corporations, governments, institutions and individuals     around the world.       As of December 31, 2010, we operate in all 50 states,     the District of Columbia and more than 40     non-U.S. countries.     Our retail banking footprint covers approximately     80 percent of the U.S. population and in the U.S., we     serve approximately 57 million consumer and small business     relationships with 5,900 banking centers, 18,000 ATMs,     nationwide call centers, and leading online and mobile banking     platforms. We have banking centers in 13 of the 15 fastest     growing states and have leadership positions in market share for     deposits in seven of those states. We offer industry-leading     support to approximately four million small business owners.

For additional information on these measures and ratios, see     Supplemental Financial Data beginning on page 36, and for a     corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see     Table XIII.         (2)   Net income (loss), diluted earnings     (loss) per common share, return on average assets, ROTE and the     efficiency ratio have been calculated excluding the impact of     goodwill impairment charges of $12.4 billion in 2010 and     accordingly, these are non-GAAP measures. For additional     information on these measures and ratios, see Supplemental     Financial Data beginning on page 36, and for a     corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see     Table XIII.         (3)   Balances and ratios do not include     loans accounted for under the fair value option. For additional     exclusions on nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed     properties, see Nonperforming Consumer Loans and Foreclosed     Properties Activity beginning on page 81 and corresponding     Table 33, and Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and     Foreclosed Properties Activity and corresponding Table 41 on     page 89.         (4)   Net charge-offs as a percentage of     average loans and leases outstanding excluding purchased     credit-impaired (PCI) loans were 3.73 percent and     3.71 percent for 2010 and 2009.         (5)   Ratio of the allowance for loan and     lease losses to net charge-offs excluding (PCI) loans was     1.04 percent and 1.00 percent for 2010 and 2009.             n/m = not meaningful          24     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents       2010 Economic and     Business Environment       The banking environment and markets in which we conduct our     businesses will continue to be strongly influenced by     developments in the U.S. and global economies, as well as     the continued implementation and rulemaking from recent     financial reforms. The global economy continued to recover in     2010, but growth was very uneven across countries and regions.     Emerging nations, led by China, India and Brazil, expanded     rapidly, while the U.S., U.K., Europe and Japan continued to     grow modestly.     United     States       In the U.S., the economy began to recover early in 2010, fueled     by moderate growth in consumption and inventory rebuilding, but     slowed in late spring, coincident with the intensification of     Europes financial crisis. A slowdown in consumption and     domestic demand growth contributed to weak employment gains and     an unemployment rate that drifted close to 10 percent.     Year-over-year     inflation measures receded below one percent and stock market     indices declined. Concerns about high unemployment and fears     that the U.S. might incur deflation led the Federal Reserve     to adopt a second round of quantitative easing that involved     purchases of $600 billion of U.S. Treasury securities     scheduled to occur through June 2011. The announcement of this     policy led to lower interest rates. Bond yields rebounded in the     second half of 2010 as the U.S. economy reaccelerated,     driven by stronger consumer spending, rapid growth of exports     and business investment in equipment and software. The strong     holiday retail season provided healthy economic momentum toward     year end. Despite only moderate economic growth in 2010,     corporate profits rose sharply, benefiting from strong     productivity gains and constraints on hiring and operating     costs. Cautious business financial practices resulted in a     record-breaking $1.5 trillion in free cash flows at     non-financial businesses.       The housing market remained weak throughout 2010. Home sales     were soft, despite lower home prices and low interest rates.     There were delays in the foreclosure process on the large number     of distressed mortgages and the supply of unsold homes remained     high. Based on available Home Price Index (HPI) information, the     mild improvement in home prices that occurred in the second half     of 2009 continued into early 2010. However, housing prices     renewed a downward trend in the second half of 2010, due in part     to the expiration of tax incentives for home buyers.       Credit quality of bank loans to businesses and households     improved significantly in 2010 and the continued economic     recovery improved the environment for bank lending. Bank     commercial and industrial loans to businesses increased in the     last few months of 2010, following their steep recession-related     declines, reflecting increasing loan demand relating to stronger     production, inventory building and capital spending. Rising     disposable personal income, household deleveraging and improving     household finances contributed to improving consumer credit     quality.     Europe       In Europe, a financial crisis emerged in mid-2010, triggered by     high budget deficits and rising direct and contingent sovereign     debt in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain that created     concerns about the ability of these European Union (EU)     peripheral nations to continue to service their debt     obligations. These conditions impacted financial markets and     resulted in high and volatile bond yields on the sovereign debt     of many EU nations. The financial crisis and efforts by the     European Commission, European Central Bank (ECB) and     International Monetary Fund (IMF) to negotiate a financial     support package to financially challenged EU nations unsettled     global financial markets and contributed to Euro exchange rate     and interest rate volatility. Economic performance of certain EU     core nations, led by Germany, remained healthy     throughout 2010, while the economies of Greece, Ireland, Italy,     Portugal and Spain experienced recessionary conditions and     slowing           growth in response to the financial crisis and the     implementation of fiscal austerity programs. Additionally, Spain     and Irelands economies declined as a result of material     deterioration in their housing sectors. Uncertainty over the     outcome of the EU governments financial support programs     and worries about sovereign finances continued through year end.     For information on our exposure in Europe, see     Non-U.S. Portfolio     beginning on page 94 and Note 28      Performance by Geographical Area to the Consolidated     Financial Statements.     Asia       Asia, excluding Japan, continued to outperform all other regions     in 2010 with strong growth across most countries. China and     India continued to lead the region in terms of growth and China     became the second largest economy in the world after the U.S.,     eclipsing Japan. Growth across the region became broader based     with consumer demand, investment activity and exports all     performing well. Asia remained well positioned to withstand     global shocks because of record international reserves, current     account surpluses and reduced external leverage. Many Asian     nations, including China, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and     Malaysia, are net external creditors, with China and Japan among     the largest holders of U.S. Treasury bonds. Bank balance     sheets have improved across most of the region and asset quality     issues have remained manageable. Among the key challenges faced     by the region were large capital inflows that placed     appreciation pressures on most currencies against the     U.S. Dollar (USD), complicating monetary policy and adding     to excess liquidity pressures. Most countries in the region,     including China, India, South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia,     began to withdraw fiscal stimulus and tighten monetary policy     with hikes in interest rates as growth gathered momentum and as     food and broader price inflation pressures began to increase.     Japan performed well early in the year, but the economy weakened     at the end of the year due to weakening consumer demand, and     appreciation of the yen that hurt export competitiveness. For     information on our exposure in Asia, see     Non-U.S. Portfolio     beginning on page 94 and Note 28      Performance by Geographical Area to the Consolidated     Financial Statements.     Emerging     Nations       In the emerging nations, inflation pressures began to mount and     their central banks raised interest rates or took steps to     tighten monetary policy and slow bank lending. Strong growth in     emerging nations and their favorable economic outlooks attracted     capital from the industrialized nations. The excess global     liquidity generated by the accommodative monetary policies of     the Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan and other central banks also     flowed into emerging nations. These capital inflows put upward     pressure on many emerging nation currencies. As a result, some     emerging nations, such as Brazil, experienced strong currency     appreciation. However, in other nations, that peg their     currencies to the U.S. dollar, currency appreciation was     muted causing inflationary pressures and rapid real estate price     appreciation. Global economic momentum, along with the generally     weak U.S. dollar and easing monetary policies in several     industrialized nations, contributed to rising prices for     industrial commodities in these emerging nations. Through year     end, inflation pressures in key emerging nations continued to     mount. For more information on our emerging nations exposure,     see Table 48 on page 95.     Performance     Overview       In 2010, we reported a net loss of $2.2 billion compared to     net income of $6.3 billion in 2009. After preferred stock     dividends and accretion of $1.4 billion in 2010 compared     with $8.5 billion in 2009, net loss applicable to common     shareholders was $3.6 billion, or $0.37 per diluted common     share, compared to $2.2 billion, or $0.29 per diluted     common share in 2009. Our 2010 results reflected, among other     things, $12.4 billion in goodwill impairment charges,     including non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment     charges of              Bank of America     2010     25     Table of Contents           $10.4 billion in Global Card Services and     $2.0 billion in Home Loans & Insurance.     For more information about the goodwill impairment charges in     2010, see Complex Accounting Estimates beginning on     page 107 and Note 10  Goodwill and     Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Excluding the $12.4 billion of goodwill impairment charges,     net income was $10.2 billion for 2010. After preferred     stock dividends and accretion, net income applicable to common     shareholders, excluding the goodwill impairment charges was     $8.8 billion, or $0.86 per diluted common share, for 2010.     Revenue, net of interest expense on a FTE basis decreased     $9.6 billion or eight percent to $111.4 billion in     2010.       Net interest income on a FTE basis increased $4.3 billion     to $52.7 billion for 2010 compared to 2009. The increase     was due to the impact of deposit pricing and the adoption of new     consolidation guidance. The increase was partially offset by     lower commercial and consumer loan levels and lower rates on the     core assets and trading assets and liabilities.       Noninterest income decreased $13.8 billion to     $58.7 billion in 2010 compared to $72.5 billion in     2009. Contributing to the decline was lower mortgage banking     income, down $6.1 billion, largely due to $6.8 billion     in representations and warranties provision, and decreases in     equity investment income of $4.8 billion, gains on sales of     debt securities of $2.2 billion, trading account profits of     $2.2 billion, service charges of $1.6 billion and     insurance income of $694 million, compared to 2009. These     declines were partially offset by an increase in other income of     $2.4 billion and a decrease in impairment losses of     $1.9 billion.       Representations and warranties expense increased     $4.9 billion to $6.8 billion in 2010 compared to     $1.9 billion in 2009. The increase was primarily driven by     a $4.1 billion provision for representations and warranties     in the fourth quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter provision     includes $3.0 billion related to the impact of the     agreements reached with the GSEs on December 31, 2010,     pursuant to which we paid $2.8 billion to resolve     repurchase claims involving certain residential mortgage loans     sold directly to the GSEs by entities related to legacy     Countrywide Financial Corporation (Countrywide) as well as     adjustments made to the representations and warranties liability     for other loans sold             directly to the GSEs and not covered by these agreements. For     more information about the GSE agreements, see Recent Events     beginning on page 33 and Note 9      Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate     Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       The provision for credit losses decreased $20.1 billion to     $28.4 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The provision for     credit losses was $5.9 billion lower than net charge-offs     in 2010, resulting in a reduction in reserves, compared with the     2009 provision for credit losses that was $14.9 billion     higher than net charge-offs, reflecting reserve additions     throughout the year. The reserve reduction in 2010 was due to     improving portfolio trends across most of the consumer and     commercial businesses, particularly the U.S. credit card,     consumer lending and small business products, as well as core     commercial loan portfolios.       Noninterest expense increased $16.4 billion to     $83.1 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was     driven by the $12.4 billion of goodwill impairment charges     recognized in 2010. Excluding the goodwill impairment charges,     noninterest expense increased $4.0 billion in 2010 compared     to 2009, driven by a $3.6 billion increase in personnel     costs reflecting the build-out of several businesses and a     $1.6 billion increase in litigation expense, partially     offset by lower merger and restructuring charges.        FTE basis, net income excluding the goodwill impairment     charges, noninterest expense excluding goodwill impairment     charges and net income applicable to common shareholders     excluding the goodwill impairment charges are non-GAAP measures.     For corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures,     see Table XIII.     Segment     Results       Effective January 1, 2010, management realigned the former     Global Banking and Global Markets business     segments into Global Commercial Banking and GBAM.

For     more information on this measure, see Supplemental Financial     Data beginning on page 36, and for a corresponding     reconciliation to a GAAP financial measure, see Table XIII.         (2)   In 2010, Global Card Services     and All Other are presented in accordance with new     consolidation guidance. Accordingly, current year Global Card     Services results are comparable to prior year results which     are presented on a managed basis. For more information on the     reconciliation of Global Card Services and All     Other, see Note 26  Business Segment     Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.                Deposits net income decreased from the prior year due to     a decline in revenue and higher noninterest expense. Net     interest income increased as a result of a customer shift to     more liquid products and continued pricing discipline, partially     offset by a lower net interest income allocation related to     asset and liability management (ALM) activities. The noninterest     income decline was driven by the impact of Regulation E,     which was effective in the third quarter of 2010 and our     overdraft policy changes implemented in late 2009. Noninterest     expense increased as a higher proportion of banking center sales     and service           costs was aligned to Deposits from the other segments,     and increased litigation expenses. The increase was partially     offset by the absence of a special Federal Deposit Insurance     Corporation (FDIC) assessment in 2009.   Global Card Services net loss increased compared to the     prior year due primarily to a $10.4 billion goodwill     impairment charge. Revenue decreased compared to the prior year     driven by lower average loans, reduced interest and fee income     primarily resulting from the implementation of the CARD Act and     the impact of recording a reserve related to future payment     protection              26     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           insurance claims in the U.K. that have not yet been asserted.     Provision for credit losses improved due to lower delinquencies     and bankruptcies as a result of the improved economic     environment, which resulted in reserve reductions in 2010     compared to reserve increases in the prior year. Noninterest     expense increased primarily due to the goodwill impairment     charge.   Home Loans & Insurance net loss increased in     2010 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in     representations and warranties provision and a $2.0 billion     goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by a decline in     provision for credit losses driven by improving portfolio     trends. Mortgage banking income declined driven by increased     representations and warranties provision and lower production     volume reflecting a drop in the overall size of the mortgage     market. Noninterest expense increased primarily due to the     goodwill impairment charge, higher litigation expense and an     increase in default-related servicing expense, partially offset     by lower production expense and insurance losses.   Global Commercial Banking net income increased due to     lower credit costs. Revenue was negatively impacted by     additional costs related to our agreement to purchase certain     retail automotive loans. Net interest income increased due to a     growth in average deposits, partially offset by a lower net     interest income allocation related to ALM activities. Credit     pricing discipline offset the impact of the decline in average     loan balances. The provision for credit losses decreased driven     by improvements from stabilizing values in the commercial real     estate portfolio.   GBAM net income decreased driven by the absence of the     gain in the prior year related to the contribution of our     merchant processing business to a joint venture. Additionally,     the decrease was driven by lower sales and trading revenue due     to more favorable market conditions in the prior year, partially           offset by credit valuation gains on derivative liabilities and     gains on legacy assets compared to losses in the prior year.     Provision for credit losses declined driven by lower net     charge-offs and reserve levels, as well as a reduction in     reservable criticized balances. Noninterest expense increased     driven by higher compensation costs as a result of the     recognition of expense on a proportionately larger amount of     prior year incentive deferrals and investments in infrastructure     and personnel associated with further development of the     business. Income tax expense was adversely affected by a charge     related to the U.K. tax rate reduction impacting the carrying     value of deferred tax assets.   GWIM net income decreased driven by higher noninterest     expense and the tax-related effect of the sale of the Columbia     Management long-term asset management business partially offset     by higher noninterest income and lower credit costs. Revenue     increased driven by higher asset management fees and     transactional revenue. Provision for credit losses decreased     driven by stabilization of the portfolios and the recognition of     a single large commercial charge-off in 2009. Noninterest     expense increased due primarily to higher revenue-related     expenses, support costs and personnel costs associated with     further investment in the business.   All Other net income decreased compared to the prior year     driven primarily by decreases in net interest income and     noninterest income, partially offset by a lower provision for     credit losses. Revenue decreased due primarily to lower equity     investment gains as the prior year included a gain resulting     from the sale of a portion of our investment in China     Construction Bank (CCB) combined with reduced gains on the sale     of debt securities. The decrease in the provision for credit     losses was due to improving portfolio trends in the residential     mortgage portfolio.           Bank of America     2010     27     Table of Contents          Financial     Highlights      Net Interest     Income       Net interest income on a FTE basis increased $4.3 billion     to $52.7 billion for 2010 compared to 2009. The increase     was due to the impact of deposit pricing and the adoption of new     consolidation guidance which contributed $10.5 billion to     net interest income in 2010. The increase was partially offset     by lower commercial and consumer loan levels, the sale of First     Republic in 2010 and lower rates on the core assets and trading     assets and liabilities, including derivatives exposure. The net     interest yield on a FTE basis increased 13 basis points     (bps) to 2.78 percent for 2010 compared to 2009 due to     these same factors.

The following     items highlight the significant changes.                   Card income decreased $245 million due to the     implementation of the CARD Act partially offset by the impact of     the new consolidation guidance and higher interchange income.               Service charges decreased $1.6 billion largely due to the     impact of Regulation E, which became effective in the third     quarter of 2010 and the impact of our overdraft policy changes     implemented in late 2009.               Equity investment income decreased by $4.8 billion, as net     gains on the sales of certain strategic investments during 2010,     including Itaú Unibanco, MasterCard, Santander and a     portion of our investment in BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock) were     less than gains in 2009 that included a $7.3 billion gain     related to the sale of a portion of our investment in CCB and     the $1.1 billion gain related to our BlackRock investment.               Trading account profits decreased $2.2 billion due to more     favorable market conditions in the prior year and investor     concerns regarding sovereign debt fears and regulatory     uncertainty. Net credit valuation gains on derivative     liabilities of $262 million for 2010 compared to losses of     $662 million for 2009.               Mortgage banking income decreased $6.1 billion due to an     increase of $4.9 billion in representations and warranties     provision and lower volume and margins.               Insurance income decreased $694 million due to a liability     recorded for future claims related to payment protection     insurance (PPI) sold in the U.K.               Gains on sales of debt securities decreased $2.2 billion     driven by a lower volume of sales of debt securities. The     decrease also included the impact of losses in 2010 related to     portfolio restructuring activities.               Other income (loss) improved by $2.4 billion. The prior     year included a net negative fair value adjustment of     $4.9 billion on structured liabilities compared to a net     positive adjustment of $18 million in 2010, and the prior     year                           also included a $3.8 billion gain on the contribution of     our merchant processing business to a joint venture. Legacy     asset write-downs included in other income (loss) were     $1.7 billion in 2009 compared to net gains of     $256 million in 2010.               Impairment losses recognized in earnings on     available-for-sale     (AFS) debt securities decreased $1.9 billion reflecting     lower impairment write-downs on non-agency residential     mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and collateralized debt     obligations (CDOs).       Provision for     Credit Losses       The provision for credit losses decreased $20.1 billion to     $28.4 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The provision for     credit losses was $5.9 billion lower than net charge-offs     for 2010, resulting in a reduction in reserves primarily due to     improving portfolio trends throughout the year across the     consumer and commercial businesses.       The provision for credit losses related to our consumer     portfolio decreased $11.4 billion to $25.4 billion for     2010 compared to 2009. The provision for credit losses related     to our commercial portfolio including the provision for unfunded     lending commitments decreased $8.7 billion to     $3.0 billion for 2010 compared to 2009.       Net charge-offs totaled $34.3 billion, or 3.60 percent     of average loans and leases for 2010 compared with     $33.7 billion, or 3.58 percent for 2009.

The increase was driven by a $3.6 billion     increase in personnel costs reflecting the build out of several     businesses, the recognition of expense on proportionally larger     prior year incentive deferrals and the U.K. payroll tax on     certain year-end incentive payments, as well as a     $1.6 billion increase in litigation costs. These increases     were partially offset by a $901 million decline in pre-tax     merger and restructuring charges compared to the prior year. The     prior year included a special FDIC assessment of     $724 million.     Income Tax     Expense       Income tax expense was $915 million for 2010 compared to a     benefit of $1.9 billion for 2009. The effective tax rate     for 2010 was not meaningful due to the impact of non-deductible     goodwill impairment charges of $12.4 billion.       The effective tax rate for 2010 excluding goodwill impairment     charges from pre-tax income was 8.3 percent compared to     (44.0) percent for 2009, primarily driven by an increase in     pre-tax income excluding the non-deductible goodwill impairment     charges. Also impacting the 2010 effective tax rate was a              28     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           $392 million charge from a U.K. law change referred to     below and a $1.7 billion tax benefit from the release of a     portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to     acquired capital loss carryforward tax benefits compared to     $650 million in 2009. For more information, see     Note 21  Income Taxes to the Consolidated     Financial Statements.       During 2010, the U.K. government enacted a tax law change     reducing the corporate income tax rate by one percent effective     for the 2011 U.K. tax financial year beginning on April 1,     2011. This reduction favorably affects           income tax expense on future U.K. earnings, but also required us     to re-measure our U.K. net deferred tax assets using the lower     tax rate. The U.K. corporate tax rate reduction resulted in an     income tax charge of $392 million in 2010. If future rate     reductions were to be enacted as suggested in U.K. Treasury     announcements and assuming no change in the deferred tax asset     balance, a similar charge to income tax expense for each one     percent reduction in the rate would result during each period of     enactment.

Average total assets in 2010 decreased     $3.5 billion from 2009. At December 31, 2010, total     liabilities were $2.0 trillion, an increase of     $37.9 billion, or two percent, from December 31, 2009.     Average total liabilities for 2010 increased $7.9 billion     from 2009.       Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance     sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management     functions, primarily involving our portfolios of highly liquid     assets, that are designed to ensure the adequacy of capital     while enhancing our ability to manage liquidity requirements for     the Corporation and for our customers, and to position the     balance sheet in accordance with the Corporations risk     appetite. The execution of these functions requires the use of     balance sheet and capital-related limits including spot, average     and risk-weighted asset limits, particularly in our trading     businesses. One of our key metrics, Tier 1 leverage ratio,     is calculated based on adjusted quarterly average total assets.         Impact of     Adopting New Consolidation Guidance       On January 1, 2010, the Corporation adopted new     consolidation guidance resulting in the consolidation of certain     former qualifying special purpose entities and VIEs that were     not recorded on the Corporations Consolidated Balance     Sheet prior to that date. The adoption of this new consolidation     guidance resulted in a net incremental increase in assets of     $100.4 billion, including $69.7 billion resulting from     consolidation of credit card trusts and $30.7 billion from     consolidation of other special purpose entities including     multi-seller conduits, and a net increase of $106.7 billion     in total liabilities, including $84.4 billion of long-term     debt. These amounts are net of retained interests in     securitizations held on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at     December 31, 2009 and a $10.8 billion increase in the     allowance for loan and lease losses, the majority of which     relates to credit card receivables. The Corporation recorded a     $6.2 billion charge,     net-of-tax,     to retained earnings on January 1, 2010 for the cumulative     effect of the adoption of this new consolidation guidance due     primarily to the increase in the allowance for loan and lease     losses, and a $116 million charge to accumulated other     comprehensive income (OCI). The initial recording of these     assets, related allowance for loan and lease losses and     liabilities on the Corporations Consolidated Balance Sheet     had no impact at the date of adoption on consolidated results of     operations. For additional detail on the impact of adopting this     new consolidation guidance, refer to Note 8      Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the     Consolidated Financial Statements.           Bank of America     2010     29     Table of Contents         Assets     Federal Funds     Sold and Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to     Resell       Federal funds transactions involve lending reserve balances on a     short-term basis. Securities borrowed and securities purchased     under agreements to resell are utilized to accommodate customer     transactions, earn interest rate spreads and obtain securities     for settlement. Year-end federal funds sold and securities     borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell increased     $19.7 billion and average amounts increased     $21.2 billion in 2010 compared to 2009, attributable     primarily to a favorable rate environment and increased customer     activity.     Trading Account     Assets       Trading account assets consist primarily of fixed-income     securities (including government and corporate debt), and equity     and convertible instruments. Year-end trading account assets     increased $12.5 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily     due to the adoption of new consolidation guidance as well as the     consolidation of a VIE late in 2010. Average trading account     assets decreased slightly in 2010 as compared to 2009.     Debt     Securities       Debt securities include U.S. Treasury and agency     securities, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), principally agency     MBS, foreign bonds, corporate bonds and municipal debt. We use     the debt securities portfolio primarily to manage interest rate     and liquidity risk and to take advantage of market conditions     that create more economically attractive returns on these     investments. Year-end and average balances of debt securities     increased $26.6 billion and $52.9 billion in 2010     compared to 2009 due to agency MBS purchases. For additional     information on AFS debt securities, see Market Risk     Management  Securities beginning on page 103 and     Note 5  Securities to the Consolidated     Financial Statements.     Loans and     Leases       Year-end and average loans and leases increased     $40.3 billion to $940.4 billion and $9.5 billion     to $958.3 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase     was primarily due to the impact of adopting new consolidation     guidance partially offset by continued deleveraging by     consumers, tighter underwriting and the elevated levels of     liquidity of commercial clients.

Allowance for     Loan and Lease Losses       Year-end and average allowance for loan lease losses increased     $4.7 billion and $12.3 billion in 2010 compared to     2009 primarily due to the $10.8 billion of reserves     recorded on January 1, 2010 in connection with the adoption     of new consolidation guidance and reserve additions in the PCI     portfolio throughout 2010. These were partially offset by     reserve reductions during 2010 due to the impacts of the     improving economy. For a more detailed discussion of the     Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, see Allowance for Loan and     Lease Losses beginning on page 97.     All Other     Assets       Year-end and average other assets decreased $59.7 billion     and $71.5 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 driven primarily     by the sale of strategic investments and goodwill impairment     charges.         Liabilities     Deposits       Year-end and average deposits increased $18.8 billion to     $1.0 trillion and $7.6 billion to $988.6 billion in     2010 compared to 2009. The increase was attributable to growth     in our noninterest-bearing deposits, NOW and money market     accounts primarily driven by affluent, and commercial and     corporate clients, partially offset by a decrease in time     deposits as a result of customer shift to more liquid products.     Federal Funds     Purchased and Securities Loaned or Sold Under Agreements to     Repurchase       Federal funds transactions involve borrowing reserve balances on     a short-term basis. Securities loaned and securities sold under     agreements to repurchase are collateralized borrowing     transactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn     interest rate spreads and finance assets on the balance sheet.     Year-end and average federal funds purchased and securities     loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase decreased     $9.8 billion and $16.2 billion in 2010 compared to     2009 primarily due to lower funding requirements.     Trading Account     Liabilities       Trading account liabilities consist primarily of short positions     in fixed-income securities (including government and corporate     debt), equity and convertible instruments. Year-end and average     trading account liabilities increased $6.5 billion and     $19.5 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 due to trading     activity in fixed-income securities.     Commercial Paper     and Other Short-term Borrowings       Commercial paper and other short-term borrowings provide a     funding source to supplement deposits in our ALM strategy.     Year-end and average commercial paper and other short-term     borrowings decreased $9.6 billion to $60.0 billion and     decreased $42.1 billion to $76.7 billion in 2010     compared to 2009 as a result of our strengthened liquidity     position.     Long-term     Debt       Year-end and average long-term debt increased by     $9.9 billion to $448.4 billion and $43.9 billion     to $490.5 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The increases     were attributable to the $84.4 billion impact of new     consolidation guidance as discussed on page 29 offset by     maturities outpacing new issuances and the Corporations     strategy to reduce our long-term debt. For additional     information on long-term debt, see Note 13      Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements.     All Other     Liabilities       Year-end all other liabilities increased $22.0 billion in     2010 compared to 2009 driven primarily by adoption of new     consolidation guidance.     Shareholders     Equity       Year-end and average shareholders equity decreased     $3.2 billion and $11.4 billion in 2010 compared to     2009. The decrease was driven primarily by the goodwill     impairment charges of $12.4 billion and the impact of     adopting new consolidation guidance as we recorded a     $6.2 billion charge to retained earnings for newly     consolidated loans partially offset by changes in accumulated     OCI.           30     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents       Cash Flows     Overview       The Corporations operating assets and liabilities support     our global markets and lending activities. We believe that cash     flows from operations, available cash balances and our ability     to generate cash through short- and long-term debt are     sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs. Our investing     activities primarily include the AFS securities portfolio and     other short-term investments. In addition, our financing     activities reflect cash flows related to raising customer     deposits and issuing long-term debt as well as preferred and     common stock.       Cash and cash equivalents decreased $12.9 billion during     2010 due to repayment and maturities of certain long-term debt     and net purchases of AFS securities partially offset by deposit     growth. Cash and cash equivalents increased $88.5 billion     during 2009 which reflected our strengthened liquidity. The     following discussion outlines the significant activities that     impacted our cash flows during 2010 and 2009.       During 2010, net cash provided by operating activities was     $82.6 billion compared to $129.7 billion in 2009. The     more significant adjustments to net           income (loss) to arrive at cash provided by operating activities     included the decreases in the provision for credit losses,     decreases in trading and derivative assets, and in 2010, the     goodwill impairment charges.       During 2010, net cash of $30.3 billion was used in     investing activities primarily for net purchases of AFS debt     securities. During 2009, net cash provided by investing     activities was $157.9 billion, in part, from net sales, pay     downs and maturities of AFS securities associated with our     management of interest rate risk, and net cash received from the     acquisition of Merrill Lynch.       During 2010, the net cash used in financing activities of     $65.4 billion primarily reflected the net decreases in     long-term debt as maturities outpaced new issuances. During     2009, net cash used in financing activities was     $199.6 billion reflecting the declines in commercial paper     and other short-term borrowings due, in part to lower Federal     Home Loan Bank (FHLB) balances as a result of our strong     liquidity position and a decrease in long-term debt as     maturities outpaced new issuances.

The agreement with FHLMC extinguishes all     outstanding and potential mortgage repurchase and make-whole     claims arising out of any alleged breaches of selling     representations and warranties related to loans sold directly by     legacy Countrywide to FHLMC through 2008, subject to certain     exceptions we do not believe will be material. The agreement     with FNMA substantially resolves the existing pipeline of     repurchase and make-whole claims outstanding as of     September 20, 2010 arising out of alleged breaches of     selling representations and warranties related to loans sold     directly by legacy Countrywide to FNMA. These agreements with     the GSEs do not cover outstanding and potential mortgage     repurchase and make-whole claims arising out of any alleged     breaches of selling representations and warranties to legacy     Bank of America first-lien residential mortgage loans sold     directly to the GSEs or other loans sold directly to the GSEs     other than described above, loan servicing obligations, other     contractual obligations or loans contained in private-label     securitizations.       As a result of these agreements and associated adjustments made     to the representations and warranties liability for other loans     sold directly to the GSEs and not covered by the agreements, the     Corporation recorded a provision of $3.0 billion during the     fourth quarter of 2010. We believe that our remaining exposure     to representations and warranties for first-lien residential     mortgage loans sold directly to the GSEs has been accounted for     as a result of these agreements and the associated adjustments     to our recorded liability for representations and warranties for     first-lien residential mortgage for loans sold directly to the     GSEs and not covered by the agreements as discussed above. We     believe our predictive repurchase models, utilizing our     historical repurchase experience with the GSEs while considering     current developments, including the recent agreements,     projections of future defaults as well as certain assumptions     regarding economic conditions, home prices and other matters,     allows us to reasonably estimate the liability for obligations     under representations and warranties on loans sold to the GSEs.     However, future provisions for representations and warranties     liability to the GSEs may be affected if actual experience is     different from our historical experience with the GSEs or our     projections of future defaults, and assumptions regarding     economic conditions, home prices and other matters, that are     incorporated in the provision calculation.       Although our experience with non-GSE claims remains limited, we     expect additional activity in this area going forward and that     the volume of repurchase claims from monolines, whole-loan     investors and investors in private-label securitizations could     increase in the future. It is reasonably possible that future     losses may occur, and our estimate is that the upper range of     possible loss related to non-GSE sales could be $7 billion     to $10 billion over existing accruals. This estimate does     not represent a probable loss, is based on currently available     information, significant judgment, and a number of assumptions     that are subject to change. A significant portion of this     estimate relates to loans originated through legacy Countrywide,     and the repurchase liability is generally limited to the     original seller of the loan. Future provisions and possible loss     or range of loss may be impacted if actual results are different     from our assumptions regarding economic conditions, home prices     and other matters and may vary by counterparty. The resolution     of the repurchase claims process with the non-GSE counterparties     will likely be a protracted process, and we will vigorously     contest any request for repurchase if we conclude that a valid     basis for the repurchase claim does not exist. For additional     information about representations and warranties, see     Note 9  Representations and Warranties     Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated     Financial Statements and Representations and Warranties     beginning on page 52.         Goodwill       In 2010, we recorded a $10.4 billion goodwill impairment     charge in Global Card Services and a $2.0 billion     goodwill impairment charge in Home Loans &     Insurance. These goodwill impairment charges are non-cash,     non-tax deductible and have no impact on our reported     Tier 1 and tangible equity ratios. Our consumer and small     business card products, including the debit card business, are     part of an integrated platform within Global Card     Services. Based on the provisions of the Financial Reform     Act which limit the interchange fees that may be charged with     respect to electronic debit interchange, we estimate a revenue     loss, beginning in the third quarter of 2011, of approximately     $2.0 billion annually based on current volumes and assuming     limited mitigation within this segment. Accordingly, we     performed a goodwill impairment analysis during the three months     ended September 30, 2010. This analysis indicated that the     implied fair value of the goodwill in Global Card Services     was less than the carrying value, and accordingly, we     recorded a $10.4 billion charge to reduce the carrying     value to fair value.       During the three months ended December 31, 2010, we     performed a goodwill impairment analysis for Home     Loans & Insurance as it was likely that there had     been a decline in its fair value as a result of increased     uncertainties, including existing and potential litigation     exposure and other related risks, higher servicing costs     including loss mitigation efforts, foreclosure related issues     and the redeployment of centralized sales resources to address     servicing needs. This analysis indicated that the implied fair     value of the goodwill in Home Loans & Insurance     was less than the carrying value, and accordingly, we     recorded a $2 billion charge to reduce the carrying value     of goodwill in Home Loans & Insurance.       For additional information on the goodwill impairment charges,     see Complex Accounting Estimates  Goodwill and     Intangible Assets beginning on page 110 and     Note 10  Goodwill and Intangible Assets     to the Consolidated Financial Statements.     Review of     Foreclosure Processes       On October 1, 2010, we voluntarily stopped taking     residential mortgage foreclosure proceedings to judgment in     states where foreclosure requires a court order following a     legal proceeding (judicial states). On October 8, 2010, we     stopped foreclosure sales in all states in order to complete an     assessment of the related business processes. These actions     generally did not affect the initiation and processing of     foreclosures prior to judgment, or sale of vacant real estate     owned properties. We took these precautionary steps in order to     ensure our processes for handling foreclosures include the     appropriate controls and quality assurance. Our review has     involved an assessment of the foreclosure process, including a     review of completed foreclosure affidavits in pending     proceedings.       As a result of that review, we identified and implemented     process and control enhancements, and we intend to monitor     ongoing quality results of each process. The process and control     enhancements implemented as a result of our review are intended     to strengthen the controls related to preparation, execution and     notarization of affidavits in judicial states and strengthen our     oversight of lawyers in the attorney network who conduct     foreclosure proceedings on our behalf, both in judicial states     and in states where foreclosures are handled without judicial     supervision (non-judicial states). This oversight includes a     periodic review of a sample of foreclosure files maintained by     these attorneys, and     on-site     reviews of law firms in the attorney network. In addition, our     process and control enhancements for both judicial and     non-judicial states include strengthening the controls related     to the preparation and execution of other foreclosure loan     documentation, including notices of default and pre-foreclosure     loss mitigation affidavits, as well as enhanced associate     training. After these enhancements were put in place, we resumed     foreclosure sales in most non-judicial states during the fourth     quarter of 2010, and expect sales to resume in the remaining     non-judicial states in the              Bank of America     2010     33     Table of Contents           first quarter of 2011. We also commenced a rolling process of     preparing, as necessary, affidavits of indebtedness in pending     foreclosure proceedings in order to resume the process of taking     these foreclosure proceedings to judgment in judicial states,     beginning with properties believed to be vacant, and with     properties for which the mortgage was originated on a     non-owner-occupied basis. The process of preparing affidavits in     pending proceedings is expected to continue in the first quarter     of 2011, and could result in prolonged adversary proceedings     that delay certain foreclosure sales.       Law enforcement authorities in all 50 states and the     U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and other federal     agencies, including certain bank supervisory authorities,     continue to investigate alleged irregularities in the     foreclosure practices of residential mortgage servicers.     Authorities have publicly stated that the scope of the     investigations extends beyond foreclosure documentation     practices to include mortgage loan modification and loss     mitigation practices. The Corporation is cooperating with these     investigations and is dedicating significant resources to     address these issues. The current environment of heightened     regulatory scrutiny has the potential to subject the Corporation     to inquiries or investigations that could significantly     adversely affect its reputation. Such investigations by state     and federal authorities, as well as any other governmental or     regulatory scrutiny of our foreclosure processes, could result     in material fines, penalties, equitable remedies (including     requiring default servicing or other process changes), or other     enforcement actions, and result in significant legal costs in     responding to governmental investigations and additional     litigation.       While we cannot predict the ultimate impact of the temporary     delay in foreclosure sales, or any issues that may arise as a     result of alleged irregularities with respect to previously     completed foreclosure activities, we may be subject to     additional borrower and non-borrower litigation and governmental     and regulatory scrutiny related to our past and current     foreclosure activities. This scrutiny may extend beyond our     pending foreclosure matters to issues arising out of alleged     irregularities with respect to previously completed foreclosure     activities. Our costs increased in the fourth quarter of 2010     and we expect that additional costs incurred in connection with     our foreclosure process assessment will continue into 2011 due     to the additional resources necessary to perform the foreclosure     process assessment, to revise affidavit filings and to implement     other operational changes. This will likely result in higher     noninterest expense, including higher servicing costs and legal     expenses, in Home Loans & Insurance. It is also     possible that the temporary suspension in foreclosure sales may     result in additional costs and expenses, including costs     associated with the maintenance of properties or possible home     price declines while foreclosures are delayed. In addition,     required process changes could increase our default servicing     costs over the longer term. Finally, the time to complete     foreclosure sales may increase temporarily, which may result in     an increase in nonperforming loans and servicing advances and     may impact the collectability of such advances and the value of     our mortgage servicing rights (MSR) asset, MBS and real estate     owned properties. An increase in the time to complete     foreclosure sales also may inflate the amount of highly     delinquent loans in the Corporations mortgage statistics,     result in increasing levels of consumer nonperforming loans, and     could have a dampening effect on net interest margin as     nonperforming assets increase. Accordingly, delays in     foreclosure sales, including any delays beyond those currently     anticipated, our continued process enhancements and any issues     that may arise out of alleged irregularities in our foreclosure     process could increase the costs associated with our mortgage     operations.       Loan sales have not been materially impacted by the temporary     delay in foreclosure sales or the review of our foreclosure     process. However, delays in foreclosure sales could negatively     impact the valuation of our real estate owned properties and MBS     that are serviced by us. With respect to agency MBS, while there     would be no credit impairment to security holders due to the     guarantee provided by the agencies, the valuation of certain MBS     could be negatively affected under certain scenarios due to     changes in the timing of cash flows. The impact on agency MBS     depends on, among other factors, how           long the underlying loans are affected by foreclosure delays and     would vary among securities. With respect to non-agency MBS,     under certain scenarios the timing and amount of cash flows     could be negatively affected. The ultimate impact on the     non-agency MBS depends on the same factors that impact agency     MBS, as well as the level of credit enhancement, including     subordination. In addition, as a result of our foreclosure     process assessment and related control enhancements that we have     implemented, there may continue to be delays in foreclosure     sales, including a continued backlog of foreclosure proceedings,     and evictions from real estate owned properties.     Certain     Servicing-related Issues       The Corporation and its legacy companies have securitized, and     continue to securitize, a significant portion of the residential     mortgage loans that we have originated or acquired. The     Corporation services a large portion of the loans it or its     subsidiaries have securitized and also services loans on behalf     of third-party securitization vehicles. In addition to     identifying specific servicing criteria, pooling and servicing     arrangements entered into in connection with a securitization or     whole loan sale typically impose standards of care on the     servicer, with respect to its activities, that may include the     obligation to adhere to the accepted servicing practices of     prudent mortgage lenders     and/or to     exercise the degree of care and skill that the servicer employs     when servicing loans for its own account. Many non-agency     residential mortgage-backed securitizations and whole loan     servicing agreements also require the servicer to indemnify the     trustee or other investor for or against failures by the     servicer to perform its servicing obligations or acts or     omissions that involve willful malfeasance, bad faith or gross     negligence in the performance of, or reckless disregard of, the     servicers duties.       Servicing agreements with the GSEs generally provide the GSEs     with broader rights relative to the servicer than are found in     servicing agreements with private investors. For example, each     GSE typically has the right to demand that the servicer     repurchase loans that breach the sellers representations     and warranties made in connection with the initial sale of the     loans even if the servicer was not the seller. The GSEs also     reserve the contractual right to demand indemnification or loan     repurchase for certain servicing breaches although we believe     that repurchase or indemnification demands solely for servicing     breaches are rare. In addition, our agreements with the GSEs and     their first mortgage seller/servicer guides provide for     timelines to resolve delinquent loans through workout efforts or     liquidation, if necessary. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we     recorded an expense of $230 million for compensatory fees     that we expect to be assessed by the GSEs as a result of     foreclosure delays.       With regard to alleged irregularities in foreclosure     process-related activities, a servicer may incur costs or losses     if the servicer elects or is required to re-execute or re-file     documents or take other action in its capacity as a servicer in     connection with pending or completed foreclosures. The servicer     also may incur costs or losses if the validity of a foreclosure     action is challenged by a borrower. If a court were to overturn     a foreclosure because of errors or deficiencies in the     foreclosure process, the servicer may have liability to a title     insurer of the property sold in foreclosure. These costs and     liabilities may not be reimbursable to the servicer. A servicer     may also incur costs or losses associated with private-label     securitizations or other loan investors relating to delays or     alleged deficiencies in processing documents necessary to comply     with state law governing foreclosures.       The servicer may be subject to deductions by insurers for     mortgage insurance or guarantee benefits relating to delays or     alleged deficiencies. Additionally, if the servicer commits a     material breach of its servicing obligations that is not cured     within specified timeframes, including those related to default     servicing and foreclosure, it could be terminated as servicer     under servicing agreements under certain circumstances. Any of     these actions may harm the servicers reputation, increase     its servicing costs or otherwise adversely affect its financial     condition and results of operations.           34     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents             Mortgage notes, assignments or other documents are often     required to be maintained and are often necessary to enforce     mortgage loans. We have processes in place to satisfy document     delivery and maintenance requirements in accordance with     securitization transaction standards. Additionally, there has     been significant public commentary regarding the common industry     practice of recording mortgages in the name of Mortgage     Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), as nominee on     behalf of the note holder, and whether securitization trusts own     the loans purported to be conveyed to them and have valid liens     securing those loans. We believe that the process for mortgage     loan transfers into securitization trusts is based on a     well-established body of law that establishes ownership of     mortgage loans by the securitization trusts and we believe that     we have substantially executed this process. We currently use     the MERS system for a substantial portion of the residential     mortgage loans that we originate, including loans that have been     sold to investors or securitization trusts. Although the GSEs do     not require the use of MERS, the GSEs permit standard forms of     mortgages and deeds of trust that use MERS and we believe that     loans that employ these forms are considered to be properly     documented for the GSEs purposes. We believe that the use     of MERS is a widespread practice in the industry. Certain legal     challenges have been made to the process for transferring     mortgage loans to securitization trusts asserting that having a     mortgagee of record that is different than the holder of the     mortgage note could break the chain of title and     cloud the ownership of the loan. Under the Uniform Commercial     Code, a securitization trust or other investor should have good     title to a mortgage loan if, among other means, either the note     is endorsed in blank or to the named transferee and delivered to     the holder or its designee, which may be a document custodian.     In order to foreclose on a mortgage loan, in certain cases it     may be necessary or prudent for an assignment of the mortgage to     be made to the holder of the note, which in the case of a     mortgage held in the name of MERS as nominee would need to be     completed by MERS. As such, our practice is to obtain     assignments of mortgages from MERS prior to instituting     foreclosure. If certain required documents are missing or     defective, or if the use of MERS is found not to be effective,     we could be obligated to cure             certain defects or in some circumstances otherwise be subject to     additional costs and expenses, which could have a material     adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and     financial condition.     Private-label     Residential Mortgage-backed Securities Matters       On October 18, 2010, Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, LP     (which changed its name to BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP), a     wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, received a letter,     in its capacity as servicer under certain pooling and servicing     agreements for 115 private-label residential MBS securitizations     (subsequently increased to 225 securitizations) from investors     purportedly owning interests in RMBS issued in the     securitizations. The letter asserted breaches of certain loan     servicing obligations, including an alleged failure to provide     notice to the trustee and other parties to the pooling and     servicing agreements of breaches of representations and     warranties with respect to mortgage loans included in the     securitization transactions. On November 4, 2010, the     servicer responded in writing to the letter, stating among other     things that the letter had identified no facts indicating that     the servicer had breached any of its obligations, and asking     that the signatories of the letter provide evidence that they     met the minimum voting interest requirements for investor action     contained in the relevant contracts. BAC Home Loans Servicing,     LP and Gibbs & Bruns LLP on behalf of certain     investors including those who signed the letter, as well as The     Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, have agreed to a short     extension of any time periods commenced by the letter to permit     the parties to explore dialogue around the issues raised. There     are a number of questions about the validity of the assertions     set forth in the letter, including whether these purported     investors have standing to bring these claims. The servicer     intends to challenge the assertions in the letter and to fully     enforce its rights under the relevant contracts.       For additional information about representations and warranties,     see Note 9  Representations and Warranties     Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated     Financial Statements, Representations and Warranties beginning     on page 52 and Item 1A. Risk Factors of this     Form 10-K.           Bank of America     2010     35     Table of Contents          Supplemental     Financial Data        We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses     (i.e., efficiency ratio and net interest yield) on a FTE basis.     Although these are non-GAAP measures, we believe managing the     business with net interest income on a FTE basis provides a more     accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative     purposes. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is     adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent     before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax     expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal     statutory tax rate of 35 percent. This measure ensures     comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and     tax-exempt sources.       As mentioned above, certain performance measures including the     efficiency ratio and net interest yield utilize net interest     income (and thus total revenue) on a FTE basis. The efficiency     ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of     revenue, and net interest yield evaluates how many basis points     we are earning over the cost of funds. During our annual     planning process, we set efficiency targets for the Corporation     and each line of business. We believe the use of these non-GAAP     measures provides additional clarity in assessing our results.     Targets vary by year and by business and are based on a variety     of factors including maturity of the business, competitive     environment, market factors and other items including our risk     appetite.       We also evaluate our business based on the following ratios that     utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP measure. Return on average     tangible common shareholders equity measures our earnings     contribution as a percentage of common shareholders equity     plus any Common Equivalent Securities (CES) less goodwill and     intangible assets, (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax     liabilities. ROTE measures our earnings contribution as a     percentage of           average shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible     assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax     liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents common     shareholders equity plus any CES less goodwill and     intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax     liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible     assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax     liabilities. The tangible equity ratio represents total     shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets     (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities     divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets     (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities.     Tangible book value per common share represents ending common     shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets     (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities     divided by ending common shares outstanding plus the number of     common shares issued upon conversion of common equivalent     shares. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity     (i.e., capital). In addition, profitability, relationship and     investment models all use ROTE as key measures to support our     overall growth goals.       The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures     are presented in Tables 6 and 7 and Statistical Tables XII and     XIV. In addition, in Table 7 and Statistical Table XIV, we have     excluded the impact of goodwill impairment charges of     $12.4 billion recorded in 2010 when presenting earnings and     diluted earnings per common share, the efficiency ratio, return     on average assets, return on average common shareholders     equity, return on average tangible common shareholders     equity and ROTE. Accordingly, these are non-GAAP measures.     Statistical Tables XIII and XV provide reconciliations of these     non-GAAP measures with financial measures defined by GAAP. We     believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional     clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation. Other     companies may define or calculate these measures and ratios     differently.

(2)   Performance ratios are calculated     excluding the impact of goodwill impairment charges of     $12.4 billion recorded during 2010.              36     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents         Core Net Interest     Income       We manage core net interest income which is reported net     interest income on a FTE basis adjusted for the impact of     market-based activities. As discussed in the GBAM     business segment section beginning on page 45, we     evaluate our market-based results and strategies on a total     market-based revenue approach by combining net interest income     and noninterest income for GBAM. In addition, 2009 is     presented on a managed basis which is adjusted for loans that we     originated and subsequently sold into credit card     securitizations. Noninterest income, rather than net interest     income and provision for credit           losses, was recorded for securitized assets as we are     compensated for servicing the securitized assets and we recorded     servicing income and gains or losses on securitizations, where     appropriate. 2010 is presented in accordance with new     consolidation guidance. An analysis of core net interest income,     core average earning assets and core net interest yield on     earning assets, all of which adjust for the impact of these two     non-core items from reported net interest income on a FTE basis,     is shown below. We believe the use of this non-GAAP presentation     provides additional clarity in assessing our results.

The decrease was     driven by lower loan levels compared to managed loan levels in     2009, and lower yields for the discretionary and credit card     portfolios. These impacts were partially offset by lower rates     on deposits.       Core average earning assets decreased $39.2 billion to $1.4     trillion for 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was primarily     due to lower           commercial loan levels and lower consumer loan levels compared     to managed consumer loan levels in 2009. The impact was     partially offset by increased securities levels in 2010.       Core net interest yield decreased 23 bps to     3.46 percent for 2010 compared to 2009 due to the factors     noted above.               Bank of America     2010     37     Table of Contents          Business     Segment Operations      Segment     Description and Basis of Presentation       We report the results of our operations through six business     segments: Deposits, Global Card Services, Home     Loans & Insurance, Global Commercial Banking, GBAM     and GWIM, with the remaining operations recorded in     All Other. Effective January 1, 2010, we realigned     the Global Corporate and Investment Banking portion of the     former Global Banking segment with the former Global     Markets business segment to form GBAM and to     reflect Global Commercial Banking as a standalone     segment. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform     to current period presentation.       We prepare and evaluate segment results using certain non-GAAP     methodologies and performance measures, many of which are     discussed in Supplemental Financial Data beginning on     page 36. In addition, return on average tangible     shareholders equity for the segments is calculated as net     income, excluding goodwill impairment charges, divided by     average allocated equity less goodwill and a percentage of     intangible assets (excluding MSRs). We begin by evaluating the     operating results of the segments which by definition exclude     merger and restructuring charges.       The management accounting and reporting process derives segment     and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for     revenue and expense. The net income derived for the businesses     is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an     activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other     methodologies and assumptions management believes are     appropriate to reflect the results of the business.       Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest     income on a FTE basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of     net interest income to a FTE basis results in a corresponding     increase in income tax expense. The segment results also reflect     certain revenue and expense methodologies that are utilized to     determine net income. For presentation purposes, in segments     where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which     are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets to     match liabilities. The net interest income of the businesses     includes the results of a funds transfer pricing             process that matches assets and liabilities with similar     interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. Net     interest income of the business segments also includes an     allocation of net interest income generated by our ALM     activities.       Our ALM activities include an overall interest rate risk     management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate     contracts to manage fluctuations in earnings that are caused by     interest rate volatility. Our goal is to manage interest rate     sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not     significantly adversely affect net interest income. Our ALM     activities are allocated to the business segments and fluctuate     based on performance. ALM activities include external product     pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the     effects of our internal funds transfer pricing process and the     net effects of other ALM activities.       Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific     business segment are allocated to the segments. The most     significant of these expenses include data and item processing     costs and certain centralized or shared functions. Data     processing costs are allocated to the segments based on     equipment usage. Item processing costs are allocated to the     segments based on the volume of items processed for each     segment. The costs of certain centralized or shared functions     are allocated based on methodologies that reflect utilization.       Equity is allocated to business segments and related businesses     using a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each     segments credit, market, interest rate, strategic and     operational risk components. The nature of these risks is     discussed further beginning on page 59. We benefit from the     diversification of risk across these components which is     reflected as a reduction to allocated equity for each segment.     The total amount of average equity reflects both risk-based     capital and the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically     assigned to the business segments.

In addition,     Deposits includes an allocation of ALM activities. In the     U.S., we serve approximately 57 million consumer and small     business relationships through a franchise that stretches coast     to coast through 32 states and the District of Columbia     utilizing our network of approximately 5,900 banking centers,     18,000 ATMs, nationwide call centers and leading online and     mobile banking platforms.       At December 31, 2010, our active online banking customer     base was 29.3 million subscribers compared to     29.6 million at December 31, 2009, and our active bill     pay users paid $304.3 billion of bills online during 2010     compared to $302.4 billion in 2009.       Our deposit products include traditional savings accounts, money     market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, and noninterest-and     interest-bearing checking accounts. Deposit products provide a     relatively stable source of funding and liquidity. We earn net     interest spread revenue from investing this liquidity in earning     assets through client-facing lending and ALM activities. The     revenue is allocated to the deposit products using our funds     transfer pricing process which takes into account the interest     rates and maturity characteristics of the deposits. Deposits     also generates fees such as account service fees,     non-sufficient funds fees, overdraft charges and ATM fees.   Deposits includes the net impact of migrating customers     and their related deposit balances between GWIM and     Deposits. For more information on the migration of     customer balances, see GWIM beginning on page 48.       Regulation E became effective July 1, 2010 for new     customers and August 16, 2010 for existing customers. These     rules partially impacted the third quarter of 2010 and fully     impacted the fourth quarter of 2010. In late 2009, we     implemented changes in our overdraft policies which negatively           impacted revenue. These changes were intended to help customers     limit overdraft fees. For more information on Regulation E,     see Regulatory Matters beginning on page 56.       Net income fell $1.2 billion, or 48 percent, to     $1.4 billion due to lower revenue and higher noninterest     expense. Net interest income increased $1.0 billion, or     15 percent, to $8.1 billion as a result of a customer     shift to more liquid products and continued pricing discipline,     partially offset by a lower net interest income allocation     related to ALM activities. Average deposits increased     $4.2 billion from a year ago due to the transfer of certain     deposits from other client managed businesses and organic     growth, partially offset by the expected run-off of higher-cost     legacy Countrywide deposits.       Noninterest income fell $1.7 billion, or 26 percent,     to $5.1 billion, primarily driven by the decline in service     charges due to the implementation of Regulation E and the     impact of our overdraft policy changes. The impact of     Regulation E, which was in effect beginning in the third     quarter and fully in effect in the fourth quarter of 2010, and     overdraft policy changes, which were in effect for the full year     of 2010, was a reduction in service charges during 2010 of     approximately $1.7 billion. In 2011, the incremental     reduction to service charges related to Regulation E and     overdraft policy changes is expected to be approximately $1.1     billion, or a full-year impact of approximately     $2.8 billion, net of identified mitigation actions.       Noninterest expense increased $1.3 billion, or     14 percent, to $10.8 billion as a result of a higher     proportion of costs associated with banking center sales and     service efforts being aligned to Deposits from the other     consumer segments and increased litigation expenses in 2010.     Noninterest expense includes FDIC charges of $896 million     compared to $1.2 billion during 2009 which included a     special FDIC assessment.

We provide credit card products to     customers in the U.S., Canada, Ireland, Spain and the U.K. We     offer a variety of co-branded and affinity credit and debit card     products and are one of the leading issuers of credit cards     through endorsed marketing in the U.S. and Europe.       On February 22, 2010, the majority of the provisions of the     CARD Act became effective and negatively impacted net interest     income during 2010 due to restrictions on our ability to reprice     credit cards based on risk and on card income due to     restrictions imposed on certain fees. The 2010 full-year impact     on revenue was approximately $1.5 billion. For more     information on the CARD Act, see Regulatory Matters beginning on     page 56.       The Corporation reports its Global Card Services results     in accordance with new consolidation guidance. Under this new     consolidation guidance, we consolidated all credit card trusts     on January 1, 2010. Accordingly, current year results are     comparable to prior year results that are presented on a managed     basis.

As a result of the Financial Reform Act, which was signed into     law on July 21, 2010, we believe that our debit card     revenue in Global Card Services will be adversely     impacted beginning in the third quarter of 2011. Based on 2010     volumes, our estimate of revenue loss due to the debit card     interchange fee standards to be adopted under the Financial     Reform Act was approximately $2.0 billion annually. This     estimate resulted in a $10.4 billion goodwill impairment     charge for Global Card Services. Depending on the final     rulemaking under the Durbin Amendment, additional goodwill     impairment may occur in Global Card Services. For     additional information, refer to Regulatory           Matters  Debit Interchange Fees on page 57 and     Complex Accounting Estimates beginning on page 107.   Global Card Services recorded a net loss of     $6.6 billion primarily due to the $10.4 billion     goodwill impairment charge in 2010. Excluding this charge,     Global Card Services would have reported net income of     $3.8 billion compared to a net loss of $5.3 billion in     the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in provision for     credit losses. Revenue decreased $3.4 billion, or     12 percent, to $25.6 billion, driven by lower average     loans, reduced interest and fee income primarily resulting from     the implementation of the CARD Act and the impact of recording     an incremental reserve of $592 million for future payment     protection insurance claims in the U.K. that have not yet been     asserted. For more information on payment protection insurance,     refer to Note 14  Commitments and     Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Net interest income decreased $2.2 billion, or     11 percent, to $17.8 billion as average loans     decreased $35.7 billion partially offset by lower funding     costs. The decline in average loans was due to the elevated     level of net charge-offs and risk mitigation strategies that     were implemented throughout the recent economic cycle.       Noninterest income decreased $1.3 billion, or     14 percent, to $7.8 billion driven by lower card     income primarily due to the implementation of the CARD Act and     the impact of recording a reserve related to future payment     protection insurance claims. The decrease was partially offset     by higher interchange income during 2010 and the gain on the     sale of our MasterCard equity holdings.       Provision for credit losses improved $16.9 billion due to     lower delinquencies and bankruptcies as a result of the improved     economic environment. This resulted in reserve reductions of     $7.0 billion in 2010 compared to reserve increases of     $3.4 billion in 2009. The prior year included a reserve     addition due to maturing securitizations which had an     unfavorable impact on the 2009 provision expense. In addition,     net charge-offs declined $6.5 billion in 2010 compared to     2009.       Excluding the goodwill impairment charge of $10.4 billion,     noninterest expense decreased $773 million primarily driven     by a higher proportion of costs associated with banking center     sales and service efforts being aligned to Deposits from     Global Card Services.               40     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents       Home     Loans & Insurance                                                       (Dollars in millions)            2010               2009               % Change               Net interest     income (1)        $   4,690               $       4,975                   (6       )%          Noninterest income:                                                           Mortgage banking income            3,079                   9,321                   (67       )          Insurance income            2,257                   2,346                   (4       )          All other income            621                   261                   138                                                                    Total noninterest income            5,957                   11,928                   (50       )                                                                Total revenue, net of interest expense            10,647                   16,903                   (37       )                                                                Provision for credit losses            8,490                   11,244                   (24       )          Goodwill impairment            2,000                                      n/m              All other noninterest expense            13,163                   11,705                   12                                                                    Loss before income taxes            (13,006   )               (6,046       )               (115       )          Income tax     benefit (1)            (4,085   )               (2,195       )               (86       )                                                            Net loss        $   (8,921   )           $       (3,851       )               (132       )                                                                                                                      Net interest     yield (1)            2.52   %               2.58       %                          Efficiency     ratio (1)            142.42                   69.25                              Efficiency ratio, excluding goodwill impairment     charge (1)            123.63                   69.25                                                                               Balance Sheet                                                                                                             Average                                                           Total loans and leases        $   129,236               $       130,519                   (1       )%          Total earning assets            186,455                   193,152                   (3       )          Total assets            226,352                   230,123                   (2       )          Allocated equity            26,170                   20,530                   27                                                                Year end                                                           Total loans and leases        $   122,935               $       131,302                   (6       )%          Total earning assets            173,033                   188,349                   (8       )          Total assets            213,455                   232,588                   (8       )          Allocated equity            23,542                   27,148                   (13       )                                                                    (1)   FTE basis             n/m = not meaningful        Home Loans & Insurance generates revenue by     providing an extensive line of consumer real estate products and     services to customers nationwide. Home Loans &     Insurance products are available to our customers through a     retail network of 5,900 banking centers, mortgage loan officers     in approximately 750 locations and a sales force offering our     customers direct telephone and online access to our products.     These products are also offered through our correspondent loan     acquisition channels. On February 4, 2011, we announced     that we are exiting the reverse mortgage origination business.     In October 2010, we exited the first mortgage wholesale     acquisition channel. These strategic changes were made to allow     greater focus on our retail and correspondent channels.   Home Loans & Insurance products include fixed     and adjustable-rate first-lien mortgage loans for home purchase     and refinancing needs, reverse mortgages, home equity lines of     credit and home equity loans. First mortgage products are either     sold into the secondary mortgage market to investors, while     retaining MSRs and the Bank of America customer relationships,     or are held on our balance sheet in All Other for ALM     purposes. Home Loans & Insurance is not     impacted by the Corporations first mortgage production     retention decisions as Home Loans & Insurance     is compensated for the decision on a management accounting     basis with a corresponding offset recorded in All Other.     Funded home equity lines of credit and home equity loans are     held on the Home Loans & Insurance balance     sheet. In addition, Home Loans & Insurance     offers property, casualty, life, disability and credit     insurance.       On February 3, 2011, we announced that we had entered into     an agreement to sell the lender-placed and voluntary property     and casualty insurance assets and liabilities of Balboa     Insurance Company (Balboa) and affiliated             entities for an upfront cash payment of approximately     $700 million, subject to certain closing and other     adjustments, as well as additional future payments. Balboa is a     wholly-owned subsidiary and part of Home Loans &     Insurance.   Home Loans & Insurance includes the impact of     transferring customers and their related loan balances between     GWIM and Home Loans & Insurance based on     client segmentation thresholds. For more information on the     migration of customer balances, see GWIM beginning on     page 48.   Home Loans & Insurance recorded a net loss of     $8.9 billion compared to a net loss of $3.9 billion in     2009 primarily due to an increase of $4.9 billion in     representations and warranties provision and the     $2.0 billion goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2010,     partially offset by a decline in provision for credit losses of     $2.8 billion. For additional information on representations     and warranties, see Note 9  Representations     and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the     Consolidated Financial Statements and Representations and     Warranties on page 52.       Provision for credit losses decreased $2.8 billion to     $8.5 billion driven by improving portfolio trends which led     to lower reserve additions, including those associated with the     Countrywide PCI home equity portfolio.       Noninterest expense increased $3.5 billion primarily due to     the goodwill impairment charge, higher litigation expense and     default-related and other loss mitigation expenses, partially     offset by lower production expense and insurance losses.       See Complex Accounting Estimates  Goodwill and     Intangible Assets beginning on page 110 and     Note 10  Goodwill and Intangible Assets     to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of     the goodwill impairment charge for Home Loans &     Insurance.           Bank of America     2010     41     Table of Contents       Mortgage Banking     Income   Home Loans & Insurance mortgage banking income     is categorized into production and servicing income. Production     income is comprised of revenue from the fair value gains and     losses recognized on our interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs)     and loans     held-for-sale     (LHFS), the related secondary market execution, and costs     related to representations and warranties in the sales     transactions along with other obligations incurred in the sales     of mortgage loans. In addition, production income includes     revenue, which is eliminated in All Other, for transfers     of mortgage loans from Home Loans & Insurance     to the ALM portfolio related to the Corporations     mortgage production retention decisions.       Servicing income includes income earned in connection with     servicing activities and MSR valuation adjustments, net of     economic hedge activities. The costs associated with our     servicing activities are included in noninterest expense.       Servicing activities include collecting cash for principal,     interest and escrow payments from borrowers, disbursing customer     draws for lines of credit and accounting for and remitting     principal and interest payments to investors and escrow payments     to third parties. Our home retention efforts are also part of     our servicing activities, along with responding to customer     inquiries and supervising foreclosures and property     dispositions. In an effort to avoid foreclosure, Bank of America     evaluates various workout options prior to foreclosure sale     which has resulted in elongated default timelines. Our servicing     agreements with certain loan investors require us to comply with     usual and customary standards in the liquidation of delinquent     mortgage loans. Our agreements with the GSEs provide timelines     to complete the liquidation of delinquent loans. In instances     where we fail to meet these timelines, our agreements provide     the GSEs with the option to assess compensatory fees. In 2010,     the Corporation recorded an expense of approximately     $230 million for estimated compensatory fees that it     expects to be assessed by the GSEs as a result of foreclosure     delays. Additionally, we may face demands and claims from     private-label securitization investors concerning alleged     breaches of customary servicing standards. For additional     information on our servicing activities, see Recent     Events  Certain Servicing-related Issues beginning on     page 34.       On October 18, 2010, Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, LP     (which changed its name to BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP), a     wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, received a letter,     in its capacity as servicer under certain pooling and servicing     agreements for 115 private-label residential MBS securitizations     (subsequently increased to 225 securitizations). The letter     asserted breaches of certain servicing obligations.

(2)   Includes sale of MSRs.         (3)   Includes the effect of transfers of     mortgage loans from Home Loans & Insurance to     the ALM portfolio in All Other.               The production loss of $688 million represented a decrease     of $6.2 billion as representations and warranties provision     increased $4.9 billion to $6.8 billion which includes     provision of $3.0 billion related to the GSE agreements as     well as adjustments to the representations and warranties     liability for other loans sold directly to the GSEs and not     covered by those agreements. Also contributing to the     representations and warranties provision for the year was our     continued evaluation of non-GSE exposure to repurchases and     similar claims, which led to the determination that we have     developed sufficient repurchase experience with certain non-GSE     counterparties to record a liability related to existing and     future projected claims from such counterparties. For additional     information on representations and warranties, see     Note 9  Representations and Warranties     Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated     Financial Statements, Recent Events  Representations     and Warranties Liability on page 33 and Representations and     Warranties beginning on page 52. In addition, core     production revenue, which excludes representations and     warranties provision, declined $1.3 billion due to a     decline in volume driven by a drop in the overall size of the     mortgage market and a decline in market share.       Net servicing income remained relatively flat as lower MSR     results, net of hedges, were offset by a lower impact of     customer payments and higher fee income.

(2)   Servicing of residential mortgage     loans, home equity lines of credit, home equity loans and     discontinued real estate mortgage loans.                   First mortgage production in Home Loans & Insurance     was $287.2 billion in 2010 compared to     $354.5 billion in 2009. The decrease of $67.3 billion     was primarily due to a drop in the overall size of the mortgage     market driven by weaker market demand for both refinance and     purchase transactions combined with a decrease in market share.     Home equity production was $7.6 billion in 2010 compared to     $10.5 billion in 2009. The decrease of $2.9 billion     was primarily due to more stringent underwriting guidelines for     home equity lines of credit and loans as well as lower consumer     demand.       At December 31, 2010, the consumer MSR balance was     $14.9 billion, which represented 92 bps of the related     unpaid principal balance compared to $19.5 billion, or     113 bps of the related unpaid principal balance at     December 31, 2009. The decrease in the consumer MSR balance     was driven by the impact of declining mortgage rates partially     offset by the addition of new MSRs recorded in connection with     sales of loans. In addition, elevated servicing costs, due to     higher personnel expenses associated with default-related     servicing activities, reduced expected cash flows. These factors     together resulted in the 21 bps decrease in capitalized     MSRs as a percentage of loans serviced.

Our clients include business banking     and middle-market companies, commercial real estate firms and     governments, and are generally defined as companies with annual     sales up to $2 billion. Our lending products and services     include commercial loans and commitment facilities, real estate     lending, asset-based lending and indirect consumer loans. Our     capital management and treasury solutions include treasury     management, foreign exchange and short-term investing options.   Global Commercial Banking recorded 2010 net income     of $3.2 billion compared to a 2009 net loss of     $290 million, with the improvement driven by lower credit     costs.       Net interest income remained relatively flat as growth in     average deposits from our existing clients of     $18.7 billion, or 14 percent, was offset by a lower     net interest income allocation related to ALM activities. In     addition, net interest income benefited from credit pricing     discipline, which negated the impact of the $25.8 billion,     or 11 percent, decline in average loan balances.       Noninterest income decreased $270 million, or nine percent,     largely due to additional costs related to our agreement to     purchase certain retail automotive loans. For further     information, see Note 14  Commitments     and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       The provision for credit losses decreased $5.8 billion to     $2.0 billion for 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was     driven by improvements primarily in the commercial real estate     portfolios reflecting stabilizing values and in the           U.S. commercial portfolio resulting from improved borrower     credit profiles. Additionally, all other portfolios experienced     lower net charge-offs attributable to more stable economic     conditions.     Global Commercial     Banking Revenue   Global Commercial Banking revenues can also be     categorized as treasury services revenue primarily from capital     and treasury management, and business lending revenue derived     from credit related products and services. Treasury services     revenue for 2010 was $4.3 billion, an increase of     $62 million compared to 2009. Revenue growth was driven by     net interest income from increased deposits, partially offset by     lower treasury service charges. As clients manage through     current economic conditions, we have seen usage of certain     treasury services decline and increased conversion of paper to     electronic services. These actions combined with our clients     leveraging compensating balances to offset fees have decreased     treasury service charges. Business lending revenue for 2010 was     $6.6 billion, a decrease of $299 million compared to     2009, largely due to additional costs related to our agreement     to purchase certain retail automotive loans. Despite client     deleveraging in the first half of 2010 and continued low loan     demand, commercial and industrial loan balances began to     stabilize and show moderate growth during the latter part of     2010. Commercial real estate loan balances declined due to     continued client deleveraging and our management of     nonperforming loans. Credit pricing discipline negated the     impact of the decline in average loan balances on net interest     income.               44     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents       Global     Banking & Markets                                                       (Dollars in millions)            2010               2009               % Change               Net interest     income (1)        $   7,989               $       9,553                   (16       )%          Noninterest income:                                                           Service charges            2,126                   2,044                   4              Investment and brokerage services            2,441                   2,662                   (8       )          Investment banking income            5,408                   5,927                   (9       )          Trading account profits            9,689                   11,803                   (18       )          All other income            845                   634                   33                                                                    Total noninterest income            20,509                   23,070                   (11       )                                                                Total revenue, net of interest expense            28,498                   32,623                   (13       )                                                                Provision for credit losses            (155   )               1,998                   (108       )          Noninterest expense            18,038                   15,921                   13                                                                    Income before income taxes            10,615                   14,704                   (28       )          Income tax     expense (1)            4,296                   4,646                   (8       )                                                            Net income        $   6,319               $       10,058                   (37       )                                                                                                                      Return on average equity            12.01   %               20.32       %                          Return on average tangible shareholders equity            15.05                   25.82                              Efficiency     ratio (1)            63.30                   48.80                                                                                Balance Sheet                                                                                                              Average                                                           Total trading-related assets        $   499,433               $       508,163                   (2       )%          Total loans and leases            98,604                   110,811                   (11       )          Total market-based earning assets            504,360                   481,376                   5              Total earning assets            598,613                   588,252                   2              Total assets            758,958                   778,870                   (3       )          Total deposits            109,792                   104,868                   5              Allocated equity            52,604                   49,502                   6                                                                Year end                                                           Total trading-related assets        $   413,563               $       410,755                   1       %          Total loans and leases            100,010                   95,930                   4              Total market-based earning assets            416,174                   404,315                   3              Total earning assets            509,269                   498,765                   2              Total assets            655,535                   649,876                   1              Total deposits            111,447                   102,093                   9              Allocated equity            49,054                   53,260                   (8       )                                                                    (1)   FTE basis              GBAM provides financial products, advisory services,     financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services     globally to our institutional investor clients in support of     their investing and trading activities. We also work with our     commercial and corporate clients to provide debt and equity     underwriting and distribution capabilities, merger-related and     other advisory services, and risk management products using     interest rate, equity, credit, currency and commodity     derivatives, foreign exchange, fixed-income and mortgage-related     products. As a result of our market-making activities in these     products, we may be required to manage positions in government     securities, equity and equity-linked securities, high-grade and     high-yield corporate debt securities, commercial paper, MBS and     asset-backed securities (ABS). Underwriting debt and equity     issuances, securities research and certain market-based     activities are executed through our global broker/dealer     affiliates which are our primary dealers in several countries.     GBAM is a leader in the global distribution of     fixed-income, currency and energy commodity products and     derivatives. GBAM also has one of the largest equity     trading operations in the world and is a leader in the     origination and distribution of equity and equity-related     products. Our corporate banking services provide a wide range of     lending-related products and services, integrated working     capital management and treasury solutions to clients through our     network of offices and client relationship teams along with     various product partners. Our corporate clients are generally     defined as companies with annual sales greater than     $2 billion.       GBAM also includes the results of our merchant processing     joint venture, Banc of America Merchant Services, LLC.       In 2009, we entered into a joint venture agreement with First     Data Corporation (First Data) to form Banc of America     Merchant Services, LLC. The joint venture provides payment     solutions, including credit, debit and prepaid cards, and check     and     e-commerce     payments to merchants ranging from small businesses to corporate     and commercial clients worldwide. In addition to Bank of America     and First Data, the remaining stake was initially held by a     third party. During 2010, the third party sold its interest to     the joint venture, thus increasing the Corporations     ownership interest in the joint venture to 49 percent. For     additional information on the joint venture agreement, see     Note 5  Securities to the Consolidated     Financial Statements.       Net income decreased $3.7 billion to $6.3 billion due     to a $4.1 billion decline in revenues and an increase in     noninterest expenses of $2.1 billion. This was partially     offset by lower provision expense reflecting improvement in     borrower credit profiles. Additionally, income tax expense was     negatively affected from a change in the U.K. corporate income     tax rate that impacted the carrying value of the deferred tax     asset by approximately $390 million.       Net interest income decreased $1.6 billion to     $8.0 billion due to tighter spreads on trading related     assets and lower average loan and lease balances, partially     offset by higher earned spreads on deposits. The     $12.2 billion, or 11 percent, decline in average loans     and leases was driven by reduced client demand. Net interest     income is comprised of both markets-based revenue              Bank of America     2010     45     Table of Contents           from our trading activities and banking-based revenue which is     related to our credit and treasury service products.       Noninterest income decreased $2.6 billion due in part to     the prior year gain of $3.8 billion related to the     contribution of the merchant processing business to the joint     venture. While overall sales and trading revenue were flat     year-over-year,     the market in 2009 was more favorable but results were muted by     losses on legacy positions. Noninterest expense increased     $2.1 billion driven mainly by higher compensation costs     from investments in infrastructure, professional fees and     litigations expense.     Components of     Global Banking & Markets     Sales and Trading     Revenue       Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed-income     including investment and non-investment grade corporate debt     obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), RMBS     and CDOs; currencies including interest rate and foreign     exchange contracts; commodities including primarily futures,     forwards, swaps and options; and equity income from     equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity.

(2)   Includes $2.4 billion and     $2.6 billion of investment and brokerage services revenue     for 2010 and 2009.               Sales and trading revenue decreased $322 million, or two     percent, to $17.3 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 due to     increased investor risk aversion and more favorable market     conditions in the prior year. We recorded net credit spread     gains on derivative liabilities during 2010 of $242 million     compared to losses of $801 million in 2009.       FICC revenue increased $435 million to $13.2 billion     due to significantly lower market disruption charges, partially     offset by lower revenue in our rates and currencies, commodities     and credit products due to diminished client activity and     European debt deterioration. Gains on legacy assets, primarily     in trading account profits (losses) and other income (loss),     were $321 million for 2010 compared to write-downs of     $3.8 billion in 2009. Legacy losses in the prior year were     primarily driven by our CMBS, CDO and leveraged finance exposure.       Equity income was $4.1 billion in 2010 compared to     $4.9 billion in 2009 driven by a decline in client flows     and market conditions in the derivatives business.

(2)   Represents the offset to fees paid     on the Corporations transactions.               Equity issuance fees decreased $465 million in 2010     primarily reflecting lower levels of industry-wide activity and     a decline in market-based revenue pools. Debt issuance fees     increased $143 million consistent with a five percent     increase in global fee pools in 2010. Strong performance within     debt issuance was mainly driven by higher revenues within     leveraged finance. Advisory fees decreased $148 million     during 2010.     Global Corporate     Banking       Client relationship teams along with product partners work with     our customers to provide them with a wide range of     lending-related products and services, integrated working     capital management and treasury solutions through the     Corporations global network of offices. Global Corporate     Banking lending revenues of $3.4 billion for 2010 increased     $567 million compared to 2009. The increase in 2010 is     primarily due to higher fees and the negative impact of hedge     results in 2009. Treasury services revenue of $2.8 billion     for 2010 decreased $3.9 billion primarily due to a     $3.8 billion pre-tax gain in the prior year related to the     contribution of the merchant processing business to a joint     venture. Equity investment income from the joint venture was     $133 million for 2010. During 2010, we sold our trust     administration business and in connection with the sale provided     certain commitments to the acquirer. See     Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies     to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional     information.           46     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents         Collateralized     Debt Obligation Exposure       CDO vehicles hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities     and issue multiple tranches of debt securities including     commercial paper, mezzanine and equity securities. Our     CDO-related exposure can be divided into funded and unfunded     super senior liquidity commitment exposure, other super senior     exposure (i.e., cash positions and derivative contracts),     warehouse, and sales and trading positions. For more information     on our CDO positions, see Note 8      Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the     Consolidated Financial Statements. Super senior exposure     represents the most senior class of commercial paper or notes     that are issued by the CDO vehicles. These financial instruments     benefit from the subordination of all other securities issued by     the CDO vehicles.             In 2010, we incurred $573 million of losses resulting from     our CDO-related exposure compared to $2.2 billion in     CDO-related losses in 2009. This included $357 million in     2010 related to counterparty risk on our CDO-related exposure     compared to $910 million in 2009. Also included in these     losses were     other-than-temporary     impairment (OTTI) write-downs of $251 million in 2010     compared to losses of $1.2 billion in 2009 related to CDOs     and retained positions classified as AFS debt securities.       As presented in the table below, at December 31, 2010, our     hedged and unhedged super senior CDO exposure before     consideration of insurance, net of write-downs, was     $2.0 billion compared to $3.6 billion at     December 31, 2009.

(3)   Hedged amounts are presented at     carrying value before consideration of the insurance.                    We value our CDO structures using market-standard models to     model the specific collateral composition and cash flow     structure of each deal. Key inputs to the models are prepayment     rates, default rates and severities for each collateral type,     and other relevant contractual features. Unrealized losses     recorded in accumulated OCI on super senior cash positions and     retained positions from liquidated CDOs in aggregate decreased     $382 million during 2010 to $466 million at     December 31, 2010.       At December 31, 2010, total super senior exposure of     $2.0 billion was marked at 18 percent, including     $156 million of retained positions from           liquidated CDOs marked at 42 percent, $527 million of     non-subprime exposure marked at 39 percent and the     remaining $1.3 billion of subprime exposure marked at     14 percent of the original exposure amounts.       The table below presents our original total notional,     mark-to-market     receivable and credit valuation adjustment for credit default     swaps and other positions with monolines. The receivable for     super senior CDOs reflects hedge gains recorded from inception     of the contracts in connection with write-downs on the super     senior CDOs in the table above.

This decrease was     driven by positive valuation adjustments on legacy assets and     terminated monoline contracts.     Other CDO     Exposure       With the Merrill Lynch acquisition, we acquired a loan with a     carrying value of $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2010     that is collateralized by U.S. super senior ABS CDOs.     Merrill Lynch originally provided financing to the borrower           for an amount equal to approximately 75 percent of the fair     value of the collateral. The loan, which is recorded in All     Other, has full recourse to the borrower and all scheduled     payments on the loan have been received. Events of default under     the loan are customary events of default, including failure to     pay interest when due and failure to pay principal at maturity.     Collateral for the loan is excluded from our CDO exposure     discussions and the applicable tables.

GWIM results also include the BofA Global Capital     Management (BACM) business, which is comprised primarily of the     cash and liquidity asset management business that Bank of     America retained following the sale of the Columbia Management     long-term asset management business on May 1, 2010. The     historical results of Columbia Managements long-term asset     management business were transferred to All Other along     with the Corporations economic ownership interest in     BlackRock.       Revenue from MLGWM was $13.1 billion, up four     percent in 2010 compared to 2009. Revenue from     U.S. Trust was $2.7 billion, up five percent in     2010 compared to 2009.

The directional     shift of total deposits migrated was mainly due to client     segmentation threshold changes. Subsequent to the date of     migration, the associated net interest income, noninterest     income and noninterest expense are recorded in the business to     which the clients migrated.

Net interest income decreased $157 million,     or three percent, to $5.8 billion as the positive impact of     higher deposit levels was more than offset by lower revenue from     corporate ALM activity. Noninterest income increased     $691 million, or seven percent, to $10.8 billion     primarily due to higher asset management fees driven by stronger     markets, continued long-term assets under management flows and     higher transactional activity. Provision for credit losses     decreased $415 million, or 39 percent, to     $646 million driven by stabilization of the portfolios and     the recognition of a single large           commercial charge-off in 2009. Noninterest expense increased     $1.2 billion, or 10 percent, to $13.6 billion driven     by increases in revenue-related expenses, higher support costs     and personnel costs associated with further investment in the     business.

The decrease in client balances was due to the sale of the     Columbia Management long-term asset management business,     outflows in MLGWMs non-fee based brokerage assets     and outflows in BACMs money market assets due to the     continued low rate environment, partially offset by higher     market levels and inflows in client deposits, long-term assets     under management (AUM) and fee-based brokerage assets.

For more information on All Other,     including the securitization offset, see     Note 26  Business Segment Information to     the Consolidated Financial Statements.         (3)   Includes elimination of     segments excess asset allocations to match liabilities     (i.e., deposits) of $621.3 billion and $537.1 billion     for 2010 and 2009, and $645.8 billion and     $586.0 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009.                  The 2009 presentation above of All Other excludes the     securitization offset to make it comparable with the 2010     presentation. In 2009, Global Card Services was presented     on a managed basis with the difference between managed and held     reported as the securitization offset. With the adoption of new     consolidation guidance on January 1, 2010, we consolidated     all credit card securitizations that were previously     unconsolidated, such that All Other no longer includes     the securitization offset. For additional information on the     securitization offset included in All Other, see     Note 26  Business Segment Information to     the Consolidated Financial Statements.   All Other, as presented above, consists of two broad     groupings, Equity Investments and     Other.  Equity Investments includes     Corporate Investments, Global Principal Investments and     Strategic Investments. Other can be segregated into the     following categories: liquidating businesses, merger and     restructuring charges, ALM functions (i.e., residential mortgage     portfolio and investment securities) and related activities     (i.e., economic hedges, fair value option on structured     liabilities), and the impact of certain allocation     methodologies. For additional information on the other     activities included in All Other, see     Note 26  Business Segment Information to     the Consolidated Financial Statements.             The tables below present the components of All Others     equity investments at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and     also a reconciliation of All Others equity     investment income to the total consolidated equity investment     income for 2010 and 2009.

Global Principal Investments (GPI) is comprised of a diversified     portfolio of investments in private equity, real estate and     other alternative investments. These investments are made either     directly in a company or held through a fund with related income     recorded in equity investment income. GPI had unfunded equity     commitments of $1.4 billion and $2.5 billion at     December 31, 2010 and 2009, related to certain of these     investments. During 2010, we sold our exposure of     $2.9 billion in certain private equity funds, comprised of     $1.5 billion in funded exposure and $1.4 billion in     unfunded commitments in these funds as we continue to reduce our     equity exposure.       Affiliates of the Corporation may, from time to time, act as     general partner, fund manager     and/or     investment advisor to certain Corporation-sponsored real estate     private equity funds. In this capacity, these affiliates manage     and/or     provide investment advisory services to such real estate private     equity funds primarily for the benefit of third-party     institutional and private clients. These activities, which are     recorded in GPI, inherently involve risk to us and to the fund     investors, and in certain situations may result in losses. In     2010, we recorded a loss of $163 million related to a     consolidated real estate private equity fund for which we were     the general partner and investment advisor. In late 2010, the     general partner and investment advisor responsibilities were     transferred to an independent third-party asset manager.       Strategic Investments includes primarily our investment in CCB     of $19.7 billion as well as our $2.6 billion remaining     investment in BlackRock. At December 31, 2010, we owned     approximately 10 percent, or 25.6 billion common     shares of CCB. During 2010, we sold certain rights related to     our investment in CCB resulting in a gain of $432 million.     Also during 2010, we sold our Itaú Unibanco and Santander     equity investments resulting in a net gain of approximately     $800 million and a portion of our interest in BlackRock     resulting in a gain of $91 million.   All Other reported net income of $1.1 billion in     2010 compared to $1.3 billion in 2009 with the decline due     to decreases in net interest income and noninterest income     compared to the prior year. The decrease in net interest income     was driven by a $1.4 billion lower funding differential on     certain securitizations and the impact of capital raises     occurring throughout 2009 that were not allocated to the     businesses. Noninterest income decreased $4.9 billion, as     the prior year included a $7.3 billion gain resulting from     sales of shares of CCB and an increase of $1.4 billion on     net gains on the sale of debt securities. This was offset by net     negative fair value adjustments of $4.9 billion on     structured liabilities in 2009 compared to a net positive     adjustment of $18 million in 2010 and higher valuation     adjustments and gains on sales of select investments in GPI.     Also in 2010, we sold our investments in Itaú Unibanco and     Santander resulting in a net gain of           approximately $800 million, as well as the gains on CCB and     BlackRock. For more information on the sales of these     investments, see Note 5  Securities to     the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Provision for credit losses decreased $3.4 billion to     $4.6 billion due to improving portfolio trends in the     residential mortgage portfolio partially offset by further     deterioration in the Countrywide purchased credit-impaired     discontinued real estate portfolio.       The income tax benefit in 2010 was $4.1 billion compared to     $2.4 billion in 2009, driven by an increase in the pre-tax     loss as well as the release of a higher portion of a deferred     tax asset valuation allowance.       During 2010, we completed the sale of First Republic at book     value and as a result, we removed $17.4 billion of loans     and $17.8 billion of deposits from the Corporations     Consolidated Balance Sheet.      Off-Balance     Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations        We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt     and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of     business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we     commit to future purchases of products or services from     unaffiliated parties. Obligations that are legally binding     agreements whereby we agree to purchase products or services     with a specific minimum quantity defined at a fixed, minimum or     variable price over a specified period of time are defined as     purchase obligations. Included in purchase obligations are     commitments to purchase loans of $2.6 billion and vendor     contracts of $7.1 billion. The most significant vendor     contracts include communication services, processing services     and software contracts. Other long-term liabilities include our     contractual funding obligations related to the Qualified Pension     Plans,     Non-U.S. Pension     Plans, Nonqualified Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and     Life Plans (the Plans). Obligations to the Plans are based on     the current and projected obligations of the Plans, performance     of the Plans assets and any participant contributions, if     applicable. During 2010 and 2009, we contributed     $378 million and $414 million to the Plans, and we     expect to make at least $306 million of contributions     during 2011.       Debt, lease, equity and other obligations are more fully     discussed in Note 13  Long-term Debt and     Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies to     the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Plans are more fully     discussed in Note 19  Employee Benefit Plans     to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       We enter into commitments to extend credit such as loan     commitments, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and commercial     letters of credit to meet the financing needs of our customers.

In addition, in prior     years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries have sold pools     of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans     as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans.     In connection with these transactions, we or our subsidiaries or     legacy companies make or have made various representations and     warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties may     result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to     otherwise make whole or provide other remedy to a     whole-loan     buyer or securitization trust (collectively, repurchase claims).     Our operations are currently structured to attempt to limit the     risk of repurchase and accompanying credit exposure by seeking     to ensure consistent production of mortgages in accordance with     our underwriting procedures and by servicing those mortgages     consistent with our contractual obligations.       The fair value of probable losses to be absorbed under the     representations and warranties obligations and the guarantees is     recorded as an accrued liability when the loans are sold. The     liability for probable losses is updated by accruing a     representations and warranties provision in mortgage banking     income. This is done throughout the life of the loan as     necessary when additional relevant information becomes     available. The methodology used to estimate the liability for     representations and warranties is a function of the     representations and warranties given and considers a variety of     factors, which include, depending on the counterparty, actual     defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience,     estimated home prices, estimated probability that a repurchase     request will be received, number of payments made by the     borrower prior to default and estimated probability that a loan     will be required to be repurchased. Historical experience also     considers recent events such as the agreements with the GSEs on     December 31, 2010 as discussed in the following section. Changes     to any one of these factors could significantly impact the     estimate of our liability. Given that these factors vary by     counterparty, we analyze our representations and warranties     obligations based on the specific counterparty with whom the     sale was made. Although the timing and volume has varied, we     have experienced in recent periods increasing repurchase and     similar requests from buyers and insurers, including monolines.     Generally the volume of unresolved repurchase claims from the     FHA and VA for loans in GNMA-guaranteed securities is not     significant because the requests are limited in number and are     typically resolved quickly. We expect that efforts to attempt to     assert repurchase requests by monolines,     whole-loan     investors and private-label securitization investors may     increase in the future. See Recent Events      Private-label Residential Mortgage-backed Securities Matters, on     page 35 for additional information. We perform a     loan-by-loan     review of all properly presented repurchase claims and have and     will continue to contest such demands that we do not believe are     valid. In addition, we may reach a bulk settlement with a     counterparty (in lieu of the     loan-by-loan     review process), on terms determined to be advantageous to the     Corporation. Overall, disputes with respect to repurchase claims     have increased with monoline insurers,     whole-loan     buyers and     private-label     securitization investors. For additional information, see     Note 9  Representations and Warranties     Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated     Financial Statements.             At December 31, 2010, our total unresolved repurchase     claims totaled approximately $10.7 billion compared to     $7.6 billion at the end of 2009. The liability for     representations and warranties and corporate guarantees, is     included in accrued expenses and other liabilities and the     related provision is included in mortgage banking income. At     December 31, 2010 and 2009, the liability was     $5.4 billion and $3.5 billion. For 2010 and 2009, the     provision for representations and warranties and corporate     guarantees was $6.8 billion and $1.9 billion. The     representations and warranties provision of $6.8 billion,     includes a provision of $3.0 billion in the fourth quarter     of 2010 related to the GSE agreements as well as adjustments to     the representations and warranties liability for other loans     sold directly to the GSEs and not covered by those agreements.     Also contributing to the increase in representations and     warranties provision for the year was our continued evaluation     of exposure to non-GSE repurchases and similar claims, which led     to the determination that we have developed sufficient     repurchase experience with certain non-GSE counterparties to     record a liability related to existing and future projected     claims from such counterparties. Representations and warranties     provision may vary significantly each period as the methodology     used to estimate the expense continues to be refined based on     the level and type of repurchase claims presented, defects     identified, the latest experience gained on repurchase claims     and other relevant facts and circumstances, which could have a     material adverse impact on our earnings for any particular     period.     Government-sponsored     Enterprises       During the last ten years, Bank of America and our subsidiaries     have sold over $2.0 trillion of loans to the GSEs and we have an     established history of working with them on repurchase claims.     Our experience with them continues to evolve and any disputes     are generally related to areas such as the reasonableness of     stated income, occupancy and undisclosed liabilities, and are     typically focused on the 2004 through 2008 vintages. On     December 31, 2010, we reached agreements with the GSEs and     paid $2.8 billion to the GSEs pursuant to such agreements,     resolving repurchase claims involving certain residential     mortgage loans sold directly to them by entities related to     legacy Countrywide. As a result of these agreements, as well as     adjustments to the representations and warranties liability for     other loans sold directly to the GSEs and not covered by those     agreements, we adjusted our liability for representations and     warranties. For additional information regarding these     agreements, see Note 9  Representations and     Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the     Consolidated Financial Statements.       Our current repurchase claims experience with the GSEs is     predominantly concentrated in the 2004 through 2008 origination     vintages where we believe that our exposure to representations     and warranties liability is most significant. Our repurchase     claims experience related to loans originated prior to 2004 has     not been significant and we believe that the changes made to our     operations and underwriting policies have reduced our exposure     after 2008. The cumulative repurchase claims for 2007 exceed all     other vintages. The volume of loans originated in 2007 was     significantly higher than any other vintage which, together with     the high delinquency level in this vintage, helps to explain the     high level of repurchase claims compared to the other vintages.               52     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents    Cumulative     GSE Repurchase Claims by Vintage                  (1)   Exposure at default (EAD)     represents the unpaid principal balance at the time of default     or the unpaid principal balance as of December 31, 2010.                  Bank of America and legacy Countrywide sold approximately $1.1     trillion of loans originated from 2004 through 2008 to the GSEs.     As of December 31, 2010, slightly less than 10 percent     of the loans in these vintages have defaulted or are     180 days or more past due (severely delinquent). At least     25 payments have been made on approximately 55 percent of     severely delinquent or defaulted loans. Through     December 31, 2010, we have received approximately     $21.6 billion in repurchase claims associated with these     vintages, representing approximately two percent of the loans     sold to the GSEs in these vintages. Including the agreement     reached with FNMA on December 31, 2010, we have resolved     $18.2 billion of these claims with a net loss experience of     approximately 27 percent. The claims resolved and the loss     rate do not include $839 million in claims extinguished as     a result of the           agreement with FHLMC due to the global nature of the agreement     and, specifically, the absence of a formal apportionment of the     agreement amount between current and future claims. Our     collateral loss severity rate on approved repurchases has     averaged approximately 45 to 55 percent. Although the level     of repurchase claims from the GSEs has been elevated for the     last few quarters, the agreements with the GSEs have resulted in     a decrease in the total number of outstanding repurchase claims     at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009.     Based on the information derived from the historical GSE     experience, including the GSE agreements discussed on the     previous  page, we believe we are 70 percent to     75 percent through the receipt of the GSE repurchase claims     that we ultimately expect to receive.

We believe that our remaining exposure to     representations and warranties for loans sold directly to the     GSEs has been accounted for as a result of these agreements and     the associated adjustments to our recorded liability for     representations and warranties for other loans sold directly to     the GSEs and not covered by the agreements. We believe our     predictive repurchase models, utilizing our historical     repurchase experience with the GSEs while considering current     developments, including the recent agreements, projections of     future defaults as well as certain assumptions regarding     economic conditions, home prices and other matters, allows us to     reasonably estimate the liability for obligations under     representations and warranties on loans sold to the GSEs.     However, future provisions and possible loss or range of loss     associated with representations and warranties made to the GSEs     may be impacted if actual results are different from our     assumptions regarding economic conditions, home prices and other     matters.     Transactions with     Investors Other than Government-sponsored Entities       In prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries have     sold pools of first-lien mortgage loans and home equity loans as     private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. The     loans sold include prime loans, including loans with a loan     balance in excess of the conforming loan limit, Alt-A,     pay-option, home equity and subprime loans. Many of the loans     sold in the form of whole loans were subsequently pooled with     other mortgages into private-label securitizations issued or     sponsored by the third-party buyer of the whole loans. In some     of the private-label securitizations, monolines have insured all     or some of the issued bonds or certificates. In connection with     these securitizations and whole loan sales, we or our     subsidiaries or our legacy companies made various     representations and warranties. Breaches of these     representations and warranties may result in the requirement to     repurchase mortgage loans from or to otherwise make whole or     provide other remedy to a whole-loan buyer or securitization     trust.       As detailed in Table 11, legacy companies and certain     subsidiaries sold loans originated from 2004 through 2008 with a     principal balance of $963 billion to investors other than     GSEs, of which approximately $478 billion in           principal has been paid and $216 billion have defaulted, or     are severely delinquent (i.e., 180 days or more past due)     and are considered principal at-risk at December 31, 2010.     As of December 31, 2010, we had received $13.7 billion     of repurchase claims on these     2004-2008     loan vintages, of which $6.0 billion have been resolved and     $7.7 billion remain outstanding. Of the $7.7 billion     of repurchase claims that remain outstanding, we have reviewed     $4.1 billion that we have declined to repurchase. We have     recognized losses of $1.7 billion on the resolved     repurchase claims, $631 million of which relates to     monolines and $1.1 billion of which relates to whole loan     and private-label investors, as described in more detail below.       As it relates to private investors, including those who have     invested in private-label securitizations, a contractual     liability to repurchase mortgage loans generally arises only if     counterparties prove there is a breach of the representations     and warranties that materially and adversely affects the     interest of the investor or all investors in a securitization     trust, or that there is a breach of other standards established     by the terms of the related sale agreement. We believe that the     longer a loan performs, the less likely an underwriting     representations and warranties breach would have had a material     impact on the loans performance or that a breach even     exists. Because the majority of the borrowers in this population     would have made a significant amount of payments if they are not     yet 180 days or more delinquent, we believe that the     principal balance at the greatest risk for repurchase requests     in this population of private-label investors is a combination     of loans that have already defaulted and those that are     currently 180 days or more past due. Additionally, the     obligation to repurchase mortgage loans also requires that     counterparties have the contractual right to demand repurchase     of the loans. Based on a recent court ruling that dismissed a     case against legacy Countrywide, we believe private-label     securitization investors must generally aggregate     25 percent of the voting interests in each of the tranches     of a particular securitization to instruct the securitization     trustee to investigate potential repurchase claims. While a     securitization trustee may elect to investigate or demand     repurchase of loans on its own, individual investors typically     have limited rights under the contracts to present repurchase     claims directly. Also, the motivation of some private-label     securitization investors to assert repurchase claims may be     diminished by the fact that their investment is not materially     impacted by the losses due to the credit enhancement coverage     provided by cash flows from the tranches rated below AAA, for     example.       Any amounts paid related to repurchase claims from a monoline     are paid to the securitization trust and are applied in     accordance with the terms of the              54     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           governing securitization documents, which may include use by the     securitization trust to repay any outstanding monoline advances     or reduce future advances from the monolines. To the extent that     a monoline has not advanced funds or does not anticipate that it     will be required to advance funds to the securitization trust,     the likelihood of receiving a repurchase request from a monoline     may be reduced as the monoline would receive limited or no     benefit from the payment of repurchase claims. Moreover, some     monolines are not           currently performing their obligations under the financial     guaranty policies they issued which may, in certain     circumstances, impact their ability to present repurchase claims.       Table 11 details the population of loans sold as whole-loans or     in non-agency securitizations by entity and product together     with the principal at-risk stratified by the number of payments     the borrower made prior to default or becoming severely     delinquent.

(2)   Excludes transactions sponsored by     Bank of America and Merrill Lynch where no representations or     warranties were assumed.         (3)   Includes exposures on third-party     sponsored transactions related to legacy entity originations.                      As of December 31, 2010, approximately 22 percent of     the loans sold to non-GSEs that were originated from 2004 to     2008 have defaulted or are severely delinquent. As shown in     Table 11, at least 25 payments have been made on approximately     58 percent of the loans included in principal at-risk. We     believe many of the defaults observed in these securitizations     have been, and continue to be, driven by external factors like     the substantial depreciation in home prices, persistently high     unemployment and other negative economic trends, diminishing the     likelihood that any loan defect (assuming one exists at all) was     the cause of the loans default.       We believe the agreements for private-label securitizations     generally contain less rigorous representations and warranties     and generally impose higher burdens on investors seeking loan     repurchases than the comparable agreements with the GSEs. For     example, borrower fraud representations and warranties were     generally not given in private-label securitizations. The     following represent some of the typical private-label     securitization transaction terms (which differ substantially     from those provided in GSE transactions):                   Representation of material compliance with underwriting     guidelines (which often explicitly permit exceptions).               Few transactions contain a representation that there has been no     fraud or material misrepresentation by a borrower or third party.               Many representations include materiality qualifiers.               Breach of representation must materially and adversely affect     certificate holders interest in the loan.               No representation that the mortgage is of investment quality.               Offering documents included extensive disclosures, including     detailed risk factors, description of underwriting practices and     guidelines, and loan attributes.               Only parties to a pooling and servicing agreement (e.g., the     trustee) can bring repurchase claims. Certificate holders cannot     bring claims directly and do not have access to loan files. At     least 25 percent of each tranche of certificate holders is     generally required in order to direct a trustee to review                           loan files for potential claims. In addition, certificate     holders must bear costs of a trustees loan file review.               Repurchase liability is generally limited to the seller.         These factors lead us to believe that only a portion of the     principal at-risk with respect to loans included in     private-label securitizations will be the subject of a     repurchase request and only a portion of those requests would     ultimately result in a repurchase. Although our experience with     non-GSE claims remains limited, we expect additional activity in     this area going forward and that the volume of repurchase claims     from monolines, whole-loan investors and investors in     private-label securitizations could increase in the future. It     is reasonably possible that future losses may occur, and our     estimate is that the upper range of possible loss related to     non-GSE sales could be $7 billion to $10 billion over     existing accruals. This estimate does not represent a probable     loss, is based on currently available information, significant     judgment, and a number of assumptions that are subject to     change. A significant portion of this estimate relates to loans     originated through legacy Countrywide, and the repurchase     liability is generally limited to the original seller of the     loan. Future provisions and possible loss or range of loss may     be impacted if actual results are different from our assumptions     regarding economic conditions, home prices and other matters and     may vary by counterparty. The resolution of the repurchase     claims process with the non-GSE counterparties will likely be a     protracted process, and we will vigorously contest any request     for repurchase if we conclude that a valid basis for the     repurchase claim does not exist.       The following discussion provides more detailed information     related to non-GSE counterparties.     Monoline     Insurers       Legacy companies have sold $185.6 billion of loans     originated from 2004 through 2008 into monoline-insured     securitizations, which are included in Table 11, including     $106.2 billion of first-lien mortgages and     $79.4 billion of              Bank of America     2010     55     Table of Contents           second-lien mortgages. Of these balances, $45.8 billion of     the first-lien mortgages and $48.5 billion of the     second-lien mortgages have paid off and $32.9 billion of     the first-lien mortgages and $14.5 billion of the     second-lien mortgages have defaulted or are severely delinquent     and are considered principal at-risk at December 31, 2010.     At least 25 payments have been made on approximately     52 percent of the loans included in principal at-risk. Of     the first-lien mortgages sold, $41.0 billion, or     39 percent, were sold as whole loans to other institutions     which subsequently included these loans with those of other     originators in private-label securitization transactions in     which the monolines typically insured one or more securities.     Through December 31, 2010, we have received     $5.6 billion of representations and warranties claims     related to the monoline-insured transactions. Of these     repurchase claims, $799 million have been resolved, with     losses of $631 million. The majority of these resolved     claims related to second-lien mortgages and $678 million of     these claims were resolved through repurchase or indemnification     while $121 million were rescinded by the investor or paid     in full. At December 31, 2010, the unpaid principal balance     of loans related to unresolved monoline repurchase requests was     $4.8 billion, including $3.0 billion that have been     reviewed where it is believed a valid defect has not been     identified which would constitute an actionable breach of     representations and warranties and $1.8 billion that are in     the process of review. We have had limited experience with most     of the monoline insurers in the repurchase process, which has     constrained our ability to resolve the open claims with such     counterparties. Also, certain monoline insurers have instituted     litigation against legacy Countrywide and Bank of America, which     limits our relationship with such monoline insurers and ability     to enter into constructive dialogue to resolve the open claims.     It is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate future     repurchase obligations with respect to those monolines with whom     we have limited repurchase experience and, therefore, no     liability has been recorded in connection with these monolines,     other than a liability for repurchase requests that are in the     process of review and repurchase requests where we have     determined that there are valid loan defects. However, certain     other monoline insurers have engaged with us in a consistent     repurchase process and we have used that experience to record a     liability related to existing and projected future claims from     such counterparties.     Whole Loan Sales     and Private-label Securitizations       Legacy entities, and to a lesser extent Bank of America, sold     loans in whole loan sales or via private-label securitizations     with a total principal balance of $777.1 billion originated     from 2004 through 2008, which are included in Table 11, of which     $384.0 billion have been paid off and $169.0 billion     have defaulted or are severely delinquent and are considered     principal at-risk at December 31, 2010. At least 25     payments have been made on approximately 60 percent of the     loans included in principal at-risk. We have received     approximately $8.1 billion of representations and     warranties claims from whole loan investors and private-label     securitization investors related to these vintages, including     $5.6 billion from whole loan investors, $800 million     from one private-label securitization counterparty which were     submitted prior to 2008 and $1.7 billion in recent demands     from private-label securitization investors. Private-label     securitization investors generally do not have the contractual     right to demand repurchase of loans directly. The inclusion of     the $1.7 billion in recent demands from private-label     securitization investors does not mean that we believe these     claims have satisfied the contractual thresholds required for     these investors to direct the securitization trustee to take     action or are otherwise procedurally or substantively valid.     Additionally, certain private-label securitizations are insured     by the monolines, which are not reflected in these figures     regarding whole loan sales and private-label securitizations.       We have resolved $5.2 billion of the claims received from     whole loan investors and private-label securitization investors     with losses of $1.1 billion. Approximately     $2.1 billion of these claims were resolved through     repurchase           or indemnification and $3.1 billion were rescinded by the     investor. Claims outstanding related to these vintages totaled     $2.9 billion at December 31, 2010, $1.1 billion     of which we have reviewed and declined to repurchase based on an     assessment of whether a material breach exists, $91 million     of which are in the process of review and $1.7 billion of     which are demands from private-label securitization investors     received in the fourth quarter of 2010. The majority of the     claims that we have received so far are from whole loan     investors and until we have meaningful repurchase experiences     with counterparties other than whole loan investors, it is not     possible to determine whether a loss related to our     private-label securitizations has occurred or is probable.     However, certain whole loan investors have engaged with us in a     consistent repurchase process and we have used that experience     to record a liability related to existing and future claims from     such counterparties.       On October 18, 2010, Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, LP     (which changed its name to BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP), a     wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, received a letter,     in its capacity as servicer on 115 private-label securitizations     which was subsequently extended to 225 securitizations. The     letter asserted breaches of certain servicing obligations,     including an alleged failure to provide notice of breaches of     representations and warranties with respect to mortgage loans     included in the transactions.

Risk Factors for additional     information on recent or proposed legislative and regulatory     initiatives as well as other risks to which we are exposed,     including among others, enhanced regulatory scrutiny or     potential legal liability as a result of the recent financial     crisis.     Financial Reform     Act       On July 21, 2010, the Financial Reform Act was signed into     law. The Financial Reform Act enacts sweeping financial     regulatory reform and will alter the way in which we conduct     certain businesses, increase our costs and reduce our revenues.     Background       The Financial Reform Act mandates that the Federal Reserve limit     debit card interchange fees. Provisions in the legislation also     ban banking organizations from engaging in proprietary trading     and restrict their sponsorship of, or investing in, hedge funds     and private equity funds, subject to limited exceptions. The     Financial Reform Act increases regulation of the derivative     markets through measures that broaden the derivative instruments     subject to regulation and requires clearing and exchange trading     as well as imposing additional capital and margin requirements     for derivative market participants. The Financial Reform Act     also changes the methodology for calculating deposit insurance     assessments from the amount of an insured depository     institutions domestic deposits to its total assets minus     tangible capital; provides for resolution authority to establish     a process to unwind large systemically important financial     companies; creates a new regulatory body to set requirements     regarding the terms and conditions of consumer financial     products and expands the role of state regulators in enforcing     consumer protection requirements over banks; includes new     minimum leverage and risk-based              56     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           capital requirements for large financial institutions;     disqualifies trust preferred securities and other hybrid capital     securities from Tier 1 capital; and requires securitizers     to retain a portion of the risk that would otherwise be     transferred into certain securitization transactions. Many of     these provisions have begun to be phased-in or will be phased-in     over the next several months or years and will be subject both     to further rulemaking and the discretion of applicable     regulatory bodies.       The Financial Reform Act will continue to have a significant and     negative impact on our earnings through fee reductions, higher     costs and new restrictions, as well as reduce available capital.     The Financial Reform Act may also continue to have a material     adverse impact on the value of certain assets and liabilities     held on our balance sheet. The ultimate impact of the Financial     Reform Act on our businesses and results of operations will     depend on regulatory interpretation and rulemaking, as well as     the success of any of our actions to mitigate the negative     earnings impact of certain provisions. For information on the     impact of the Financial Reform Act on our credit ratings, see     Liquidity Risk beginning on page 67.       The Financial Reform Act and other proposed regulatory     initiatives may also have an adverse impact on capital. During     2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision finalized rules     on certain capital and liquidity measurements. For additional     information on these rules, see Regulatory Capital      Regulatory Capital Changes beginning on page 64.     Debit     Interchange Fees       The limits that the Financial Reform Act places on debit     interchange fees will significantly reduce our debit card     interchange revenues. Interchange fees, or swipe     fees, are charges that merchants pay to us and other credit card     companies and card-issuing banks for processing electronic     payment transactions. The legislation, which provides the     Federal Reserve with authority over interchange fees received or     charged by a card issuer, requires that fees must be     reasonable and proportional to the costs of     processing such transactions. The Federal Reserve considered the     functional similarity between debit card transactions and     traditional checking transactions and the incremental costs     incurred by a card issuer in processing a particular debit card     transaction. In addition, the legislation prohibits card issuers     and networks from entering into exclusive arrangements requiring     that debit card transactions be processed on a single network or     only two affiliated networks, and allows merchants to determine     transaction routing.       On December 16, 2010, the Federal Reserve issued a proposed     rule that would establish debit card interchange fee standards     and prohibit network exclusivity arrangements and routing     restrictions. The Federal Reserve requested comments on two     alternative interchange fee standards that would apply to all     covered issuers: one based on each issuers costs, with a     safe harbor initially set at $0.07 per transaction and a cap     initially set at $0.12 per transaction; and the other a     stand-alone cap initially set at $0.12 per transaction. The     Federal Reserve also requested comment on possible frameworks     for an adjustment to the interchange fees to reflect certain     issuer costs associated with fraud prevention. If the Federal     Reserve adopts either of these proposed standards in the final     rule, the maximum allowable interchange fee received by covered     issuers for debit card transactions would be more than     70 percent lower than the 2009 average once the new rule     takes effect on July 21, 2011. The proposed rule would also     prohibit issuers and networks from restricting the number of     networks over which debit card transactions may be processed.     The Federal Reserve requested comment on two alternative     approaches: one alternative would require at least two     unaffiliated networks per debit card, and the other would     require at least two unaffiliated networks per debit card for     each type of cardholder authorization method (such as signature     or PIN). Under both alternatives, the issuers and networks would     be prohibited from inhibiting a merchants ability to     direct the routing of debit card transactions over any network     that the issuer enabled to process them.             As previously announced on July 16, 2010, as a result of     the Financial Reform Act and its related rules and subject to     final rulemaking over the next year, we believe that our debit     card revenue will be adversely impacted beginning in the third     quarter of 2011. Our consumer and small business card products,     including the debit card business, are part of an integrated     platform within the Global Card Services business     segment. In 2010, our estimate of revenue loss due to the debit     card interchange fee standards to be adopted under the Financial     Reform Act was approximately $2.0 billion annually based on     2010 volumes. As a result, we recorded a non-tax deductible     goodwill impairment charge for Global Card Services of     $10.4 billion in 2010. We have identified other potential     mitigation actions within Global Card Services, but they     are in the early stages of development and some of them may     impact other segments. The impairment charge, which is a     non-cash item, had no impact on our reported Tier 1 and     tangible equity ratios. If the Federal Reserve sets the final     interchange fee standards at the lowest proposed fee     alternative, as described above (i.e., $0.07 per transaction)     the lower interchange revenue may result in additional     impairment of goodwill in Global Card Services. In view     of the uncertainty with model inputs including the final ruling,     changes in the economic outlook and the corresponding impact to     revenues and asset quality, and the impacts of mitigation     actions, it is not possible to estimate the amount or range of     amounts of additional goodwill impairment, if any, associated     with changes to interchange fee standards. For more information     on goodwill and the impairment charge, refer to     Note 10  Goodwill and Intangible Assets     to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Complex     Accounting Estimates beginning on page 107.     Limitations on     Certain Activities       We anticipate that the final regulations associated with the     Financial Reform Act will include limitations on certain     activities, including limitations on the use of a banks     own capital for proprietary trading and sponsorship or     investment in hedge funds and private equity funds (Volcker     Rule). Regulations implementing the Volcker Rule are required to     be in place by October 21, 2011, and the Volcker Rule     becomes effective twelve months after such rules are final or on     July 21, 2012, whichever is earlier. The Volcker Rule then     gives banking entities two years from the effective date (with     opportunities for additional extensions) to bring activities and     investments into conformance. In anticipation of the adoption of     the final regulations, we have begun winding down our     proprietary trading line of business. The ultimate impact of the     Volcker Rule or the winding down of this business, and the time     it will take to comply or complete, continues to remain     uncertain. The final regulations issued may impose additional     operational and compliance costs on us.     Derivatives       The Financial Reform Act includes measures to broaden the scope     of derivative instruments subject to regulation by requiring     clearing and exchange trading of certain derivatives, imposing     new capital and margin requirements for certain market     participants and imposing position limits on certain     over-the-counter     (OTC) derivatives. The Financial Reform Act grants the     U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the     SEC substantial new authority and requires numerous rulemakings     by these agencies. Generally, the CFTC and SEC have until     July 16, 2011 to promulgate the rulemakings necessary to     implement these regulations. The ultimate impact of these     derivatives regulations, and the time it will take to comply,     continues to remain uncertain. The final regulations will impose     additional operational and compliance costs on us and may     require us to restructure certain businesses and negatively     impact our revenues and results of operations.     FDIC Deposit     Insurance Assessments       Since the financial crisis began several years ago, an     increasing number of bank failures has imposed significant costs     on the FDIC in resolving those failures, and the     regulators deposit insurance fund has been depleted. In     order to              Bank of America     2010     57     Table of Contents           maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of     the deposit insurance fund, the FDIC has increased, and may     increase in the future, assessment rates of insured     institutions, including Bank of America.       Deposits placed at the U.S. Banks are insured by the FDIC,     subject to limits and conditions of applicable law and the     FDICs regulations. Pursuant to the Financial Reform Act,     FDIC insurance coverage limits were permanently increased to     $250,000 per customer. The Financial Reform Act also provides     for unlimited FDIC insurance coverage for non-interest bearing     demand deposit accounts for a two-year period beginning on     December 31, 2010 and ending on January 1, 2013. The     FDIC administers the Deposit Insurance Fund, and all insured     depository institutions are required to pay assessments to the     FDIC that fund the Deposit Insurance Fund. The Financial Reform     Act changed the methodology for calculating deposit insurance     assessments from the amount of an insured depository     institutions domestic deposits to its total assets minus     tangible capital. On February 7, 2011 the FDIC issued a new     regulation implementing revisions to the assessment system     mandated by the Financial Reform Act. The new regulation will be     effective April 1, 2011 and will be reflected in the     June 30, 2011 FDIC fund balance and the invoices for     assessments due September 30, 2011. As a result of the new     regulations, we expect to incur higher annual deposit insurance     assessments. We have identified potential mitigation actions,     but they are in the early stages of development and we are not     able to directly control the basis or the amount of premiums     that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance or for other fees     or assessment obligations imposed on financial institutions. Any     future increases in required deposit insurance premiums or other     bank industry fees could have a significant adverse impact on     our financial condition and results of operations.     CARD     Act       On May 22, 2009, the CARD Act was signed into law. The     majority of the CARD Act provisions became effective in February     2010. The CARD Act legislation contains comprehensive credit     card reform related to credit card industry practices including     significantly restricting banks ability to change interest     rates and assess fees to reflect individual consumer risk,     changing the way payments are applied and requiring changes to     consumer credit card disclosures. The provisions of the CARD Act     negatively impacted net interest income and card income during     2010, and are expected to negatively impact future net interest     income due to the restrictions on our ability to reprice credit     cards based on risk, and card income due to restrictions imposed     on certain fees. The 2010 full-year decrease in revenue was     approximately $1.5 billion.     Regulation E       On November 12, 2009, the Federal Reserve issued amendments     to Regulation E which implements the Electronic     Fund Transfer Act. The rules became effective on     July 1, 2010 for new customers and August 16, 2010 for     existing customers. These amendments limit the way we and other     banks charge an overdraft fee for non-recurring debit card     transactions that overdraw a consumers account unless the     consumer affirmatively consents to the banks payment of     overdrafts for those transactions. Under previously announced     plans, we do not offer customers the opportunity to opt-in to     overdraft services related to non-recurring debit card     transactions. However, customers are able to opt-in on a     withdrawal-by-withdrawal     basis to access cash through the Bank of America ATM network     where the bank is able to alert customers that the transaction     may overdraw their account and result in a fee if they choose to     proceed. The impact of Regulation E, which was in effect     beginning in the third quarter and fully in effect in the fourth     quarter of 2010, and our overdraft policy changes, which were in     effect for the full year of 2010, was a reduction in service     charges during 2010 of approximately $1.7 billion. In 2011,     the incremental reduction to service charges related to     Regulation E and overdraft policy changes is expected           to be approximately $1.1 billion, or a full-year impact of     approximately $2.8 billion, net of identified mitigation     action.     U.K. Corporate     Income Tax Rate       On July 27, 2010, the U.K. government enacted a law change     reducing the corporate income tax rate by one percent effective     for the 2011 U.K. tax financial year beginning on April 1,     2011. While this rate reduction favorably affects income tax     expense on future U.K. earnings, it also required us to     remeasure our U.K. net deferred tax assets using the lower tax     rate, which resulted in a charge to income tax expense of     $392 million in 2010. A future rate reduction of one     percent per year is generally expected to be enacted in each of     2011, 2012 and 2013, which would result in a similar charge to     income tax expense of nearly $400 million during each of     the three years. The U.K. Treasury has asked for taxpayer views     on whether the U.K. government should alternatively enact the     full remaining three-percent reduction entirely during 2011,     which would accelerate the possible charges into 2011 for a     total of approximately $1.1 billion.     Final Regulatory     Guidance on Consolidation       On January 21, 2010, the Federal Reserve, Office of the     Comptroller of the Currency, FDIC and Office of Thrift     Supervision (collectively, joint agencies) issued a final rule     regarding risk-based capital requirements related to the impact     of the adoption of new consolidation guidance. The impact on the     Corporation on January 1, 2010 due to the new consolidation     guidance and the final rule was an increase in risk-weighted     assets of $21.3 billion and a reduction in capital of     $9.7 billion. The overall impact of the new consolidation     guidance and the final rule was a decrease in Tier 1     capital and Tier 1 common ratios of 76 bps and     73 bps. For more information, see Balance Sheet     Overview  Impact of Adopting New Consolidation     Guidance on page 29, Capital Management beginning on     page 63 and Liquidity Risk beginning on page 67.     Payment     Protection Insurance       In the U.K., the Corporation sells PPI through its Global     Card Services business to credit card customers and has     previously sold this insurance to consumer loan customers. In     response to an elevated level of customer complaints of     misleading sales tactics across the industry, heightened media     coverage and pressure from consumer advocacy groups, the U.K.     Financial Services Authority (FSA) has investigated and raised     concerns about the way some companies have handled complaints     relating to the sale of these insurance policies. In August     2010, the FSA issued a policy statement on the assessment and     remediation of PPI claims which is applicable to the     Corporations U.K. consumer businesses and is intended to     address concerns among consumers and regulators regarding the     handling of PPI complaints across the industry. The policy     statement sets standards for the sale of PPI that apply to     current and prior sales, and in the event a company does not or     did not comply with the standards, it is alleged that the     insurance was incorrectly sold, giving the customer rights to     remedies. Given the new regulatory guidance, in 2010, the     Corporation had a liability of $630 million based on its current     claims history and an estimate of future claims that have yet to     be asserted against the Corporation. For additional information     on PPI, see Note 14  Commitments and     Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial     Statements  Payment Protection Insurance Claims     Matter on page 196.     U.K. Bank     Levy       On June 22, 2010, the U.K. government announced that it     intended to introduce an annual bank levy. Beginning in 2011,     the bank levy will be payable on the consolidated liabilities,     subject to certain exclusions and offsets, of U.K. group     companies and U.K. branches of foreign banking groups as of each     year-end balance sheet date. As currently proposed, the bank     levy rate for 2011 and              58     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           future years will be 0.075 percent per annum for certain     short-term liabilities with a rate of 0.0375 percent per     annum for longer maturity liabilities and certain deposits. The     legislation is expected to be enacted in the third quarter of     2011. We currently estimate that the cost of the U.K. bank levy     will be approximately $125 million annually beginning in     2011.     Regulatory     Guidance on Collateral Dependent Loans       On February 23, 2010, regulators issued clarifying     guidance, effective in the first quarter of 2010, on modified     consumer real estate loans that specifies criteria required to     demonstrate a borrowers capacity to repay the modified     loan. In connection with this guidance, we reviewed our modified     consumer real estate loans and determined that a portion of     these loans did not meet the criteria and, therefore, were     deemed collateral dependent. The guidance requires that a     modified loan deemed to be collateral dependent be written down     to its estimated collateral value even if that loan is     performing. The application of this guidance resulted in     $1.0 billion of net charge-offs in 2010, of which     $822 million were home equity, $207 million were     residential mortgage and $9 million were discontinued real     estate.     Making Home     Affordable Program       On March 4, 2009, the U.S. Treasury provided details     related to the $75 billion Making Home Affordable program     (MHA) which is focused on reducing the number of foreclosures     and making it easier for customers to refinance loans. The MHA     consists of the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP)     which provides guidelines on first-lien loan modifications, and     the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) which provides     guidelines for loan refinancing.       As part of the MHA program, on April 28, 2009, the     U.S. government announced intentions to create the     second-lien modification program (2MP) that is designed to     reduce the monthly payments on qualifying home equity loans and     lines of credit under certain conditions, including completion     of a HAMP modification on the first mortgage on the property.     This program provides incentives to lenders to modify all     eligible loans that fall under the guidelines of this program.     Additional clarification on government guidelines for the     program was announced early in 2010. On April 8, 2010, we     began early implementation of the 2MP with the mailing of trial     modification offers to eligible home equity customers. We will     modify eligible second liens under this initiative regardless of     whether the MHA modified first lien is serviced by     the Corporation or another participating servicer.       On April 5, 2010, we implemented the Home Affordable     Foreclosure Alternatives (HAFA) program, which is another     addition to the HAMP that assists borrowers with non-retention     options, such as short sale or     deed-in-lieu     options, instead of foreclosure. The HAFA program provides     incentives to lenders to assist all eligible borrowers that fall     under the guidelines of this program. Our first goal is to work     with the borrower to determine if a loan modification or other     homeownership retention solution is available before pursuing     non-retention options such as short sales. Short sales are an     important option for homeowners who are facing financial     difficulty and do not have a viable option to remain in the     home. HAFAs short sale guidelines are designed to     streamline and standardize the process and will be compatible     with Bank of Americas new cooperative short sale program.       During 2010, 285,000 loan modifications were completed with a     total unpaid principal balance of $65.7 billion, including     109,000 loans with a total unpaid principal amount of     $25.5 billion that were converted from trial-period to     permanent modifications under the MHA, which include HAMP     first-lien modifications and 2MP second-lien modifications. In     addition, on March 26, 2010, the U.S. government     announced new changes to the MHA program guidelines that include     principal forgiveness options to the HAMP for a     sub-segment     of qualified HAMP borrowers. The details around eligibility,     forgiveness arrangements and the incentive structures are still     being finalized. However, we           implemented a forgiveness program on a subset of HAMP eligible     products under the National Home Retention Program (NHRP) in     2010.       In addition to the programs described above, we have implemented     several programs designed to help our customers. For information     on these programs, refer to Credit Risk Management beginning on     page 71. We will continue to help our customers address     financial challenges through these government programs and our     own home retention programs.     Stress     Tests       The Corporation has established management routines to     periodically conduct stress tests to evaluate potential impacts     to the Corporation under hypothetical economic scenarios. These     stress tests will facilitate our contingency planning and     management of capital and liquidity. These processes were also     used to conduct the recent secondary stress testing imposed by     the Federal Reserve and were incorporated into the Capital Plan     that was submitted as part of this request, which included a     proposed modest increase in our common dividend in the second     half of 2011. The results of these stress tests may influence     bank regulatory supervisory requirements concerning the     Corporation and may impact the amount or timing of dividends or     distributions to the Corporations stockholders. For     additional information, see Capital Management beginning on     page 63 and Liquidity Risk beginning on page 67.     Other     Matters       The Corporation has established guidelines and policies for     managing capital across its subsidiaries. The guidance for the     Corporations subsidiaries with regulatory capital     requirements, including branch operations of banking     subsidiaries, requires each entity to maintain satisfactory     capital levels. This includes setting internal capital targets     for the U.S. bank subsidiaries to exceed well     capitalized levels.       The U.K. has adopted increased capital and liquidity     requirements for local financial institutions, including     regulated U.K. subsidiaries of non-U.K. bank holding companies     and other financial institutions as well as branches of non-U.K.     banks located in the U.K. In addition, the U.K. has proposed the     creation and production of recovery and resolution plans     (commonly referred to as living wills) by such entities. We are     currently monitoring the impact of these initiatives.      Managing     Risk      Overview       Risk is inherent in every activity that we undertake. Our     business exposes us to strategic, credit, market, liquidity,     compliance, operational and reputational risk. We must manage     these risks to maximize our long-term results by ensuring the     integrity of our assets and the quality of our earnings.       Strategic risk is the risk that results from adverse business     decisions, ineffective or inappropriate business plans, or     failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment,     business cycles, customer preferences, product obsolescence,     regulatory environment, business strategy execution,     and/or other     inherent risks of the business including reputational risk.     Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a borrowers     or counterpartys inability to meet its obligations. Market     risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or     revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market     conditions such as interest rate movements. Liquidity risk is     the inability to meet contractual and contingent financial     obligations, on- or off-balance sheet, as they come due.     Compliance risk is the risk that arises from the failure to     adhere to laws, rules, regulations, or internal policies and     procedures. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from     inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or     external events. Reputational risk is the potential that     negative publicity regarding an organizations conduct or     business practices will adversely affect its profitability,     operations or customer base, or require costly              Bank of America     2010     59     Table of Contents           litigation or other measures. Reputational risk is evaluated     within all of the risk categories and throughout the risk     management process, and as such is not discussed separately     herein. The following sections, Strategic Risk Management     beginning on page 62, Capital Management beginning on     page 63, Liquidity Risk beginning on page 67, Credit     Risk Management beginning on page 71, Market Risk     Management beginning on page 100, Compliance Risk     Management on page 106 and Operational Risk Management     beginning on page 106, address in more detail the specific     procedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of     risk that we manage.       In choosing when and how to take risks, we evaluate our capacity     for risk and seek to protect our brand and reputation, our     financial flexibility, the value of our assets and the strategic     potential of our Corporation. We intend to maintain a strong and     flexible financial position that will allow us to successfully     weather challenging economic times and take advantage of     opportunities to grow. We also intend to focus on maintaining     our relevance and value to customers, associates and     shareholders. To achieve these objectives, we have built a     comprehensive risk management culture and have implemented     governance and control measures to maintain that culture.       Our risk management infrastructure is continually evolving to     meet the heightened challenges posed by the increased complexity     of the financial services industry and markets, by our increased     size and global footprint, and by the financial crisis. We have     a defined risk framework and clearly articulated risk appetite     which is approved annually by the Corporations Board of     Directors (the Board).       We take a comprehensive approach to risk management. Risk     management planning is fully integrated with strategic,     financial and customer/client planning so that goals and     responsibilities are aligned across the organization. Risk is     managed in a systematic manner by focusing on the Corporation as     a whole as well as managing risk across the enterprise and     within individual business units, products, services and     transactions, and across all geographic locations. We maintain a     governance structure that delineates the responsibilities for     risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight     of those activities, by executive management and the Board.       Executive management assesses, and the Board oversees, the     risk-adjusted returns of each business segment through review     and approval of strategic and financial operating plans. By     allocating economic capital to and establishing a risk appetite     for a business segment, we seek to effectively manage the     ability to take on risk. Economic capital is assigned to each     business segment using a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating     each segments stand-alone credit, market, interest rate     and operational risk components, and is used to measure     risk-adjusted returns. Businesses operate within their credit,     market, compliance and operational risk standards and limits in     order to adhere to the risk appetite. These limits are based on     analyses of risk and reward in each line of business, and     executive management is responsible for tracking and reporting     performance measurements as well as any exceptions to guidelines     or limits. The Board monitors financial performance, execution     of the strategic and financial operating plans, compliance with     the risk appetite and the adequacy of internal controls through     its committees.       On December 14, 2010, the Board completed its annual review     and approval of the Risk Framework and the Risk Appetite     Statement for the Corporation. The Risk Framework defines the     accountability of the Corporation and its associates and the     Risk Appetite Statement defines the parameters under which we     will take risk. Both documents are intended to enable us to     maximize our long-term results and ensure the integrity of our     assets and the quality of our earnings. The Risk Framework is     designed to be used by our associates to understand risk     management activities, including their individual roles and     accountabilities. It also defines how risk management is     integrated into our core business processes, and it defines the     risk management governance structure, including     managements involvement. The risk management     responsibilities of the lines of business, governance and     control functions, and Corporate Audit are also clearly defined,     and reflects how the           Board-approved risk appetite influences business and risk     strategy. The risk management process contains four elements:     identify and measure risk, mitigate and control risk, monitor     and test risk, and report and review risk, and is applied across     all business activities to enable an integrated and     comprehensive review of risk consistent with the Boards     Risk Appetite Statement.     Risk Management     Processes and Methods       To support our corporate goals and objectives, risk appetite,     and business and risk strategies, we maintain a governance     structure that delineates the responsibilities for risk     management activities, as well as governance and oversight of     those activities, by management and the Board. All associates     have accountability for risk management. Each associates     risk management responsibilities falls into one of three major     categories: lines of business, governance and control (Global     Risk Management and enterprise control functions) and Corporate     Audit.       Line of business managers and associates are accountable for     identifying, managing and escalating attention, as appropriate,     to all risks in their business units, including existing and     emerging risks. Line of business managers must ensure that their     business activities are conducted within the risk appetite     defined by management and approved by the Board. The limits and     controls for each business must be consistent with the Risk     Appetite Statement. Line of business associates in client and     customer facing businesses are responsible for     day-to-day     business activities, including developing and delivering     profitable products and services, fulfilling customer requests     and maintaining desirable customer relationships. These     associates are accountable for conducting their daily work in     accordance with policies and procedures. It is the     responsibility of each associate to protect the Corporation and     defend the interests of the shareholders.       Governance and control functions are comprised of Global Risk     Management and the enterprise control functions. Global Risk     Management is led by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). The CRO leads     senior management in managing risk, is independent from the     Corporations lines of business and enterprise control     functions, and maintains sufficient autonomy to develop and     implement meaningful risk management measures. This position     serves to protect the Corporation and its shareholders. The CRO     reports to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and is the     management team lead or a participant in Board-level risk     governance committees. The CRO has the mandate to ensure that     appropriate risk management practices are in place, effective     and consistent with our overall business strategy and risk     appetite. Global Risk Management is comprised of two types of     risk teams, Enterprise Risk Teams and independent line of     business risk teams, which report to the CRO and are independent     from the lines of business and enterprise control functions.       Enterprise Risk Teams are responsible for setting and     establishing enterprise policies, programs and standards,     assessing program adherence, providing enterprise-level risk     oversight, and reporting and monitoring for systemic and     emerging risk issues. In addition, the Enterprise Risk Teams are     responsible for monitoring and ensuring that risk limits are     reasonable and consistent with the risk appetite. These risk     teams also carry out risk-based oversight of the enterprise     control functions.       Independent line of business risk teams are responsible for     establishing policies, limits, standards, controls, metrics and     thresholds within the defined corporate standards for the lines     of business to which they are aligned. The independent line of     business risk teams are responsible for ensuring that risk     limits and standards are reasonable and consistent with the risk     appetite.       Enterprise control functions are independent of the lines of     business and have risk governance and control responsibilities     for enterprise programs. In this role, they are responsible for     setting policies, standards and limits; providing risk     reporting; monitoring for systemic risk issues including     existing, emerging and reputational; and implementing procedures     and controls at the enterprise and line of business levels for     their respective control functions. Enterprise control functions     consist of the Chief Financial Officer group, Global              60     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           Technology and Operations, Global Human Resources, Global     Marketing and Corporate Affairs, and Legal.       The Corporate Audit function and the Corporate General Auditor     maintain independence from the lines of business and governance     and control functions by reporting directly to the Audit     Committee of the Board. Corporate Audit provides independent     assessment and validation through testing of key processes and     controls across the Corporation. Corporate Audit provides an     independent assessment of the Corporations management and     internal control systems. Corporate Audit activities are     designed to provide reasonable assurance that resources are     adequately protected; significant financial, managerial and     operating information is materially complete, accurate and     reliable; and employees actions are in compliance with the     Corporations policies, standards, procedures, and     applicable laws and regulations.       To ensure that the Corporations goals and objectives, risk     appetite, and business and risk strategies are achieved, we     utilize a risk management process that is applied across the     execution of all business activities. This risk management     process, which is an integral part of our Risk Framework,     enables the Corporation to review risk in an integrated and     comprehensive manner across all risk categories and make     strategic and business decisions based on that comprehensive     view. Corporate goals and objectives and our risk appetite are     established by management, approved by the Board, and are key     drivers to setting business and risk strategy.       One of the key tools of the risk management process is the use     of Risk and Control Self Assessments (RCSAs). RCSAs are the     primary method for facilitating the management of Business     Environment and Internal Control Factor (BEICF) data. The     end-to-end     RCSA process incorporates risk identification and assessment of     the control environment; monitoring, reporting and escalating     risk; quality assurance and data validation; and integration     with the risk appetite. The RCSA process also incorporates     documentation by either the line of business or enterprise     control function of the business environment, risks, controls,     and monitoring and reporting. This results in a comprehensive     risk management view that enables understanding of and action on     operational risks and controls for all of our processes,     products, activities and systems.       The formal processes used to manage risk represent a part of our     overall risk management process. Corporate culture and the     actions of our associates           are also critical to effective risk management. Through our Code     of Ethics, we set a high standard for our associates. The Code     of Ethics provides a framework for all of our associates to     conduct themselves with the highest integrity in the delivery of     our products or services to our customers. We instill a strong     and comprehensive risk management culture through     communications, training, policies, procedures, and     organizational roles and responsibilities. Additionally, we     continue to strengthen the link between the associate     performance management process and individual compensation to     encourage associates to work toward enterprise-wide risk goals.     Board Oversight     of Risk       We maintain a governance structure that delineates the     responsibilities for risk management activities, as well as     governance and oversight of those activities, by management and     the Board. The majority of our directors, including the Chairman     of the Board, are considered independent and meet the     requirements of our Director Independence Categorical Standards     and the criteria for independence in the listing standards of     the New York Stock Exchange. Also, all members of the Audit and     Enterprise Risk Committees are independent and all members of     the Credit Committee are non-management directors.       The Board is responsible for the oversight of the management of     the Corporation. As part of its oversight, the Board oversees     the management of the various types of risk faced by the     Corporation. Our corporate risk management governance structure     is designed to align the interests of the Board and management     with those of our stockholders and to foster integrity     throughout the Corporation.       The Board, under the leadership of its independent Chairman,     oversees the management of the Corporation through the     governance structure, which includes Board committees and     management committees. The Board maintains standing committees     to oversee risk. The committees with the majority of risk     oversight responsibilities include the Credit, Enterprise Risk     and Audit Committees.           Bank of America     2010     61     Table of Contents        The figure below illustrates the inter-relationship between the     Board, Board level committees and management level committees     with the majority of risk oversight responsibilities for the     Corporation.        (1) Compliance      Risk activities, including Ethics Oversight, are required to be     reviewed by the Audit Committee and Operational Risk activities     are required to be reviewed by the Enterprise Risk Committee.   (2) The      Disclosure Committee assists the CEO and CFO in fulfilling their     responsibility for the accuracy and timeliness of the     Corporations disclosures and reports the results of the     process to the Audit Committee.            The Credit Committee is responsible for oversight of senior     managements identification and management of the     Corporations credit exposures on an enterprise-wide basis,     as well as the Corporations responses to trends affecting     those exposures. The Credit Committee is also responsible for     oversight of senior managements actions relating to the     adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and the     Corporations credit-related policies.       The Enterprise Risk Committee is responsible for exercising     oversight of senior managements responsibility to identify     the material risks facing the Corporation and oversight of     senior managements planning for and management of the     Corporations material risks, including market risk,     interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and     reputational risk. The Enterprise Risk Committee also oversees     senior managements establishment of policies and     guidelines articulating the Corporations risk tolerances     for material categories of risk, the performance and functioning     of the Corporations overall risk management function, and     senior managements establishment of appropriate systems     that support control of market risk, interest rate risk and     liquidity risk.       The Audit Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in     overseeing the integrity of the Corporations Consolidated     Financial Statements and the effectiveness of the     Corporations system of internal controls and policies and     procedures for managing and assessing risk, including compliance     with legal and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee also     provides approval and direct oversight of the independent     registered public accounting firm, including such firms     assessment of managements assertion of the effectiveness     of the Corporations disclosure controls and procedures and           the Corporations internal control over financial     reporting; and oversight of such accountants appointment,     compensation, qualifications and independence. The Audit     Committee also oversees the corporate audit function.       The Credit, Enterprise Risk and Audit Committees provide     enterprise-wide oversight of the Corporations management     and handling of risk. Each of these three committees reports     regularly to the Board on risk-related matters within its     responsibilities and together they provide the Board with     integrated, thorough insight about our management of strategic,     credit, market, liquidity, compliance, legal, operational and     reputational risks. At meetings of each Board committee and our     Board, directors receive updates from management regarding all     aspects of enterprise risk management, including our performance     against our identified risk appetite.       Executive management develops for Board approval the     Corporations Risk Framework, Risk Appetite Statement, and     strategic and financial operating plans. Management and the     Board, through the Credit, Enterprise Risk and Audit Committees,     monitor financial performance, execution of the strategic and     financial operating plans, compliance with the risk appetite,     and the adequacy of internal controls.      Strategic     Risk Management        Strategic risk is embedded in every line of business and is one     of the major risk categories along with credit, market,     liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. It is     the risk that results from adverse business decisions,              62     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           ineffective or inappropriate business plans, or failure to     respond to changes in the competitive environment, business     cycles, customer preferences, product obsolescence, regulatory     environment, business strategy execution     and/or other     inherent risks of the business including reputational risk. In     the financial services industry, strategic risk is high due to     changing customer, competitive and regulatory environments. Our     appetite for strategic risk is assessed within the context of     the strategic plan, with strategic risks selectively and     carefully considered in the context of the evolving marketplace.     Strategic risk is managed in the context of our overall     financial condition and assessed, managed and acted on by the     Chief Executive Officer and executive management team.     Significant strategic actions, such as material acquisitions or     capital actions, are reviewed and approved by the Board.       Executive management and the Board approve a strategic plan     every two to three years. Annually, executive management     develops a financial operating plan and the Board reviews and     approves the plan. With oversight by the Board, executive     management ensures that the plans are consistent with the     Corporations strategic plan, core operating tenets and     risk appetite. The following are assessed in their reviews:     forecasted earnings and returns on capital, the current risk     profile, current capital and liquidity requirements, staffing     levels and changes required to support the plan, stress testing     results, and other qualitative factors such as market growth     rates and peer analysis. With oversight by the Board, executive     management performs similar analyses throughout the year, and     defines changes to the financial forecast or the risk, capital     or liquidity positions as deemed appropriate to balance and     optimize between achieving the targeted risk appetite and     shareholder returns and maintaining the targeted financial     strength.       We use proprietary models to measure the capital requirements     for credit, country, market, operational and strategic risks.     The economic capital assigned to each line of business is based     on its unique risk exposures. With oversight by the Board,     executive management assesses the risk-adjusted returns of each     business in approving strategic and financial operating plans.     The businesses use economic capital to define business     strategies, price products and transactions, and evaluate client     profitability.      Capital     Management        Bank of America manages its capital position to maintain a     strong and flexible financial position in order to perform     through economic cycles, take advantage of organic growth     opportunities, maintain ready access to financial markets,     remain a source of financial strength for its subsidiaries, and     return capital to its shareholders as appropriate.       To determine the appropriate level of capital, we assess the     results of our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process     (ICAAP), the current economic and market environment, and     feedback from investors, ratings agencies and regulators. Based     upon this analysis we set capital guidelines for Tier 1     common capital and Tier 1 capital to ensure we can maintain     an adequate capital position in a severe adverse economic     scenario. We also target to maintain capital in excess of the     capital required per our economic capital measurement process     (see Economic Capital on page 66). Management and the Board     annually approve a comprehensive Capital Plan which documents     the ICAAP and related results, analysis and support for the     capital guidelines, and planned capital actions and capital     adequacy assessment.       The ICAAP incorporates capital forecasts, stress test results,     economic capital, qualitative risk assessments and assessment of     regulatory changes. We generate monthly regulatory capital and     economic capital forecasts that are aligned to the most recent     earnings, balance sheet and risk forecasts. We utilize quarterly     stress tests to assess the potential impacts to earnings,     capital and liquidity for a variety of economic stress     scenarios. We perform qualitative risk assessments to identify     and assess material risks not fully captured in the forecasts,     stress tests or economic capital. Given the significant proposed     regulatory capital changes, we also regularly assess the     potential capital           impacts and monitor associated mitigation actions. Management     continuously assesses ICAAP results and provides documented     quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the capital guidelines     and capital position to the Board.       Capital management is integrated into the risk and governance     processes, as capital is a key consideration in development of     the strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits. Economic     capital is allocated to each business unit and used to perform     risk-adjusted return analysis at the business unit, client     relationship and transaction level.     Regulatory     Capital       As a financial services holding company, we are subject to the     risk-based capital guidelines (Basel I) issued by the     Federal Reserve. At December 31, 2010, we operated banking     activities primarily under two charters: Bank of America, N.A.     and FIA Card Services, N.A. which are subject to the risk-based     capital guidelines issued by the Office of the Comptroller of     the Currency (OCC). Under these guidelines, the Corporation and     its affiliated banking entities measure capital adequacy based     on Tier 1 common capital, Tier 1 capital and Total     capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital). Capital ratios     are calculated by dividing each capital amount by risk-weighted     assets. Additionally, Tier 1 capital is divided by adjusted     quarterly average total assets to derive the Tier 1     leverage ratio.       Tier 1 capital is calculated as the sum of core     capital elements. The predominate components of core     capital elements are qualifying common stockholders     equity, any CES and qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred     stock. Also included in Tier 1 capital are qualifying trust     preferred capital debt securities (Trust Securities),     hybrid securities and qualifying non-controlling interest in     subsidiaries which are subject to the rules governing     restricted core capital elements. Goodwill, other     disallowed intangible assets, disallowed deferred tax assets and     the cumulative changes in fair value of all financial     liabilities accounted for under a fair value option that are     included in retained earnings and are attributable to changes in     the companys own creditworthiness are deducted from the     sum of the core capital elements. Total capital is Tier 1     plus supplementary Tier 2 capital elements such as     qualifying subordinated debt, a limited portion of the allowance     for loan and lease losses, and a portion of net unrealized gains     on AFS marketable equity securities. Tier 1 common capital     is not an official regulatory ratio, but was introduced by the     Federal Reserve during the Supervisory Capital Assessment     Program in 2009. Tier 1 common capital is Tier 1     capital less preferred stock, Trust Securities, hybrid     securities and qualifying non-controlling interest in     subsidiaries.       Risk-weighted assets are calculated for credit risk for all on-     and off-balance sheet credit exposures and for market risk on     trading assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures.     Credit risk risk-weighted assets are calculated by assigning a     prescribed risk-weight to all on-balance sheet assets and to the     credit equivalent amount of certain off-balance sheet exposures.     The risk-weight is defined in the regulatory rules based upon     the obligor or guarantor type and collateral if applicable.     Off-balance sheet exposures include financial guarantees,     unfunded lending commitments, letters of credit and derivatives.     Market risk risk-weighted assets are calculated using risk     models for the trading account positions, including all foreign     exchange and commodity positions regardless of the applicable     accounting guidance. Under Basel I there are no risk-weighted     assets calculated for operational risk. Any assets that are a     direct deduction from the computation of capital are excluded     from risk-weighted assets and adjusted average total assets     consistent with regulatory guidance.       For additional information on these and other regulatory     requirements, see Note 18  Regulatory     Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial     Statements.     Capital     Composition and Ratios       On January 21, 2010, the joint agencies issued a final rule     regarding the impact of the new consolidation guidance on     risk-based capital. The incremental impact on January 1,     2010 was an increase in assets of $100.4 billion and     risk-weighted assets of $21.3 billion and a reduction in     Tier 1 common              Bank of America     2010     63     Table of Contents           capital and Tier 1 capital of $9.7 billion. The     overall effect of the new consolidation guidance and the final     rule was a decrease in Tier 1 capital and Tier 1     common capital ratios of 76 bps and 73 bps on     January 1, 2010.       We continued to strengthen capital in 2010 as evidenced by the     $4.7 billion growth in Tier 1 common capital or     $14.4 billion before the impact of the new consolidation     guidance. The increase was driven by the $10.2 billion in     earnings generated in 2010, excluding the goodwill impairment     charges of $12.4 billion. Tier 1 capital and Total     capital grew by $3.2 billion and $3.5 billion in 2010     or by $13.0 billion and $12.9 billion when adjusted     for the impact of the new consolidation guidance.       Risk-weighted assets declined by $87 billion in 2010     including the impact of the new consolidation guidance. The     risk-weighted asset reduction is consistent with our continued     efforts to reduce non-core assets and legacy loan portfolios.       As a result of the increased capital position and reduced     risk-weighted assets, the Tier 1 common capital ratio     increased 79 bps to 8.60 percent, the Tier 1     capital ratio increased 84 bps to 11.24 percent and     Total capital increased 111 bps to 15.77 percent in     2010. When adjusted for the impacts of the new consolidation     guidance, the growth in the ratios was more significant.             The Tier 1 leverage ratio increased 33 bps to     7.21 percent, reflecting both the strengthening of the     capital position previously mentioned and a $62 billion     reduction in adjusted quarterly average total assets including     the impact of the new consolidation guidance.       The $12.4 billion goodwill impairment charges recognized     during 2010 did not impact the regulatory capital ratios.       The table below presents the Corporations capital ratios     and related information at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Regulatory     Capital Changes       In June 2004, the Basel II Accord was published by the     Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee)     with the intent of more closely aligning regulatory capital     requirements with underlying risks, similar to economic capital.     While economic capital is measured to cover unexpected losses,     we also manage regulatory capital to adhere to regulatory     standards of capital adequacy.       The Basel II Final Rule (Basel II) which was published     in December 2007 established requirements for     U.S. implementation of the Basel Committees     Basel II Accord and provides detailed requirements for a     new regulatory capital framework. This regulatory capital     framework includes requirements related to credit and     operational risk (Pillar 1), supervisory requirements           (Pillar 2) and disclosure requirements (Pillar 3). We     began the Basel II parallel qualification period on     April 1, 2010.       Designated U.S. financial institutions are required to     complete a minimum parallel qualification period under     Basel II of four consecutive successful quarters before     receiving regulatory approval to report regulatory capital using     the Basel II methodology and exiting the parallel period.     During the parallel period, the resulting capital calculations     under both the current risk-based capital rules (Basel     I) and Basel II will be reported to the financial     institutions regulatory supervisors. Once the parallel     period is successfully completed and we have received approval     to exit parallel, we will transition to Basel II as the     methodology for calculating regulatory capital. Basel II     provides for a three-year transitional floor subsequent to     exiting parallel, after which Basel I may be discontinued. The     Collins Amendment within the Financial              64     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           Reform Act and the U.S. banking regulators subsequent     Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published by the Federal Reserve     on December 14, 2010 propose however that the current     three-year transitional floors under Basel II be replaced     with a permanent risk based capital floor as defined under Basel     I.       On December 16, 2010, U.S. regulators issued a Notice     of Proposed Rulemaking on the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines for     Market Risk (Market Risk Rules), reflecting partial adoption of     the Basel Committees July 2009 consultative document on     the topic. We anticipate U.S. regulators will adopt the     Market Risk Rules in mid-2011. This change is expected to     significantly increase the capital requirements for our trading     assets and liabilities, including derivatives exposures which     meet the definition established by the regulatory agencies. We     continue to evaluate the capital impact of the proposed rules     and currently anticipate being fully compliant with any final     rules by the projected implementation date of year-end 2011.       On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee issued     Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more     resilient banks and banking systems (Basel III), proposing     a January 2013 implementation date for Basel III. If implemented     by U.S. regulators as proposed, Basel III could     significantly increase our capital requirements. Basel III     and the Financial Reform Act propose the disqualification of     trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital, with the     Financial Reform Act proposing the disqualification be phased in     from 2013 to 2015. Basel III also proposes the deduction of     certain assets from capital (deferred tax assets, MSRs,     investments in financial firms and pension assets, among others,     within prescribed limitations), the inclusion of other     comprehensive income in capital, increased capital for     counterparty credit risk, and new minimum capital and buffer     requirements. The phase-in period for the capital deductions is     proposed to occur in 20 percent increments from 2014     through 2018 with full implementation by December 31, 2018.     The increase in capital requirements for counterparty credit     risk is proposed to be effective January 2013. The phase-in     period for the new minimum capital requirements and related     buffers is proposed to occur between 2013 and 2019.     U.S. regulators are expected to begin the final rulemaking     processes for Basel III in early 2011 and have indicated a     goal to adopt final rules by year-end 2011 or early 2012. For     additional information on our MSRs, refer to     Note 25  Mortgage Servicing Rights to the     Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on     deferred tax assets, refer to Note 21  Income     Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       If Basel III is implemented in the U.S. consistent     with Basel Committee rules, beginning in January 2013, we would     be required to maintain minimum capital ratio requirements of     6.0 percent for Tier 1 capital and 8.0 percent     for Total capital. Basel III also includes a proposed     minimum requirement for common equity Tier 1 capital of     3.5 percent beginning in 2013 which would             increase to 4.5 percent in 2015. Basel III also     includes three capital buffers which would be phased in over     time and impact all three capital ratios. These buffers include     a capital conservation buffer that would start at     0.63 percent in 2016 and increase to 2.5 percent in     2019. Thus, the minimum capital ratio requirements including the     capital conservation buffer in 2019 would be 7.0 percent     for common equity Tier 1 capital, 8.5 percent for     Tier 1 capital and 10.5 percent for Total capital. If     ratios fall below the minimum requirement plus the capital     conservation buffer, such as 10.5 percent for Total     capital, an institution would be required to restrict dividends,     share repurchases and discretionary bonuses. Additionally,     Basel III also includes a countercyclical buffer of up to     2.5 percent that regulators could require in periods of     excess credit growth. The countercyclical buffer is to be     comprised of loss-absorbing capital, such as common equity, and     is meant to retain additional capital during periods of excess     credit growth providing incremental protection in the event of a     material market downturn. The ratios presented above do not     include the third buffer requirement for systemically important     financial institutions, which the Basel Committee continues to     assess and has not yet quantified. The countercyclical and     systemic buffers are scheduled to be phased in from 2013 through     2019. U.S. regulators are expected to begin the rulemaking     processes for Basel III in early 2011 and have indicated a     goal to adopt final rules by the end of 2011 or early 2012.       These regulatory changes also require approval by the agencies     of analytical models used as part of our capital measurement and     assessment, especially in the case of more complex models. If     these more complex models are not approved, it could require     financial institutions to hold additional capital, which in some     cases could be significant.       We expect to maintain a Tier 1 common capital ratio in     excess of eight percent as the regulatory rule changes are     implemented without needing to raise new equity capital. We have     made the implementation and mitigation of these regulatory     changes a strategic priority. We also note there remains     significant uncertainty on the final impacts as the     U.S. has issued final rules only for Basel II and a     Notice of Proposal Rulemaking for the Market Risk Rules at this     time. Impacts may change as the U.S. finalizes rules and     the regulatory agencies interpret the final rules for Basel III     during the implementation process.

Tier 1 and Total capital ratio     increased 48 bps to 10.78 percent and 50 bps to     14.26 percent at December 31, 2010 compared to     December 31, 2009. The increase in the ratios was driven by     $11.1 billion           in earnings generated in 2010 combined with a $26.4 billion     decline in risk-weighted assets. The Tier 1 leverage ratio     increased 45 bps to 7.83 percent benefiting from the     improvement in Tier 1 capital combined with a     $56.0 billion              Bank of America     2010     65     Table of Contents           decrease in adjusted quarterly average total assets. The     reduction in risk-weighted assets and adjusted quarterly average     total assets is consistent with our continued efforts to reduce     non-core assets and legacy loan portfolios.       The FIA Card Services, N.A. Tier 1 capital ratio increased     9 bps to 15.30 percent and Total capital ratio     decreased 7 bps to 16.94 percent compared to     December 31, 2009. The increase in Tier 1 capital     ratio was due to a decrease in risk-weighted assets of     $22.3 billion. The decrease in the Total capital ratio was     due to a reduction in Tier 2 capital resulting from a     $390 million decrease in qualifying term subordinated debt     combined with a net increase in the allowance for credit losses     limitation of $269 million. The Tier 1 leverage ratio     decreased to 13.21 percent at December 31, 2010 from     23.09 percent at December 31, 2009 due to a     $68.9 billion increase in adjusted quarterly average total     assets. The increase in adjusted quarterly average total assets     was the result of the adoption of new consolidation guidance.     Broker/Dealer     Regulatory Capital       Bank of Americas principal U.S. broker/dealer     subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith     (MLPF&S) and Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp     (MLPCC). MLPCC is a subsidiary of MLPF&S and provides     clearing and settlement services. Both entities are subject to     the net capital requirements of SEC     Rule 15c3-1.     Both entities are also registered as futures commission     merchants and subject to the Commodity Futures Trading     Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17.       MLPF&S has elected to compute the minimum capital     requirement in accordance with the Alternative Net Capital     Requirement as permitted by SEC     Rule 15c3-1.     At December 31, 2010, MLPF&Ss regulatory net     capital as defined by     Rule 15c3-1     was $9.8 billion and exceeded the minimum requirement of     $736 million by $9.1 billion. MLPCCs net capital     of $2.3 billion exceeded the minimum requirement by     $2.1 billion.       In accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirements,     MLPF&S is required to maintain tentative net capital in     excess of $1 billion and notify the SEC in the event its     tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. At     December 31, 2010, MLPF&S had tentative net capital in     excess of the minimum and notification requirements.     Economic     Capital       Our economic capital measurement process provides a risk-based     measurement of the capital required for unexpected credit,     market and operational losses over a one-year time horizon at a     99.97 percent confidence level, consistent with a     AA credit rating. Economic capital is allocated to     each business unit based upon its risk positions and     contribution to enterprise risk, and is used for capital     adequacy, performance measurement and risk management purposes.     The strategic planning process utilizes economic capital with     the goal of allocating risk appropriately and measuring returns     consistently across all businesses and activities.     Credit Risk     Capital       Economic capital for credit risk captures two types of risks:     default risk, which represents the loss of principal due to     outright default or the borrowers inability to repay an     obligation in full, and migration risk, which represents     potential loss in market value due to credit deterioration over     the one-year capital time horizon. Credit risk is assessed and     modeled for all on- and off-balance sheet credit exposures     within     sub-categories     for commercial, retail, counterparty and investment securities.     The economic capital methodology captures dimensions such as     concentration and country risk and originated securitizations.     The economic capital methodology is based on the probability             of default, loss given default, exposure at default and maturity     for each credit exposure, and the portfolio correlations across     exposures. See page 71 for more information on Credit Risk     Management.     Market Risk     Capital       Market risk reflects the potential loss in the value of     financial instruments or portfolios due to movements in foreign     exchange and interest rates, credit spreads, and security and     commodity prices. Bank of Americas primary market risk     exposures are in its trading portfolio, equity investments, MSRs     and the interest rate exposure of its core balance sheet.     Economic capital is determined by utilizing the same models the     Corporation used to manage these risks including, for example,     Value-at-Risk, simulation, stress testing and scenario analysis.     See page 100 for additional information on Market Risk     Management.     Operational Risk     Capital       We calculate operational risk capital at the business unit level     using actuarial-based models and historical loss data. We     supplement the calculations with scenario analysis and risk     control assessments. See Operational Risk Management beginning     on page 106 for more information.     Capital     Actions       The Corporation held a special meeting of stockholders on     February 23, 2010 at which we obtained stockholder approval     of an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of     incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our     common stock from 10.0 billion to 11.3 billion. On     February 24, 2010, approximately 1.3 billion shares of     common stock were issued through the conversion of CES into     common stock. For more information regarding this conversion,     see Preferred Stock Issuances and Exchanges on page 67.       In January 2009, we issued approximately 1.4 billion shares     of common stock in connection with the acquisition of Merrill     Lynch. For additional information regarding the Merrill Lynch     acquisition, see Note 2  Merger and     Restructuring Activity to the Consolidated Financial     Statements. In addition, in 2009, we issued warrants to purchase     approximately 199.1 million shares of common stock in     connection with preferred stock issuances to the     U.S. government. For more information, see Preferred Stock     Issuances and Exchanges on page 67. In 2009, we issued     1.3 billion shares of common stock at an average price of     $10.77 per share through an     at-the-market     issuance program resulting in gross proceeds of approximately     $13.5 billion. In addition, during 2010 and 2009, we issued     approximately 98.6 million and 7.4 million shares     under employee stock plans.     Troubled Asset     Relief Program  Related Asset Sales       We received notification from the Federal Reserve confirming     that we fulfilled our commitment to increase equity by     $3.0 billion through asset sales to be completed by     December 31, 2010. The commitment was made in connection     with the approval we received in December 2009 to repurchase the     preferred stock that we issued as a result of our participation     in the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).       There were no common shares repurchased in 2010 except for     shares acquired under equity incentive plans, as discussed in     Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related     Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities of     this     Form 10-K.     Currently, there is no existing Board authorized share     repurchase program. For more information regarding our common     share issuances, see Note 15      Shareholders Equity to the Consolidated Financial     Statements.       We currently intend to modestly increase the common stock     dividends in the second half of 2011 subject to approval by the     Federal Reserve.           66     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents         Common Stock     Dividends       The table below is a summary of our declared quarterly cash     dividends on common stock during 2010 and through     February 25, 2011.

In addition, we     also entered into agreements with certain holders of other     non-government perpetual preferred shares to exchange their     holdings of approximately $10.9 billion aggregate     liquidation preference of perpetual preferred stock into     approximately 800 million shares of common stock. In total,     the exchange offer and these privately negotiated exchanges     covered the exchange of $14.8 billion aggregate liquidation     preference of perpetual preferred stock into 1.0 billion     shares of common stock. In 2009, we recorded an increase to     retained earnings and net income applicable to common     shareholders of $576 million related to these exchanges.     This represents the net of a $2.6 billion benefit due to     the excess of the carrying value of our non-convertible     preferred stock over the fair value of the common stock     exchanged. This was partially offset by a $2.0 billion     inducement to convertible preferred shareholders representing     the excess of the fair value of the common stock exchanged,     which was accounted for as an induced conversion of convertible     preferred stock, over the fair value of the common stock that     would have been issued under the original conversion terms.       On December 2, 2009, we received approval from the     U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve to repay the     U.S. governments $45.0 billion preferred stock     investment provided under TARP. In accordance with the approval,     on December 9, 2009, we repurchased all outstanding shares     of Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock Series N,     Series Q and Series R issued to the U.S. Treasury     as part of the TARP. While participating in the TARP we recorded     $7.4 billion in dividends and accretion on the TARP     Preferred Stock and repayment saved us approximately     $3.6 billion in annual dividends and accretion. We did not     repurchase the related common stock warrants issued to the     U.S. Treasury in connection with its TARP investment. The     U.S. Treasury auctioned these warrants in March 2010. For     more detail on the TARP Preferred Stock, refer to     Note 15  Shareholders Equity to the     Consolidated Financial Statements.       We repurchased the TARP Preferred Stock through the use of     $25.7 billion in excess liquidity and $19.3 billion in     proceeds from the sale of 1.3 billion units of CES valued     at $15.00 per unit. The CES consisted of depositary shares     representing interests in shares of Common Equivalent Junior     Preferred Stock Series S (Common Equivalent Stock) and     warrants (Contingent Warrants) to purchase an aggregate     60 million shares of the Corporations common stock.     Each depositary share represented a     1/1,000th      interest in a share of Common Equivalent Stock and each     Contingent Warrant granted the holder the right to purchase     0.0467 of a share of a common stock for $0.01 per share. Each     depositary share entitled the holder, through the depository, to     a proportional fractional interest in all rights and preferences     of the Common Equivalent Stock, including conversion, dividend,     liquidation and voting rights.       The Corporation held a special meeting of stockholders on     February 23, 2010 at which we obtained stockholder approval     of an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of     incorporation to increase the number of           authorized shares of our common stock. Following effectiveness     of the amendment, on February 24, 2010, the Common     Equivalent Stock converted in full into our common stock and the     Contingent Warrants automatically expired without becoming     exercisable, and the CES ceased to exist.       On October 15, 2010, all of the outstanding shares of the     mandatory convertible Preferred Stock, Series 2 and     Series 3, of Merrill Lynch automatically converted into an     aggregate of 50 million shares of the Corporations     Common Stock in accordance with the terms of these preferred     securities.       For more information on cash dividends declared on preferred     stock, see Table III.     Enterprise-wide     Stress Testing       As a part of our core risk management practices, we conduct     enterprise-wide stress tests on a periodic basis to better     understand earnings, capital and liquidity sensitivities to     certain economic and business scenarios, including economic and     market conditions that are more severe than anticipated. These     enterprise-wide stress tests provide an understanding of the     potential impacts from our risk profile to earnings, capital and     liquidity, and serve as a key component of our capital     management practices. Scenarios are selected by a group     comprised of senior line of business, risk and finance     executives. Impacts to each line of business from each scenario     are then determined and analyzed, primarily leveraging the     models and processes utilized in everyday management routines.     Impacts are assessed along with potential mitigating actions     that may be taken. Analysis from such stress scenarios is     compiled for and reviewed through our Risk Oversight Committee     (ROC), Asset Liability Market Risk Committee (ALMRC) and the     Boards Enterprise Risk Committee, and serves to inform and     be incorporated, along with other core business processes, into     decision-making by management and the Board. We have made     substantial investments to establish stress testing capabilities     as a core business process.      Liquidity     Risk      Funding and     Liquidity Risk Management       We define liquidity risk as the potential inability to meet our     contractual and contingent financial obligations, on- or     off-balance sheet, as they come due. Our primary liquidity     objective is to ensure adequate funding for our businesses     throughout market cycles, including periods of financial stress.     To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity     risk, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding     sources including our stable deposit base. We define excess     liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and     high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to     meet our funding requirements as those obligations arise.       Global funding and liquidity risk management activities are     centralized within Corporate Treasury. We believe that a     centralized approach to funding and liquidity risk management     enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements,     maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs     and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events.       The Enterprise Risk Committee approves the Corporations     liquidity policy and contingency funding plan, including     establishing liquidity risk tolerance levels. The ALMRC, in     conjunction with the Board and its committees, monitors our     liquidity position and reviews the impact of strategic decisions     on our liquidity. ALMRC is responsible for managing liquidity     risks and ensuring exposures remain within the established     tolerance levels. ALMRC delegates additional oversight     responsibilities to the ROC, which reports to ALMRC. The ROC     reviews and monitors our liquidity position, cash flow     forecasts, stress testing scenarios and results, and implements     our liquidity limits and guidelines. For more information, refer     to Board Oversight of Risk beginning on page 61.       Under this governance framework, we have developed certain     funding and liquidity risk management practices which include:     maintaining excess              Bank of America     2010     67     Table of Contents           liquidity at the parent company and selected subsidiaries,     including our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries; determining     what amounts of excess liquidity are appropriate for these     entities based on analysis of debt maturities and other     potential cash outflows, including those that we may experience     during stressed market conditions; diversifying funding sources,     considering our asset profile and legal entity structure; and     performing contingency planning.     Global Excess     Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets       We maintain excess liquidity available to the parent company and     selected subsidiaries in the form of cash and high-quality,     liquid, unencumbered securities. These assets serve as our     primary means of liquidity risk mitigation and we call these     assets our Global Excess Liquidity Sources. Our cash     is primarily on deposit with central banks, such as the Federal     Reserve. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid,     unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities,     U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select     group of     non-U.S. government     securities. We believe we can quickly obtain cash for these     securities, even in stressed market conditions, through     repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our Global     Excess Liquidity Sources in entities that allow us to meet the     liquidity requirements of our global businesses and we consider     the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other     restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among     entities.       Our global excess liquidity sources increased $122 billion     to $336 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to     $214 billion at December 31, 2009 and were maintained     as presented in the table below. This increase was due primarily     to liquidity generated by our bank subsidiaries through deposit     growth, loan repayments combined with lower loan demand and     other factors.        Table     16 Global     Excess Liquidity Sources                                                         December 31         (Dollars in billions)                2010                   2009               Parent company            $   121                   $       99              Bank subsidiaries                180                       89              Broker/dealers                35                       26                                                        Total global excess liquidity     sources            $   336                   $       214                       As noted above, the excess liquidity available to the parent     company is held in cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered     securities and totaled $121 billion and $99 billion at     December 31, 2010 and 2009. Typically, parent company cash     is deposited overnight with Bank of America, N.A.       Our bank subsidiaries excess liquidity sources at     December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $180 billion and     $89 billion. These amounts are distinct from the cash     deposited by the parent company, as described above. In addition     to their excess liquidity sources, our bank subsidiaries hold     significant amounts of other unencumbered securities that we     believe could also be used to generate liquidity, such as     investment-grade ABS, MBS and municipal bonds. Another way our     bank subsidiaries can generate incremental liquidity is by     pledging a range of other unencumbered loans and securities to     certain Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve Discount     Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against     this pool of specifically identified eligible assets was     approximately $170 billion and $187 billion at     December 31, 2010 and 2009. We have established operational     procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets,     including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans     and securities collateral. Due to regulatory restrictions,     liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can only be used to     fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries and cannot be     transferred to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries.       Our broker/dealer subsidiaries excess liquidity sources at     December 31, 2010 and 2009 consisted of $35 billion     and $26 billion in cash and high-quality, liquid,     unencumbered securities. Our broker/dealers also held           significant amounts of other unencumbered securities we believe     could also be used to generate additional liquidity, including     investment-grade corporate securities and equities. Liquidity     held in a broker/dealer subsidiary is only available to meet the     obligations of that entity and cannot be transferred to the     parent company or to any other subsidiary, often due to     regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements.     Time to Required     Funding and Stress Modeling       We use a variety of metrics to determine the appropriate amounts     of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our     bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries. One metric we use to     evaluate the appropriate level of excess liquidity at the parent     company is Time to Required Funding. This debt     coverage measure indicates the number of months that the parent     company can continue to meet its unsecured contractual     obligations as they come due using only its Global Excess     Liquidity Sources without issuing any new debt or accessing any     additional liquidity sources. We define unsecured contractual     obligations for purposes of this metric as maturities of senior     or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by Bank of America     Corporation or Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., including     certain unsecured debt instruments, primarily structured notes,     which we may be required to settle for cash prior to maturity.     The ALMRC has established a target for Time to Required Funding     of 21 months. Time to Required Funding was 24 months     at December 31, 2010 compared to 25 months at     December 31, 2009.       We utilize liquidity stress models to assist us in determining     the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the     parent company and our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries.     These risk sensitive models have become increasingly important     in analyzing our potential contractual and contingent cash     outflows beyond those outflows considered in the Time to     Required Funding analysis.       We evaluate the liquidity requirements under a range of     scenarios with varying levels of severity and time horizons.     These scenarios incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific     events, including potential credit ratings downgrades for the     parent company and our subsidiaries. We consider and utilize     scenarios based on historical experience, regulatory guidance,     and both expected and unexpected future events.       The types of contractual and contingent cash outflows we     consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to:     upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions     in new debt issuance; diminished access to secured financing     markets; potential deposit withdrawals and reduced rollover of     maturing term deposits by customers; increased draws on loan     commitments and liquidity facilities; additional collateral that     counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded;     collateral, margin and subsidiary capital requirements arising     from losses; and potential liquidity required to maintain     businesses and finance customer activities.       We consider all sources of funds that we could access during     each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching     available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by     legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage     our asset-liability profile and establish limits and guidelines     on certain funding sources and businesses.     Basel III     Liquidity Standards       In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision issued     International framework for liquidity risk measurement,     standards and monitoring, which includes two measures of     liquidity risk. These two minimum liquidity measures were     initially introduced in guidance in December 2009 and are     considered part of Basel III.       The first liquidity measure is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio     (LCR) which identifies the amount of unencumbered, high quality     liquid assets a financial institution holds that can be used to     offset the net cash outflows the institution would encounter     under an acute     30-day     stress scenario. The second              68     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           liquidity measure is the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) which     measures the amount of longer-term, stable sources of funding     employed by a financial institution relative to the liquidity     profiles of the assets funded and the potential for contingent     calls on funding liquidity arising from off-balance sheet     commitments and obligations over a one-year period. The Basel     Committee expects the LCR to be implemented in January 2015 and     the NSFR in January 2018, following observation periods     beginning in 2012. We continue to monitor the development and     the potential impact of these evolving proposals and expect to     be able to meet the final requirements.     Diversified     Funding Sources       We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured     and unsecured liabilities through a globally coordinated funding     strategy. We diversify our funding globally across products,     programs, markets, currencies and investor bases.       We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through     our deposit base which was $1.0 trillion and $992 billion     at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Deposits are primarily     generated by our Deposits, Global Commercial Banking, GWIM     and GBAM segments. These deposits are diversified by     clients, product type and geography. Certain of our     U.S. deposits are insured by the FDIC. We consider a     substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and     consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is     generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market     volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale     funding sources.       Certain consumer lending activities, primarily in our banking     subsidiaries, may be funded through securitizations. Included in     these consumer lending activities are the extension of mortgage,     credit card, auto loans, home equity loans and lines of credit.     If securitization markets are not available to us on favorable     terms, we typically finance these loans with deposits or with     wholesale borrowings. For additional information on     securitizations, see Note 8  Securitizations     and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated     Financial Statements.       Our trading activities are primarily funded on a secured basis     through securities lending and repurchase agreements; these     amounts will vary based on customer activity and market     conditions. We believe funding these activities in the secured     financing markets is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to     changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing.     Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often     overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for     financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles     which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant     reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the     liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding     globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a     range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations,     when appropriate.       Unsecured debt, both short- and long-term, is also an important     source of funding. We may issue unsecured debt through     syndicated U.S. registered offerings, U.S. registered     and unregistered medium-term note programs,     non-U.S. medium-term     note programs,     non-U.S. private     placements, U.S. and     non-U.S. commercial     paper and through other methods. We distribute a significant     portion of our debt offerings through our retail and     institutional sales forces to a large, diversified global     investor base. Maintaining relationships with our investors is     an important aspect of our funding strategy. We may, from time     to time, purchase outstanding Bank of America Corporation debt     securities in various transactions, depending upon prevailing     market conditions, liquidity and other factors. In addition, we     may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide     liquidity for investors.       In addition, our parent company, bank and broker-dealer     subsidiaries regularly access short-term secured and unsecured     markets through federal funds purchased, commercial paper and     other short-term borrowings to           support customer activities, short-term financing requirements     and cash management.       At December 31, 2010, commercial paper and other short-term     borrowings included $6.7 billion of VIEs that were     consolidated in accordance with new consolidation guidance     effective January 1, 2010. For average and year-end balance     discussions, see Balance Sheet Overview beginning on     page 29. For more information, see     Note 12  Federal Funds Sold,     Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and     Short-term Borrowings to the Consolidated Financial     Statements.       We issue the majority of our long-term unsecured debt at the     parent company and Bank of America, N.A. During 2010, the parent     company and Bank of America, N.A. issued $28.8 billion and     $3.5 billion of long-term senior unsecured debt.       We issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and     currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an     appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of     unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market     conditions or by matters specific to the financial services     industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing     risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we     anticipate will mature within any month or quarter.       The primary benefits of our centralized funding strategy include     greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition     by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable     funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time     zone differences or other business considerations make parent     company funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may     issue their own debt.       At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our long-term debt was in     the currencies presented in the table below.      Table     17 Long-term     Debt By Major Currency                                                         December 31         (Dollars in millions)                2010                   2009               U.S. Dollar            $   302,487                   $       281,692              Euros                87,482                       99,917              Japanese Yen                19,901                       19,903              British Pound                16,505                       16,460              Australian Dollar                6,924                       7,973              Canadian Dollar                6,628                       4,894              Swiss Franc                3,069                       2,666              Other                5,435                       5,016                Total long-term debt            $   448,431                   $       438,521                       At December 31, 2010, the above table includes     $71.0 billion of primarily U.S. Dollar long-term debt     of VIEs that were consolidated in accordance with new     consolidation guidance effective January 1, 2010.       We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest     rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the     characteristics of the assets they are funding. For further     details on our ALM activities, refer to Interest Rate Risk     Management for Nontrading Activities beginning on page 103.       We also diversify our funding sources by issuing various types     of debt instruments including structured notes, which are debt     obligations that pay investors with returns linked to other debt     or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We     typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these     notes with derivative positions     and/or in     the underlying instruments so that from a funding perspective,     the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We     could be required to immediately settle certain structured note     obligations for cash or other securities under certain     circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning     purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings     will remain outstanding beyond the              Bank of America     2010     69     Table of Contents           earliest put or redemption date. We had outstanding structured     notes of $61.1 billion and $57.0 billion at     December 31, 2010 and 2009.       Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt     obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a     requirement for an early repayment, require additional     collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate     maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an     adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios,     earnings, cash flows or stock price.       We participated in the FDICs Temporary Liquidity Guarantee     Program (TLGP) which allowed us to issue senior unsecured debt     that the FDIC guaranteed in return for a fee based on the amount     and maturity of the debt. At December 31, 2010, we had     $27.5 billion outstanding under the program. We no longer     issue debt under this program and all of our debt issued under     TLGP will mature by June 30, 2012. Under this program, our     debt received the highest long-term ratings from the major     credit ratings agencies which resulted in a lower total cost of     issuance than if we had issued non-FDIC guaranteed long-term     debt. The associated FDIC fee for the 2009 issuances was     $554 million and is being amortized into expense over the     stated term of the debt.       For additional information on debt funding, see     Note 13  Long-term Debt to the     Consolidated Financial Statements.     Contingency     Planning       We maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potential     responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of     severity. These policies and plans are based on stress scenarios     and include potential funding strategies, and communication and     notification procedures that we would implement in the event we     experienced stressed liquidity conditions. We periodically     review and test the contingency funding plans to validate     efficacy and assess readiness.       Our U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding     through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain     non-U.S. subsidiaries     have access to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions in     which they operate. While we do not rely on these sources in our     liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and     governance processes that would enable us to access these     sources if necessary.     Credit     Ratings       Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly     impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may     be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in     certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain     transactions including OTC derivatives. Thus, it is our     objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings.       Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions on our creditworthiness     and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term     debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other     securities, including asset securitizations. Our credit ratings     are subject to ongoing review by the ratings agencies and thus     may change from time to time based on a number of factors,     including our own financial strength, performance, prospects and     operations as well as factors not under our control, such as     ratings agency-specific criteria or frameworks for our industry     or certain security types, which are subject to revision from     time to time, and conditions affecting the financial services     industry generally. In light of the recent difficulties in the     financial services industry and financial markets, there can be     no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings.       During 2009 and 2010, the ratings agencies took numerous     actions, many of which were negative, to adjust our credit     ratings and the outlooks for those ratings. Currently, Bank of     America Corporations long-term senior debt           and outlook expressed by the ratings agencies are as follows: A2     (negative) by Moodys Investors Services, Inc.     (Moodys), A (negative) by Standard and Poors Ratings     Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.     (S&P), and A+ (Rating Watch Negative) by Fitch, Inc.     (Fitch). Bank of America, N.A.s long-term debt and outlook     currently are as follows: A+ (negative), Aa3 (negative) and A+     (Rating Watch Negative) by those same three credit ratings     agencies, respectively. The ratings agencies have indicated     that, as a systemically important financial institution, our     credit ratings currently reflect their expectation that, if     necessary, we would receive significant support from the     U.S. government. All three ratings agencies, however, have     indicated they will reevaluate, and could reduce the uplift they     include in our ratings for government support for reasons     arising from financial services regulatory reform proposals or     legislation. In February 2010, S&P affirmed our current     credit ratings but revised the outlook to negative from stable     based on its belief that it is less certain whether the     U.S. government would be willing to provide extraordinary     support. On July 27, 2010, Moodys affirmed our     current ratings but revised the outlook to negative from stable     due to its expectation for lower levels of government support     over time as a result of the passage of the Financial Reform     Act. Also, on October 22, 2010, Fitch placed our credit     ratings on Rating Watch Negative from stable outlook due to     proposed rulemaking that could negatively impact its assessment     of future systemic government support. Other factors that     influence our credit ratings include changes to the ratings     agencies methodologies, the ratings agencies     assessment of the general operating environment, our relative     positions in the markets in which we compete, reputation,     liquidity position, diversity of funding sources, the level and     volatility of earnings, corporate governance and risk management     policies, capital position, capital management practices and     current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives.       A reduction in certain of our credit ratings or the ratings of     certain asset-backed securitizations would likely have a     material adverse effect on our liquidity, access to credit     markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and on     certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where     counterparty creditworthiness is critical. Under the terms of     certain OTC derivatives contracts and other trading agreements,     in the event of a credit ratings downgrade, the counterparties     to those agreements may require us to provide additional     collateral or to terminate these contracts or agreements. Such     collateral calls or terminations could cause us to sustain     losses, impair our liquidity, or both, by requiring us to     provide the counterparties with additional collateral in the     form of cash or highly liquid securities. If Bank of America     Corporations or Bank of America, N.A.s commercial     paper or short-term credit ratings (which currently have the     following ratings:     P-1 by     Moodys,     A-1 by     S&P and F1+ by Fitch) were downgraded by one or more     levels, the potential loss of short-term funding sources such as     commercial paper or repo financing and effect on our incremental     cost of funds would be material. For information regarding the     additional collateral and termination payments that would be     required in connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and     other trading agreements as a result of such a credit ratings     downgrade, see Note 4  Derivatives to the     Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors.       The credit ratings of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. from     the three major credit ratings agencies are the same as those of     Bank of America Corporation. The major credit ratings agencies     have indicated that the primary drivers of Merrill Lynchs     credit ratings are Bank of America Corporations credit     ratings.           70     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents          Credit     Risk Management        Credit quality continued to show improvement during 2010;     although, net charge-offs, and nonperforming loans, leases and     foreclosed properties remained elevated. Signs of economic     stability and our proactive credit risk management initiatives     positively impacted the credit portfolio as charge-offs and     delinquencies continued to improve across almost all portfolios     along with risk rating improvements in the commercial portfolio.     Global and national economic uncertainty, regulatory initiatives     and reform, however, continued to weigh on the credit portfolios     through December 31, 2010. For more information, see 2010     Economic and Business Environment on page 25. Credit     metrics were also impacted by loans added to the balance sheet     on January 1, 2010 in connection with the adoption of new     consolidation guidance.       Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability of a     borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. Credit risk     can also arise from operational failures that result in an     erroneous advance, commitment or investment of funds. We define     the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss     potential arising from all product classifications including     loans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets     held-for-sale     and unfunded lending commitments which include loan commitments,     letters of credit and financial guarantees. Derivative positions     are recorded at fair value and assets     held-for-sale     are recorded at fair value or the lower of cost or fair value.     Certain loans and unfunded commitments are accounted for under     the fair value option. Credit risk for these categories of     assets is not accounted for as part of the allowance for credit     losses but as part of the fair value adjustments recorded in     earnings. For derivative positions, our credit risk is measured     as the net replacement cost in the event the counterparties with     contracts in which we are in a gain position fail to perform     under the terms of those contracts. We use the current     mark-to-market     value to represent credit exposure without giving consideration     to future     mark-to-market     changes. The credit risk amounts take into consideration the     effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and     cash collateral. Our consumer and commercial credit extension     and review procedures take into account funded and unfunded     credit exposures. For additional information on derivative and     credit extension commitments, see Note 4      Derivatives and Note 14  Commitments and     Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower     or counterparty, repayment sources, the nature of underlying     collateral, and other support given current events, conditions     and expectations. We classify our portfolios as either consumer     or commercial and monitor credit risk in each as discussed below.       We proactively refine our underwriting and credit management     practices, as well as credit standards, to meet the changing     economic environment. To actively mitigate losses and enhance     customer support in our consumer businesses, we have expanded     collections, loan modification and customer assistance     infrastructures. We also have implemented a number of actions to     mitigate losses in the commercial businesses including     increasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring,     hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of     deteriorating commercial exposures to independent special asset     officers as credits approach criticized levels.       Since January 2008, and through 2010, Bank of America and     Countrywide have completed nearly 775,000 loan modifications     with customers. During 2010, we completed nearly 285,000     customer loan modifications with a total unpaid principal     balance of approximately $65.7 billion, which included     109,000 customers who converted from trial period to permanent     modifications under the governments MHA program. Of the     loan modifications           completed in 2010, in terms of both the volume of modifications     and the unpaid principal balance associated with the underlying     loans, most were in the portfolio serviced for investors and     were not on our balance sheet. The most common types of     modifications during the year include a combination of rate     reduction and capitalization of past due amounts which represent     68 percent of the volume of modifications completed in     2010, while principal forbearance represented 15 percent     and capitalization of past due amounts represented nine percent.     We also provide rate reductions, rate and payment extensions,     principal forgiveness and other actions. These modification     types are generally considered troubled debt restructurings     (TDRs). For more information on TDRs and portfolio impacts, see     Nonperforming Consumer Loans and Foreclosed Properties Activity     beginning on page 81 and Note 6      Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial     Statements.       On October 1, 2010, we voluntarily stopped taking     residential mortgage foreclosure proceedings to judgment in     judicial states. On October 8, 2010, we stopped foreclosure     sales in all states in order to complete an assessment of the     related business processes. As a result of that assessment, we     identified and began implementing process and control     enhancements and we intend to monitor ongoing quality results of     each process. After these enhancements were put in place, we     resumed foreclosure sales in most non-judicial states during the     fourth quarter of 2010, and expect sales to resume in the     remaining non-judicial states in the first quarter of 2011. The     process of preparing affidavits in pending proceedings in     judicial states is expected to continue into the first quarter     of 2011 and could result in prolonged adversary proceedings that     delay certain foreclosure sales. We took these precautionary     steps in order to ensure our processes for handling foreclosures     include the appropriate controls and quality assurance. These     initiatives further support our credit risk management and     mitigation efforts. For more information, see Recent Events     beginning on page 33.       Certain European countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy,     Portugal and Spain, continue to experience varying degrees of     financial stress. Risks and ongoing concerns about the debt     crisis in Europe could result in a disruption of the financial     markets which could have a detrimental impact on the global     economic recovery, including the impact of non-sovereign debt in     these countries. For more information on our direct sovereign     and non-sovereign exposures in these countries, see     Non-U.S. Portfolio     beginning on page 94.       The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new     disclosure guidance, effective on a prospective basis for the     Corporations 2010 year-end reporting, that addresses     disclosure of loans and other financing receivables and the     related allowance. The new disclosure guidance defines a     portfolio segment as the level at which an entity develops and     documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance     for credit losses, and a class of financing receivables as the     level of disaggregation of portfolio segments based on the     initial measurement attribute, risk characteristics and methods     for assessing risk. The Corporations portfolio segments     are home loans, credit card and other consumer, and commercial.     The classes within the home loans portfolio segment are     residential mortgage, home equity and discontinued real estate.     The classes within the credit card and other consumer portfolio     segment are U.S. credit card,     non-U.S. credit     card, direct/indirect consumer and other consumer. The classes     within the commercial portfolio segment are     U.S. commercial, commercial real estate, commercial lease     financing,     non-U.S. commercial     and U.S. small business commercial. Under this new     disclosure guidance, the allowance is presented by portfolio     segment.               Bank of America     2010     71     Table of Contents          Consumer     Portfolio Credit Risk Management        Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with     initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrowers     credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with     experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio     management including underwriting, product pricing, risk     appetite, setting credit limits and establishing operating     processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns.     Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral     information from external sources such as credit bureaus     and/or     internal historical experience. These models are a component of     our consumer credit risk management process and are used, in     part, to help determine both new and existing credit decisions,     portfolio management strategies including authorizations and     line management, collection practices and strategies,     determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses, and     economic capital allocations for credit risk.       For information on our accounting policies regarding     delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and TDRs for     the consumer portfolio, see Note 1  Summary     of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated     Financial Statements.     Consumer Credit     Portfolio       Although unemployment rates remained at elevated levels,     improvement in the U.S. economy and stabilization in the     labor markets during 2010 resulted in lower losses and lower     delinquencies in almost all consumer portfolios during 2010 when     compared to 2009 on a managed basis. However, economic     deterioration throughout 2009 and weakness in the economic     recovery in 2010 drove continued stress in the housing markets     and tighter availability of credit in the market place resulting     in elevated net charge-offs in most portfolios. In addition,     during 2010, our consumer real estate portfolios were impacted     by net charge-offs on certain modified loans deemed to be     collateral dependent pursuant to clarification of regulatory     guidance. For more           information on regulatory guidance on collateral dependent     modified loans, see Regulatory Matters beginning on page 56.       Under the new consolidation guidance, we consolidated all     previously off-balance sheet securitized credit card receivables     along with certain home equity and auto loan securitization     trusts. The 2010 consumer credit card credit quality statistics     include the impact of consolidation of VIEs. The following     tables include the December 31, 2009 balances as well as     the January 1, 2010 balances to show the impact of the     adoption of the new consolidation guidance. Accordingly, the     December 31, 2010 credit quality statistics under the new     consolidation guidance should be compared to the amounts     presented in the January 1, 2010 column.       The table below presents our outstanding consumer loans and the     Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. Loans that were acquired from     Countrywide and considered credit-impaired were written down to     fair value upon acquisition. In addition to being included in     the Outstandings columns in the table below, these     loans are also shown separately, net of purchase accounting     adjustments, in the Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired     Loan Portfolio column. Loans that were acquired from     Merrill Lynch were recorded at fair value including those that     were considered credit-impaired upon acquisition. The Merrill     Lynch consumer PCI loan portfolio did not materially alter the     reported credit quality statistics of the consumer portfolios     and is, therefore, excluded from the Countrywide Purchased     Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio column and the following     discussion. For additional information, see     Note 6  Outstanding Loans and Leases to     the Consolidated Financial Statements. The impact of the     Countrywide PCI loan portfolio on certain credit statistics is     reported where appropriate. See Countrywide Purchased     Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio beginning on page 78 for     more information. Under certain circumstances, loans that were     originally classified as discontinued real estate loans upon     acquisition have been subsequently modified from pay option or     subprime loans into loans with more conventional terms and are     now included in the residential mortgage portfolio shown below.

Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card     loans, consumer non-real estate-secured loans or unsecured     consumer loans as these loans are generally charged off no later     than the end of the month in which the loan becomes     180 days past due. Real estate-secured past due consumer     loans insured by the FHA are reported as accruing as opposed to     nonperforming since the           principal repayment is insured by the FHA. FHA insured loans     accruing past due 90 days or more are primarily related to     our purchases of delinquent loans pursuant to our servicing     agreements with GNMA. Additionally, nonperforming loans and     accruing balances past due 90 days or more do not include     the Countrywide PCI loans even though the customer may be     contractually past due.

(3)   At December 31, 2010 and 2009,     balances accruing past due 90 days or more represent loans     insured by the FHA.

These are the only     product classifications materially impacted by the Countrywide     PCI loan portfolio for 2010 and 2009. For all loan and lease     categories, the net charge-offs were unchanged.             n/a = not applicable                  We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to     exclude the impact of the Countrywide PCI and FHA insured loan     portfolios is more representative of the ongoing operations and     credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following     discussions of the residential mortgage, home           equity and discontinued real estate portfolios, we provide     information that is adjusted to exclude the impact of the     Countrywide PCI and FHA insured loan portfolios. In addition,     beginning on page 78, we separately disclose information on     the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio.               Bank of America     2010     73     Table of Contents         Residential     Mortgage       The residential mortgage portfolio, which excludes the     discontinued real estate portfolio acquired with Countrywide,     makes up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio     at 40 percent of consumer loans at December 31, 2010.     Approximately 14 percent of the residential mortgage     portfolio is in GWIM and represents residential mortgages     that are originated for the home purchase and refinancing needs     of our affluent clients. The remaining portion of the portfolio     is mostly in All Other and is comprised of both     residential loans originated for our customers and used in our     overall ALM activities as well as purchased loans.       Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio     increased $15.8 billion at December 31, 2010 compared     to December 31, 2009 as new FHA insured origination volume     was partially offset by paydowns, the sale           of First Republic, transfers to foreclosed properties and     charge-offs. In addition, FHA repurchases of delinquent loans     pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA also increased     the residential mortgage portfolio during 2010. At     December 31, 2010 and 2009, the residential mortgage     portfolio included $53.9 billion and $12.9 billion of     outstanding loans that were insured by the FHA. On this portion     of the residential mortgage portfolio, we are protected against     principal loss as a result of FHA insurance. The table below     presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on     both a reported basis and excluding the Countrywide PCI and FHA     insured loan portfolios.

We have mitigated a portion of our credit risk on the     residential mortgage portfolio through the use of synthetic     securitization vehicles and long-term standby agreements with     FNMA and FHLMC as described in Note 6      Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial     Statements. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the synthetic     securitization vehicles referenced $53.9 billion and     $70.7 billion of residential mortgage loans and provided     loss protection up to $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion.     At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Corporation had a     receivable of $722 million and $1.0 billion from these     vehicles for reimbursement of losses. The Corporation records an     allowance for credit losses on loans referenced by the synthetic     securitization vehicles. The reported net charge-offs for the     residential mortgage portfolio do not include the benefit of     amounts reimbursable from these vehicles. Adjusting for the     benefit of the credit protection from the synthetic     securitizations, the residential mortgage net charge-off ratio     for 2010 would have been reduced by seven bps compared to     27 bps for 2009. Synthetic securitizations and the     protection provided by FNMA and FHLMC together mitigated risk on     35 percent of our residential mortgage portfolio at both     December 31, 2010 and 2009. These credit protection     agreements reduce our regulatory risk-weighted assets due to the     transfer of a portion of our credit risk to unaffiliated     parties. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, these transactions     had the cumulative effect of reducing our risk-weighted assets     by $8.6 billion and $16.8 billion, and increased our     Tier 1 capital ratio by seven bps and 11 bps and our     Tier 1 common capital ratio by five bps and eight bps. At     December 31, 2010 and 2009, $14.3 billion and     $6.6 billion in loans were protected by long-term standby     agreements. The Corporation does not record an allowance for     credit losses on loans protected by these long-term standby     agreements.             Nonperforming residential mortgage loans increased     $1.1 billion compared to December 31, 2009 as new     inflows, which continued to slow in 2010 due to favorable     delinquency trends, continued to outpace nonperforming loans     returning to performing status, charge-offs, and paydowns and     payoffs. At December 31, 2010, $12.7 billion, or     72 percent, of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans     were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to     the fair value of the underlying collateral. Net charge-offs     decreased $680 million to $3.7 billion in 2010, or     1.79 percent of total average residential mortgage loans     compared to 1.83 percent for 2009 driven primarily by     favorable delinquency trends which were due in part to     improvement in the U.S. economy. Net charge-off ratios were     further impacted by lower loan balances primarily due to     paydowns, the sale of First Republic and charge-offs.       Certain risk characteristics of the residential mortgage     portfolio continued to contribute to higher losses. These     characteristics include loans with a high refreshed     loan-to-value     (LTV), loans originated at the peak of home prices in 2006 and     2007, loans to borrowers located in California and Florida where     we have concentrations and where significant declines in home     prices have been experienced, as well as interest-only loans.     Although the following disclosures address each of these risk     characteristics separately, there is significant overlap in     loans with these characteristics, which contributed to a     disproportionate share of the losses in the portfolio. The     residential mortgage loans with all of these higher risk     characteristics comprised five percent and seven percent of the     residential mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2010 and     2009, but accounted for 26 percent of the residential     mortgage net charge-offs in 2010 compared to 31 percent in     2009.           74     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           Residential mortgage loans with a greater than 90 percent     but less than 100 percent refreshed LTV represented     10 percent and 11 percent of the residential mortgage     portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Loans with a     refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent represented     23 percent of the residential mortgage loan portfolio at     both December 31, 2010 and 2009. Of the loans with a     refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent, 88 percent     were performing at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. Loans     with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans     where the outstanding carrying value of the loan is greater than     the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. The     majority of these loans have a refreshed LTV greater than     100 percent due primarily to home price deterioration from     the weakened economy. Loans to borrowers with refreshed FICO     scores below 620 represented 14 percent and 12 percent     of the residential mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2010     and 2009.             The 2006 and 2007 vintage loans, which represented     38 percent and 42 percent of our residential mortgage     portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009, have higher     refreshed LTVs and accounted for 67 percent and     69 percent of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at     December 31, 2010 and 2009. These vintages of loans     accounted for 77 percent of residential mortgage net     charge-offs during 2010 and 75 percent during 2009.       The table below presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and     net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the     residential mortgage portfolio. California and Florida combined     represented 42 percent of outstandings and 48 percent     of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2010. These states     accounted for 54 percent of the net charge-offs for 2010     compared to 58 percent for 2009. The Los Angeles-Long     Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within     California represented 13 percent of outstandings at both     December 31, 2010 and 2009, but comprised only seven     percent of net charge-offs for both 2010 and 2009.

Of the residential mortgage loans, $62.5 billion, or     32 percent, at December 31, 2010 are interest-only     loans of which 87 percent were performing. Nonperforming     balances on interest-only residential mortgage loans were     $8.0 billion, or 45 percent of total nonperforming     residential mortgages. Additionally, net charge-offs on the     interest-only portion of the portfolio represented     53 percent of the total residential mortgage net     charge-offs during 2010.       The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) encourages banks to meet     the credit needs of their communities for housing and other     purposes, particularly in neighborhoods with low or moderate     incomes. At December 31, 2010, our CRA portfolio was eight     percent of the residential mortgage loan balances but comprised     17 percent of nonperforming residential mortgage loans.     This portfolio also represented 23 percent of residential     mortgage net charge-offs during 2010.

Home     Equity       The home equity portfolio makes up 21 percent of the     consumer portfolio and is comprised of home equity lines of     credit, home equity loans and reverse mortgages. At     December 31, 2010, approximately 88 percent of the     home equity portfolio was included in Home Loans &     Insurance, while the remainder of the portfolio was     primarily in GWIM. Outstanding balances in the home     equity portfolio decreased $11.1 billion at     December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 due to     charge-offs, paydowns and the sale of First Republic, partially     offset by the adoption of new consolidation guidance, which     resulted in the consolidation of $5.1 billion of home     equity loans on January 1, 2010. Of the loans in the home     equity portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009,     $24.8 billion and $26.0 billion, or 18 percent     for both periods, were in first-lien positions (20 percent     and 19 percent excluding the Countrywide PCI home equity     loan portfolio). For more information on the Countrywide PCI     home equity loan portfolio, see the discussion beginning on     page 78.       Home equity unused lines of credit totaled $80.1 billion at     December 31, 2010 compared to $92.7 billion at     December 31, 2009. This decrease was due primarily to     account attrition as well as line management initiatives on     deteriorating accounts and the sale of First Republic, which     more than offset new production. The home equity line of credit     utilization rate was 59 percent at December 31, 2010     compared to 57 percent at December 31, 2009.

Nonperforming home equity loans decreased $1.1 billion to     $2.7 billion compared to December 31, 2009 driven     primarily by charge-offs, including those recorded in connection     with regulatory guidance clarifying the timing of charge-offs on     collateral dependent modified loans, and nonperforming loans     returning to performing status which together outpaced     delinquency inflows and the impact of the adoption of new     consolidation guidance. At December 31, 2010,     $916 million, or 34 percent, of the nonperforming home     equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been     written down to their fair values. Net charge-offs decreased     $269 million to $6.8 billion, or 5.10 percent, of     total average home equity loans for 2010 compared to     $7.1 billion, or 5.00 percent, for 2009. The decrease     was primarily driven by favorable portfolio trends due in part     to improvement in the U.S. economy. This was partially     offset by $822 million of net charge-offs related to the     implementation of regulatory guidance on collateral dependent     modified loans and $463 million of net charge-offs related     to home equity loans that were consolidated on January 1,     2010 under new consolidation guidance. Net charge-off ratios     were further impacted by lower loan balances primarily as a     result of charge-offs, paydowns and the sale of First Republic.       There are certain risk characteristics of the home equity     portfolio which have contributed to higher losses including     loans with a high refreshed combined     loan-to-value     (CLTV), loans originated at the peak of home prices in 2006 and     2007 and loans in geographic areas that have experienced the     most significant declines in home prices. Home price declines     coupled with the fact that most home equity loans are secured by     second-lien positions have significantly reduced and, in some     cases, eliminated all collateral value after consideration of     the first-lien position. Although the following disclosures     address each of these risk characteristics separately, there is     significant overlap in loans with these characteristics, which     has contributed to a           disproportionate share of losses in the portfolio. Home equity     loans with all of these higher risk characteristics comprised     10 percent and 11 percent of the total home equity     portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009, but have accounted     for 29 percent of the home equity net charge-offs in 2010     compared to 38 percent in 2009.       Home equity loans with greater than 90 percent but less     than 100 percent refreshed CLTVs comprised 11 percent     and 12 percent of the home equity portfolio at     December 31, 2010 and 2009. Loans with refreshed CLTVs     greater than 100 percent comprised 30 percent and     31 percent of the home equity portfolio at     December 31, 2010 and 2009. Of those loans with a refreshed     CLTV greater than 100 percent, 97 percent were     performing at December 31, 2010 while 95 percent were     performing at December 31, 2009. Home equity loans and     lines of credit with a refreshed CLTV greater than     100 percent reflect loans where the carrying value and     available line of credit of the combined loans are equal to or     greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing     the loan. Depending on the LTV of the first lien, there may be     collateral in excess of the first lien that is available to     reduce the severity of loss on the second lien. The majority of     these high refreshed CLTV ratios are due to home price declines.     In addition, loans to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score     below 620 represented 12 percent and 13 percent of the     home equity loans at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Of the     total home equity portfolio, 75 percent and 72 percent     at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were interest-only loans.       The 2006 and 2007 vintage loans, which represent 47 percent     and 49 percent of our home equity portfolio at     December 31, 2010 and 2009, have higher refreshed CLTVs and     accounted for 57 percent of nonperforming home equity loans     at December 31, 2010 compared to 62 percent at     December 31, 2009. These vintages of loans accounted for     66 percent of net charge-offs in 2010 compared to     72 percent in 2009.               76     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           The table below presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and     net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home     equity loan portfolio. California and Florida combined     represented 40 percent of the total home equity portfolio     and 44 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at     December 31, 2010. These states accounted for     55 percent of the home equity net charge-offs for 2010     compared to 60 percent of the home equity net charge-offs     for 2009. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New     Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 11 percent of outstanding     home equity loans at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. This     MSA comprised only six percent           of net charge-offs for both 2010 and 2009. The Los Angeles-Long     Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent of     outstanding home equity loans at both December 31, 2010 and     2009 and comprised 11 percent of net charge-offs for 2010     compared to 13 percent for 2009.

Discontinued Real     Estate       The discontinued real estate portfolio, totaling     $13.1 billion at December 31, 2010, consisted of pay     option and subprime loans acquired in the Countrywide     acquisition. Upon acquisition, the majority of the discontinued     real estate portfolio was considered credit-impaired and written     down to fair value. At December 31, 2010, the Countrywide     PCI loan portfolio comprised $11.7 billion, or     89 percent, of the total discontinued real estate     portfolio. This portfolio is included in All Other and is     managed as part of our overall ALM activities. See Countrywide     Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio beginning on     page 78 for more information on the discontinued real     estate portfolio.       At December 31, 2010, the purchased discontinued real     estate portfolio that was not credit-impaired was     $1.4 billion. Loans with greater than 90 percent     refreshed LTVs and CLTVs comprised 29 percent of the     portfolio and those with refreshed FICO scores below 620     represented 46 percent of the portfolio. California     represented 37 percent of the portfolio and 34 percent     of the nonperforming loans while Florida represented     10 percent of the portfolio and 15 percent of the     nonperforming loans at December 31, 2010. The Los     Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up     16 percent of outstanding discontinued real estate loans at     December 31, 2010.       Pay option adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which are included     in the discontinued real estate portfolio, have interest rates     that adjust monthly and minimum required payments that adjust     annually, subject to resetting of the loan if minimum payments     are made and deferred interest limits are reached. Annual     payment adjustments are subject to a 7.5 percent maximum     change. To ensure that contractual loan payments are adequate to     repay a loan, the fully amortizing loan payment amount is     re-established after the initial five or     10-year     period and again every five years thereafter. These payment     adjustments are not subject to the 7.5 percent limit and     may be substantial due to changes in interest rates and the     addition of unpaid interest to the loan           balance. Payment advantage ARMs have interest rates that are     fixed for an initial period of five years. Payments are subject     to reset if the minimum payments are made and deferred interest     limits are reached. If interest deferrals cause a loans     principal balance to reach a certain level within the first     10 years of the life of the loan, the payment is reset to     the interest-only payment; then at the     10-year     point, the fully amortizing payment is required.       The difference between the frequency of changes in the     loans interest rates and payments along with a limitation     on changes in the minimum monthly payments of 7.5 percent     per year can result in payments that are not sufficient to pay     all of the monthly interest charges (i.e., negative     amortization). Unpaid interest charges are added to the loan     balance until the loan balance increases to a specified limit,     which can be no more than 115 percent of the original loan     amount, at which time a new monthly payment amount adequate to     repay the loan over its remaining contractual life is     established.       At December 31, 2010, the unpaid principal balance of pay     option loans was $14.6 billion, with a carrying amount of     $11.8 billion, including $11.0 billion of loans that     were credit-impaired upon acquisition. The total unpaid     principal balance of pay option loans with accumulated negative     amortization was $12.5 billion including $858 million     of negative amortization. The percentage of borrowers electing     to make only the minimum payment on option ARMs was     69 percent at December 31, 2010. We continue to     evaluate our exposure to payment resets on the acquired     negative-amortizing loans including the Countrywide PCI pay     option loan portfolio and have taken into consideration several     assumptions regarding this evaluation (e.g., prepayment rates).     Based on our expectations, 11 percent and three percent of     the pay option loan portfolio are expected to reset in 2011 and     2012. Approximately four percent are expected to reset     thereafter and approximately 82 percent are expected to     default or repay prior to being reset.               Bank of America     2010     77     Table of Contents         Countrywide     Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio       Loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration     since origination and for which it is probable at purchase that     we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments     are accounted for under the accounting guidance for PCI loans,     which addresses accounting for differences between contractual     and expected cash flows to be collected from the     purchasers initial investment in loans if those     differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit     quality. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the     acquisition date may include statistics such as past due status,     refreshed FICO scores and refreshed LTVs. PCI loans are recorded     at fair value upon acquisition and           the applicable accounting guidance prohibits carrying over or     recording valuation allowances in the initial accounting. The     Merrill Lynch PCI consumer loan portfolio did not materially     alter the reported credit quality statistics of the consumer     portfolios. As such, the Merrill Lynch consumer PCI loans are     excluded from the following discussion and credit statistics.       Acquired loans from Countrywide that were considered     credit-impaired were written down to fair value at the     acquisition date. The following table presents the unpaid     principal balance, carrying value, allowance for loan and lease     losses and the net carrying value as a percentage of the unpaid     principal balance for the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio at     December 31, 2010.

Of the $25.9 billion that is less than     180 days past due, $21.5 billion, or 83 percent     of the total unpaid principal balance, was current based on the     contractual terms while $2.2 billion, or eight percent, was     in early stage delinquency. During 2010, we recorded     $2.3 billion of provision for credit losses on PCI loans     which was comprised mainly of $1.4 billion for home equity     and $689 million for discontinued real estate loans     compared to a total provision for PCI loans of $3.3 billion     in 2009. Provision expense in 2010 was driven primarily by a     slower pace of expected recovery in home prices, the result of a     deteriorating view on defaults on more seasoned loans in the     portfolio and a reassessment of modification and short sale     benefits as we gain more experience with troubled borrowers. The     Countrywide PCI allowance for loan losses increased     $2.5 billion from December 31, 2009 to     $6.3 billion at December 31, 2010 as a result of the     increase in the provision for credit losses and the     reclassification of a portion of nonaccretable difference to the     allowance.

Those loans to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score     below 620 represented 62 percent of the Countrywide PCI     discontinued real estate loan portfolio at December 31,     2010. Refreshed LTVs and CLTVs greater than 90 percent     represented 55 percent of the PCI discontinued real estate     loan portfolio after consideration of purchase accounting     adjustments and 83 percent based on the unpaid principal     balance at December 31, 2010. Those loans that were     originally classified as discontinued real estate loans upon     acquisition and have been subsequently modified are now excluded     from this portfolio and included in the Countrywide PCI     residential mortgage loan portfolio, but remain in the PCI loan     pool.

Managed basis assumed that securitized loans were     not sold into credit card securitizations and presented credit     quality information as if the loans had not been sold. Under the     new consolidation guidance effective January 1, 2010, we     consolidated the credit card securitization trusts and the new     held basis is comparable to the previously reported managed     basis.

Outstandings in the     U.S. credit card loan portfolio increased     $64.3 billion compared to December 31, 2009 due to the     adoption of the new consolidation guidance. Compared to 2009,     net charge-offs increased $6.5 billion to     $13.0 billion also due to the adoption of the new     consolidation guidance. U.S. credit card loans 30 days     or more past due and still accruing interest increased     $2.0 billion while loans 90 days or more past due and     still accruing interest increased $1.2 billion compared to     December 31, 2009 due to the adoption of new consolidation     guidance.       Compared to December 31, 2009 on a managed basis,     outstandings decreased $15.9 billion primarily as a result     of charge-offs and lower origination volume. Net losses     decreased $3.9 billion due to lower levels of delinquencies     and bankruptcies as a result of improvement in the     U.S. economy compared to 2009 on a managed basis. The net     charge-off ratio was 11.04 percent of total average     U.S. credit card loans in 2010 compared to     12.07 percent in 2009 on a managed basis. U.S. credit     card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing     interest decreased $4.0 billion and loans 90 days or     more past due and still accruing interest decreased     $2.1 billion compared to December 31, 2009 on a     managed basis. These declines were due to improvement in the     U.S. economy including stabilization in the levels of     unemployment.

The $38.8 billion decrease was driven by a     combination of account management initiatives on higher risk or     inactive accounts and tighter underwriting standards for new     originations.     Non-U.S.     Credit Card       Prior to the adoption of new consolidation guidance, the     non-U.S. credit     card portfolio was reported on both a held and managed basis.     Under the new consolidation guidance effective January 1,     2010, we consolidated the credit card securitization trusts and     the new held basis is comparable to the previously reported     managed basis.

Outstandings in the     non-U.S. credit     card portfolio increased $5.8 billion compared to     December 31, 2009 due to the adoption of the new     consolidation guidance. Additionally, net charge-off levels and     ratios for 2010, when compared to 2009, were impacted by the     adoption of the new consolidation guidance. Net charge-offs     increased $1.0 billion to $2.2 billion in 2010.       Outstandings declined $3.7 billion compared to     December 31, 2009 on a managed basis primarily due to     charge-offs, lower origination volume and the strengthening of     the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies. Net     losses           were substantially flat for 2010, decreasing $16 million     from managed losses in 2009. The net loss ratio increased to     7.88 percent of total average     non-U.S. credit     card compared to 7.43 percent in 2009, due to the decrease     in outstandings.       Unused lines of credit for     non-U.S. credit     card totaled $60.3 billion at December 31, 2010     compared to $69.6 billion at December 31, 2009 on a     managed basis. The $9.3 billion decrease was driven by the     combination of account management initiatives on inactive     accounts, tighter underwriting standards for new originations     and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain     foreign currencies, particularly the British Pound and the Euro.     Direct/Indirect     Consumer       At December 31, 2010, approximately 48 percent of the     direct/indirect portfolio was included in Global Commercial     Banking (dealer financial services  automotive,     marine and recreational vehicle loans), 29 percent was     included in GWIM (principally other non-real     estate-secured, unsecured personal loans and securities-based     lending margin loans), 15 percent was included in Global     Card Services (consumer personal loans and other non-real     estate-secured loans) and the remainder was in All Other     (student loans).       Outstanding loans and leases decreased $6.9 billion to     $90.3 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to     December 31, 2009 as lower outstandings in the Global     Card Services unsecured consumer lending portfolio and the     sale of a portion of the student loan portfolio were partially     offset by the adoption of new consolidation guidance, growth in     securities-based lending and the purchase of auto receivables     within the dealer financial services portfolio. Direct/indirect     loans that were past due 30 days or more and still accruing     interest declined $1.1 billion compared to     December 31, 2009, to $2.6 billion due to a     combination of reduced outstandings and improvement in the     unsecured consumer lending portfolio. Net charge-offs decreased     $2.1 billion to $3.3 billion in 2010, or     3.45 percent of total average direct/indirect loans     compared to 5.46 percent in 2009. This decrease was     primarily driven by reduced outstandings from changes in     underwriting criteria and lower levels of delinquencies and     bankruptcies in the unsecured consumer lending portfolio as a     result of improvement in the U.S. economy including     stabilization in the levels of unemployment. An additional     driver was lower net charge-offs in the dealer financial     services portfolio due to the impact of higher credit quality     originations and higher resale values. Net charge-offs for the     unsecured consumer lending portfolio decreased $1.6 billion     to $2.7 billion and the net charge-off ratio decreased to     16.74 percent in 2010 compared to 17.75 percent in     2009. Net charge-offs for the dealer financial services     portfolio decreased $404 million to $487 million and     the loss rate decreased to 1.08 percent in 2010 compared to     2.16 percent in 2009.               80     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents        The table below presents certain state concentrations for the     direct/indirect consumer loan portfolio.

The     remainder consisted of the     non-U.S. consumer     loan portfolio, of which the vast majority we previously exited     and is largely in Global Card Services and deposit     overdrafts which are recorded in Deposits.     Nonperforming     Consumer Loans and Foreclosed Properties Activity       Table 33 presents nonperforming consumer loans and foreclosed     properties activity during 2010 and 2009. Nonperforming LHFS are     excluded from nonperforming loans as they are recorded at either     fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Nonperforming     loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans and in     general, past due consumer loans not secured by real estate as     these loans are generally charged off no later than the end of     the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. Real     estate-secured past due consumer loans insured by the FHA are     not reported as nonperforming as principal repayment is insured     by the FHA. Additionally, nonperforming loans do not include the     Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. For further information     regarding nonperforming loans, see Note 1      Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the     Consolidated Financial Statements. Nonperforming loans remained     relatively flat at $20.9 billion at December 31, 2010     compared to $20.8 billion at December 31, 2009 as     delinquency inflows to nonaccrual loans slowed driven by     favorable portfolio trends due in part to the improving     U.S. economy. These inflows were offset by charge-offs,     nonperforming loans returning to performing status, and paydowns     and payoffs.       The outstanding balance of a real estate-secured loan that is in     excess of the estimated property value, after reducing the     property value for costs to sell, is charged off no later than     the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days     past due unless repayment of the loan is insured by the FHA. At     December 31, 2010, $15.1 billion, or 69 percent,     of the nonperforming consumer real estate loans and foreclosed     properties had been written down to their fair values. This was     comprised of $13.9 billion of nonperforming loans     180 days or more past due and $1.2 billion of     foreclosed properties.       Foreclosed properties decreased $179 million in 2010. PCI     loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as these loans were     written down to fair value at the acquisition date. However,     once the underlying real estate is acquired by the Corporation     upon foreclosure of the delinquent PCI loan, it is included in     foreclosed properties. Net changes to foreclosed properties     related to PCI loans were an increase of $100 million in     2010. Not included in foreclosed properties at December 31,     2010 was $1.4 billion of real estate that was acquired by     the Corporation upon foreclosure of delinquent FHA insured     loans. We hold this real estate on our balance sheet until we     convey           these properties to the FHA. We exclude these amounts from our     nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties activity as we     will be reimbursed once the property is conveyed to the FHA for     principal and up to certain limits, costs incurred during the     foreclosure process and interest incurred during the holding     period.     Restructured     Loans       Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been     modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to     borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These concessions     typically result from the Corporations loss mitigation     activities and could include reductions in the interest rate,     payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or     other actions. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at     the time of restructuring and may only be returned to performing     status after considering the borrowers sustained repayment     performance under revised payment terms for a reasonable period,     generally six months. Nonperforming TDRs, excluding those     modified loans in the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, are     included in Table 33.       Residential mortgage TDRs totaled $11.8 billion at     December 31, 2010, an increase of $4.6 billion     compared to December 31, 2009. Of these loans,     $3.3 billion were nonperforming representing an increase of     $130 million in 2010, and $8.5 billion were performing     representing an increase of $4.5 billion in 2010 driven by     TDRs returning to performing status and new additions. These     performing TDRs are excluded from nonperforming loans in Table     33. Residential mortgage TDRs deemed collateral dependent     totaled $3.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and included     $921 million of loans classified as nonperforming and     $2.3 billion classified as performing. At December 31,     2010, performing residential mortgage TDRs included     $2.5 billion that were FHA insured.       Home equity TDRs totaled $1.7 billion at December 31,     2010, a decrease of $673 million compared to     December 31, 2009. Of these loans, $541 million were     nonperforming representing a decrease of $1.2 billion in     2010 driven primarily by nonperforming TDRs returning to     performing status and charge-offs taken to comply with     regulatory guidance clarifying the timing of charge-offs on     collateral dependent modified loans. Home equity TDRs that were     performing in accordance with their modified terms were     $1.2 billion representing an increase of $514 million     in 2010. These performing TDRs are excluded from nonperforming     loans in Table 33. Home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent     totaled $796 million at December 31, 2010 and included     $245 million of loans classified as nonperforming and     $551 million classified as performing.       Discontinued real estate TDRs totaled $395 million at     December 31, 2010, an increase of $13 million in 2010.     Of these loans, $206 million were nonperforming while the     remaining $189 million were classified as              Bank of America     2010     81     Table of Contents           performing at December 31, 2010. Discontinued real estate     TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $213 million at     December 31, 2010 and included $97 million of loans     classified as nonperforming and $116 million classified as     performing.       We also work with customers that are experiencing financial     difficulty by renegotiating credit card, consumer lending and     small business loans (the renegotiated TDR portfolio), while     complying with Federal Financial Institutions Examination     Council (FFIEC) guidelines. Substantially all renegotiated     portfolio modifications are considered to be TDRs. The     renegotiated TDR portfolio may include modifications, both     short- and long-term, of interest rates or payment amounts or a     combination of interest rates and payment amounts. We make     modifications primarily through internal renegotiation programs     utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external     renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is     excluded from Table 33 as we do not generally classify consumer     non-real estate loans as nonperforming. At December 31,     2010, our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $12.1 billion of     which $9.2 billion was current or less than 30 days     past due under the modified terms, compared to an     $8.1 billion portfolio, on a held basis at     December 31, 2009, of which $5.9 billion was current     or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. At     December 31, 2009, our renegotiated           TDR portfolio, on a managed basis, was $15.8 billion of     which $11.5 billion was current or less than 30 days     past due under the modified terms. For more information on the     renegotiated TDR portfolio, see Note 6      Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial     Statements.       As a result of new accounting guidance on PCI loans, beginning     January 1, 2010, modifications of loans in the PCI loan     portfolio do not result in removal of the loan from the PCI loan     pool. TDRs in the consumer real estate portfolio that were     removed from the PCI loan portfolio prior to the adoption of new     accounting guidance were $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion     at December 31, 2010 and 2009, of which $426 million     and $395 million were nonperforming. These nonperforming     loans are excluded from the table below.       Nonperforming consumer real estate TDRs, included in the table     below, as a percentage of total nonperforming consumer loans and     foreclosed properties, declined to 16 percent at     December 31, 2010 from 21 percent at December 31,     2009. This was due to nonperforming TDRs returning to performing     status and charge-offs, including those charged off to comply     with regulatory guidance clarifying the timing of charge-offs on     collateral dependent modified loans, both of which outpaced new     additions of nonperforming TDRs.

For more information on our     definition of nonperforming loans, see the discussion beginning     on page 81.         (2)   2009 includes $465 million of     nonperforming loans acquired from Merrill Lynch.         (3)   Consumer loans may be returned to     performing status when all principal and interest is current and     full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and     interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes     well-secured and is in the process of collection. Certain TDRs     are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructure and     may only be returned to performing status after considering the     borrowers sustained repayment performance for a reasonable     period, generally six months.         (4)   Our policy is not to classify     consumer credit card and consumer loans not secured by real     estate as nonperforming; therefore, the charge-offs on these     loans have no impact on nonperforming activity and accordingly     are excluded from this table.         (5)   At December 31, 2010,     67 percent of nonperforming loans are 180 days or more     past due and have been written down through charge-offs to     69 percent of the unpaid principal balance.         (6)   Our policy is to record any losses     in the value of foreclosed properties as a reduction in the     allowance for loan and lease losses during the first     90 days after transfer of a loan into foreclosed     properties. Thereafter, all gains and losses in value are     recorded in noninterest expense. New foreclosed properties in     the table above are net of $575 million and     $818 million of charge-offs during 2010 and 2009, taken     during the first 90 days after transfer.         (7)   2009 includes $21 million of     foreclosed properties acquired from Merrill Lynch.             n/a = not applicable        82     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents          Commercial     Portfolio Credit Risk Management        Credit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with     an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or     counterparty based on an analysis of its financial position. As     part of the overall credit risk assessment, our commercial     credit exposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to     approval based on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent     to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing     basis, and if necessary, adjusted to reflect changes in the     financial condition, cash flow, risk profile, or outlook of a     borrower or counterparty. In making credit decisions, we     consider risk rating, collateral, country, industry and single     name concentration limits while also balancing the total     borrower or counterparty relationship. Our lines of business and     risk management personnel use a variety of tools to continuously     monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform     under its obligations. We use risk rating aggregations to     measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios. In     addition, risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of     assigned economic capital and the allowance for credit losses.       For information on our accounting policies regarding     delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the     commercial portfolio, refer to Note 1      Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the     Consolidated Financial Statements.     Management of     Commercial Credit Risk Concentrations       Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal     that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in     undesirable levels of risk. We review, measure and manage     concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product,     geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review,     measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic     location and property type. In addition, within our     international portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by     country. Tables 38, 42, 48 and 49 summarize our concentrations.     We also utilize syndication of exposure to third parties, loan     sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage     the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio.       As part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt     to work with clients to modify their loans to terms that better     align with their current ability to pay. In situations where an     economic concession has been granted to a borrower experiencing     financial difficulty, we identify these loans as TDRs.       We account for certain large corporate loans and loan     commitments, including issued but unfunded letters of credit     which are considered utilized for credit risk management     purposes, that exceed our single name credit risk concentration     guidelines under the fair value option. Lending commitments,           both funded and unfunded, are actively managed and monitored,     and as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships     may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with the     Corporations credit view and market perspectives     determining the size and timing of the hedging activity. In     addition, we purchase credit protection to cover the funded     portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain other credit     exposures. To lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit     protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an     industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.     These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for     treatment as accounting hedges. They are carried at fair value     with changes in fair value recorded in other income (loss).     Commercial Credit     Portfolio   U.S.-based     loan balances continued to decline on weak loan demand as     businesses aggressively managed their working capital and     production capacity by maintaining lean inventories, staff     levels, physical locations and capital expenditures.     Additionally, many borrowers continued to access the capital     markets for financing while reducing their use of bank credit     facilities. Risk mitigation strategies and net charge-offs     further contributed to the decline in loan balances.     Fourth-quarter balances showed stabilization relative to prior     quarters.     Non-U.S. commercial     loans showed strong growth from client demand, driven by     regional economic conditions and the positive impact of our     initiatives in Asia and other emerging markets.       Reservable criticized balances, net charge-offs and     nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed property balances in     the commercial credit portfolio declined in 2010. These     reductions were driven primarily by the U.S. commercial and     commercial real estate portfolios. U.S. commercial was     driven by broad-based improvements in terms of clients,     industries and lines of business. Commercial real estate also     continued to show signs of stabilization during 2010; however,     levels of stressed commercial real estate loans remained     elevated. Most other credit indicators across the remaining     commercial portfolio have also improved.       Table 34 presents our commercial loans and leases, and related     credit quality information at December 31, 2010 and 2009.       Loans that were acquired from Merrill Lynch that were considered     purchased credit-impaired were written down to fair value upon     acquisition and amounted to $204 million and     $692 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009. These     loans are excluded from the nonperforming loans and accruing     balances 90 days or more past due even though the customer     may be contractually past due.

Table 36 presents commercial credit exposure by type for     utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure.     Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs, financial     guarantees, bankers acceptances and commercial letters of     credit for which the Corporation is legally bound to advance     funds under prescribed conditions, during a specified period.     Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types     are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.     Total commercial committed credit exposure decreased     $68.1 billion, or eight percent, at December 31, 2010     compared to December 31, 2009 driven primarily by     reductions in both funded and unfunded loan and lease exposure.       Total commercial utilized credit exposure decreased     $45.1 billion, or nine percent, at December 31, 2010     compared to December 31, 2009. Utilized           loans and leases declined as businesses continued to     aggressively manage working capital and production capacity,     maintain low inventories and defer capital expenditures as the     economic outlook remained uncertain. Clients also continued to     access the capital markets for their funding needs to reduce     reliance on bank credit facilities. The decline in utilized     loans and leases was also due to the sale of First Republic     effective July 1, 2010 and the transfer of certain     exposures into LHFS partially offset by the increase in conduit     balances related to the adoption of new consolidation guidance.     The utilization rate for loans and leases, letters of credit and     financial guarantees, and bankers acceptances was     57 percent at both December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Criticized exposure corresponds to the     Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as     defined by regulatory authorities. In addition to reservable     loans and leases, excluding those accounted for under the fair     value option, exposure includes SBLCs, financial guarantees,     bankers acceptances and commercial letters of credit for     which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed     conditions, during a specified time period. Although funds have     not been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized     for credit risk management purposes. Total commercial           utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased     $16.1 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to     December 31, 2009, due to decreases across all portfolios,     primarily U.S. commercial and commercial real estate driven     largely by continued paydowns, payoffs and, to a diminishing     extent, charge-offs. Despite the improvements, utilized     reservable criticized levels remain elevated in commercial real     estate. At December 31, 2010, approximately 88 percent     of the loans within commercial utilized reservable criticized     exposure were secured.

U.S.     Commercial       At December 31, 2010, 57 percent and 25 percent     of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small     business, were included in Global Commercial Banking and     GBAM. The remaining 18 percent was mostly included     in GWIM (business-purpose loans for wealthy clients).     Outstanding U.S. commercial loans, excluding loans     accounted for under the fair value option, decreased     $5.8 billion primarily due to reduced customer demand and     continued client utilization of the capital markets, partially     offset by the adoption of new consolidation guidance which     increased loans by $5.3 billion on January 1, 2010.     Compared to December 31, 2009, reservable criticized     balances and nonperforming loans and leases declined     $11.1 billion and $1.5 billion. The declines were     broad-based in terms of borrowers and industries and were driven     by improved client credit profiles and liquidity. Net     charge-offs decreased $1.3 billion in 2010 compared to 2009.     Commercial Real     Estate       The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in     Global Commercial Banking and consists of loans made     primarily to public and private developers, homebuilders and     commercial real estate firms. Outstanding loans decreased     $20.1 billion at December 31, 2010 compared           to December 31, 2009 due to portfolio attrition, the sale     of First Republic, transfer of certain assets to LHFS and net     charge-offs. The portfolio remains diversified across property     types and geographic regions. California represents the largest     state concentration at 18 percent of commercial real estate     loans and leases at December 31, 2010. For more information     on geographic and property concentrations, refer to Table 38.       Credit quality for commercial real estate is showing signs of     stabilization; however, we expect that elevated unemployment and     ongoing pressure on vacancy and rental rates will continue to     affect primarily the non-homebuilder portfolio. Compared to     December 31, 2009, nonperforming commercial real estate     loans and foreclosed properties decreased in the homebuilder,     retail and land development property types, partially offset by     an increase in office and multi-use property types. Reservable     criticized balances declined by $3.3 billion primarily due     to stabilization in the homebuilder portfolio and retail and     unsecured segments in the non-homebuilder portfolio, partially     offset by continued deterioration in the multi-family rental and     office property types within the non-homebuilder portfolio. Net     charge-offs decreased $685 million in 2010 compared to 2009     due to declines in the homebuilder portfolio resulting from a     slower rate of declining appraisal values.               Bank of America     2010     85     Table of Contents        The table below presents outstanding commercial real estate     loans by geographic region and property type. Commercial real     estate primarily includes commercial loans and leases secured by     non owner-occupied real estate which are dependent on the sale     or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment.     The decline in California is due primarily to the sale of First     Republic.

During 2010, we continued to see stabilization in the     homebuilder portfolio. Certain portions of the non-homebuilder     portfolio remain most at-risk as occupancy rates, rental rates     and commercial property prices remain under pressure. We have     adopted a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to     reduce utilized and potential exposure in the commercial real     estate portfolios.        86     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents        The tables below present commercial real estate credit quality     data by non-homebuilder and homebuilder property types.

Non-homebuilder nonperforming loans and foreclosed     properties were $4.6 billion, or 10.08 percent of     total non-homebuilder loans and foreclosed properties at     December 31, 2010 compared to $4.8 billion, or     7.73 percent, at December 31, 2009. Non-homebuilder     utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased to     $17.1 billion, or 35.55 percent, at December 31,     2010 compared to $18.1 billion, or 27.27 percent, at     December 31, 2009. The decrease in criticized exposure was     primarily in the retail and unsecured segments, with the ratio     increasing due to declining loan balances. For the     non-homebuilder portfolio, net charge-offs increased     $187 million for 2010 compared to 2009. The changes were     concentrated in land development and retail.       At December 31, 2010, we had committed homebuilder exposure     of $6.0 billion compared to $10.4 billion at     December 31, 2009 of which $4.3 billion and     $7.3 billion were funded secured loans. The decline in     homebuilder committed exposure was due to repayments, net     charge-offs,           reductions in new home construction and continued risk     mitigation initiatives. At December 31, 2010, homebuilder     nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties declined     $1.3 billion due to repayments, net charge-offs, fewer risk     rating downgrades and a slowdown in the rate of home price     declines compared to December 31, 2009. Homebuilder     utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased by     $2.3 billion to $3.4 billion due to repayments and net     charge-offs. The nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed     properties and the utilized reservable criticized ratios for the     homebuilder portfolio were 42.80 percent and     74.27 percent at December 31, 2010 compared to     42.16 percent and 74.44 percent at December 31,     2009. Net charge-offs for the homebuilder portfolio decreased     $872 million in 2010 compared to 2009.       At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the commercial real estate     loan portfolio included $19.1 billion and     $27.4 billion of funded construction and land development     loans that were originated to fund the construction     and/or     rehabilitation of commercial properties. This portfolio is     mostly secured and diversified across property types and     geographies but faces significant challenges in the current     housing and rental markets. Weak rental              Bank of America     2010     87     Table of Contents           demand and cash flows, along with declining property valuations     have resulted in elevated levels of reservable criticized     exposure, nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties, and net     charge-offs. Reservable criticized construction and land     development loans totaled $10.5 billion and     $13.9 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009.     Nonperforming construction and land development loans and     foreclosed properties totaled $4.0 billion and     $5.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. During a     propertys construction phase, interest income is typically     paid from interest reserves that are established at the     inception of the loan. As construction is completed and the     property is put into service, these interest reserves are     depleted and interest begins to be paid from operating cash     flows. Loans continue to be classified as construction loans     until they are refinanced. We do not recognize interest income     on nonperforming loans regardless of the existence of an     interest reserve.     Non-U.S.     Commercial       The     non-U.S. commercial     loan portfolio is managed primarily in GBAM. Outstanding     loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value     option, showed growth from client demand driven by regional     economic conditions and the positive impact of our initiatives     in Asia and other emerging markets. Net charge-offs decreased     $426 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to stabilization     in the portfolio. For additional information on the     non-U.S. commercial     portfolio, refer to     Non-U.S. Portfolio     beginning on page 94.     U.S. Small     Business Commercial       The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is     comprised of business card and small business loans managed in     Global Card Services and Global Commercial     Banking. U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs     decreased $968 million in 2010 compared to 2009. Although     losses remain           elevated, the reduction in net charge-offs was driven by lower     levels of delinquencies and bankruptcies resulting from     U.S. economic improvement as well as the reduction of     higher risk vintages and the impact of higher quality     originations. Of the U.S. small business commercial net     charge-offs for 2010, 79 percent were credit card-related     products compared to 81 percent during 2009.     Commercial Loans     Carried at Fair Value       The portfolio of commercial loans accounted for under the fair     value option is managed primarily in GBAM. Outstanding     commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option     decreased $1.6 billion to an aggregate fair value of     $3.3 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to     December 31, 2009 due primarily to reduced corporate     borrowings under bank credit facilities. We recorded net losses     of $89 million resulting from new originations, loans being     paid off at par value and changes in the fair value of the loan     portfolio during 2010 compared to net gains of $515 million     during 2009. These amounts were primarily attributable to     changes in instrument-specific credit risk and were largely     offset by gains or losses from hedging activities.       In addition, unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit     had an aggregate fair value of $866 million and     $950 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009 and were     recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The     associated aggregate notional amount of unfunded lending     commitments and letters of credit accounted for under the fair     value option were $27.3 billion and $27.0 billion at     December 31, 2010 and 2009. Net gains resulting from new     originations, terminations and changes in the fair value of     commitments and letters of credit of $172 million were     recorded during 2010 compared to net gains of $1.4 billion     for 2009. These gains were primarily attributable to changes in     instrument-specific credit risk.           88     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents         Nonperforming     Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties     Activity       The table below presents the nonperforming commercial loans,     leases and foreclosed properties activity during 2010 and 2009.     The $2.9 billion decrease at December 31, 2010     compared to December 31, 2009 was driven by paydowns,     payoffs and charge-offs in the commercial real estate and     U.S. commercial portfolios. Approximately 95 percent     of commercial           nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties are     secured and approximately 40 percent are contractually     current. In addition, commercial nonperforming loans are carried     at approximately 68 percent of their unpaid principal     balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease     losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to     the estimated net realizable value.

(3)   Commercial loans and leases may be     restored to performing status when all principal and interest is     current and full repayment of the remaining contractual     principal and interest is expected or when the loan otherwise     becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. TDRs     are generally classified as performing after a sustained period     of demonstrated payment performance.         (4)   Business card loans are not     classified as nonperforming; therefore, the charge-offs on these     loans have no impact on nonperforming activity and accordingly     are excluded from this table.         (5)   Outstanding commercial loans and     leases exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.                    At December 31, 2010, the total commercial TDR balance was     $1.2 billion. Nonperforming TDRs were $952 million and     are included in Table 41. Nonperforming TDRs increased     $466 million while performing TDRs increased     $147 million during 2010.       U.S. commercial TDRs were $356 million, an increase of     $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.     Nonperforming U.S. commercial TDRs decreased     $52 million during 2010, while performing TDRs excluded     from nonperforming loans in Table 41 increased $112 million.       At December 31, 2010, the commercial real estate TDR     balance was $815 million, an increase of $547 million     during 2010. Nonperforming TDRs increased $524 million     during the year, while performing TDRs increased     $23 million.       At December 31, 2010 the     non-U.S. commercial     TDR balance was $19 million, an increase of     $6 million. Nonperforming TDRs decreased $6 million     during the year, while performing TDRs increased     $12 million.     Industry     Concentrations       Table 42 presents commercial committed and utilized credit     exposure by industry and the total net credit default protection     purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portions of certain     credit exposures. Our commercial           credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of     industries. The decline in commercial committed exposure of     $68.1 billion from December 31, 2009 to     December 31, 2010 was broad-based across most industries.       Industry limits are used internally to manage industry     concentrations and are based on committed exposures and capital     usage that are allocated on an     industry-by-industry     basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and     approve industry limits, as well as to provide ongoing     monitoring. Managements Credit Risk Committee (CRC)     oversees industry limit governance.       Diversified financials, our largest industry concentration,     experienced a decrease in committed exposure of     $25.8 billion, or 24 percent, at December 31,     2010 compared to December 31, 2009. This decrease was     driven primarily by a reduction in exposure to conduits tied to     the consumer finance industry.       Real estate, our second largest industry concentration,     experienced a decrease in committed exposure of     $21.1 billion, or 23 percent, at December 31,     2010 compared to December 31, 2009 due primarily to     portfolio attrition. Real estate construction and land     development exposure represented 27 percent of the total     real estate industry committed exposure at December 31,     2010. For more information on the commercial real estate and     related portfolios, refer to Commercial Real Estate beginning on     page 85.           Bank of America     2010     89     Table of Contents             The $11.8 billion, or 34 percent, decline in     individuals and trusts committed exposure was largely due to the     unwinding of two derivative transactions. Committed exposure in     the banking industry increased $6.3 billion, or 27 percent,     at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009     primarily due to increases in both traded products and loan     exposure as a result of momentum from growth initiatives. The     decline of $4.5 billion, or 10 percent, in consumer     services was concentrated in gaming and restaurants. Committed     exposure for the commercial services and supplies industry     declined $4.1 billion, or 12 percent, primarily due to     reduced loan demand and the sale of First Republic.       The recent economic downturn has had a residual effect on debt     issued by state and local municipalities and certain exposures     to these municipalities. While historically default rates were     low, stress on the municipalities financials due to the     economic downturn has increased the potential for defaults in     the near term. As part of our overall and ongoing risk     management processes, we continually monitor these exposures     through a rigorous review process. Additionally, internal     communications surrounding certain at-risk counterparties     and/or     sectors are regularly circulated ensuring exposure levels are     compliant with established concentration guidelines.     Monoline and     Related Exposure       Monoline exposure is reported in the insurance industry and     managed under insurance portfolio industry limits. Direct loan     exposure to monolines consisted of revolvers in the amount of     $51 million and $41 million at December 31, 2010     and 2009.       We have indirect exposure to monolines primarily in the form of     guarantees supporting our loans, investment portfolios,     securitizations and credit-enhanced securities as part of our     public finance business and other selected products. Such     indirect exposure exists when we purchase credit protection           from monolines to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on     certain credit exposures including loans and CDOs. We underwrite     our public finance exposure by evaluating the underlying     securities.       We also have indirect exposure to monolines, primarily in the     form of guarantees supporting our mortgage and other loan sales.     Indirect exposure may exist when credit protection was purchased     from monolines to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on     certain mortgage and other loan exposures. A loss may occur when     we are required to repurchase a loan and the market value of the     loan has declined or we are required to indemnify or provide     recourse for a guarantors loss. For additional information     regarding our exposure to representations and warranties, see     Note 9  Representations and Warranties     Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated     Financial Statements and Representations and Warranties     beginning on page 52. For additional information regarding     monolines, see Note 14  Commitments and     Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Monoline derivative credit exposure at December 31, 2010     had a notional value of $38.4 billion compared to     $42.6 billion at December 31, 2009.     Mark-to-market     monoline derivative credit exposure was $9.2 billion at     December 31, 2010 compared to $11.1 billion at     December 31, 2009 with the decrease driven by positive     valuation adjustments on legacy assets and terminated monoline     contracts. At December 31, 2010, the counterparty credit     valuation adjustment related to monoline derivative exposure was     $5.3 billion compared to $6.0 billion at     December 31, 2009. This reduced our net     mark-to-market     exposure to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2010 compared     to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2009. At     December 31, 2010, approximately 62 percent of this     exposure was related to one monoline compared to approximately     54 percent at December 31, 2009. We do not hold     collateral against these derivative exposures. For more     information on our monoline exposure, see GBAM beginning     on page 45.           90     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           We also have indirect exposure to monolines as we invest in     securities where the issuers have purchased wraps (i.e.,     insurance). For example, municipalities and corporations     purchase insurance in order to reduce their cost of borrowing.     If the ratings agencies downgrade the monolines, the credit     rating of the bond may fall and may have an adverse impact on     the market value of the security. In the case of default, we     first look to the underlying           securities and then to recovery on the purchased insurance.

(2)   Industries are viewed from a     variety of perspectives to best isolate the perceived risks. For     purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined     based on the borrowers or counterparties primary     business activity using operating cash flows and primary source     of repayment as key factors.         (3)   Represents net notional credit     protection purchased. See Risk Mitigation below for additional     information.                  Risk     Mitigation       We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as     well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To     lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection     levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry,     borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.       At December 31, 2010 and 2009, net notional credit default     protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to     hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the     fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures,     was $20.1 billion and $19.0 billion. The     mark-to-market     effects, including the cost of net credit default protection     hedging our           credit exposure, resulted in net losses of $546 million     during 2010 compared to net losses of $2.9 billion in 2009.     The average     Value-at-Risk     (VaR) for these credit derivative hedges was $53 million     for 2010 compared to $76 million for 2009. The average VaR     for the related credit exposure was $65 million in 2010     compared to $130 million in 2009. There is a     diversification effect between the net credit default protection     hedging our credit exposure and the related credit exposure such     that the combined average VaR was $41 million for 2010,     compared to $89 million for 2009. Refer to Trading Risk     Management beginning on page 100 for a description of our     VaR calculation for the market-based trading portfolio.

(3)   In addition to names which have not     been rated, NR includes $(1.5) billion and     $2.3 billion in net credit default swaps index positions at     December 31, 2010 and 2009. While index positions are     principally investment grade, credit default swaps indices     include names in and across each of the ratings categories.                      In addition to our net notional credit default protection     purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain     credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making     activities for clients and establishing positions intended to     profit from directional or relative value changes. We execute     the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market     with large, multinational financial institutions, including     broker/dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other     investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC     market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also           subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties     fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. In most     cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily     margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade,     depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit     covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of     collateral required of the counterparty, where applicable,     and/or allow     us to take additional protective measures such as early     termination of all trades.               92     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           The notional amounts presented in Table 45 represent the total     contract/notional amount of credit derivatives outstanding and     include both purchased and written credit derivatives. The     credit risk amounts are measured as the net replacement cost, in     the event the counterparties with contracts in a gain position     to us fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. For     information on the performance risk of our written credit     derivatives, see Note 4  Derivatives to     the Consolidated Financial Statements.             The credit risk amounts discussed on page 92 and noted in the     table below take into consideration the effects of legally     enforceable master netting agreements while amounts disclosed in     Note 4  Derivatives to the Consolidated     Financial Statements are shown on a gross basis. Credit risk     reflects the potential benefit from offsetting exposure to     non-credit derivative products with the same counterparties that     may be netted upon the occurrence of certain events, thereby     reducing the Corporations overall exposure.

These adjustments are necessary as     the market quotes on derivatives do not fully reflect the credit     risk of the counterparties to the derivative assets. We consider     collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements     that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in     determining the counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment.     All or a portion of these counterparty credit risk valuation     adjustments are reversed or otherwise adjusted in future periods     due to changes in the value of the derivative contract,     collateral and creditworthiness of the counterparty.             During 2010 and 2009, credit valuation gains (losses) of     $731 million and $3.1 billion ($(8) million and     $1.7 billion, net of hedges) were recognized in trading     account profits (losses) for counterparty credit risk related to     derivative assets. For additional information on gains or losses     related to the counterparty credit risk on derivative assets,     refer to Note 4  Derivatives to the     Consolidated Financial Statements. For information on our     monoline counterparty credit risk, see the discussions beginning     on pages 47 and 90, and for information on our CDO-related     counterparty credit risk, see GBAM beginning on     page 45.           Bank of America     2010     93     Table of Contents          Non-U.S.     Portfolio       Our     non-U.S. credit     and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define     country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and     political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability     and changes in government policies. A risk management framework     is in place to measure, monitor and manage     non-U.S. risk     and exposures. Management oversight of country risk, including     cross-border risk, is provided by the Regional Risk Committee, a     subcommittee of the CRC.       The following table sets forth total     non-U.S. exposure     broken out by region at December 31, 2010 and 2009.     Non-U.S. exposure     includes credit           exposure net of local liabilities, securities and other     investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the     U.S. Total     non-U.S. exposure     can be adjusted for externally guaranteed loans outstanding and     certain collateral types. Exposures which are subject to     external guarantees are reported under the country of the     guarantor. Exposures with tangible collateral are reflected in     the country where the collateral is held. For securities     received, other than cross-border resale agreements,     outstandings are assigned to the domicile of the issuer of the     securities. Resale agreements are generally presented based on     the domicile of the counterparty consistent with FFIEC reporting     requirements.         Table     46 Regional     Non-U.S.     Exposure (1, 2,      3)                                               December 31         (Dollars in millions)            2010               2009               Europe        $   148,078               $       170,796              Asia Pacific            73,255                   47,645              Latin America            14,848                   19,516              Middle East and Africa            3,688                   3,906              Other            22,188                   15,799                                                Total        $   262,057               $       257,662                                                        (1)   Local funding or liabilities are     subtracted from local exposures consistent with FFIEC reporting     requirements.         (2)   Derivative assets included in the     exposure amounts have been reduced by the amount of cash     collateral applied of $44.2 billion and $34.3 billion     at December 31, 2010 and 2009.         (3)   Generally, resale agreements are     presented based on the domicile of the counterparty, consistent     with FFIEC reporting requirements. Cross-border resale     agreements where the underlying securities are U.S. Treasury     securities, in which case the domicile is the U.S., are excluded     from this presentation.                    Our total     non-U.S. exposure     was $262.1 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase     of $4.4 billion from December 31, 2009. Our     non-U.S. exposure     remained concentrated in Europe which accounted for     $148.1 billion, or 57 percent, of total     non-U.S. exposure.     The European exposure was mostly in Western Europe and was     distributed across a variety of industries. The decrease of     $22.7 billion in Europe was primarily driven by our efforts     to reduce exposure in the peripheral Eurozone countries and sale     or maturity of securities in the U.K. Select European countries     are further detailed in Table 49. Asia Pacific was our second     largest     non-U.S. exposure     at $73.3 billion, or 28 percent. The     $25.6 billion increase in Asia Pacific was predominantly     driven by a required change in accounting for our CCB     investment, increased securities exposure in Japan, and     increased securities and loan exposure in other Asia Pacific     emerging markets. For more information on the required change in     accounting for our CCB investment, refer to     Note 5  Securities to the Consolidated     Financial Statements. Latin America accounted for     $14.8 billion, or six percent, of total     non-U.S. exposure.     The $4.7 billion decrease in Latin America was primarily     driven by the sale of our equity investments in Itaú     Unibanco and Santander. Other     non-U.S. exposure     was $22.2 billion at           December 31, 2010, an increase of $6.4 billion from     the prior year resulting from an increase in Canadian     cross-border loans. For more information on our Asia Pacific and     Latin America exposure, see     non-U.S. exposure     to selected countries defined as emerging markets on     page 95.       As shown in Table 47, the United Kingdom, France and China had     total cross-border exposure greater than one percent of our     total assets and were the only countries where total     cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of our total assets     at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, Canada and     Japan had total cross-border exposure of $17.9 billion and     $17.0 billion representing 0.79 percent and     0.75 percent of total assets. Canada and Japan were the     only other countries that had total cross-border exposure that     exceeded 0.75 percent of our total assets at     December 31, 2010.       Exposure includes cross-border claims by our     non-U.S. offices     including loans, acceptances, time deposits placed, trading     account assets, securities, derivative assets, other     interest-earning investments and other monetary assets. Amounts     also include unused commitments, SBLCs, commercial letters of     credit and formal guarantees. Sector definitions are consistent     with FFIEC reporting requirements for preparing the Country     Exposure Report.

Derivative assets were collateralized by other     marketable securities of $96 million, $26 million and     $71 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010.         (2)   At December 31, 2009, total     cross-border exposure for France and China was     $17.4 billion and $12.1 billion, representing     0.78 percent and 0.54 percent of total assets.              94     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents       As presented in Table 48,     non-U.S. exposure     to borrowers or counterparties in emerging markets increased     $14.5 billion to $65.1 billion at December 31,     2010 compared to $50.6 billion at December 31, 2009.     The increase was due to an increase in the Asia Pacific region     which was partially offset by a              decrease in Latin America.     Non-U.S. exposure     to borrowers or counterparties in emerging markets represented     25 percent and 20 percent of total     non-U.S. exposure     at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

               (1)   There is no generally accepted     definition of emerging markets. The definition that we use     includes all countries in Asia Pacific excluding Japan,     Australia and New Zealand; all countries in Latin America     excluding Cayman Islands and Bermuda; all countries in Middle     East and Africa; and all countries in Central and Eastern     Europe. At December 31, 2010, there was $460 million     in emerging market exposure accounted for under the fair value     option, none at December 31, 2009.         (2)   Includes acceptances, due froms,     SBLCs, commercial letters of credit and formal guarantees.         (3)   Derivative assets are carried at     fair value and have been reduced by the amount of cash     collateral applied of $1.2 billion and $557 million at     December 31, 2010 and 2009. At December 31, 2010 and     2009, there were $408 million and $616 million of     other marketable securities collateralizing derivative assets.         (4)   Generally, cross-border resale     agreements are presented based on the domicile of the     counterparty, consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements.     Cross-border resale agreements where the underlying securities     are U.S. Treasury securities, in which case the domicile is the     U.S., are excluded from this presentation.         (5)   Cross-border exposure includes     amounts payable to the Corporation by borrowers or     counterparties with a country of residence other than the one in     which the credit is booked, regardless of the currency in which     the claim is denominated, consistent with FFIEC reporting     requirements.         (6)   Local country exposure includes     amounts payable to the Corporation by borrowers with a country     of residence in which the credit is booked regardless of the     currency in which the claim is denominated. Local funding or     liabilities are subtracted from local exposures consistent with     FFIEC reporting requirements. Total amount of available local     liabilities funding local country exposure at December 31,     2010 was $15.7 billion compared to $17.6 billion at     December 31, 2009. Local liabilities at December 31,     2010 in Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East and Africa     were $15.1 billion, $451 million and     $193 million, respectively, of which $7.9 billion was     in Singapore, $1.8 billion in both China and Hong Kong,     $1.2 billion in India, $802 million in South Korea and     $573 million in Taiwan. There were no other countries with     available local liabilities funding local country exposure     greater than $500 million.         (7)   No country included in Other Asia     Pacific, Other Latin America, Other Middle East and Africa, and     Other Central and Eastern Europe had total     non-U.S.     exposure of more than $500 million.                      At December 31, 2010 and 2009, 70 percent and     53 percent of the emerging markets exposure was in Asia     Pacific. Emerging markets exposure in Asia Pacific increased by     $18.3 billion primarily driven by our equity investment in     CCB, which accounted for $10.6 billion, or 58 percent,     of the increase in Asia, and increases in loans in India and     securities in Singapore. The increase in our equity investment     in CCB was driven by a required change in accounting. For more     information on our CCB investment, refer to     Note 5  Securities to the Consolidated     Financial Statements.             At December 31, 2010 and 2009, 21 percent and     35 percent of the emerging markets exposure was in Latin     America. Latin America emerging markets exposure decreased     $3.8 billion driven by the sale of our equity investments     in Itaú Unibanco and Santander, which accounted for     $5.4 billion and $2.5 billion at December 31,     2009, partially offset by increased loans across the region. For     more information on these sales, refer to     Note 5  Securities to the Consolidated     Financial Statements.       At December 31, 2010 and 2009, six percent and seven     percent of the emerging markets exposure was in Middle East and     Africa, with a decrease of              Bank of America     2010     95     Table of Contents           $81 million primarily driven by a decrease in securities in     South Africa, offset by increases in loans in the United Arab     Emirates and South Africa, and securities in Bahrain. At     December 31, 2010 and 2009, three percent and five percent     of the emerging markets exposure was in Central and Eastern     Europe.       Certain European countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy,     Portugal and Spain, are currently experiencing varying degrees     of financial stress. These countries have had certain credit     ratings lowered by ratings services during 2010. Risks from the     debt crisis in Europe could result in a disruption of the           financial markets which could have a detrimental impact on the     global economic recovery and sovereign and non-sovereign debt in     these countries. The table below shows our direct sovereign and     non-sovereign exposures, excluding consumer credit card     exposure, in these countries at December 31, 2010. The     total exposure to these countries was $15.8 billion at     December 31, 2010 compared to $25.5 billion at     December 31, 2009. The $9.7 billion decrease since     December 31, 2009 was driven primarily by the sale or     maturity of sovereign and non-sovereign securities in all     countries.

Provision     for Credit Losses        The provision for credit losses decreased $20.1 billion to     $28.4 billion for 2010 compared to 2009. The provision for     credit losses for the consumer portfolio decreased     $11.4 billion to $25.4 billion for 2010 compared to     2009 reflecting lower delinquencies and decreasing bankruptcies     in the consumer credit card and unsecured consumer lending     portfolios resulting from an improving economic outlook. Also     contributing to the improvement were lower reserve additions in     consumer real estate due to improving portfolio trends. The     addition to reserves in the consumer PCI loan portfolios     reflected further reductions in expected principal cash flows of     $2.2 billion for 2010 compared to $3.5 billion a year     earlier. Consumer net charge-offs of $29.4 billion for 2010     were $4.2 billion higher than the prior year due to the     impact of the adoption of new             consolidation guidance resulting in the consolidation of certain     securitized loan balances in our consumer credit card and home     equity portfolios, offset by benefits from economic improvement     during the year which impacted all consumer portfolios.       The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio,     including the provision for unfunded lending commitments,     decreased $8.7 billion to $3.0 billion for 2010     compared to 2009 due to improved borrower credit profiles,     stabilization of appraisal values in the commercial real estate     portfolio and lower delinquencies and bankruptcies in the small     business portfolio. These same factors resulted in a decrease in     commercial net charge-offs of $3.5 billion to     $5.0 billion in 2010 compared to 2009.           96     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents          Allowance     for Credit Losses     Allowance for     Loan and Lease Losses       The allowance for loan and lease losses is allocated based on     two components, described below, based on whether a loan or     lease is performing or whether it has been individually     identified as being impaired or has been modified as a TDR. We     evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses     based on the total of these two components. The allowance for     loan and lease losses excludes loans     held-for-sale     and loans accounted for under the fair value option, as fair     value adjustments related to loans measured at fair value     include a credit risk component.       The first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses     covers nonperforming commercial loans, consumer real estate     loans that have been modified in a TDR, renegotiated credit     card, unsecured consumer and small business loans. These loans     are subject to impairment measurement primarily at the loan     level based either on the present value of expected future cash     flows discounted at the loans original effective interest     rate, or discounted at the portfolio average contractual annual     percentage rate, excluding renegotiated and promotionally priced     loans for the renegotiated TDR portfolio. Impairment measurement     may also be based upon the collateral value or the loans     observable market price. When the determined or measured values     are lower than the carrying value of the loan, impairment is     recognized. For purposes of computing this specific loss     component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated     individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool     using historical loss experience for the respective product     types and risk ratings of the loans.       The second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses     covers performing consumer and commercial loans and leases which     have incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable.     The allowance for consumer and certain homogeneous commercial     loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio     evaluations, generally by product type. Loss forecast models are     utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not     limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or     foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, economic     trends and credit scores. Our consumer real estate loss forecast     model estimates the portion of our homogeneous loans that will     default based on individual loan attributes, the most     significant of which are refreshed LTV or CLTV, borrower credit     score as well as vintage and geography, all of which are further     broken down into current delinquency status. Incorporating     refreshed LTV and CLTV into our probability of default allows us     to factor the impact of changes in home prices into our     allowance for loan and lease losses. These loss forecast models     are updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate information     reflecting the current economic environment. Included within     this second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses     and determined separately from the procedures outlined above are     reserves which are maintained to cover uncertainties that affect     our estimate of probable losses including domestic and global     economic uncertainty and large single name defaults. We evaluate     the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on     the combined total of these two components. As of     December 31, 2010, inputs to the loss forecast process     resulted in reductions in the allowance for most consumer     portfolios.       The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is     established by product type after analyzing historical loss     experience by internal risk rating, current economic conditions,     industry performance trends, geographic or obligor     concentrations within each portfolio segment, and any other     pertinent information. The statistical models for commercial     loans are generally updated annually and utilize the     Corporations historical database of actual defaults and     other data. The loan risk ratings and composition of the     commercial portfolios are updated at least quarterly to     incorporate the most recent data reflecting the current economic     environment. For risk-rated commercial loans, we estimate the     probability of default (PD) and the loss given           default (LGD) based on the Corporations historical     experience of defaults and credit losses. Factors considered     when assessing the internal risk rating include the value of the     underlying collateral, if applicable; the industry in which the     obligor operates; the obligors liquidity and other     financial indicators; and other quantitative and qualitative     factors relevant to the obligors credit risk. When     estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses, management     relies not only on models derived from historical experience but     also on its judgment in considering the effect on probable     losses inherent in the portfolios due to the current     macroeconomic environment and trends, inherent uncertainty in     models, and other qualitative factors. As of December 31,     2010, updates to the loan risk ratings and composition resulted     in reductions in the allowance for all commercial portfolios.       We monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred     loan and lease losses. This monitoring process includes periodic     assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios     and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those     portfolios.       Additions to, or reductions of, the allowance for loan and lease     losses generally are recorded through charges or credits to the     provision for credit losses. Credit exposures deemed to be     uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan and     lease losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are     credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses.       The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer     portfolio as presented in Table 51 was $34.7 billion at     December 31, 2010, an increase of $6.9 billion from     December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily related to     $10.8 billion of reserves recorded on January 1, 2010     in connection with the adoption of new consolidation guidance,     and higher reserve additions in the non-impaired consumer real     estate portfolios during the first half of 2010 amid continued     stress in the housing market. These items were partially offset     by reserve reductions primarily due to improving credit quality     in the Global Card Services consumer portfolios. With     respect to the consumer PCI loan portfolios, updates to our     expected principal cash flows resulted in an increase in     reserves through provision of $2.2 billion for 2010,     primarily in the home equity and discontinued real estate     portfolios compared to $3.5 billion in 2009.       The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses was     $7.2 billion at December 31, 2010, a $2.2 billion     decrease from December 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily     due to improvements in the U.S. small business commercial     portfolio within Global Card Services due to improved     delinquencies and bankruptcies, as well as in the     U.S. commercial portfolios primarily in Global     Commercial Banking and GBAM, and the commercial real     estate portfolio primarily within Global Commercial Banking     reflecting improved borrower credit profiles as a result of     improving economic conditions.       The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total     loans and leases outstanding was 4.47 percent at     December 31, 2010 compared to 4.16 percent at     December 31, 2009. The increase in the ratio was mostly due     to consumer reserve increases for securitized loans consolidated     under the new consolidation guidance, which were primarily     credit card loans. The December 31, 2010 and 2009 ratios     above include the impact of the PCI loan portfolio. Excluding     the PCI loan portfolio, the allowance for loan and lease losses     as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was     3.94 percent at December 31, 2010 compared to     3.88 percent at December 31, 2009.     Reserve for     Unfunded Lending Commitments       In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also     estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments     such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding loan     commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair     value option. Unfunded lending commitments are subject to the     same assessment as funded loans, including estimates of PD and     LGD. Due to the nature of unfunded commitments, the              Bank of America     2010     97     Table of Contents           estimate of probable losses must also consider utilization. To     estimate the portion of these undrawn commitments that is likely     to be drawn by a borrower at the time of estimated default,     analyses of the Corporations historical experience are     applied to the unfunded commitments to estimate the funded     exposure at default (EAD). The expected loss for unfunded     lending commitments is the product of the PD, the LGD and the     EAD, adjusted for any qualitative factors including economic     uncertainty and inherent uncertainty in models.             The reserve for unfunded lending commitments at     December 31, 2010 was $1.2 billion, $299 million     lower than December 31, 2009 primarily driven by accretion     of purchase accounting adjustments on acquired Merrill Lynch     unfunded positions and customer utilizations of previously     unfunded positions.

Bank of America     2010     99     Table of Contents          Market     Risk Management        Market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or     revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market     conditions such as market movements. This risk is inherent in     the financial instruments associated with our operations     and/or     activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term     borrowings, long-term debt, trading account assets and     liabilities, and derivatives. Market-sensitive assets and     liabilities are generated through loans and deposits associated     with our traditional banking business, customer and other     trading operations, the ALM process, credit risk mitigation     activities and mortgage banking activities. In the event of     market volatility, factors such as underlying market movements     and liquidity have an impact on the results of the Corporation.       Our traditional banking loan and deposit products are nontrading     positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for     assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost).     However, these positions are still subject to changes in     economic value based on varying market conditions, primarily     changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse     changes in the economic value of our nontrading positions is     managed through our ALM activities. We have elected to account     for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option.     For further information on the fair value of certain financial     assets and liabilities, see Note 22  Fair     Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes     currently reflected in income. Trading positions are subject to     various risk factors, which include exposures to interest rates     and foreign exchange rates, as well as mortgage, equity,     commodity, issuer and market liquidity risk factors. We seek to     mitigate these risk exposures by using techniques that encompass     a variety of financial instruments in both the cash and     derivatives markets. The following discusses the key risk     components along with respective risk mitigation techniques.     Interest Rate     Risk       Interest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose     values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates.     These instruments include, but are not limited to, loans, debt     securities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities,     deposits, borrowings and derivative instruments. Hedging     instruments used to mitigate these risks include derivatives     such as options, futures, forwards and swaps.     Foreign Exchange     Risk       Foreign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the     values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in     other currencies. The types of instruments exposed to this risk     include investments in     non-U.S. subsidiaries,     foreign currency-denominated loans and securities, future cash     flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange     transactions, foreign currency-denominated debt and various     foreign exchange derivative instruments whose values fluctuate     with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange     rates or     non-U.S. interest     rates. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include     foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures, forwards,     foreign currency-denominated debt and deposits.     Mortgage     Risk       Mortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the value of     mortgage-related instruments. The values of these instruments     are sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt     ratings, default, market liquidity, other interest rates,     government participation and interest rate volatility. Our     exposure to these instruments takes several forms. First, we     trade and engage in market-making activities in a variety of     mortgage securities including whole loans, pass-through     certificates, commercial mortgages, and collateralized mortgage     obligations (CMOs) including CDOs using mortgages as           underlying collateral. Second, we originate a variety of MBS     which involves the accumulation of mortgage-related loans in     anticipation of eventual securitization. Third, we may hold     positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans     as part of the ALM portfolio. Fourth, we create MSRs as part of     our mortgage origination activities. See     Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting     Principles and Note 25  Mortgage     Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements     for additional information on MSRs. Hedging instruments used to     mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options, currency     swaps, futures, forwards and foreign currency-denominated debt.     Equity Market     Risk       Equity market risk represents exposures to securities that     represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of     domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-linked     instruments. Instruments that would lead to this exposure     include, but are not limited to, the following: common stock,     exchange-traded funds, American Depositary Receipts, convertible     bonds, listed equity options (puts and calls),     over-the-counter     equity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures     and other equity derivative products. Hedging instruments used     to mitigate this risk include options, futures, swaps,     convertible bonds and cash positions.     Commodity     Risk       Commodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the     petroleum, natural gas, power and metals markets. These     instruments consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and     options. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include     options, futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity     product, as well as cash positions.     Issuer Credit     Risk       Issuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the     creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers. Our     portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an     asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of     credit spreads, by credit migration or by defaults. Hedging     instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, credit     default swaps and other credit fixed-income instruments.     Market Liquidity     Risk       Market liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of     expected market activity changes dramatically and, in certain     cases, may even cease to exist. This exposes us to the risk that     we will not be able to transact business and execute trades in     an orderly manner which may impact our results. This impact     could further be exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing     correlations are compromised by the disproportionate demand or     lack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk     mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail below.      Trading     Risk Management        Trading-related revenues represent the amount earned from     trading positions, including market-based net interest income,     in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading     account assets and liabilities and derivative positions are     reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see     Note 22  Fair Value Measurements to the     Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading-related revenues can     be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions     and customer demand. Trading-related revenues are dependent on     the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed,     and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time     within the ever-changing market environment.       The Global Markets Risk Committee (GRC), chaired by the Global     Markets Risk Executive, has been designated by ALMRC as the     primary governance              100     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           authority for Global Markets Risk Management including trading     risk management. The GRCs focus is to take a     forward-looking view of the primary credit and market risks     impacting GBAM and prioritize those that need a proactive     risk mitigation strategy. Market risks that impact lines of     business outside of GBAM are monitored and governed by     their respective governance authorities.       The GRC monitors significant daily revenues and losses by     business and the primary drivers of the revenues or losses.     Thresholds are in place for each of our businesses in order to     determine if the revenue or loss is considered to be significant     for that business. If any of the thresholds are exceeded, an     explanation of the variance is provided to the GRC. The     thresholds are developed in coordination with the respective     risk managers to highlight those revenues or losses that exceed     what is considered to be normal daily income statement     volatility.             The histogram below is a graphic depiction of trading volatility     and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for     the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, as compared with     the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. During the     twelve months ended December 31, 2010, positive     trading-related revenue was recorded for 90 percent of the     trading days of which 75 percent were daily trading gains     of over $25 million, four percent of the trading days had     losses greater than $25 million and the largest loss was     $102 million. This can be compared to the twelve months     ended December 31, 2009, where positive trading-related     revenue was recorded for 88 percent of the trading days of     which 72 percent were daily trading gains of over     $25 million, six percent of the trading days had losses     greater than $25 million and the largest loss was     $100 million.        Histogram     of Daily Trading-related Revenue                    To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the     actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well     as portfolios. VaR is a key statistic used to measure market     risk. In order to manage     day-to-day     risks, VaR is subject to trading limits both for our overall     trading portfolio and within individual businesses. All limit     excesses are communicated to management for review.       A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of     hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of     potential gains and losses. VaR represents the worst loss the     portfolio is expected to experience based on historical trends     with a given level of confidence and depends on the volatility     of the positions in the portfolio and on how strongly their     risks are correlated. Within any VaR model, there are     significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from     company to company. In addition, the accuracy of a VaR model     depends on the availability and quality of historical data for     each of the positions in the portfolio. A VaR model may require     additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not     have extensive historical price data or for illiquid positions     for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available.       A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of     potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios. There are     however many limitations inherent in a VaR model as it utilizes     historical results over a defined time period to estimate future     performance. Historical results may not always be indicative           of future results and changes in market conditions or in the     composition of the underlying portfolio could have a material     impact on the accuracy of the VaR model. In order for the VaR     model to reflect current market conditions, we update the     historical data underlying our VaR model on a bi-weekly basis     and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model.       We continually review, evaluate and enhance our VaR model so     that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio.     Nevertheless, due to the limitations mentioned above, we have     historically used the VaR model as only one of the components in     managing our trading risk and also use other techniques such as     stress testing and desk level limits. Periods of extreme market     stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying     degrees.       The accuracy of the VaR methodology is reviewed by backtesting     (i.e., comparing actual results against expectations derived     from historical data) the VaR results against the daily profit     and loss. Graphic representation of the backtesting results with     additional explanation of backtesting excesses are reported to     the GRC. Backtesting excesses occur when trading losses exceed     VaR. Senior management reviews and evaluates the results of     these tests. In periods of market stress, the GRC members     communicate daily to discuss losses and VaR limit excesses. As a     result of this process, the lines of business may selectively     reduce risk. Where economically feasible, positions are sold or     macroeconomic hedges are executed to reduce the exposure.               Bank of America     2010     101     Table of Contents           The graph below shows daily trading-related revenue and VaR for     the twelve months ended December 31, 2010. Actual losses     did not exceed daily trading VaR in the twelve months ended     December 31, 2010 and 2009. Our VaR model uses a historical     simulation approach based on three years of historical data             and an expected shortfall methodology equivalent to a     99 percent confidence level. Statistically, this means that     losses will exceed VaR, on average, one out of 100 trading days,     or two to three times each year.

The decrease in average VaR during 2010 resulted from reduced     exposures in several businesses. In addition, portfolio     diversification increased relative to average VaR, as exposure     changes resulted in reduced correlations across businesses.       Counterparty credit risk is an adjustment to the     mark-to-market     value of our derivative exposures reflecting the impact of the     credit quality of counterparties on our derivative assets. Since     counterparty credit exposure is not included in the VaR     component of the regulatory capital allocation, we do not     include it in our trading VaR, and it is therefore not included     in the daily trading-related revenue illustrated in our     histogram or used for backtesting.     Trading Portfolio     Stress Testing       Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can     exceed our estimates, we also stress test our     portfolio. Stress testing estimates the value change in our     trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market     movements. Various scenarios, categorized as either historical     or hypothetical, are regularly run and reported for the overall     trading portfolio and individual businesses. Historical     scenarios simulate the impact of price changes that occurred     during a set of extended historical market events. Generally, a     10-business-day window or longer, representing the most severe           point during a crisis, is selected for each historical scenario.     Hypothetical scenarios provide simulations of anticipated shocks     from predefined market stress events. These stress events     include shocks to underlying market risk variables which may be     well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to     calculate VaR. As with the historical scenarios, the     hypothetical scenarios are designed to represent a short-term     market disruption. Scenarios are reviewed and updated as     necessary in light of changing positions and new economic or     political information. In addition to the value afforded by the     results themselves, this information provides senior management     with a clear picture of the trend of risk being taken given the     relatively static nature of the shocks applied. Stress testing     for the trading portfolio is also integrated with     enterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits     framework. A process has been established to promote consistency     between the scenarios used for the trading portfolio and those     used for enterprise-wide stress testing. The scenarios used for     enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical     trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time     horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for     use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For     additional information on enterprise-wide stress testing, see     page 68.           102     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents          Interest     Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities       Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk     exposure to our nontrading exposures. Our overall goal is to     manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do     not adversely affect core net interest income. Interest rate     risk is measured as the potential volatility in our core net     interest income caused by changes in market interest rates.     Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking,     create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.     Interest rate risk from these activities, as well as the impact     of changing market conditions, is managed through our ALM     activities.       Simulations are used to estimate the impact on core net interest     income of numerous interest rate scenarios, balance sheet trends     and strategies. These simulations evaluate how changes in     short-term financial instruments, debt securities, loans,     deposits, borrowings and derivative instruments impact core net     interest income. In addition, these simulations incorporate     assumptions about balance sheet dynamics such as loan and     deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, and asset     and liability repricing and           maturity characteristics. These simulations do not include the     impact of hedge ineffectiveness.       Management analyzes core net interest income forecasts utilizing     different rate scenarios with the baseline utilizing     market-based forward interest rates. Management frequently     updates the core net interest income forecast for changing     assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends and     market conditions. Thus, we continually monitor our balance     sheet position in an effort to maintain an acceptable level of     exposure to interest rate changes.       We prepare forward-looking forecasts of core net interest     income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected     future business growth, ALM positioning and the direction of     interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward     curve. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative     interest rate scenarios have on the static baseline forecast in     order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied     conditions. The spot and     12-month     forward monthly rates used in our respective baseline forecast     at December 31, 2010 and 2009 are presented in the table     below.

The sensitivity analysis above assumes that we take no action in     response to these rate shifts over the indicated periods. At     December 31, 2010, the exposure as reported reflects     impacts that may be realized in net interest income. At     December 31, 2009, the estimated exposure as reported     reflects impacts that would have been realized primarily in net     interest income and card income.       Our core net interest income was asset sensitive to a parallel     move in interest rates at both December 31, 2010 and 2009.     The change in the interest rate risk position relative to     December 31, 2009 is primarily due to lower short-term     interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use     securities, residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign     exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity.         Securities       The securities portfolio is an integral part of our ALM position     and is primarily comprised of debt securities including MBS and     to a lesser extent U.S. Treasury, corporate, municipal and     other debt securities. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, AFS     debt securities were $337.6 billion and     $301.6 billion. During 2010 and 2009, we purchased AFS debt     securities of $199.2 billion and $185.1 billion, sold     $97.5 billion and $159.4 billion, and had maturities     and received paydowns of $70.9 billion and     $59.9 billion. We realized $2.5 billion and     $4.7 billion in net gains on sales of debt securities     during 2010 and 2009. In addition, we securitized     $2.4 billion and $14.0 billion of residential mortgage     loans into MBS during 2010 and 2009, which we retained.           Bank of America     2010     103     Table of Contents             During 2010, we entered into a series of transactions in our AFS     debt securities portfolio that involved securitizations as well     as sales of non-agency RMBS. These transactions were initiated     following a review of corporate risk objectives in light of     proposed Basel regulatory capital changes and liquidity targets.     For more information on the proposed regulatory capital changes,     see Capital Management  Regulatory Capital Changes     beginning on page 64. During 2010, the carrying value of     the non-agency RMBS portfolio was reduced $14.5 billion     primarily as a result of the aforementioned sales and     securitizations as well as paydowns. We recognized net losses of     $922 million on the series of transactions in the AFS debt     securities portfolio, and improved the overall credit quality of     the remaining portfolio such that the percentage of the     non-agency RMBS portfolio that is below investment-grade was     reduced significantly.       Accumulated OCI includes after-tax net unrealized gains of     $7.4 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31,     2010 and 2009, comprised primarily of after-tax net unrealized     gains of $714 million and after-tax net unrealized losses     of $628 million related to AFS debt securities and     after-tax net unrealized gains of $6.7 billion and     $2.1 billion related to AFS equity securities. The 2010     unrealized gain on marketable equity securities was related to     our investment in CCB. See Note 5  Securities     to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further     discussion on marketable equity securities. Total market value     of the AFS debt securities was $337.6 billion and     $301.6 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009 with a     weighted-average duration of 4.9 and 4.5 years, and     primarily relates to our MBS and U.S. Treasury portfolio.     The amount of pre-tax accumulated OCI related to AFS debt     securities increased by $2.2 billion during 2010 to     $1.1 billion, primarily due to sales of non-agency CMO     positions.       We recognized $967 million of OTTI losses through earnings     on AFS debt securities in 2010 compared to $2.8 billion in     2009. We also recognized $3 million of OTTI losses on AFS     marketable equity securities during 2010 compared to     $326 million in 2009.       The recognition of impairment losses on AFS debt and marketable     equity securities is based on a variety of factors, including     the length of time and extent to which the market value has been     less than cost, the financial condition of the issuer of the     security including credit ratings and the specific events     affecting the operations of the issuer, underlying assets that     collateralize the debt security, other industry and     macroeconomic conditions, and our intent and ability to hold the     security to recovery. We do not intend to sell securities with     unrealized losses and it is not more-likely-than-not that we     will be required to sell those securities before recovery of     amortized cost. Based on our evaluation of these and other     relevant factors, and after consideration of the losses     described in the paragraph above, we do not believe that the AFS     debt and marketable equity securities that are in an unrealized     loss position at December 31, 2010 are     other-than-temporarily     impaired.     Residential     Mortgage Portfolio       At December 31, 2010 and 2009, residential mortgages were     $258.0 billion and $242.1 billion. During 2010 and     2009, we retained $63.8 billion and $26.6 billion in     first mortgages originated by Home Loans &     Insurance. Outstanding residential mortgage loans increased     $15.8 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 as new FHA insured     origination volume was partially offset by paydowns, the sale of     $10.8 billion of residential mortgages related to First     Republic Bank, transfers to foreclosed properties and     charge-offs. In addition, FHA repurchases of delinquent loans     pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA also increased     the residential mortgage portfolio during 2010.           During 2010 and 2009, we securitized $2.4 billion and     $14.0 billion of residential mortgage loans into MBS which     we retained. We recognized gains of $68 million on     securitizations completed during 2010. For more information on     these securitizations, see Note 8      Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the     Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2010 and 2009, we had     no purchases of residential mortgages related to ALM activities.     We sold $443 million of residential mortgages during 2010,     of which $432 million were originated residential mortgages     and $11 million were previously purchased from third     parties. Net gains on these transactions were $21 million.     This compares to sales of $5.9 billion of residential     mortgages during 2009 of which $5.1 billion were originated     residential mortgages and $771 million were previously     purchased from third parties. These sales resulted in gains of     $47 million. We received paydowns of $38.2 billion and     $42.3 billion in 2010 and 2009.     Interest Rate and     Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts       Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are     utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to     manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use     derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in     fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign     exchange components. For additional information on our hedging     activities, see Note 4  Derivatives to     the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Our interest rate contracts are generally non-leveraged generic     interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures     and forwards. In addition, we use foreign exchange contracts,     including cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency     forward contracts and options to mitigate the foreign exchange     risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and     liabilities. Table 55 shows the notional amounts, fair value,     weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected     maturity and estimated duration of our open ALM derivatives at     December 31, 2010 and 2009. These amounts do not include     derivative hedges on our MSRs.       Changes to the composition of our derivatives portfolio during     2010 reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign     exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our     derivatives portfolio are based upon the current assessment of     economic and financial conditions including the interest rate     and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and     trends, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative     positions. The notional amount of our option positions increased     to $6.6 billion at December 31, 2010 from     $6.5 billion at December 31, 2009. Our interest rate     swap positions, including foreign exchange contracts, were a net     receive-fixed position of $6.4 billion and     $52.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The     decrease in the net notional levels of our interest rate swap     position was driven by the net addition of $51.6 billion in     pay-fixed swaps and $11.5 billion in foreign     currency-denominated receive-fixed swaps, offset by a reduction     of $5.6 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated     receive-fixed swaps. The notional amount of our foreign exchange     basis swaps was $235.2 billion and $122.8 billion at     December 31, 2010 and 2009. The $112.4 billion     notional change was primarily due to new trade activity during     2010 to mitigate cross-currency basis risk on our economic hedge     portfolio. The increase in pay-fixed swaps resulted from hedging     newly purchased U.S. Treasury Bonds with swaps and entering     into additional pay-fixed swaps to hedge variable rate     short-term liabilities. Our futures and forwards net notional     position, which reflects the net of long and short positions,     was a short position of $280 million at December 31,     2010 compared to a long position of $10.6 billion at     December 31, 2009.           104     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           The table below includes derivatives utilized in our ALM     activities including those designated as accounting and economic     hedging instruments. The fair value of net ALM contracts     increased $329 million to a gain of $12.6 billion at     December 31, 2010 compared to $12.3 billion at     December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily attributable     to changes in the value of U.S. dollar-           denominated receive-fixed interest rate swaps of     $3.3 billion, foreign exchange contracts of     $2.1 billion and foreign exchange basis swaps of     $197 million. The increase was partially offset by a loss     from the changes in the value of pay-fixed interest rate swaps     of $5.0 billion and option products of $294 million.

rate swap notional amounts that     represented forward starting swaps and will not be effective     until their respective contractual start dates were     $1.7 billion and $2.5 billion, and the forward     starting pay-fixed swap positions were $34.5 billion and     $76.8 billion.         (2)   Does not include basis adjustments     on either fixed-rate debt issued by the Corporation or AFS debt     securities which are hedged in fair value hedge relationships     using derivatives designated as hedging instruments that     substantially offset the fair values of these derivatives.         (3)     At December 31, 2010 and     2009, same-currency basis swaps consist of $152.8 billion     and $42.9 billion in both foreign currency and U.S.     dollar-denominated basis swaps in which both sides of the swap     are in the same currency.         (4)   Foreign exchange basis swaps     consisted of cross-currency variable interest rate swaps used     separately or in conjunction with receive-fixed interest rate     swaps.         (5)   Does not include foreign currency     translation adjustments on certain     non-U.S.     debt issued by the Corporation which substantially offset the     fair values of these derivatives.         (6)   Option products of     $6.6 billion at December 31, 2010 are comprised of     $160 million in purchased caps/floors, $8.2 billion in     swaptions and $(1.8) billion in foreign exchange options.     Option products of $6.5 billion at December 31, 2009     are comprised of $177 million in purchased caps/floors and     $6.3 billion in swaptions.         (7)   Foreign exchange contracts include     foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed     interest rate swaps as well as foreign currency forward rate     contracts. Total notional amount was comprised of     $57.6 billion in foreign currency-denominated and     cross-currency receive-fixed swaps and $52.0 billion in     foreign currency forward rate contracts at December 31,     2010, and $46.0 billion in foreign currency-denominated and     cross-currency receive-fixed swaps and $57.7 billion in     foreign currency forward rate contracts at December 31,     2009.         (8)   Reflects the net of long and short     positions.                      We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the     variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities,     including certain compensation costs and other forecasted     transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The     net losses on both open and terminated derivative instruments     recorded in accumulated OCI,     net-of-tax,     were $3.2 billion and $2.5 billion at     December 31, 2010 and 2009. These net losses are expected     to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the     hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or     increase expense on the respective           hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow     derivative hedge positions and no changes to prices or interest     rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at     December 31, 2010 the pre-tax net losses are expected to be     reclassified into earnings as follows: $1.8 billion, or     35 percent within the next year, 80 percent within     five years, and 92 percent within 10 years, with the     remaining eight percent thereafter. For more information on     derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 4      Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.           Bank of America     2010     105     Table of Contents             We hedge our net investment in     non-U.S. operations     determined to have functional currencies other than the     U.S. dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that     typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency     basis swaps, foreign exchange options and foreign     currency-denominated debt. We recorded after-tax losses on     derivatives and foreign currency-denominated debt in accumulated     OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by     gains on our net investments in consolidated     non-U.S. entities     at December 31, 2010.      Mortgage     Banking Risk Management        We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us     to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We     determine whether loans will be held for investment or     held-for-sale     at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks     by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate.       Interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the     mortgage business. Fluctuations in interest rates drive consumer     demand for new mortgages and the level of refinancing activity,     which in turn, affects total origination and service fee income.     Typically, a decline in mortgage interest rates will lead to an     increase in mortgage originations and fees and a decrease in the     value of the MSRs driven by higher prepayment expectations.     Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage     banking is a complex process that requires complex modeling and     ongoing monitoring. IRLCs and the related residential first     mortgage LHFS are subject to interest rate risk between the date     of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary     market. To hedge interest rate risk, we utilize forward loan     sale commitments and other derivative instruments including     purchased options. These instruments are used as economic hedges     of IRLCs and residential first mortgage LHFS. At     December 31, 2010 and 2009, the notional amount of     derivatives economically hedging the IRLCs and residential first     mortgage LHFS was $129.0 billion and $161.4 billion.       MSRs are nonfinancial assets created when the underlying     mortgage loan is sold to investors and we retain the right to     service the loan. We use certain derivatives such as interest     rate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts,     Eurodollar futures, as well as mortgage-backed and     U.S. Treasury securities as economic hedges of MSRs. The     notional amounts of the derivative contracts and other     securities designated as economic hedges of MSRs at     December 31, 2010 were $1.6 trillion and     $60.3 billion. At December 31, 2009, the notional     amounts of the derivative contracts and other securities     designated as economic hedges of MSRs were $1.3 trillion and     $67.6 billion. In 2010, we recorded gains in mortgage     banking income of $5.0 billion related to the change in     fair value of these economic hedges compared to losses of     $3.8 billion for 2009.

Compliance     Risk Management        Compliance risk is the risk posed by the failure to manage     regulatory, legal and ethical issues that could result in     monetary damages, losses or harm to our reputation or image. The     Seven Elements of a Compliance     Program®      provides the framework for the compliance programs that are     consistently applied across the Corporation to manage compliance     risk. This framework includes a common approach to commitment     and accountability, policies and procedures, controls and     supervision, monitoring and testing, regulatory change     management, education and awareness, and reporting.       We approach compliance risk management on an enterprise and line     of business level. The Operational and Compliance Risk     Committee, which is a     sub-committee     of the Operational Risk Committee, provides oversight of     significant compliance risk issues. Within Global Risk     Management, Global           Compliance Risk Management develops and implements the     strategies, policies and practices for assessing and managing     compliance risks across the organization. Through education and     communication efforts, a culture of compliance is emphasized     across the organization.       The lines of business are responsible for all the risks within     the business line, including compliance risks. Compliance risk     executives monitor and test business processes for compliance     and escalate risks and issues needing resolution.      Operational     Risk Management        The Corporation defines operational risk as the risk of loss     resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people     and systems or from external events. Operational risk may occur     anywhere in the Corporation, not solely in operations functions,     and its effects may extend beyond financial losses. Operational     risk includes legal risk. Successful operational risk management     is particularly important to diversified financial services     companies because of the nature, volume and complexity of the     financial services business. Global banking guidelines and     country-specific requirements for managing operational risk were     established in a set of rules known as Basel II. Basel II     requires banks have internal operational risk management     processes to assess and measure operational risk exposure and to     set aside appropriate capital to address those exposures.       Under the Basel II Rules, an operational loss event is an     event that results in a loss and is associated with any of the     following seven operational loss event categories: internal     fraud; external fraud; employment practices and workplace     safety; clients, products and business practices; damage to     physical assets; business disruption and system failures; and     execution, delivery and process management. Specific examples of     loss events include robberies, credit card fraud, processing     errors and physical losses from natural disasters.       We approach operational risk management from two perspectives:     (1) at the enterprise level and (2) at the line of     business and enterprise control function levels. The enterprise     level refers to risk across all of the Corporation. The line of     business level includes risk in all of the revenue producing     businesses. Enterprise control functions refer to the business     units that support the Corporations business operations.       The Operational Risk Committee oversees and approves the     Corporations policies and processes to assure sound     operational and compliance risk management and serves as an     escalation point for critical operational risk and compliance     matters within the Corporation. The Operational Risk Committee     reports to the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Board regarding     operational risk activities. Within the Global Risk Management     organization, the Corporate Operational Risk team develops and     guides the strategies, policies, practices, controls and     monitoring tools for assessing and managing operational risks     across the organization as well reporting results to governance     committees and the Board.       The lines of business and enterprise control functions are     responsible for all the risks within the business line,     including operational risks. In addition to enterprise risk     management tools like loss reporting, scenario analysis and risk     and control self-assessments, operational risk executives,     working in conjunction with senior line of business executives,     have developed key tools to help identify, measure, mitigate and     monitor risk in each line of business and enterprise control     function. Examples of these include personnel management     practices, data reconciliation processes, fraud management     units, transaction processing monitoring and analysis, business     recovery planning and new product introduction processes. The     lines of business and enterprise control functions are also     responsible for consistently implementing and monitoring     adherence to corporate practices. Line of business and     enterprise control function management uses the enterprise risk     and control self-assessment process to identify and evaluate the     status of risk and control              106     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           issues, including mitigation plans, as appropriate. The goal of     this process is to assess changing market and business     conditions, to evaluate key risks impacting each line of     business and enterprise control function and assess the controls     in place to mitigate the risks. The risk and control self     assessment process is documented at periodic intervals. Key     operational risk indicators for these risks have been developed     and are used to help identify trends and issues on an     enterprise, line of business and enterprise control function     level.       The enterprise control functions participate in two ways to the     operational risk management process. First, these organizations     manage risk in their functional department. Second, they provide     specialized risk management services within their area of     expertise to the enterprise and the lines of business and other     enterprise control functions they support. For example, the     Enterprise Information Management and Supply Chain Management     organizations in the Technology and Operations enterprise     control function, develop risk management practices, such as     information security and supplier management programs. These     groups also work with business and risk executives to develop     and guide appropriate strategies, policies, practices, controls     and monitoring tools for each line of business and enterprise     control function relative to these programs.       Additionally, where appropriate, insurance policies are     purchased to mitigate the impact of operational losses when and     if they occur. These insurance policies are explicitly     incorporated in the structural features of operational risk     evaluation. As insurance recoveries, especially given recent     market events, are subject to legal and financial uncertainty,     the inclusion of these insurance policies are subject to     reductions in their expected mitigating benefits.      Complex     Accounting Estimates        Our significant accounting principles, as described in     Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting     Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements are     essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our     significant accounting principles require complex judgments to     estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have     procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these     judgments.       The more judgmental estimates are summarized in the following     discussion. We have identified and described the development of     the variables most important in the estimation processes that,     with the exception of accrued taxes, involve mathematical models     to derive the estimates. In many cases, there are numerous     alternative judgments that could be used in the process of     determining the inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist,     we have used the factors that we believe represent the most     reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance     that differs from our estimates of the key variables could     impact net income. Separate from the possible future impact to     net income from input and model variables, the value of our     lending portfolio and market sensitive assets and liabilities     may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often     significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit     and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may     change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting     volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future     operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of     deficiencies in our models or inputs.     Allowance for     Credit Losses       The allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance     for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending     commitments, represents managements estimate of probable     losses inherent in the Corporations loan portfolio     excluding those loans accounted for under the fair value option.     Changes to the allowance for credit losses are reported in the     Consolidated Statement of Income in the provision for credit     losses. Our process for determining the allowance for credit     losses is discussed in Note 1  Summary of     Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated     Financial Statements.           We evaluate our allowance at the portfolio segment level and our     portfolio segments are home loans, credit card and other     consumer, and commercial. Due to the variability in the drivers     of the assumptions used in this process, estimates of the     portfolios inherent risks and overall collectability     change with changes in the economy, individual industries,     countries, and borrowers or counterparties ability     and willingness to repay their obligations. The degree to which     any particular assumption affects the allowance for credit     losses depends on the severity of the change and its     relationship to the other assumptions.       Key judgments used in determining the allowance for credit     losses include risk ratings for pools of commercial loans and     leases, market and collateral values and discount rates for     individually evaluated loans, product type classifications for     consumer and commercial loans and leases, loss rates used for     consumer and commercial loans and leases, adjustments made to     address current events and conditions, considerations regarding     domestic and global economic uncertainty, and overall credit     conditions.       Our estimate for the allowance for loan and lease losses is     sensitive to the loss rates and expected cash flows from our     home loans, and credit card and other consumer portfolio     segments. For each one percent increase in the loss rates on     loans collectively evaluated for impairment in our home loans     portfolio segment excluding PCI loans, coupled with a one     percent decrease in the discounted cash flows on those loans     individually evaluated for impairment within this portfolio     segment, the allowance for loan and lease losses at     December 31, 2010 would have increased by     $141 million. PCI loans within our home loans portfolio     segment are initially recorded at fair value. Applicable     accounting guidance prohibits carry-over or creation of     valuation allowances in the initial accounting. However,     subsequent decreases in the expected principal cash flows from     the date of acquisition result in a charge to the provision for     credit losses and a corresponding increase to the allowance for     loan and lease losses. We subject our PCI portfolio to stress     scenarios to evaluate the potential impact given certain events.     A one percent decrease in the expected principal cash flows     could result in a $297 million impairment of the portfolio,     of which $138 million would be related to our discontinued     real estate portfolio. For each one percent increase in the loss     rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment within our     credit card and other consumer portfolio segment coupled with a     one percent decrease in the expected cash flows on those loans     individually evaluated for impairment within this portfolio     segment, the allowance for loan and lease losses at     December 31, 2010 would have increased by $152 million.       Our allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the risk     ratings assigned to loans and leases within our Commercial     portfolio segment. Assuming a downgrade of one level in the     internal risk ratings for commercial loans and leases, except     loans and leases already risk-rated Doubtful as defined by     regulatory authorities, the allowance for loan and lease losses     would have increased by $6.7 billion at December 31,     2010. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of     total loans and leases at December 31, 2010 was     4.47 percent and this hypothetical increase in the     allowance would raise the ratio to 5.19 percent.       These sensitivity analyses do not represent managements     expectations of the deterioration in risk ratings or the     increases in loss rates but are provided as hypothetical     scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan     and lease losses to changes in key inputs. We believe the risk     ratings and loss severities currently in use are appropriate and     that the probability of the alternative scenarios outlined above     occurring within a short period of time is remote.       The process of determining the level of the allowance for credit     losses requires a high degree of judgment. It is possible that     others, given the same information, may at any point in time     reach different reasonable conclusions.           Bank of America     2010     107     Table of Contents         Mortgage     Servicing Rights       MSRs are nonfinancial assets that are created when a mortgage     loan is sold and we retain the right to service the loan. We     account for consumer MSRs at fair value with changes in fair     value recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income in     mortgage banking income. Commercial-related and residential     reverse mortgage MSRs are accounted for using the amortization     method (i.e., lower of cost or market) with impairment     recognized as a reduction of mortgage banking income. At     December 31, 2010, our total MSR balance was     $15.2 billion.       We determine the fair value of our consumer MSRs using a     valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated     future net servicing income. The model incorporates key economic     assumptions including estimates of prepayment rates and     resultant weighted-average lives of the MSRs, and the     option-adjusted spread (OAS) levels. These variables can, and     generally do change from quarter to quarter as market conditions     and projected interest rates change. These assumptions are     subjective in nature and changes in these assumptions could     materially affect our operating results. For example, decreasing     the prepayment rate assumption used in the valuation of our     consumer MSRs by 10 percent while keeping all other     assumptions unchanged could have resulted in an estimated     increase of $907 million in mortgage banking income at     December 31, 2010. This impact provided above does not     reflect any hedge strategies that may be undertaken to mitigate     such risk.       We manage potential changes in the fair value of MSRs through a     comprehensive risk management program. The intent is to mitigate     the effects of changes in the fair value of MSRs through the use     of risk management instruments. To reduce the sensitivity of     earnings to interest rate and market value fluctuations,     securities as well as certain derivatives such as options and     interest rate swaps may be used as economic hedges of the MSRs,     but are not designated as accounting hedges. These instruments     are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized     in mortgage banking income. For more information, see Mortgage     Banking Risk Management on page 106.       For additional information on MSRs, including the sensitivity of     weighted-average lives and the fair value of MSRs to changes in     modeled assumptions, see Note 25  Mortgage     Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements.     Also, for information on the impact of the time to complete     foreclosure sales on the value of MSRs, see Recent     Events  Certain Servicing-related Issues beginning on     page 34.     Fair Value of     Financial Instruments       We determine the fair values of financial instruments based on     the fair value hierarchy under applicable accounting guidance     which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable     inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when     measuring fair value. Applicable accounting guidance establishes     three levels of inputs used to measure fair value. We carry     trading account assets and liabilities, derivative assets and     liabilities, AFS debt and marketable equity securities, certain     MSRs and certain other assets at fair value. Also, we account     for certain corporate loans and loan commitments, LHFS,     commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, securities     financing agreements, asset-backed secured financings, long-term     deposits and long-term debt under the fair value option. For     more information, see Note 22  Fair Value     Measurements and Note 23  Fair Value Option     to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       The fair values of assets and liabilities include adjustments     for market liquidity, credit quality and other deal specific     factors, where appropriate. Valuations of products using models     or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the     significant inputs. Where market data is available, the inputs     used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation     date. Inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if     they are supported by little or no market activity. In periods     of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity           or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market     pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation     process. In keeping with the prudent application of estimates     and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets     and liabilities, we have in place various processes and controls     that include: a model validation policy that requires review and     approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing, financial     statement fair value determination and risk quantification; a     trading product valuation policy that requires verification of     all traded product valuations; and a periodic review and     substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded     products. Primarily through validation controls, we utilize both     broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both     market-observable and internally-modeled values     and/or     valuation inputs. Our reliance on this information is tempered     by the knowledge of how the broker     and/or     pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of     reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and     lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own     internal modeling. Similarly, broker quotes that are executable     are given a higher level of reliance than indicative broker     quotes, which are not executable. These processes and controls     are performed independently of the business.       Trading account assets and liabilities are carried at fair value     based primarily on actively traded markets where prices are from     either direct market quotes or observed transactions. Liquidity     is a significant factor in the determination of the fair value     of trading account assets and liabilities. Market price quotes     may not be readily available for some positions, or positions     within a market sector where trading activity has slowed     significantly or ceased. Situations of illiquidity generally are     triggered by market perception of credit uncertainty regarding a     single company or a specific market sector. In these instances,     fair value is determined based on limited available market     information and other factors, principally from reviewing the     issuers financial statements and changes in credit ratings     made by one or more of the ratings agencies.       Trading account profits (losses), which represent the net amount     earned from our trading positions, can be volatile and are     largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand.     Trading account profits (losses) are dependent on the volume and     type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the     volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within     the ever-changing market environment. To evaluate risk in our     trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential     volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios. At a     portfolio and corporate level, we use trading limits, stress     testing and tools such as VaR modeling, which estimates a     potential daily loss that we do not expect to exceed with a     specified confidence level, to measure and manage market risk.     For more information on VaR, see Trading Risk Management     beginning on page 100.       The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in     the OTC market are determined using quantitative models that     require the use of multiple market inputs including interest     rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or     pricing curves and volatility factors, which are used to value     the positions. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted     and can be validated through external sources including brokers,     market transactions and third-party pricing services. Estimation     risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions     that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates where     observable market inputs are less readily available or are     unobservable, in which case quantitative-based extrapolations of     rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair     values. The Corporation incorporates within its fair value     measurements of OTC derivatives the net credit differential     between the counterparty credit risk and our own credit risk.     The value of the credit differential is determined by reference     to existing direct market reference costs of credit, or where     direct references are not available, a proxy is applied     consistent with direct references for other counterparties that     are similar in credit risk. An estimate of severity of loss is     also used in the              108     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           determination of fair value, primarily based on historical     experience adjusted for any more recent name specific     expectations.     Level 3     Assets and Liabilities       Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on     prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both     unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value     measurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value     hierarchy established in applicable accounting guidance. The     Level 3 financial assets and liabilities include private     equity investments, consumer MSRs, ABS, highly structured,     complex or long-dated derivative contracts, structured notes and     certain CDOs, for which there is not an active market for           identical assets from which to determine fair value or where     sufficient, current market information about similar assets to     use as observable, corroborated data for all significant inputs     into a valuation model is not available. In these cases, the     fair values of these Level 3 financial assets and     liabilities are determined using pricing models, discounted cash     flow methodologies, a net asset value approach for certain     structured securities, or similar techniques for which the     determination of fair value requires significant management     judgment or estimation. In 2010, there were no changes to the     quantitative models, or uses of such models, that resulted in a     material adjustment to the Consolidated Statement of Income.

During 2010, we recognized net gains of $7.1 billion on     Level 3 assets and liabilities which were primarily gains     on net derivatives driven by income earned on IRLCs, which are     considered derivative instruments related to the origination of     mortgage loans that are     held-for-sale.     These gains were partially offset by changes in the value of     MSRs as a result of a decline in interest rates and OTTI losses     on non-agency RMBS. We also recorded pre-tax net unrealized     losses of $193 million in accumulated OCI on Level 3     assets and liabilities during 2010, primarily related to     non-agency RMBS.       Level 3 financial instruments, such as our consumer MSRs,     may be economically hedged with derivatives not classified as     Level 3; therefore, gains or losses associated with     Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or     losses associated with financial instruments classified in other     levels of the fair value hierarchy. The gains and losses     recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our     liquidity or capital resources.       We conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications     on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level 3 are     made if the significant inputs used in the financial models     measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became     unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current     marketplace. These transfers are effective as of the beginning     of the quarter.       During 2010, the more significant transfers into Level 3     included $3.2 billion of trading account assets,     $3.5 billion of AFS debt securities, $1.1 billion of     net derivative contracts and $1.9 billion of long-term     debt. Transfers into Level 3 for trading account assets     were driven by reduced price transparency as a result of lower     levels of trading activity for certain municipal auction rate     securities and corporate debt securities as well as a change in     valuation           methodology for certain ABS to a discounted cash flow model.     Transfers into Level 3 for AFS debt securities were due to     an increase in the number of non-agency RMBS and other taxable     securities priced using a discounted cash flow model. Transfers     into Level 3 for net derivative contracts were primarily     related to a lack of price observability for certain credit     default and total return swaps. Transfers in and transfers out     of Level 3 for long-term debt are primarily due to changes     in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of certain     equity-linked structured notes.       During 2010, the more significant transfers out of Level 3     were $3.4 billion of trading account assets and     $1.8 billion of long-term debt. Transfers out of     Level 3 for trading account assets were driven by increased     price verification of certain mortgage-backed securities,     corporate debt and     non-U.S. government     and agency securities. Transfers out of Level 3 for     long-term debt are the result of a decrease in the significance     of unobservable pricing inputs for certain equity-linked     structured notes.     Global Principal     Investments       Global Principal Investments is included within Equity     Investments in All Other on page 51. Global     Principal Investments is comprised of a diversified portfolio of     private equity, real estate and other alternative investments in     both privately held and publicly traded companies. These     investments are made either directly in a company or held     through a fund. At December 31, 2010, this portfolio     totaled $11.7 billion including $9.7 billion of     non-public investments.       Certain equity investments in the portfolio are subject to     investment-company accounting under applicable accounting     guidance, and accordingly,              Bank of America     2010     109     Table of Contents           are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in     equity investment income. Initially the transaction price of the     investment is generally considered to be the best indicator of     fair value. Thereafter, valuation of direct investments is based     on an assessment of each individual investment using     methodologies that include publicly traded comparables derived     by multiplying a key performance metric (e.g., earnings before     interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of the portfolio     company by the relevant valuation multiple observed for     comparable companies, acquisition comparables, entry-level     multiples and discounted cash flows, and are subject to     appropriate discounts for lack of liquidity or marketability.     Certain factors that may influence changes in fair value include     but are not limited to, recapitalizations, subsequent rounds of     financing and offerings in the equity or debt capital markets.     For fund investments, we generally record the fair value of our     proportionate interest in the funds capital as reported by     the funds respective managers.     Accrued Income     Taxes       Accrued income taxes, reported as a component of accrued     expenses and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance     Sheet, represents the net amount of current income taxes we     expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions     attributable to our operations to date. We currently file income     tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions and consider many     factors, including statutory, judicial and regulatory     guidance, in estimating the appropriate accrued income     taxes for each jurisdiction.       In applying the applicable accounting guidance, we monitor     relevant tax authorities and change our estimate of accrued     income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their     interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities. These     revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes, which also     may result from our income tax planning and from the resolution     of income tax controversies, may be material to our operating     results for any given period.     Goodwill and     Intangible Assets       Background       The nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets     are discussed in Note 1  Summary of Significant     Accounting Principles and Note 10  Goodwill     and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial     Statements. Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment at the     reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the     Corporation is performed as of June 30 and in interim periods if     events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. See     discussion about the annual impairment test as of June 30,     2010 on page 111. A reporting unit is a business segment or     one level below. As reporting units are determined after an     acquisition or evolve with changes in business strategy,     goodwill is assigned to reporting units and it no longer retains     its association with a particular acquisition. All of the     revenue streams and related activities of a reporting unit,     whether acquired or organic, are available to support the value     of the goodwill.       The Corporations common stock price, consistent with     common stock prices in the financial services industry, remains     volatile primarily due to the continued uncertainty in the     financial markets as well as recent financial reforms including     the Financial Reform Act. Our market capitalization has remained     below our recorded book value during 2010. The fair value of all     reporting units in aggregate as of the June 30, 2010 annual     impairment test was estimated to be $264.4 billion and the     common stock market capitalization of the Corporation as of that     date was $144.2 billion ($134.5 billion at     December 31, 2010). The implied control premium, which is     the amount a buyer would be willing to pay over the current     market price of a publicly traded stock to obtain control, was     63 percent after taking into consideration the outstanding     preferred stock of $18.0 billion as of June 30, 2010.     As none of our reporting units are publicly traded, individual     reporting unit fair value determinations are not directly     correlated to the Corporations stock price. Although we     believe it is reasonable to conclude that market capitalization           could be an indicator of fair value over time, we do not believe     that recent fluctuations in our market capitalization as a     result of the current economic conditions are reflective of     actual cash flows and the fair value of our individual reporting     units.       Estimating the fair value of reporting units and the assets,     liabilities and intangible assets of a reporting unit is a     subjective process that involves the use of estimates and     judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate     discount rates and an applicable control premium. The fair     values of the reporting units were determined using a     combination of valuation techniques consistent with the market     approach and the income approach and included the use of     independent valuation specialists. Measurement of the fair     values of the assets, liabilities and intangibles of a reporting     unit was consistent with the requirements of the fair value     measurements accounting guidance and includes the use of     estimates and judgments. The fair values of the intangible     assets were determined using the income approach.       The market approach we used estimates the fair value of the     individual reporting units by incorporating any combination of     the tangible capital, book capital and earnings multiples from     comparable publicly traded companies in industries similar to     that of the reporting unit. The relative weight assigned to     these multiples varies among the reporting units based upon     qualitative and quantitative characteristics, primarily the size     and relative profitability of the respective reporting unit     compared to the comparable publicly traded companies. Since the     fair values determined under the market approach are     representative of a noncontrolling interest, a control premium     was added to arrive at the reporting units estimated fair     values on a controlling basis.       For purposes of the income approach, we calculated discounted     cash flows using estimated future cash flows and an appropriate     terminal value. Our discounted cash flow analysis employs a     capital asset pricing model in estimating the discount rate     (i.e., cost of equity financing) for each reporting unit. The     inputs to this model include the risk-free rate of return, beta,     which is a measure of the level of non-diversifiable risk     associated with comparable companies for each specific reporting     unit, market equity risk premium and in certain cases an     unsystematic (company-specific) risk factor. The unsystematic     risk factor is the input that specifically addresses uncertainty     related to our projections of earnings and growth, including the     uncertainty related to loss expectations. We utilized discount     rates that we believe adequately reflect the risk and     uncertainty in the financial markets generally and specifically     in our internally developed forecasts. Expected rates of equity     returns were estimated based on historical market returns and     risk/return rates for similar industries of the reporting unit.     We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and     actual results may differ from forecasted results.     Global Card     Services Impairment       On July 21, 2010, the Financial Reform Act was signed into     law. Under the Financial Reform Act and its amendment to the     Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Federal Reserve must     adopt rules within nine months of enactment of the Financial     Reform Act regarding the interchange fees that may be charged     with respect to electronic debit transactions. Those rules will     take effect one year after enactment of the Financial Reform     Act. The Financial Reform Act and the applicable rules are     expected to materially reduce the future revenues generated by     the debit card business of the Corporation.       Our consumer and small business card products, including the     debit card business, are part of an integrated platform within     Global Card Services. During the three months ended     September 30, 2010, our estimate of revenue loss due to the     debit card interchange fee standards to be adopted under the     Financial Reform Act was approximately $2.0 billion     annually based on current volumes. Accordingly, we performed an     impairment test for Global Card Services during the three     months ended September 30, 2010. In step one of the     impairment test, the fair value of Global Card Services     was estimated under the income approach where the     significant assumptions included the              110     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           discount rate, terminal value, expected loss rates and expected     new account growth. We also updated our estimated cash flow     valuation to reflect the current strategic plan and other     portfolio assumptions. Based on the results of step one of the     impairment test, we determined that the carrying amount of     Global Card Services, including goodwill, exceeded the     fair value. The carrying amount, fair value and goodwill of the     reporting unit were $39.2 billion, $25.9 billion and     $22.3 billion, respectively. Accordingly, we performed step     two of the goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit. In     step two, we compared the implied fair value of the reporting     units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.     Under step two of the impairment test, significant assumptions     in measuring the fair value of the assets and liabilities     including discount rates, loss rates and interest rates were     updated to reflect the current economic conditions. Based on the     results of this third-quarter goodwill impairment test for     Global Card Services, the carrying value of the goodwill     assigned to the reporting unit exceeded the implied fair value     by $10.4 billion. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash,     non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of     $10.4 billion to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in     Global Card Services from $22.3 billion to     $11.9 billion. The goodwill impairment test included     limited mitigation actions to recapture lost revenue. Although     we have identified other potential mitigation actions within     Global Card Services, the impact of these actions going     forward did not reduce the goodwill impairment charge because     these actions are in the early stages of development and,     additionally, certain of them may impact segments other than     Global Card Services (e.g., Deposits). The     impairment charge had no impact on the Corporations     reported Tier 1 and tangible equity ratios.       Due to the continued stress on Global Card Services as a     result of the Financial Reform Act, we concluded that an     additional impairment analysis should be performed for this     reporting unit during the three months ended December 31,     2010. In step one of the goodwill impairment test, the fair     value of Global Card Services was estimated under the     income approach. The significant assumptions under the income     approach included the discount rate, terminal value, expected     loss rates and expected new account growth. The carrying amount,     fair value and goodwill for the Global Card Services     reporting unit were $27.5 billion, $27.6 billion     and $11.9 billion, respectively. The estimated fair value     as a percent of the carrying amount at December 31, 2010     was 100 percent. Although fair value exceeded the carrying     amount in step one of the Global Card Services goodwill     impairment test, to further substantiate the value of goodwill,     we also performed the step two test for this reporting unit.     Under step two of the goodwill impairment test for this     reporting unit, significant assumptions in measuring the fair     value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit     including discount rates, loss rates and interest rates were     updated to reflect the current economic conditions. The results     of step two of the goodwill impairment test indicated that     remaining balance of goodwill of $11.9 billion was not     impaired as of December 31, 2010.       On December 16, 2010, the Federal Reserve released proposed     regulations to implement the Durbin Amendment of the Financial     Reform Act, which are scheduled to be effective July 21,     2011. The proposed rule includes two alternative interchange fee     standards that would apply to all covered issuers: one based on     each issuers costs, with a safe harbor initially set at     $0.07 per transaction and a cap initially set at $0.12 per     transaction; and the other a stand-alone cap initially set at     $0.12 per transaction. See Regulatory Matters beginning on     page 56 for additional information. Although the range of     revenue loss estimate based on the proposed rule was slightly     higher than our original estimate of $2.0 billion, given     the uncertainty around the potential outcome, we did not change     the revenue loss estimate used in the goodwill impairment test     during the three months ended December 31, 2010. If the     final Federal Reserve rule sets interchange fee standards that     are significantly lower than the interchange fee assumptions we     used in this goodwill impairment test, we will be required to     perform an additional goodwill impairment           test which may result in additional impairment of goodwill in     Global Card Services. In view of the uncertainty with     model inputs including the final ruling, changes in the economic     outlook and the corresponding impact to revenues and asset     quality, and the impacts of mitigation actions, it is not     possible to estimate the amount or range of amounts of     additional goodwill impairment, if any.     Home     Loans & Insurance Impairment       During the three months ended December 31, 2010, we     performed an impairment test for the Home Loans &     Insurance reporting unit as it was likely that there was a     decline in its fair value as a result of increased     uncertainties, including existing and potential litigation     exposure and other related risks, higher current servicing costs     including loss mitigation efforts, foreclosure related issues     and the redeployment of centralized sales resources to address     servicing needs. In step one of the goodwill impairment test,     the fair value of Home Loans & Insurance was     estimated based on a combination of the market approach and the     income approach. Under the market approach valuation,     significant assumptions included market multiples and a control     premium. The significant assumptions for the valuation of     Home Loans & Insurance under the income     approach included cash flow estimates, the discount rate and the     terminal value. These assumptions were updated to reflect the     current strategic plan forecast and to address the increased     uncertainties referenced above. Based on the results of step one     of the impairment test, we determined that the carrying     amount of Home Loans & Insurance, including     goodwill, exceeded the fair value. The carrying amount, fair     value and goodwill for the Home Loans & Insurance     reporting unit were $24.7 billion, $15.1 billion     and $4.8 billion, respectively. Accordingly, we performed     step two of the goodwill impairment test for this reporting     unit. In step two, we compared the implied fair value of the     reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that     goodwill. Under step two of the goodwill impairment test,     significant assumptions in measuring the fair value of the     assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including discount     rates, loss rates and interest rates were updated to reflect the     current economic conditions. Based on the results of step two of     the impairment test, the carrying value of the goodwill assigned     to Home Loans & Insurance exceeded the implied     fair value by $2.0 billion. Accordingly, we recorded a     non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of     $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2010 to reduce the     carrying value of goodwill in the Home Loans &     Insurance reporting unit. The impairment charge had no     impact on the Corporations Tier 1 and tangible equity     ratios.       As we obtain additional information relative to our litigation     exposure, representations and warranties repurchase obligations,     servicing costs and foreclosure related issues, it is possible     that such information, if significantly different than the     assumptions used in this goodwill impairment test, may result in     additional impairment in the Home Loans & Insurance     reporting unit.     Annual Impairment     Test for 2010       We perform our annual goodwill impairment test for all reporting     units as of June 30 each year. In performing the first step of     the June 30, 2010 annual impairment test, we compared the     fair value of each reporting unit to its current carrying     amount, including goodwill. To determine fair value, we utilized     a combination of a market approach and an income approach. Under     the market approach, we compared earnings and equity multiples     of the individual reporting units to multiples of publicly     traded companies comparable to the individual reporting units.     The control premiums used in the June 30, 2010 annual     impairment test ranged from 25 to 35 percent. Under the     income approach, we updated our assumptions to reflect the     current market environment. The discount rates used in the     June 30, 2010 annual impairment test ranged from 11 to     15 percent depending on the relative risk of a reporting     unit. Because growth rates developed by management for              Bank of America     2010     111     Table of Contents           individual revenue and expense items have been significantly     affected by the current economic environment and financial     reform, management developed separate long-term forecasts. The     fair value of Global Card Services was estimated under     the income approach which did not include the impact of any     potential future changes that would result from the Financial     Reform Act because it was not signed into law until the third     quarter 2010.       Based on the results of step one of the annual impairment test,     we determined that the carrying amount of the Home     Loans & Insurance and Global Card Services     reporting units, including goodwill, exceeded their fair     value. The carrying amount, fair value and goodwill for the     Home Loans & Insurance reporting unit were     $27.1 billion, $22.5 billion and $4.8 billion,     respectively, and for Global Card Services were     $40.1 billion, $40.1 billion and $22.3 billion,     respectively. Because the carrying amount exceeded the fair     value, we performed step two of the goodwill impairment test for     these reporting units as of June 30, 2010. For all other     reporting units, step two was not required as their fair value     exceeded their carrying amount indicating there was no     impairment.       In step two for both reporting units, we compared the implied     fair value of each reporting units goodwill with the     carrying amount of that goodwill. We determined the implied fair     value of goodwill for a reporting unit by assigning the fair     value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities     of that unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as     if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business     combination. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit     over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the     implied fair value of goodwill. Significant assumptions in     measuring the fair value of the assets and liabilities of both     reporting units including discount rates, loss rates and     interest rates were updated to reflect the current economic     conditions. Based on the results of step two of the impairment     test as of June 30, 2010, we determined that goodwill was     not impaired in either Home Loans & Insurance     or Global Card Services.     Representations     and Warranties       The methodology used to estimate the liability for     representations and warranties is a function of the     representations and warranties given and considers a variety of     factors, which include depending upon the counterparty, actual     defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience,     estimated home prices, estimated probability that we will     receive a repurchase request, number of payments made by the     borrower prior to default and estimated probability that we will     be required to repurchase a loan. Changes to any one of these     factors could significantly impact the estimate of our     liability. Representations and warranties provision may vary     significantly each period as the methodology used to estimate     the expense continues to be refined based on the level and type     of repurchase requests presented, defects identified, the latest     experience gained on repurchase requests and other relevant     facts and circumstances. For those claims where we have     established a representations and warranties liability as     discussed in Note 9  Representations and     Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the     Consolidated Financial Statements, an assumed simultaneous     increase or decrease of 10 percent in estimated future     defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate would result     in an increase of approximately $850 million or decrease of     approximately $950 million in the representations and     warranties liability as of December 31, 2010. These     sensitivities are hypothetical and are intended to provide an     indication of the impact of a significant change in these key     assumptions on the representations and warranties liability. In     reality, changes in one assumption may result in changes in     other assumptions, which may or may not counteract the     sensitivity.       For additional information on representations and warranties,     see Representations and Warranties on page 52,     Note 9  Representations and Warranties Obligations     and Corporate Guarantees and Note 14      Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial     Statements.         Litigation     Reserve       In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the     Corporation establishes an accrued liability for litigation and     regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies     that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may     be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. When a     loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the     Corporation does not establish an accrued liability. As a     litigation or regulatory matter develops, the Corporation, in     conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter,     evaluates on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a     loss contingency that is both probable and estimable. If, at the     time of evaluation, the loss contingency related to a litigation     or regulatory matter is not both probable and estimable, the     matter will continue to be monitored for further developments     that would make such loss contingency both probable and     estimable. Once the loss contingency related to a litigation or     regulatory matter is deemed to be both probable and estimable,     the Corporation will establish an accrued liability with respect     to such loss contingency and record a corresponding amount of     litigation-related expense. The Corporation will continue to     monitor the matter for further developments that could affect     the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously     established.       For a limited number of the matters disclosed in Note 14      Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated     Financial Statements for which a loss is probable or reasonably     possible in future periods, whether in excess of a related     accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, we are     able to estimate a range of possible loss. In determining     whether it is possible to provide an estimate of loss or range     of possible loss, the Corporation reviews and evaluates its     material litigation and regulatory matters on an ongoing basis,     in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in     light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments.     These may include information learned through the discovery     process, rulings on dispositive motions, settlement discussions,     and other rulings by courts, arbitrators or others. In cases in     which the Corporation possesses sufficient information to     develop an estimate of loss or range of possible loss, that     estimate is aggregated and disclosed in Note 14      Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial     Statements. For other disclosed matters for which a loss is     probable or reasonably possible, such an estimate is not     possible. Those matters for which an estimate is not possible     are not included within this estimated range. Therefore, the     estimated range of possible loss represents what we believe to     be an estimate of possible loss only for certain matters meeting     these criteria. It does not represent the Corporations     maximum loss exposure. Information is provided in     Note 14  Commitments and Contingencies to the     Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the nature of all of     these contingencies and, where specified, the amount of the     claim associated with these loss contingencies.     Consolidation and     Accounting for Variable Interest Entities       The entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is     referred to as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE.     In accordance with the new consolidation guidance effective     January 1, 2010, the Corporation is deemed to have a     controlling financial interest and is the primary beneficiary of     a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the     VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic     performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to     receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the     VIE.           112     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents             Determining whether an entity has a controlling financial     interest in a VIE requires significant judgment. An entity must     assess the purpose and design of the VIE, including explicit and     implicit contractual arrangements, and the entitys     involvement in both the design of the VIE and its ongoing     activities. The entity must then determine which activities have     the most significant impact on the economic performance of the     VIE and whether the entity has the power to direct such     activities. For VIEs that hold financial assets, the party that     services the assets or makes investment management decisions may     have the power to direct the most significant activities of a     VIE. Alternatively, a third party that has the unilateral right     to replace the servicer or investment manager or to liquidate     the VIE may be deemed to be the party with power. If there are     no significant ongoing activities, the party that was     responsible for the design of the VIE may be deemed to have     power. If the entity determines that it has the power to direct     the most significant activities of the VIE, then the entity must     determine if it has either an obligation to absorb losses or the     right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant     to the VIE. Such economic interests may include investments in     debt or equity instruments issued by the VIE, liquidity     commitments, and explicit and implicit guarantees.       On a quarterly basis, we reassess whether we have a controlling     financial interest and are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The     quarterly reassessment process considers whether we have     acquired or divested the power to direct the activities of the     VIE through changes in governing documents or other     circumstances. The reassessment also considers whether we have     acquired or disposed of a financial interest that could be     significant to the VIE, or whether an interest in the VIE has     become significant or is no longer significant. The     consolidation status of the VIEs with which we are involved may     change as a result of such reassessments. Changes in     consolidation status are applied prospectively, with assets and     liabilities of a newly consolidated VIE initially recorded at     fair value. A gain or loss may be recognized upon     deconsolidation of a VIE depending on the carrying amounts of     deconsolidated assets and liabilities compared to the fair value     of retained interests and ongoing contractual arrangements.      2009     Compared to 2008        The following discussion and analysis provides a comparison of     our results of operations for 2009 and 2008. This discussion     should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial     Statements and related Notes. Tables 6 and 7 contain financial     data to supplement this discussion.      Overview      Net     Income       Net income totaled $6.3 billion in 2009 compared to     $4.0 billion in 2008. Including preferred stock dividends,     net loss applicable to common shareholders was     $2.2 billion, or $(0.29) per diluted share. Those results     compared with 2008 net income available to common     shareholders of $2.6 billion, or $0.54 per diluted share.     Net Interest     Income       Net interest income on a FTE basis increased $1.9 billion     to $48.4 billion for 2009 compared to 2008. The increase     was driven by the improved rate environment, the acquisitions of     Countrywide and Merrill Lynch, the impact of new draws on     previously securitized accounts and the contribution from     market-based net interest income which benefited from the     Merrill Lynch acquisition. These items were partially offset by     the impact of deleveraging the ALM portfolio earlier in 2009,     lower consumer loan levels and the adverse impact of     nonperforming loans. The net interest yield on a FTE basis     decreased 33 bps to 2.65 percent for 2009 compared to     2008 due to the factors related to the core businesses as     described above.         Noninterest     Income       Noninterest income increased $45.1 billion to     $72.5 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. Card income on a     held basis decreased $5.0 billion primarily due to higher     credit losses on securitized credit card loans and lower fee     income driven by changes in consumer retail purchase and payment     behavior in the stressed economic environment. Investment and     brokerage services increased $6.9 billion primarily due to     the acquisition of Merrill Lynch partially offset by the impact     of lower valuations in the equity markets driven by the market     downturn in late 2008, which improved modestly in 2009, and net     outflows in the cash funds. Investment banking income increased     $3.3 billion due to higher debt, equity and advisory fees     reflecting the increased size of the investment banking platform     from the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Equity investment income     increased $9.5 billion driven by $7.3 billion in gains     on sales of portions of our CCB investment and a     $1.1 billion gain related to our BlackRock investment.     Trading account profits (losses) increased $18.1 billion     primarily driven by favorable core trading results and reduced     write-downs on legacy assets partially offset by negative credit     valuation adjustments on derivative liabilities of     $662 million due to improvement in the Corporations     credit spreads. Mortgage banking income increased     $4.7 billion driven by higher production and servicing     income of $3.2 billion and $1.5 billion. These     increases were primarily due to increased volume as a result of     the full-year impact of Countrywide and higher refinance     activity partially offset by lower MSR results, net of hedges.     Gains on sales of debt securities increased $3.6 billion     due to the favorable interest rate environment and improved     credit spreads. Gains were primarily driven by sales of agency     MBS and CMOs. The net loss in other decreased $1.6 billion     primarily due to the $3.8 billion gain from the     contribution of our merchant processing business to a joint     venture, reduced support provided to cash funds and lower     write-downs on legacy assets offset by negative credit valuation     adjustments recorded on Merrill Lynch structured notes of     $4.9 billion.     Provision for     Credit Losses       The provision for credit losses increased $21.7 billion to     $48.6 billion for 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting further     deterioration in the economy and housing markets across a broad     range of property types, industries and borrowers. Net     charge-offs totaled $33.7 billion, or 3.58 percent of     average loans and leases for 2009 compared with     $16.2 billion, or 1.79 percent for 2008. The increased     level of net charge-offs is a result of the same factors noted     above.     Noninterest     Expense       Noninterest expense increased $25.2 billion to     $66.7 billion for 2009 compared to 2008. Personnel costs     and other general operating expenses rose due to the addition of     Merrill Lynch and the full-year impact of Countrywide.     Additionally, noninterest expense increased due to higher     litigation costs compared to the prior year, a $425 million     pre-tax charge to pay the U.S. government to terminate its     asset guarantee term sheet and higher FDIC insurance costs     including a $724 million special assessment in 2009.     Income Tax     Expense       Income tax benefit was $1.9 billion for 2009 compared to     expense of $420 million for 2008 and resulted in an     effective tax rate of (44.0) percent compared to     9.5 percent in the prior year. The change in the effective     tax rate from the prior year was due to increased permanent tax     preference items as well as a shift in the geographic mix of our     earnings driven by the addition of Merrill Lynch.           Bank of America     2010     113     Table of Contents          Business     Segment Operations     Deposits       Net income decreased $3.0 billion to $2.6 billion     driven by lower net revenue partially offset by an increase in     noninterest expense. Net interest income decreased     $3.8 billion driven by lower net interest income allocation     from ALM activities and spread compression as interest rates     declined. Noninterest income was essentially flat at     $6.8 billion. Noninterest expense increased     $908 million to $9.5 billion primarily due to higher     FDIC insurance including a special FDIC assessment, partially     offset by lower operating costs related to lower transaction     volume due to the economy and productivity initiatives.     Global Card     Services       Net income decreased $6.8 billion to a net loss of     $5.3 billion due to higher provision for credit losses. Net     interest income grew $667 million to $20.0 billion     driven by increased loan spreads. Noninterest income decreased     $2.6 billion to $9.1 billion driven by decreases in     card income and all other income. The decrease in card income     resulted from lower cash advances, credit card interchange and     fee income. All other income in 2008 included the gain     associated with the Visa initial public offering (IPO).     Provision for credit losses increased $10.0 billion to     $29.6 billion primarily driven by higher losses in the     consumer card and consumer lending portfolios from impact of the     economic conditions. Noninterest expense decreased     $1.2 billion to $7.7 billion primarily due to lower     operating and marketing costs, and the impact of certain     benefits associated with the Visa IPO transactions.     Home     Loans & Insurance   Home Loans & Insurance net loss increased     $1.3 billion to a net loss of $3.9 billion as growth     in noninterest income and net interest income was more than     offset by higher provision for credit losses and an increase in     noninterest expense. Net interest income grew $1.7 billion     driven primarily by an increase in average LHFS and home equity     loans. The growth in average LHFS was a result of higher     mortgage loan volume driven by the lower interest rate     environment. The growth in average home equity loans was     attributable to the migration of certain loans from GWIM     to Home Loans & Insurance as well as the     Countrywide acquisition. Noninterest income increased     $5.9 billion to $11.9 billion driven by higher     mortgage banking income which benefited from the Countrywide     acquisition and higher production income, partially offset by     higher representations and warranties provision. Provision for     credit losses increased $5.0 billion to $11.2 billion     driven primarily by higher losses in the home equity portfolio     and reserve increases in the Countrywide home equity PCI     portfolio. Noninterest expense increased $4.7 billion to     $11.7 billion primarily driven by the Countrywide     acquisition as well as increased costs related to higher     production volume.     Global Commercial     Banking       Net income decreased $2.9 billion to a net loss of     $290 million in 2009 as an increase in revenue was more     than offset by increased credit costs. Net interest income was     essentially flat at $8.1 billion. Noninterest income     increased $552 million to $3.1 billion largely driven     by our agreement to           purchase certain retail automotive loans. The provision for     credit losses increased $4.5 billion to $7.8 billion,     driven by reserve additions primarily in the commercial real     estate portfolio and higher net charge-offs across all     portfolios. Noninterest expense increased $501 million     primarily attributable to higher FDIC insurance, including a     special FDIC assessment.     Global     Banking & Markets   Global Banking & Markets recognized net income     of $10.1 billion in 2009 compared to a net loss of     $3.2 billion in 2008 as increased noninterest income driven     by trading account profits was partially offset by higher     noninterest expense. Sales and trading revenue was     $17.6 billion in 2009 compared to a loss of     $6.9 billion in 2008 primarily due to the addition of     Merrill Lynch. Noninterest income also included a     $3.8 billion pre-tax gain related to the contribution of     the merchant processing business into a joint venture.     Noninterest expense increased $8.6 billion, largely     attributable to the Merrill Lynch acquisition.     Global     Wealth & Investment Management       Net income increased $702 million to $1.7 billion in     2009 as higher total revenue was partially offset by increases     in noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. Net     interest income increased $1.2 billion to $6.0 billion     primarily due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Noninterest     income increased $8.6 billion to $10.1 billion     primarily due to higher investment and brokerage services income     and the lower level of support provided to certain cash funds,     partially offset by the impact of lower average equity market     levels and net outflows primarily in the cash complex. Provision     for credit losses increased $397 million to     $1.1 billion, reflecting the weak economy during 2009 which     drove higher net charge-offs in the consumer real estate and     commercial portfolios. Noninterest expense increased     $8.3 billion to $12.4 billion driven by the addition     of Merrill Lynch and higher FDIC insurance, including a special     FDIC assessment, partially offset by lower revenue-related     expenses.     All     Other       Net income in All Other was $1.3 billion in 2009     compared to a net loss of $1.1 billion in 2008 as higher     total revenue driven by increases in noninterest income, net     interest income and an income tax benefit were partially offset     by increased provision for credit losses, merger and     restructuring charges and all other noninterest expense. Net     interest income increased $1.5 billion primarily due to     unallocated net interest income related to increased liquidity     driven in part by capital raises during 2009. Noninterest income     increased $8.2 billion to $10.6 billion driven by     higher equity investment income including a $7.3 billion     gain on the sale of a portion of our CCB investment and gains on     sales of debt securities. These were partially offset by a     $4.9 billion negative valuation adjustment on certain     structured liabilities. Provision for credit losses was     $8.0 billion in 2009 compared to $2.8 billion in 2008     primarily due to higher credit costs related to our ALM     residential mortgage portfolio. Merger and restructuring charges     increased $1.8 billion to $2.7 billion due to the     integration costs associated with the Merrill Lynch and     Countrywide acquisitions.           114     Bank

                                     (1)   Fees earned on overnight deposits     placed with the Federal Reserve, which were included in time     deposits placed and other short-term investments in prior     periods, have been reclassified to cash and cash equivalents,     consistent with the Corporations Consolidated Balance     Sheet presentation of these deposits. Net interest income and     net interest yield are calculated excluding these fees.         (2)   Yields on AFS debt securities are     calculated based on fair value rather than the cost basis. The     use of fair value does not have a material impact on net     interest yield.         (3)   Nonperforming loans are included in     the respective average loan balances. Income on these     nonperforming loans is recognized on a cash basis. Purchased     credit-impaired loans were written down to fair value upon     acquisition and accrete interest income over the remaining life     of the loan.         (4)   Includes     non-U.S.     residential mortgage loans of $410 million and     $622 million in 2010 and 2009. There were no material     non-U.S.     residential mortgage loans prior to January 1, 2009.         (5)   Includes     non-U.S.     consumer loans of $7.9 billion, $8.0 billion and     $2.7 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.         (6)   Includes consumer finance loans of     $2.1 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.8 billion;     other     non-U.S.     consumer loans of $731 million, $657 million and     $774 million; and consumer overdrafts of $111 million,     $217 million and $247 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008,     respectively.         (7)   Includes U.S. commercial real     estate loans of $57.3 billion, $70.7 billion and     $62.1 billion; and     non-U.S.     commercial real estate loans of $2.7 billion,     $2.7 billion and $1.1 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008,     respectively.         (8)   Interest income includes the impact     of interest rate risk management contracts, which decreased     interest income on the underlying assets $1.4 billion,     $456 million and $260 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008,     respectively. Interest expense includes the impact of interest     rate risk management contracts, which increased (decreased)     interest expense on the underlying liabilities     $(3.5) billion, $(3.0) billion and $409 million     in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Approximately $76 million     of the estimated $429 million in contractual interest was     received and included in earnings for 2010.

Bank of America     2010     131     Table of Contents       Glossary      Alt-A Mortgage  Alternative-A mortgage, a type     of U.S. mortgage that, for various reasons, is considered     riskier than A-paper, or prime, and less risky than     subprime, the riskiest category. Alt-A interest     rates, which are determined by credit risk, therefore tend to be     between those of prime and subprime home loans. Typically, Alt-A     mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full     documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs.   Assets in Custody  Consist largely of     custodial and non-discretionary trust assets excluding brokerage     assets administered for clients. Trust assets encompass a broad     range of asset types including real estate, private company     ownership interest, personal property and investments.   Assets Under Management (AUM)  The total     market value of assets under the investment advisory and     discretion of GWIM which generate asset management fees     based on a percentage of the assets market values. AUM     reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional,     high net-worth and retail clients and are distributed through     various investment products including mutual funds, other     commingled vehicles and separate accounts.   Bridge Financing  A loan or security that is     expected to be replaced by permanent financing (debt or equity     securities, loan syndication or asset sales) prior to the     maturity date of the loan. Bridge loans may include an unfunded     commitment, as well as funded amounts, and are generally     expected to be retired in one year or less.   Client Brokerage Assets  Include client assets     which are held in brokerage accounts. This includes     non-discretionary brokerage and fee-based assets which generate     brokerage income and asset management fee revenue.   Client Deposits  Includes GWIM client     deposit accounts representing both consumer and commercial     demand, regular savings, time, money market, sweep and     non-U.S. accounts.   Committed Credit Exposure  Includes any funded     portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on     which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a     specified period under prescribed conditions.   Core Net Interest Income  Net interest income     on a fully taxable-equivalent basis excluding the impact of     market-based activities.   Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act     of 2009 (CARD Act)  Legislation signed into law     on May 22, 2009 to provide changes to credit card industry     practices including significantly restricting credit card     issuers ability to change interest rates and assess fees     to reflect individual consumer risk, change the way payments are     applied and requiring changes to consumer credit card     disclosures. The majority of the provisions became effective in     February 2010.   Credit Default Swap (CDS)  A derivative     contract that provides protection against the deterioration of     credit quality and allows one party to receive payment in the     event of default by a third party under a borrowing arrangement.   Excess Servicing Income  For certain assets     that have been securitized, interest income, fee revenue and     recoveries in excess of interest paid to the investors, gross     credit losses and other trust expenses related to the     securitized receivables are all classified as excess servicing     income, which is a component of card income. Excess servicing     income also includes the changes in fair value of the     Corporations card-related retained interests.   Interest-only Strip  A residual interest in a     securitization trust representing the right to receive future     net cash flows from securitized assets after payments to     third-party investors and net credit losses. These arise when     assets are transferred to a SPE as part of an asset     securitization transaction qualifying for sale treatment under     GAAP.   Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC)      Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms,     including interest rate and price, are guaranteed for a     designated period of time subject to credit approval.   Letter of Credit  A document issued on behalf     of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party     upon presentation of specified documents. A           letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuers     credit for that of the customer.   Loan-to-value     (LTV)  A commonly used credit quality metric that     is reported in terms of ending and average LTV. Ending LTV is     calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan at the     end of the period divided by the estimated value of the property     securing the loan. Estimated property values are primarily     determined by utilizing the Case-Schiller Home Index, a widely     used index based on data from repeat sales of single family     homes. Case-Schiller indices are updated quarterly and are     reported on a three-month or one-quarter lag. An additional     metric related to LTV is combined     loan-to-value     (CLTV) which is similar to the LTV metric, yet combines the     outstanding balance on the residential mortgage loan and the     outstanding carrying value on the home equity loan or available     line of credit, both of which are secured by the same property,     divided by the estimated value of the property. A LTV of     100 percent reflects a loan that is currently secured by a     property valued at an amount exactly equal to the carrying value     or available line of the loan. Under certain circumstances,     estimated values can also be determined by utilizing an     automated valuation method (AVM) or Mortgage Risk Assessment     Corporation (MRAC) index. An AVM is a tool that estimates the     value of a property by reference to large volumes of market data     including sales of comparable properties and price trends     specific to the MSA in which the property being valued is     located. The MRAC index is similar to the Case-Schiller Home     Index in that it is an index that is based on data from repeat     sales of single family homes and is reported on a lag.   Making Home Affordable Program (MHA)  A     U.S. Treasury program to reduce the number of foreclosures     and make it easier for homeowners to refinance loans. The     program is comprised of the Home Affordable Modification Program     (HAMP) which provides guidelines on loan modifications and is     designed to help at-risk homeowners avoid foreclosure by     reducing monthly mortgage payments and provides incentives to     lenders to modify all eligible loans that fall under the program     guidelines and the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP)     which is available to homeowners who have a proven payment     history on an existing mortgage owned by FNMA or FHLMC and is     designed to help eligible homeowners refinance their mortgage     loans to take advantage of current lower mortgage rates or to     refinance ARMs into more stable fixed-rate mortgages. In     addition, the Second Lien Program is a part of the MHA. For more     information on this program, see the separate definition for the     Second Lien Program.   Mortgage Servicing Right (MSR)  The right to     service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or     securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal,     interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for     and remitting principal and interest payments to investors.   Net Interest Yield  Net interest income     divided by average total interest-earning assets.   Nonperforming Loans and Leases  Includes loans     and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including     nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured     in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing     financial difficulties (troubled debt restructurings or TDRs).     Loans accounted for under the fair value option, purchased     credit-impaired loans and loans     held-for-sale     are not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. Consumer     credit card loans, business card loans, consumer loans not     secured by real estate, and consumer loans secured by real     estate where repayments are insured by the Federal Housing     Administration are not placed on nonaccrual status and are,     therefore, not reported as nonperforming loans and leases.   Purchased Credit-impaired (PCI) Loan  A loan     purchased as an individual loan, in a portfolio of loans or in a     business combination with evidence of deterioration in credit     quality since origination for which it is probable, upon              132     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           acquisition, that the investor will be unable to collect all     contractually required payments. These loans are written down to     fair value at the acquisition date.   Second Lien Program (2MP)  A MHA program     announced on April 28, 2009 by the U.S. Treasury that     focuses on creating a comprehensive affordability solution for     homeowners. By focusing on shared efforts with lenders to reduce     second mortgage payments,     pay-for-success     incentives for servicers, investors and borrowers, and a payment     schedule for extinguishing second mortgages, the 2MP is designed     to help up to 1.5 million homeowners. The program is     designed to ensure that first and second lien holders are     treated fairly and consistently with priority of liens, and     offers automatic modification of a second lien when a first lien     is modified.   Subprime Loans  Although a standard industry     definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage     loans) does not exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as     specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers, including     individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk     factors, such as low FICO scores, high debt to income ratios and     inferior payment history.   Super Senior CDO Exposure  Represents the most     senior class of commercial paper or notes that are issued by CDO     vehicles. These financial instruments benefit from the     subordination of all other securities, including AAA-rated     securities, issued by CDO vehicles.   Tier 1 Common Capital  Tier 1     capital including CES, less preferred stock, qualifying trust     preferred securities, hybrid securities and qualifying     noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries.         Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)  A     program established under the Emergency Economic Stabilization     Act of 2008 by the U.S. Treasury to, among other things,     invest in financial institutions through capital infusions and     purchase mortgages, MBS and certain other financial instruments     from financial institutions, in an aggregate amount up to     $700 billion, for the purpose of stabilizing and providing     liquidity to the U.S. financial markets.   Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs)  Loans     whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that     grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial     difficulties. Concessions could include a reduction in the     interest rate on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of     principal, forbearance or other actions intended to maximize     collection. TDRs are generally reported as nonperforming loans     and leases while on nonaccrual status. TDRs that are on accrual     status are reported as performing TDRs through the end of the     calendar year in which the restructuring occurred or the year in     which they are returned to accrual status. In addition, if     accruing TDRs bear less than a market rate of interest at the     time of modification, they are reported as performing TDRs     throughout their remaining lives.   Value-at-Risk     (VaR)  A VaR model estimates a range of     hypothetical scenarios to calculate a potential loss which is     not expected to be exceeded with a specified confidence level.     VaR is a key statistic used to measure and manage market risk.

Item 8.     FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA        Report of     Management on Internal Control     Over Financial Reporting       The management of Bank of America Corporation is responsible for     establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over     financial reporting.       The Corporations internal control over financial reporting     is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding     the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of     financial statements for external purposes in accordance with     accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of     America. The Corporations internal control over financial     reporting includes those policies and procedures that     (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in     reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the     transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Corporation;     (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are     recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial     statements in accordance with accounting principles generally     accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and     expenditures of the Corporation are being made only in     accordance with authorizations of management and directors of     the Corporation; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance     regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized     acquisition, use, or disposition of the Corporations     assets that could have a material effect on the financial     statements.       Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over     financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.     Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future     periods are subject to the risk that controls may become     inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree     of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.       Management assessed the effectiveness of the Corporations     internal control over financial reporting as of     December 31, 2010 based on the           framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations     of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control      Integrated Framework. Based on that assessment, management     concluded that, as of December 31, 2010, the     Corporations internal control over financial reporting is     effective based on the criteria established in Internal     Control  Integrated Framework.       The Corporations internal control over financial reporting     as of December 31, 2010 has been audited by     PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, an independent registered public     accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report which     expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the     Corporations internal control over financial reporting as     of December 31, 2010.        Brian T. Moynihan Chief Executive Officer and President        Charles H. Noski Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President               Bank of America     2010     135     Table of Contents    Report     of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm             To the Board of     Directors and Shareholders of Bank of America     Corporation:       In our opinion, the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet and     the related Consolidated Statement of Income, Consolidated     Statement of Changes in Shareholders Equity and     Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows present fairly, in all     material respects, the financial position of Bank of America     Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and     2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows     for each of the three years in the period ended     December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles     generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our     opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects,     effective internal control over financial reporting as of     December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in     Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by     the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway     Commission (COSO). The Corporations management is     responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining     effective internal control over financial reporting and for its     assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over     financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of     Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our     responsibility is to express opinions on these financial     statements and on the Corporations internal control over     financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted     our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public     Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those     standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain     reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are     free of material misstatement and whether effective internal     control over financial reporting was maintained in all material     respects. Our audits of the financial statements included     examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and     disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the     accounting principles used and significant estimates made by     management, and evaluating the overall financial statement     presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial     reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal     control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a     material           weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and     operating effectiveness of internal control based on the     assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other     procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We     believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our     opinions.       A companys internal control over financial reporting is a     process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the     reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of     financial statements for external purposes in accordance with     generally accepted accounting principles. A companys     internal control over financial reporting includes those     policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance     of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly     reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the     company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that     transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of     financial statements in accordance with generally accepted     accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the     company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of     management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide     reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of     unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the     companys assets that could have a material effect on the     financial statements.       Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over     financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.     Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future     periods are subject to the risk that controls may become     inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree     of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

      During 2010, the Corporation sold First Republic Bank in a     non-cash transaction that reduced assets and liabilities by     $19.5 billion and $18.1 billion.          The Corporation securitized $2.4 billion,     $14.0 billion and $26.1 billion of residential     mortgage loans into mortgage-backed securities which were     retained by the Corporation during 2010, 2009 and 2008,     respectively.          During 2009, the Corporation exchanged $14.8 billion of     preferred stock by issuing approximately 1.0 billion shares     of common stock valued at $11.5 billion.          During 2009, the Corporation exchanged credit card loans of     $8.5 billion and the related allowance for loan and lease     losses of $750 million for a $7.8 billion     held-to-maturity     debt security that was issued by the Corporations     U.S. credit card securitization trust and retained by the     Corporation.         The acquisition-date fair values of non-cash assets acquired and     liabilities assumed in the Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.     (Merrill Lynch) acquisition were $619.1 billion and     $626.8 billion.         Approximately 1.4 billion shares of common stock valued at     approximately $20.5 billion and 376 thousand shares of     preferred stock valued at approximately $8.6 billion were     issued in connection with the Merrill Lynch acquisition.         The acquisition-date fair values of non-cash assets acquired and     liabilities assumed in the Countrywide Financial Corporation     (Countrywide) acquisition were $157.4 billion and     $157.8 billion.          Approximately 107 million shares of common stock, valued at     approximately $4.2 billion were issued in connection with     the Countrywide acquisition.

Bank of America     2010     141     Table of Contents       Bank     of America Corporation and Subsidiaries        Notes to     Consolidated Financial Statements           NOTE 1 Summary     of Significant Accounting Principles        Bank of America Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries,     the Corporation), a financial holding company, provides a     diverse range of financial services and products throughout the     U.S. and in certain international markets. The term     the Corporation as used herein may refer to the     Corporation individually, the Corporation and its subsidiaries,     or certain of the Corporations subsidiaries or affiliates.       The Corporation conducts its activities through banking and     nonbanking subsidiaries. On January 1, 2009, the     Corporation acquired Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.     (Merrill Lynch) in exchange for common and preferred stock with     a value of $29.1 billion. The Corporation operates its     banking activities primarily under two charters: Bank of     America, National Association (Bank of America, N.A.) and FIA     Card Services, N.A. In connection with certain acquisitions     including Merrill Lynch, the Corporation acquired banking     subsidiaries that have been merged into Bank of America, N.A.     with no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the     Corporation.      Principles of     Consolidation and Basis of Presentation       The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of     the Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries, and those     variable interest entities (VIEs) where the Corporation is the     primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have     been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired companies are     included from the dates of acquisition and for VIEs, from the     dates that the Corporation became the primary beneficiary.     Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not included     in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation     accounts for investments in companies for which it owns a voting     interest of 20 percent to 50 percent and for which it     has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating     and financing decisions using the equity method of accounting or     at fair value under the fair value option. These investments are     included in other assets. Equity method investments are subject     to impairment testing and the Corporations proportionate     share of income or loss is included in equity investment income.       The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in     conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the     United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make     estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and     disclosures. Realized results could differ from those estimates     and assumptions.       The Corporation evaluates subsequent events through the date of     filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).     Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform     to current period presentation.       New Accounting     Pronouncements       In March 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)     issued new accounting guidance on embedded credit derivatives.     This new accounting guidance clarifies the scope exception for     embedded credit derivatives and defines which embedded credit     derivatives are required to be evaluated for bifurcation and     separate accounting. In addition, the guidance extends the     current disclosure requirements for credit derivatives to all     securities with potential embedded derivative features     regardless of the accounting treatment. This new accounting     guidance was effective on July 1, 2010. Upon adoption,     companies may elect the fair value option for any beneficial     interests, including those that would otherwise require     bifurcation under the new           guidance. In connection with the adoption of the guidance on     July 1, 2010, the Corporation elected the fair value option     for $629 million of AFS debt securities, principally     collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), that otherwise may be     subject to bifurcation under the new guidance. In connection     with this election, the Corporation recorded a $229 million     charge to retained earnings on July 1, 2010 as an after-tax     adjustment to reclassify the net unrealized loss on these AFS     debt securities from accumulated other comprehensive income     (OCI) to retained earnings and they were reclassified to trading     account assets. The Corporation did not bifurcate any securities     as a result of adopting the new accounting guidance. The     additional disclosures required by this new guidance are     included in Note 4  Derivatives.         On January 1, 2010, the Corporation adopted new FASB     accounting guidance on transfers of financial assets and     consolidation of VIEs. This new accounting guidance revised sale     accounting criteria for transfers of financial assets,     eliminated the concept of and accounting for qualifying special     purpose entities (QSPEs) and significantly changed the criteria     for consolidation of a VIE. The adoption of this new accounting     guidance resulted in the consolidation of certain VIEs that     previously were QSPEs and VIEs that were not recorded on the     Corporations Consolidated Balance Sheet prior to     January 1, 2010. The adoption of this new accounting     guidance resulted in a net incremental increase in assets of     $100.4 billion and a net increase in liabilities of     $106.7 billion. These amounts are net of retained interests     in securitizations held on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at     December 31, 2009 and net of a $10.8 billion increase     in the allowance for loan and lease losses. The Corporation     recorded a $6.2 billion charge,     net-of-tax,     to retained earnings on January 1, 2010 for the cumulative     effect of the adoption of this new accounting guidance, which     resulted principally from an increase in the allowance for loan     and lease losses related to the newly consolidated loans, and a     $116 million charge to accumulated OCI. Initial recording     of these assets, related allowance and liabilities on the     Corporations Consolidated Balance Sheet had no impact at     the date of adoption on the consolidated results of operations.         On January 1, 2010, the Corporation adopted, on a     prospective basis, new FASB accounting guidance stating that     troubled debt restructuring (TDR) accounting cannot be applied     to individual loans within purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loan     pools. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material     impact on the Corporations consolidated financial     condition or results of operations.      Cash and Cash     Equivalents       Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in     the process of collection, and amounts due from correspondent     banks and the Federal Reserve Bank.     Securities     Financing Agreements       Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and     securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase     (securities financing agreements) are treated as collateralized     financing transactions. These agreements are recorded at the     amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus     accrued interest, except for certain securities financing     agreements that the Corporation accounts for under the fair     value option. Changes in the fair value of securities financing     agreements that are accounted for under the fair value option     are recorded in other income (loss). For more              142     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents             information on securities financing agreements that the     Corporation accounts for under the fair value option, see     Note 23  Fair Value Option.       The Corporations policy is to obtain possession of     collateral with a market value equal to or in excess of the     principal amount loaned under resale agreements. To ensure that     the market value of the underlying collateral remains     sufficient, collateral is generally valued daily and the     Corporation may require counterparties to deposit additional     collateral or may return collateral pledged when appropriate.     Securities financing agreements give rise to negligible credit     risk as a result of these collateral provisions, and     accordingly, no allowance for loan losses is considered     necessary.       Substantially all repurchase and resale activities are     transacted under master repurchase agreements which give the     Corporation, in the event of default by the counterparty, the     right to liquidate securities held and to offset receivables and     payables with the same counterparty. The Corporation offsets     repurchase and resale transactions with the same counterparty on     the Consolidated Balance Sheet where it has such a master     agreement and the transactions have the same maturity date.       In transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a     securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be     pledged or sold as collateral, it recognizes an asset on the     Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, representing the     securities received, and a liability for the same amount,     representing the obligation to return those securities.       At the end of certain quarterly periods during the three years     ended December 31, 2009, the Corporation had recorded     certain sales of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) which,     based on an ongoing internal review and interpretation, should     have been recorded as secured borrowings. These periods and     amounts were as follows: March 31,     2009  $573 million; September 30,     2008  $10.7 billion; December 31,     2007  $2.1 billion; and March 31,     2007  $4.5 billion. As the transferred     securities were recorded at fair value in trading account     assets, the change would have had no impact on consolidated     results of operations. Had the sales been recorded as secured     borrowings, trading account assets and federal funds purchased     and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase     would have increased by the amount of the transactions, however,     the increase in all cases was less than 0.7 percent of     total assets or total liabilities. Accordingly, the Corporation     believes that these transactions did not have a material impact     on the Corporations Consolidated Financial Statements.       In repurchase transactions, typically, the termination date for     a repurchase agreement is before the maturity date of the     underlying security. However, in certain situations, the     Corporation may enter into repurchase agreements where the     termination date of the repurchase transaction is the same as     the maturity date of the underlying security and these     transactions are referred to as     repo-to-maturity     (RTM) transactions. The Corporation enters into RTM transactions     only for high quality, very liquid securities such as     U.S. Department of the Treasury (U.S. Treasury)     securities or securities issued by government-sponsored     enterprises (GSE). The Corporation accounts for RTM transactions     as sales in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, and     accordingly, removes the securities from the Consolidated     Balance Sheet and recognizes a gain or loss in the Consolidated     Statement of Income. At December 31, 2010, the Corporation     had no outstanding RTM transactions compared to     $6.5 billion at December 31, 2009, that had been     accounted for as sales.     Collateral       The Corporation accepts collateral that it is permitted by     contract or custom to sell or repledge and such collateral is     recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31,     2010 and 2009, the fair value of this collateral was     $401.7 billion and $418.2 billion of which     $257.6 billion and $310.2 billion were sold or     repledged. The primary sources of this collateral are repurchase     agreements and securities borrowed. The Corporation also pledges     securities           and loans as collateral in transactions that include repurchase     agreements, securities loaned, public and trust deposits,     U.S. Treasury tax and loan notes, and other short-term     borrowings. This collateral can be sold or repledged by the     counterparties to the transactions.       In addition, the Corporation obtains collateral in connection     with its derivative contracts. Required collateral levels vary     depending on the credit risk rating and the type of     counterparty. Generally, the Corporation accepts collateral in     the form of cash, U.S. Treasury securities and other     marketable securities. Based on provisions contained in legal     netting agreements, the Corporation nets cash collateral against     the applicable derivative fair value. The Corporation also     pledges collateral on its own derivative positions which can be     applied against derivative liabilities.     Trading     Instruments       Financial instruments utilized in trading activities are carried     at fair value. Fair value is generally based on quoted market     prices or quoted market prices for similar assets and     liabilities. If these market prices are not available, fair     values are estimated based on dealer quotes, pricing models,     discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques where     the determination of fair value may require significant     management judgment or estimation. Realized and unrealized gains     and losses are recognized in trading account profits (losses).     Derivatives and     Hedging Activities       Derivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for     trading, as economic hedges or as qualifying accounting hedges.     Derivatives utilized by the Corporation include swaps, financial     futures and forward settlement contracts, and option contracts.     A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange     cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts,     assets     and/or     indices. Financial futures and forward settlement contracts are     agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a financial instrument,     index, currency or commodity at a predetermined future date, and     rate or price. An option contract is an agreement that conveys     to the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or     sell a quantity of a financial instrument (including another     derivative financial instrument), index, currency or commodity     at a predetermined rate or price during a period or at a date in     the future. Option agreements can be transacted on organized     exchanges or directly between parties.       All derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet     at fair value, taking into consideration the effects of legally     enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Corporation     to settle positive and negative positions and offset cash     collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis. For     exchange-traded contracts, fair value is based on quoted market     prices. For non-exchange traded contracts, fair value is based     on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow     methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination     of fair value may require significant management judgment or     estimation.       Valuations of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the     value of the instrument including counterparty credit risk.     These values also take into account the Corporations own     credit standing, thus including in the valuation of the     derivative instrument the value of the net credit differential     between the counterparties to the derivative contract.     Trading     Derivatives and Economic Hedges       Derivatives held for trading purposes are included in derivative     assets or derivative liabilities with changes in fair value     included in trading account profits (losses).       Derivatives used as economic hedges, because either they did not     qualify for or were not designated as an accounting hedge, are     also included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities.     Changes in the fair value of              Bank of America     2010     143     Table of Contents             derivatives that serve as economic hedges of mortgage servicing     rights (MSRs), interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and first     mortgage loans     held-for-sale     (LHFS) that are originated by the Corporation are recorded in     mortgage banking income. Changes in the fair value of     derivatives that serve as asset and liability management (ALM)     economic hedges are recorded in other income (loss). Credit     derivatives used by the Corporation as economic hedges do not     qualify as accounting hedges despite being effective economic     hedges, and changes in the fair value of these derivatives are     included in other income (loss).     Derivatives Used     For Hedge Accounting Purposes (Accounting Hedges)       For accounting hedges, the Corporation formally documents at     inception all relationships between hedging instruments and     hedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and     strategies for undertaking various accounting hedges.     Additionally, the Corporation primarily uses regression analysis     at the inception of a hedge and for each reporting period     thereafter to assess whether the derivative used in a hedging     transaction is expected to be and has been highly effective in     offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged     item. The Corporation discontinues hedge accounting when it is     determined that a derivative is not expected to be or has ceased     to be highly effective as a hedge, and then reflects changes in     fair value of the derivative in earnings after termination of     the hedge relationship.       The Corporation uses its accounting hedges as either fair value     hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign     operations. The Corporation manages interest rate and foreign     currency exchange rate sensitivity predominantly through the use     of derivatives. Fair value hedges are used to protect against     changes in the fair value of the Corporations assets and     liabilities that are attributable to interest rate or foreign     exchange volatility. Cash flow hedges are used primarily to     minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities,     or forecasted transactions caused by interest rate or foreign     exchange fluctuations. For terminated cash flow hedges, the     maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are     hedged is 26 years, with a substantial portion of the     hedged transactions being less than 10 years. For open or     future cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which     forecasted transactions are or will be hedged is less than seven     years.       Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair     value hedges are recorded in earnings, together and in the same     income statement line item with changes in the fair value of the     related hedged item. Changes in the fair value of derivatives     designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated OCI     and are reclassified into the line item in the income statement     in which the hedged item is recorded and in the same period the     hedged item affects earnings. Hedge ineffectiveness and gains     and losses on the excluded component of a derivative in     assessing hedge effectiveness are recorded in earnings in the     same income statement line item. The Corporation records changes     in the fair value of derivatives used as hedges of the net     investment in foreign operations, to the extent effective, as a     component of accumulated OCI.       If a derivative instrument in a fair value hedge is terminated     or the hedge designation removed, the previous adjustments to     the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability are     subsequently accounted for in the same manner as other     components of the carrying amount of that asset or liability.     For interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities,     such adjustments are amortized to earnings over the remaining     life of the respective asset or liability. If a derivative     instrument in a cash flow hedge is terminated or the hedge     designation is removed, related amounts in accumulated OCI are     reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during     which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. If it     is probable that a           forecasted transaction will not occur, any related amounts in     accumulated OCI are reclassified into earnings in that period.     Interest Rate     Lock Commitments       The Corporation enters into IRLCs in connection with its     mortgage banking activities to fund residential mortgage loans     at specified times in the future. IRLCs that relate to the     origination of mortgage loans that will be held for sale are     considered derivative instruments under applicable accounting     guidance. As such, these IRLCs are recorded at fair value with     changes in fair value recorded in mortgage banking income.       In estimating the fair value of an IRLC, the Corporation assigns     a probability to the loan commitment based on an expectation     that it will be exercised and the loan will be funded. The fair     value of the commitments is derived from the fair value of     related mortgage loans which is based on observable market data     and includes the expected net future cash flows related to     servicing of the loans. Changes to the fair value of IRLCs are     recognized based on interest rate changes, changes in the     probability that the commitment will be exercised and the     passage of time. Changes from the expected future cash flows     related to the customer relationship are excluded from the     valuation of IRLCs.       Outstanding IRLCs expose the Corporation to the risk that the     price of the loans underlying the commitments might decline from     inception of the rate lock to funding of the loan. To protect     against this risk, the Corporation utilizes forward loan sales     commitments and other derivative instruments, including interest     rate swaps and options, to economically hedge the risk of     potential changes in the value of the loans that would result     from the commitments. The changes in the fair value of these     derivatives are recorded in mortgage banking income.     Securities       Debt securities are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet     as of the trade date and classified based on managements     intention on the date of purchase. Debt securities which     management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are     classified as     held-to-maturity     (HTM) and reported at amortized cost. Debt securities that are     bought and held principally for the purpose of resale in the     near term are classified as trading and are carried at fair     value with unrealized gains and losses included in trading     account profits (losses). Other debt securities are classified     as AFS and carried at fair value with net unrealized gains and     losses included in accumulated OCI on an after-tax basis. In     addition, credit-related notes, which include investments in     securities issued by CDOs, collateralized loan obligations     (CLOs) and credit-linked note vehicles, are classified as     trading securities.       The Corporation regularly evaluates each AFS and HTM debt     security where the value has declined below amortized cost to     assess whether the decline in fair value is     other-than-temporary.     In determining whether an impairment is     other-than-temporary,     the Corporation considers the severity and duration of the     decline in fair value, the length of time expected for recovery,     the financial condition of the issuer, and other qualitative     factors, as well as whether the Corporation either plans to sell     the security or it is more-likely-than-not that it will be     required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized     cost. Beginning in 2009, under new accounting guidance for     impairments of debt securities that are deemed to be     other-than-temporary,     the credit component of an     other-than-temporary     impairment (OTTI) loss is recognized in earnings and the     non-credit component is recognized in accumulated OCI in     situations where the Corporation does not intend to sell the     security and it is not more-likely-than-not that the Corporation     will be required to sell the security prior to recovery. Prior     to January 1, 2009, unrealized losses, both the credit and     non-credit components, on AFS debt securities that were deemed     to be     other-than-temporary     were included in current-period earnings. If there is an OTTI on     any individual security classified as HTM, the              144     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents             Corporation writes down the security to fair value with a     corresponding charge to other income (loss).       Interest on debt securities, including amortization of premiums     and accretion of discounts, is included in interest income.     Realized gains and losses from the sales of debt securities,     which are included in gains (losses) on sales of debt     securities, are determined using the specific identification     method.       Marketable equity securities are classified based on     managements intention on the date of purchase and recorded     on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the trade date.     Marketable equity securities that are bought and held     principally for the purpose of resale in the near term are     classified as trading and are carried at fair value with     unrealized gains and losses included in trading account profits     (losses). Other marketable equity securities are accounted for     as AFS and classified in other assets. All AFS marketable equity     securities are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains     and losses included in accumulated OCI on an after-tax basis. If     there is an     other-than-temporary     decline in the fair value of any individual AFS marketable     equity security, the Corporation reclassifies the associated net     unrealized loss out of accumulated OCI with a corresponding     charge to equity investment income. Dividend income on AFS     marketable equity securities is included in equity investment     income. Realized gains and losses on the sale of all AFS     marketable equity securities, which are recorded in equity     investment income, are determined using the specific     identification method.       Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are     recorded in other assets. Impairment testing is based on     applicable accounting guidance and the cost basis is reduced     when impairment is deemed to be     other-than-temporary.       Certain equity investments held by Global Principal Investments,     the Corporations diversified equity investor in private     equity, real estate and other alternative investments, are     subject to investment company accounting under applicable     accounting guidance, and accordingly, are carried at fair value     with changes in fair value reported in equity investment income.     These investments are included in other assets. Initially, the     transaction price of the investment is generally considered to     be the best indicator of fair value. Thereafter, valuation of     direct investments is based on an assessment of each individual     investment using methodologies that include publicly traded     comparables derived by multiplying a key performance metric     (e.g., earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and     amortization) of the portfolio company by the relevant valuation     multiple observed for comparable companies, acquisition     comparables, entry level multiples and discounted cash flows,     and are subject to appropriate discounts for lack of liquidity     or marketability. Certain factors that may influence changes in     fair value include but are not limited to recapitalizations,     subsequent rounds of financing and offerings in the equity or     debt capital markets. For fund investments, the Corporation     generally records the fair value of its proportionate interest     in the funds capital as reported by the funds     respective managers.       Other investments held by Global Principal Investments are     accounted for under either the equity method or at cost,     depending on the Corporations ownership interest, and are     reported in other assets.     Loans and     Leases       Loans measured at historical cost are reported at their     outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income,     charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated     loans, and for purchased loans, net of any unamortized premiums     or discounts. Loan origination fees and certain direct     origination costs are deferred and recognized as adjustments to     interest income over the lives of the related loans. Unearned     income, discounts and premiums are amortized to interest income     using a level yield methodology. The Corporation elects to     account for certain loans under the fair value option with     changes in fair value reported in mortgage banking income for     residential mortgage loans and other income for commercial loans.             The FASB issued new disclosure guidance, effective on a     prospective basis for the Corporations 2010 year-end     reporting, that addresses disclosure of loans and other     financing receivables and the related allowance. The new     accounting guidance defines a portfolio segment as the level at     which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology     to determine the allowance for credit losses, and a class of     financing receivables as the level of disaggregation of     portfolio segments based on the initial measurement attribute,     risk characteristics and methods for assessing risk. The     Corporations portfolio segments are home loans, credit     card and other consumer, and commercial. The classes within the     home loans portfolio segment are residential mortgage, home     equity and discontinued real estate. The classes within the     credit card and other consumer portfolio segment are     U.S. credit card,     non-U.S. credit     card, direct/indirect consumer and other consumer. The classes     within the commercial portfolio segment are     U.S. commercial, commercial real estate, commercial lease     financing,     non-U.S. commercial     and U.S. small business commercial. Under this new     accounting guidance, the allowance is presented by portfolio     segment.     Purchased     Credit-impaired Loans       The Corporation purchases loans with and without evidence of     credit quality deterioration since origination. Evidence of     credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include     statistics such as past due status, refreshed borrower credit     scores and refreshed     loan-to-value     (LTV) ratios, some of which are not immediately available as of     the purchase date. The Corporation continues to evaluate this     information and other credit-related information as it becomes     available. Purchased loans are considered to be impaired if the     Corporation does not expect to receive all contractually     required cash flows due to concerns about credit quality. The     excess of the cash flows expected to be collected measured as of     the acquisition date, over the estimated fair value is referred     to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income     over the remaining life of the loan using a level yield     methodology. The difference between contractually required     payments as of the acquisition date and the cash flows expected     to be collected is referred to as the nonaccretable difference.       The initial fair values for PCI loans are determined by     discounting both principal and interest cash flows expected to     be collected using an observable discount rate for similar     instruments with adjustments that management believes a market     participant would consider in determining fair value. The     Corporation estimates the cash flows expected to be collected     upon acquisition using internal credit risk, interest rate and     prepayment risk models that incorporate managements best     estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss     severity and payment speeds.       Subsequent decreases to expected principal cash flows result in     a charge to provision for credit losses and a corresponding     increase to a valuation allowance included in the allowance for     loan and lease losses. Subsequent increases in expected     principal cash flows result in a recovery of any previously     recorded allowance for loan and lease losses, to the extent     applicable, and a reclassification from nonaccretable difference     to accretable yield for any remaining increase. Changes in     expected interest cash flows may result in reclassifications     to/from the nonaccretable difference. Loan disposals, which may     include sales of loans, receipt of payments in full from the     borrower or foreclosure, result in removal of the loan from the     PCI loan pool at its allocated carrying amount. Beginning on     January 1, 2010, loans modified in a TDR remain within the     PCI loan pools. Prior to January 1, 2010, TDRs were removed     from the PCI loan pools.     Leases       The Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers     through a variety of lease arrangements. Direct financing leases     are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus     estimated residual value of the              Bank of America     2010     145     Table of Contents             leased property less unearned income. Leveraged leases, which     are a form of financing leases, are carried net of nonrecourse     debt. Unearned income on leveraged and direct financing leases     is accreted to interest income over the lease terms using     methods that approximate the interest method.     Allowance for     Credit Losses       The allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance     for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending     commitments, represents managements estimate of probable     losses inherent in the Corporations lending activities.     The allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for     unfunded lending commitments exclude amounts for loans and     unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair value     option as the fair values of these instruments reflect a credit     component. The allowance for loan and lease losses does not     include amounts related to accrued interest receivable other     than billed interest and fees on credit card receivables as     accrued interest receivable is reversed when a loan is placed on     nonaccrual status. The allowance for loan and lease losses     represents the estimated probable credit losses in funded     consumer and commercial loans and leases while the reserve for     unfunded lending commitments, including standby letters of     credit (SBLCs) and binding unfunded loan commitments, represents     estimated probable credit losses on these unfunded credit     instruments based on utilization assumptions. Credit exposures     deemed to be uncollectible, excluding derivative assets, trading     account assets and loans carried at fair value, are charged     against these accounts. Cash recovered on previously charged off     amounts is recorded as a recovery to these accounts. Management     evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease     losses based on the combined total of these two components.       The Corporation performs periodic and systematic detailed     reviews of its lending portfolios to identify credit risks and     to assess the overall collectability of those portfolios. The     allowance on certain homogeneous consumer loan portfolios, which     generally consist of consumer real estate within the home loans     portfolio segment and credit card loans within the credit card     and other consumer portfolio segment, is based on aggregated     portfolio segment evaluations generally by product type. Loss     forecast models are utilized for these portfolios which consider     a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical     loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on     portfolio trends, delinquencies, bankruptcies, economic     conditions and credit scores.       The Corporations home loans portfolio segment is comprised     primarily of large groups of homogeneous consumer loans secured     by residential real estate. The amount of losses incurred in the     homogeneous loan pools is estimated based upon how many of the     loans will default and the loss in the event of default. Using     statistically valid modeling methodologies, the Corporation     estimates how many of the homogeneous loans will default based     on the individual loans attributes aggregated into pools     of homogeneous loans with similar attributes. The attributes     that are most significant to the probability of default and are     used to estimate default include refreshed LTV or in the case of     a subordinated lien, refreshed combined     loan-to-value     (CLTV), borrower credit score, months since origination (i.e.,     vintage) and geography, all of which are further broken down by     present collection status (whether the loan is current,     delinquent, in default or in bankruptcy). This estimate is based     on the Corporations historical experience with the loan     portfolio. The estimate is adjusted to reflect an assessment of     environmental factors not yet reflected in the historical data     underlying the loss estimates, such as changes in real estate     values, local and national economies, underwriting standards and     the regulatory environment. The probability of default of a loan     is based on an analysis of the movement of loans with the     measured attributes from either current or each of the     delinquency categories to default over a twelve-month period.     Loans 90 or more days past due or those expected to migrate to     90 or more days past due within the twelve-month period are     assigned a rate of           default that measures the percentage of such loans that will     default over their lives given the assumption that the condition     causing the ultimate default presently exists as of the     measurement date. On home equity loans where the Corporation     holds only a second-lien position and foreclosure is not the     best alternative, the loss severity is estimated at     100 percent.       The allowance on certain commercial loans (except business card     and certain small business loans) is calculated using loss rates     delineated by risk rating and product type. Factors considered     when assessing loss rates include: the value of the underlying     collateral, if applicable, the industry of the obligor, and the     obligors liquidity and other financial indicators along     with certain qualitative factors. These statistical models are     updated regularly for changes in economic and business     conditions. Included in the analysis of consumer and commercial     loan portfolios are reserves which are maintained to cover     uncertainties that affect the Corporations estimate of     probable losses including domestic and global economic     uncertainty and large single name defaults.       The remaining commercial portfolios, including nonperforming     commercial loans, as well as consumer real estate loans modified     in a TDR, renegotiated credit card, unsecured consumer and small     business loans are reviewed in accordance with applicable     accounting guidance on impaired loans and TDRs. If necessary, a     specific allowance is established for these loans if they are     deemed to be impaired. A loan is considered impaired when, based     on current information and events, it is probable that the     Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due, including     principal     and/or     interest, according to the contractual terms of the agreement,     and once a loan has been identified as impaired, management     measures impairment. Impaired loans and TDRs are primarily     measured based on the present value of payments expected to be     received, discounted at the loans original effective     contractual interest rates, or discounted at the portfolio     average contractual annual percentage rate, excluding     renegotiated and promotionally priced loans for the renegotiated     TDR portfolio. Impaired loans and TDRs may also be measured     based on observable market prices, or for loans that are solely     dependent on the collateral for repayment, the estimated fair     value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell. If the     recorded investment in impaired loans exceeds this amount, a     specific allowance is established as a component of the     allowance for loan and lease losses unless these are consumer     real estate loans that are solely dependent on the collateral     for repayment, in which case the initial amount that exceeds the     fair value of the collateral is charged off.       Generally, prior to performing a detailed property valuation     including a walk-through of a property, the Corporation     initially estimates the fair value of the collateral securing     consumer loans that are solely dependent on the collateral for     repayment using an automated valuation method (AVM). An AVM is a     tool that estimates the value of a property by reference to     market data including sales of comparable properties and price     trends specific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which     the property being valued is located. In the event that an AVM     value is not available, the Corporation utilizes publicized     indices or if these methods provide less reliable valuations,     the Corporation uses appraisals or broker price opinions to     estimate the fair value of the collateral. While there is     inherent imprecision in these valuations, the Corporation     believes that they are representative of the portfolio in the     aggregate.       In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the     Corporation also estimates probable losses related to unfunded     lending commitments, such as letters of credit and financial     guarantees, and binding unfunded loan commitments. The reserve     for unfunded lending commitments excludes commitments accounted     for under the fair value option. Unfunded lending commitments     are subject to individual reviews and are analyzed and     segregated by risk according to the Corporations internal     risk rating scale. These risk classifications, in conjunction     with an analysis of historical loss experience, utilization     assumptions, current economic conditions, performance              146     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents             trends within the portfolio and any other pertinent information,     result in the estimation of the reserve for unfunded lending     commitments.       The allowance for credit losses related to the loan and lease     portfolio is reported separately on the Consolidated Balance     Sheet whereas the reserve for unfunded lending commitments is     reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses     and other liabilities. Provision for credit losses related to     the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments is     reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income.     Nonperforming     Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and Delinquencies       Nonperforming loans and leases generally include loans and     leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status including     nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured     in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing     financial difficulties. Loans accounted for under the fair value     option, PCI loans and LHFS are not reported as nonperforming     loans and leases.       In accordance with the Corporations policies, non-bankrupt     credit card loans and unsecured consumer loans are charged off     no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes     180 days past due. The outstanding balance of real     estate-secured loans that is in excess of the estimated property     value, less estimated costs to sell, is charged off no later     than the end of the month in which the account becomes     180 days past due unless repayment of the loan is insured     by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The estimated     property value, less estimated costs to sell, is determined     using the same process as described for impaired loans in the     Allowance for Credit Losses section beginning on page 146.     Personal property-secured loans are charged off no later than     the end of the month in which the account becomes 120 days     past due. Unsecured accounts in bankruptcy, including credit     cards, are charged off 60 days after bankruptcy     notification. For secured products, accounts in bankruptcy are     written down to the collateral value, less cost to sell, by the     end of the month in which the account becomes 60 days past     due. Consumer credit card loans, consumer loans secured by     personal property and unsecured consumer loans are not placed on     nonaccrual status prior to charge-off and therefore are not     reported as nonperforming loans. Real estate-secured loans are     generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as     nonperforming at 90 days past due. However, consumer loans     secured by real estate where repayments are insured by the FHA     are not placed on nonaccrual status, and therefore, are not     reported as nonperforming loans. Accrued interest receivable is     reversed when a consumer loan is placed on nonaccrual status.     Interest collections on nonaccruing consumer loans for which the     ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as     principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited     to interest income when received. These loans may be restored to     accrual status when all principal and interest is current and     full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and     interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes     well-secured and is in the process of collection. Consumer loans     whose contractual terms have been modified in a TDR and are     current at the time of restructuring remain on accrual status if     there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and     payment in full under the restructured terms is expected.     Otherwise, the loans are placed on nonaccrual status and     reported as nonperforming until there is sustained repayment     performance for a reasonable period, generally six months.     Consumer TDRs that are on accrual status are reported as     performing TDRs through the end of the calendar year in which     the restructuring occurred or the year in which the loans are     returned to accrual status. In addition, if accruing consumer     TDRs bear less than a market rate of interest at the time of     modification, they are reported as performing TDRs throughout     the remaining lives of the loans.       Commercial loans and leases, excluding business card loans, that     are past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest,     or where reasonable           doubt exists as to timely collection, including loans that are     individually identified as being impaired, are generally placed     on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming unless     well-secured and in the process of collection. Commercial loans     and leases whose contractual terms have been modified in a TDR     are placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming     until the loans have performed for an adequate period of time     under the restructured agreement, generally six months. Accruing     commercial TDRs are reported as performing TDRs through the end     of the calendar year in which the loans are returned to accrual     status. In addition, if accruing commercial TDRs bear less than     a market rate of interest at the time of modification, they are     reported as performing TDRs throughout the remaining lives of     the loans. Accrued interest receivable is reversed when a     commercial loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Interest     collections on nonaccruing commercial loans and leases for which     the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are     applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are     credited to income when received. Commercial loans and leases     may be restored to accrual status when all principal and     interest is current and full repayment of the remaining     contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan     otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of     collection. Business card loans are charged off no later than     the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days     past due or where 60 days have elapsed since receipt of     notification of bankruptcy filing, whichever comes first. These     loans are not placed on nonaccrual status prior to charge-off     and therefore are not reported as nonperforming loans. Other     commercial loans are generally charged off when all or a portion     of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible.       The entire balance of a consumer and commercial loan is     contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received     by the specified due date on the customers billing     statement. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due     loans until the date the loan goes into nonaccrual status, if     applicable.       PCI loans are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date.     Although the PCI loans may be contractually delinquent, the     Corporation does not classify these loans as nonperforming as     the loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition     date and the accretable yield is recognized in interest income     over the remaining life of the loan. In addition, reported net     charge-offs exclude write-downs on PCI loan pools as the fair     value already considers the estimated credit losses.     Loans     Held-for-sale       Loans that are intended to be sold in the foreseeable future,     including residential mortgages, loan syndications, and to a     lesser degree, commercial real estate, consumer finance and     other loans, are reported as LHFS and are carried at the lower     of aggregate cost or fair value. The Corporation accounts for     certain LHFS, including first mortgage LHFS, under the fair     value option. Mortgage loan origination costs related to LHFS     which the Corporation accounts for under the fair value option     are recognized in noninterest expense when incurred. Mortgage     loan origination costs for LHFS carried at the lower of cost or     fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the     loans and recognized as a reduction of mortgage banking income     upon the sale of such loans. LHFS that are on nonaccrual status     and are reported as nonperforming, as defined in the policy     above, are reported separately from nonperforming loans and     leases.     Premises and     Equipment       Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated     depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are     recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated     useful lives of the assets. Estimated lives range up to     40 years for buildings, up to 12 years for furniture     and              Bank of America     2010     147     Table of Contents             equipment, and the shorter of lease term or estimated useful     life for leasehold improvements.     Mortgage     Servicing Rights       The Corporation accounts for consumer-related MSRs at fair value     with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage banking income,     while commercial-related and residential reverse mortgage MSRs     are accounted for using the amortization method (i.e., lower of     cost or market) with impairment recognized as a reduction in     mortgage banking income. To reduce the volatility of earnings     related to interest rate and market value fluctuations, certain     securities and derivatives such as options and interest rate     swaps may be used as economic hedges of the MSRs, but are not     designated as accounting hedges. These economic hedges are     carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in     mortgage banking income.       The Corporation estimates the fair value of the consumer-related     MSRs using a valuation model that calculates the present value     of estimated future net servicing income. This is accomplished     through an option-adjusted spread (OAS) valuation approach that     factors in prepayment risk. This approach consists of projecting     servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and     discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates.     The key economic assumptions used in valuations of MSRs include     weighted-average lives of the MSRs and the OAS levels. The OAS     represents the spread that is added to the discount rate so that     the sum of the discounted cash flows equals the market price,     therefore it is a measure of the extra yield over the reference     discount factor (i.e., the forward swap curve) that the     Corporation expects to earn by holding the asset. These     variables can, and generally do, change from quarter to quarter     as market conditions and projected interest rates change, and     could have an adverse impact on the value of the MSRs and could     result in a corresponding reduction in mortgage banking income.     Goodwill and     Intangible Assets       Goodwill is calculated as the purchase premium after adjusting     for the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not     amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual     basis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potential     impairment, at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit, as     defined under applicable accounting guidance, is a business     segment or one level below a business segment. The goodwill     impairment analysis is a two-step test. The first step of the     goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of     each reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill.     If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying     amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not     impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit     exceeds its fair value, the second step must be performed to     measure potential impairment.       The second step involves calculating an implied fair value of     goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step     indicated possible impairment. The implied fair value of     goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of     goodwill recognized in a business combination, which is the     excess of the fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in     the first step, over the aggregate fair values of the assets,     liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting     unit was being acquired in a business combination. Measurement     of the fair values of the assets and liabilities of a reporting     unit is consistent with the requirements of the fair value     measurements accounting guidance, which defines fair value as an     exit price, meaning the price that would be received to sell an     asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction     between market participants at the measurement date. The     adjustments to measure the assets, liabilities and intangibles     at fair value are for the purpose of measuring the implied fair     value of goodwill and such adjustments are not reflected in the     Consolidated Balance Sheet. If the implied fair value of     goodwill exceeds the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit,     there is no impairment. If the goodwill assigned to a reporting     unit           exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge     is recorded for the excess. An impairment loss recognized cannot     exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. An     impairment loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill and     subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment losses are not     permitted under applicable accounting guidance.       For intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment     loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the intangible     asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying     amount of the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if     it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to     result from the use of the asset.     Variable Interest     Entities       A VIE is an entity that lacks equity investors or whose equity     investors do not have a controlling financial interest in the     entity through their equity investments. The entity that has a     controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the     primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. Prior to     January 1, 2010, the primary beneficiary was the entity     that would absorb a majority of the economic risks and rewards     of the VIE based on an analysis of projected     probability-weighted cash flows. In accordance with the new     accounting guidance on consolidation of VIEs and transfers of     financial assets effective January 1, 2010, the Corporation     is deemed to have a controlling financial interest and is the     primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has both the power to direct     the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the     VIEs economic performance and an obligation to absorb     losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially     be significant to the VIE. On a quarterly basis, the Corporation     reassesses whether it has a controlling financial interest in     and is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The quarterly     reassessment process considers whether the Corporation has     acquired or divested the power to direct the activities of the     VIE through changes in governing documents or other     circumstances. The reassessment also considers whether the     Corporation has acquired or disposed of a financial interest     that could be significant to the VIE, or whether an interest in     the VIE has become significant or is no longer significant. The     consolidation status of the VIEs with which the Corporation is     involved may change as a result of such reassessments. Changes     in consolidation status are applied prospectively, with assets     and liabilities of a newly consolidated VIE initially recorded     at fair value. A gain or loss may be recognized upon     deconsolidation of a VIE depending on the carrying amounts of     deconsolidated assets and liabilities compared to the fair value     of retained interests and ongoing contractual arrangements.       The Corporation primarily uses VIEs for its securitization     activities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or     debt securities into a trust or other vehicle such that the     assets are legally isolated from the creditors of the     Corporation. Assets held in a trust can only be used to settle     obligations of the trust. The creditors of these trusts     typically have no recourse to the Corporation except in     accordance with the Corporations obligations under     standard representations and warranties. Prior to 2010,     securitization trusts typically met the definition of a QSPE and     as such were not subject to consolidation.       When the Corporation is the servicer of whole loans held in a     securitization trust, including non-agency residential     mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards, automobile loans and     student loans, the Corporation has the power to direct the most     significant activities of the trust. The Corporation does not     have the power to direct the most significant activities of a     residential mortgage agency trust unless the Corporation holds     substantially all of the issued securities and has the     unilateral right to liquidate the trust. The power to direct the     most significant activities of a commercial mortgage     securitization trust is typically held by the special servicer     or by the party holding specific subordinate securities which     embody certain controlling rights. In accordance with the new     accounting guidance, the Corporation consolidates a whole loan     securitization trust if it has the power to direct the most     significant activities and also holds securities issued by the     trust or has other contractual              148     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents             arrangements, other than standard representations and     warranties, that could potentially be significant to the trust.       The Corporation may also transfer trading account securities and     AFS securities into municipal bond or resecuritization trusts.     The Corporation consolidates a municipal bond or     resecuritization trust if it has control over the ongoing     activities of the trust such as the remarketing of the     trusts liabilities or, if there are no ongoing activities,     sole discretion over the design of the trust, including the     identification of securities to be transferred in and the     structure of securities to be issued, and also retains     securities or has liquidity or other commitments that could     potentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation does     not consolidate a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if     one or a limited number of third-party investors share     responsibility for the design of the trust or have control over     the significant activities of the trust through liquidation or     other substantive rights.       Other VIEs used by the Corporation include commercial paper     conduits, CDOs, investment vehicles created on behalf of     customers and other investment vehicles. The Corporation     consolidated all previously unconsolidated commercial paper     conduits in accordance with the new accounting guidance on     January 1, 2010. In its role as administrator, the     Corporation has the power to determine which assets are held in     the conduits and the Corporation manages the issuance of     commercial paper. Through liquidity facilities, loss protection     commitments and other arrangements, the Corporation has an     obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be     significant to the VIE.       The Corporation does not routinely serve as collateral manager     for CDOs and, therefore, does not typically have the power to     direct the activities that most significantly impact the     economic performance of a CDO. However, following an event of     default, if the Corporation is a majority holder of senior     securities issued by a CDO and acquires the power to manage the     assets of the CDO, the Corporation consolidates the CDO.       The Corporation consolidates a customer or other investment     vehicle if it has control over the initial design of the vehicle     or manages the assets in the vehicle and also absorbs     potentially significant gains or losses through an investment in     the vehicle, derivative contracts or other arrangements. The     Corporation does not consolidate an investment vehicle if a     single investor controlled the initial design of the vehicle or     manages the assets in the vehicles or if the Corporation does     not have a variable interest that could potentially be     significant to the vehicle.       Retained interests in securitized assets are initially recorded     at fair value. Prior to 2010, retained interests were initially     recorded at an allocated cost basis in proportion to the     relative fair values of the assets sold and interests retained.     In addition, the Corporation may invest in debt securities     issued by unconsolidated VIEs. Quoted market prices are     primarily used to obtain fair values of these debt securities,     which are AFS debt securities or trading account assets.     Generally, quoted market prices for retained residual interests     are not available, therefore, the Corporation estimates fair     values based on the present value of the associated expected     future cash flows. This may require management to estimate     credit losses, prepayment speeds, forward interest yield curves,     discount rates and other factors that impact the value of     retained interests. Retained residual interests in     unconsolidated securitization trusts are classified in trading     account assets or other assets with changes in fair value     recorded in income. The Corporation may also enter into     derivatives with unconsolidated VIEs, which are carried at fair     value with changes in fair value recorded in income.         Fair     Value       The Corporation measures the fair values of its financial     instruments in accordance with accounting guidance that requires     an entity to base fair value on exit price and maximize the use     of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs     to determine the exit price. The Corporation categorizes its     financial instruments, based on the priority of inputs to the     valuation technique, into a three-level hierarchy, as described     below. Trading account assets and liabilities, derivative assets     and liabilities, AFS debt and marketable equity securities, MSRs     and certain other assets are carried at fair value in accordance     with applicable accounting guidance. The Corporation has also     elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the     fair value option, including certain corporate loans and loan     commitments, LHFS, commercial paper and other short-term     borrowings, securities financing agreements, asset-backed     secured financings, long-term deposits and long-term debt. The     following describes the three-level hierarchy.           Level 1        Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets     or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt     and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded     in an active exchange market, as well as certain     U.S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are     actively traded in     over-the-counter     markets.       Level 2        Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted     prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in     markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable     or can be corroborated by observable market data for     substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.     Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with     quoted prices that are traded less frequently than     exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts where value     is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are     observable in the market or can be derived principally from or     corroborated by observable market data. This category generally     includes U.S. government and agency mortgage-backed debt     securities, corporate debt securities, derivative contracts,     residential mortgage loans and certain LHFS.       Level 3        Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market     activity and that are significant to the overall fair value of     the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities     include financial instruments for which the determination of     fair value requires significant management judgment or     estimation. The fair value for such assets and liabilities is     generally determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow     methodologies or similar techniques that incorporate the     assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset     or liability. This category generally includes certain private     equity investments and other principal investments, retained     residual interests in securitizations, residential MSRs,     asset-backed securities (ABS), highly structured, complex or     long-dated derivative contracts, certain LHFS, IRLCs and certain     CDOs where independent pricing information cannot be obtained     for a significant portion of the underlying assets.             Bank of America     2010     149     Table of Contents           Income     Taxes       There are two components of income tax expense: current and     deferred. Current income tax expense approximates taxes to be     paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income tax     expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and     liabilities between periods. These gross deferred tax assets and     liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected     to be paid in the future because of future reversals of     temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as     measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the     financial statements. Deferred tax assets are also recognized     for tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and     tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to     reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts management concludes     are more-likely-than-not to be realized.       Income tax benefits are recognized and measured based upon a     two-step model: 1) a tax position must be     more-likely-than-not to be sustained based solely on its     technical merits in order to be recognized, and 2) the     benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of that     position that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon     settlement. The difference between the benefit recognized and     the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an     unrecognized tax benefit (UTB). The Corporation records income     tax-related interest and penalties, if applicable, within income     tax expense.     Retirement     Benefits       The Corporation has established retirement plans covering     substantially all full-time and certain part-time employees.     Pension expense under these plans is charged to current     operations and consists of several components of net pension     cost based on various actuarial assumptions regarding future     experience under the plans.       In addition, the Corporation has established unfunded     supplemental benefit plans and supplemental executive retirement     plans (SERPs) for selected officers of the Corporation and its     subsidiaries that provide benefits that cannot be paid from a     qualified retirement plan due to Internal Revenue Code     restrictions. The Corporations current executive officers     do not earn additional retirement income under SERPs. These     plans are nonqualified under the Internal Revenue Code and     assets used to fund benefit payments are not segregated from     other assets of the Corporation; therefore, in general, a     participants or beneficiarys claim to benefits under     these plans is as a general creditor. In addition, the     Corporation has established several postretirement healthcare     and life insurance benefit plans.     Accumulated Other     Comprehensive Income       The Corporation records unrealized gains and losses on AFS debt     and marketable equity securities, gains and losses on cash flow     accounting hedges, unrecognized actuarial gains and losses,     transition obligation and prior service costs on pension and     postretirement plans, foreign currency translation adjustments     and related hedges of net investments in foreign operations in     accumulated OCI,     net-of-tax.     Unrealized gains and losses on AFS debt and marketable equity     securities are reclassified to earnings as the gains or losses     are realized upon sale of the securities. Unrealized losses on     AFS securities deemed to represent OTTI are reclassified to     earnings at the time of the impairment charge. Beginning in     2009, for AFS debt securities that the Corporation does not     intend to sell or it is not more-likely-than-not that it will be     required to sell, only the credit component of an unrealized     loss is reclassified to earnings. Gains or losses on derivatives     accounted for as cash flow hedges are reclassified to earnings     when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Translation gains     or losses on foreign currency translation adjustments are     reclassified to earnings upon the substantial sale or     liquidation of investments in foreign operations.         Earnings Per     Common Share       Earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income     (loss) allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average     common shares outstanding. Net income (loss) allocated to common     shareholders represents net income (loss) applicable to common     shareholders which is net income (loss) adjusted for preferred     stock dividends including dividends declared, accretion of     discounts on preferred stock including accelerated accretion     when preferred stock is repaid early, and cumulative dividends     related to the current dividend period that have not been     declared as of period end, less income allocated to     participating securities (see below for additional information).     Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing     income (loss) allocated to common shareholders by the     weighted-average common shares outstanding plus amounts     representing the dilutive effect of stock options outstanding,     restricted stock, restricted stock units, outstanding warrants     and the dilution resulting from the conversion of convertible     preferred stock, if applicable.       On January 1, 2009, the Corporation adopted new accounting     guidance on earnings per share that defines unvested share-based     payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends     as participating securities that are included in computing EPS     using the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings     allocation formula under which EPS is calculated for common     stock and participating securities according to dividends     declared and participating rights in undistributed earnings.     Under this method, all earnings, distributed and undistributed,     are allocated to participating securities and common shares     based on their respective rights to receive dividends.       In an exchange of non-convertible preferred stock, income     allocated to common shareholders is adjusted for the difference     between the carrying value of the preferred stock and the fair     value of the common stock exchanged. In an induced conversion of     convertible preferred stock, income allocated to common     shareholders is reduced by the excess of the fair value of the     common stock exchanged over the fair value of the common stock     that would have been issued under the original conversion terms.     Foreign Currency     Translation       Assets, liabilities and operations of foreign branches and     subsidiaries are recorded based on the functional currency of     each entity. For certain of the foreign operations, the     functional currency is the local currency, in which case the     assets, liabilities and operations are translated, for     consolidation purposes, from the local currency to the     U.S. dollar reporting currency at period-end rates for     assets and liabilities and generally at average rates for     results of operations. The resulting unrealized gains or losses     as well as gains and losses from certain hedges, are reported as     a component of accumulated OCI on an after-tax basis. When the     foreign entitys functional currency is determined to be     the U.S. dollar, the resulting remeasurement currency gains     or losses on foreign currency-denominated assets or liabilities     are included in earnings.     Credit Card and     Deposit Arrangements     Endorsing     Organization Agreements       The Corporation contracts with other organizations to obtain     their endorsement of the Corporations loan and deposit     products. This endorsement may provide to the Corporation     exclusive rights to market to the organizations members or     to customers on behalf of the Corporation. These organizations     endorse the Corporations loan and deposit products and     provide the Corporation with their mailing lists and marketing     activities. These agreements generally have terms that range     from two to five years. The Corporation typically pays royalties     in exchange for the endorsement. Compensation costs related to     the credit card agreements are recorded as contra-revenue in     card income.           150     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           Cardholder Reward     Agreements       The Corporation offers reward programs that allow its     cardholders to earn points that can be redeemed for a broad     range of rewards including cash, travel and discounted products.     The Corporation establishes a rewards liability based upon the     points earned that are expected to be redeemed and the average     cost per point redeemed. The points to be redeemed are estimated     based on past redemption behavior, card product type, account     transaction activity and other historical card performance. The     liability is reduced as the points are redeemed. The estimated     cost of the rewards programs is recorded as contra-revenue in     card income.     Insurance Income     and Insurance Expense       Property and casualty and credit life and disability premiums     are generally recognized over the term of the policies on a     pro-rata basis for all policies except for certain of the     lender-placed auto insurance and the guaranteed auto protection     (GAP) policies. For lender-placed auto insurance, premiums are     recognized when collections become probable due to high     cancellation rates experienced early in the life of the policy.     For GAP insurance, revenue recognition is correlated to the     exposure and accelerated over the life of the contract. Mortgage     reinsurance premiums are recognized as earned. Insurance expense     includes insurance claims, commissions and premium taxes, all of     which are recorded in other general operating expense.          NOTE 2 Merger     and Restructuring Activity      Merrill     Lynch       On January 1, 2009, the Corporation acquired Merrill Lynch     through its merger with a subsidiary of the Corporation in     exchange for common and preferred stock with a value of     $29.1 billion. Under the terms of the merger agreement,     Merrill Lynch common shareholders received 0.8595 of a share of     Bank of America Corporation common stock in exchange for each     share of Merrill Lynch common stock. In addition, Merrill Lynch     non-convertible preferred shareholders received Bank of America     Corporation preferred stock having substantially identical     terms. On October 15, 2010, the outstanding Merrill Lynch     convertible preferred stock automatically converted into Bank of     America Corporation common stock in accordance with its terms.       The purchase price was allocated to the acquired assets and     liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the Merrill     Lynch acquisition date as summarized in the table below.     Goodwill of $5.2 billion was calculated as the purchase     premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets     acquired. No goodwill is deductible for federal income tax     purposes. The goodwill was allocated principally to the     Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM)     and Global Banking & Markets (GBAM)     business segments.

Merrill Lynch has been named as a defendant in various     pending legal actions and proceedings arising in connection with     its activities as a global diversified financial services     institution. Some of these legal actions and proceedings include     claims for substantial compensatory     and/or     punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages.     Merrill Lynch is also involved in investigations     and/or     proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies. Due to     the number of variables and assumptions involved in assessing     the possible outcome of these legal actions, sufficient     information did not exist as of the acquisition date to     reasonably estimate the fair value of these contingent     liabilities. As such, these contingences have been measured in     accordance with applicable accounting guidance which states that     a loss is recognized when it is probable of occurring and the     loss amount can be reasonably estimated. For further     information, see Note 14  Commitments     and Contingencies.     Merger and     Restructuring Charges and Reserves       Merger and restructuring charges are recorded in the     Consolidated Statement of Income and include incremental costs     to integrate the operations of the Corporation and its recent     acquisitions. These charges represent costs associated with     these one-time activities and do not represent ongoing costs of     the fully integrated combined organization. On January 1,     2009, the Corporation adopted new accounting guidance on     business combinations, on a prospective basis, that requires     that acquisition-related transaction and restructuring costs be     charged to expense as incurred. Previously, these expenses were     recorded as an adjustment to goodwill.             The table below presents severance and employee-related charges,     systems integrations and related charges, and other     merger-related charges.

Included for     2009 are merger-related charges of $1.8 billion related to     the Merrill Lynch acquisition, $843 million related to the     Countrywide acquisition and $97 million related to earlier     acquisitions. Included for 2008 are merger-related charges of     $205 million related to the Countrywide acquisition and     $730 million related to earlier acquisitions.       During 2010, $1.6 billion in merger-related charges for the     Merrill Lynch acquisition included $426 million for     severance and other employee-related costs, $975 million     for systems integration costs and $217 million in other     merger-related costs. In 2009, the $1.8 billion in     merger-related charges for the Merrill Lynch acquisition     included $1.2 billion for severance and other     employee-related costs, $480 million for systems     integration costs and $129 million in other merger-related     costs.       The table below presents the changes in exit cost and     restructuring reserves for 2010 and 2009. Exit cost reserves     were established in purchase accounting resulting in an increase     in goodwill. Restructuring reserves are established by a charge     to merger and restructuring charges, and the restructuring     charges are included in the total merger and restructuring     charges in the table above. Exit costs were not recorded in     purchase accounting for the Merrill Lynch acquisition in     accordance with new accounting guidance on business combinations     which was effective January 1, 2009.

During 2010, $429 million was added     to the restructuring reserves related to severance and other     employee-related costs primarily associated with the Merrill     Lynch acquisition. Cash payments and other of $496 million     during 2010 were related to severance and other employee-related     costs primarily associated with the Merrill Lynch acquisition.     Payments associated with the Countrywide acquisition are     expected to continue into 2011, while Merrill Lynch related     payments are anticipated to continue into 2012. At     December 31, 2010, restructuring reserves of     $336 million related principally to Merrill Lynch.               152     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents       NOTE 3 Trading     Account Assets and Liabilities        The table below presents the components of trading account     assets and liabilities at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

(2)   Excludes $4.4 billion of long-term     debt designated as a hedge of foreign currency risk.               ALM and Risk     Management Derivatives       The Corporations ALM and risk management activities     include the use of derivatives to mitigate risk to the     Corporation including both derivatives that are designated as     hedging instruments and economic hedges. Interest rate,     commodity, credit and foreign exchange contracts are utilized in     the Corporations ALM and risk management activities.       The Corporation maintains an overall interest rate risk     management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate     contracts, which are generally non-leveraged generic interest     rate and basis swaps, options, futures, and forwards, to     minimize significant fluctuations in earnings that are caused by     interest rate volatility. The Corporations goal is to     manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest     rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings. As a     result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate assets     and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in fair value. Gains or     losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to the     hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities are expected to     substantially offset this unrealized appreciation or     depreciation.       Interest rate and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage     business. Market risk is the risk that values of mortgage assets     or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market     conditions such as interest rate movements. To hedge interest     rate risk in mortgage banking production income, the Corporation     utilizes forward loan sale commitments and other derivative     instruments including purchased options. The Corporation also     utilizes derivatives such as interest rate options, interest     rate swaps, forward           settlement contracts and euro-dollar futures as economic hedges     of the fair value of MSRs. For additional information on MSRs,     see Note 25  Mortgage Servicing     Rights.       The Corporation uses foreign currency contracts to manage the     foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign     currency-denominated assets and liabilities, as well as the     Corporations investments in     non-U.S. subsidiaries.     Foreign exchange contracts, which include spot and forward     contracts, represent agreements to exchange the currency of one     country for the currency of another country at an     agreed-upon     price on an     agreed-upon     settlement date. Exposure to loss on these contracts will     increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency     exchange and interest rates fluctuate.       The Corporation enters into derivative commodity contracts such     as futures, swaps, options and forwards as well as     non-derivative commodity contracts to provide price risk     management services to customers or to manage price risk     associated with its physical and financial commodity positions.     The non-derivative commodity contracts and physical inventories     of commodities expose the Corporation to earnings volatility.     Cash flow and fair value accounting hedges provide a method to     mitigate a portion of this earnings volatility.       The Corporation purchases credit derivatives to manage credit     risk related to certain funded and unfunded credit exposures.     Credit derivatives include credit default swaps, total return     swaps and swaptions. These derivatives are              154     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents             accounted for as economic hedges and changes in fair value are     recorded in other income (loss).     Derivatives     Designated as Accounting Hedges       The Corporation uses various types of interest rate, commodity     and foreign exchange derivative contracts to protect against     changes in the fair value of its assets and liabilities due to     fluctuations in interest rates, exchange rates and commodity     prices (fair value hedges). The Corporation also uses these           types of contracts and equity derivatives to protect against     changes in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities, and     other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The     Corporation hedges its net investment in consolidated     non-U.S. operations     determined to have functional currencies other than the     U.S. dollar using forward exchange contracts,     cross-currency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign     currency-denominated debt (net investment hedges).

Bank of America     2010     155     Table of Contents         Cash Flow     Hedges       The table below summarizes certain information related to the     Corporations derivatives designated as cash flow hedges     and net investment hedges for 2010, 2009 and 2008. During the     next 12 months, net losses in accumulated OCI of     approximately $1.8 billion ($1.1 billion after-tax) on     derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges are     expected to be reclassified into earnings. These net losses     reclassified into earnings are expected to primarily reduce net     interest income related to the respective hedged items.       Amounts related to interest rate risk on variable rate     portfolios reclassified from accumulated OCI increased interest     income on assets by $144 million in 2010, reduced interest     income on assets by $189 million and $156 million in     2009 and 2008 and increased interest expense on liabilities by     $554 million, $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion in     2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Amounts reclassified from     accumulated OCI exclude amounts related to derivative interest     accruals which increased interest expense by $88 million     and increased interest income by $160 million for 2010 and           2009, and increased interest expense by $73 million for     2008. Hedge ineffectiveness of $(14) million,     $73 million and $(11) million was recorded in interest     income, and $(16) million, $(2) million and     $4 million was recorded in interest expense in 2010, 2009     and 2008.       Amounts related to commodity price risk reclassified from     accumulated OCI are recorded in trading account profits (losses)     with the underlying hedged item. Amounts related to price risk     on restricted stock awards reclassified from accumulated OCI are     recorded in personnel expense.

These cash-settled RSUs are accrued as liabilities     over the vesting period and adjusted to fair value based on     changes in the share price of the Corporations common     stock. From time to time, the Corporation may enter into equity     derivatives to minimize the change in the expense to the     Corporation driven by fluctuations in the share price of the     Corporations common stock during the vesting period of any     RSUs that may be granted from time to time, if any, subject to     similar or other terms and conditions. Certain of these     derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges of unrecognized     non-vested awards with the changes in fair value of the hedge     recorded in accumulated OCI and reclassified into earnings in     the             same period as the RSUs affect earnings. The remaining     derivatives are accounted for as economic hedges and changes in     fair value are recorded in personnel expense. For more     information on restricted stock units and related hedges, see     Note 20  Stock-Based Compensation Plans.     Economic     Hedges       Derivatives designated as economic hedges, because either they     did not qualify for or were not designated as accounting hedges,     are used by the Corporation to reduce certain risk exposures.     The table below presents gains (losses) on these derivatives for     2010, 2009 and 2008. These gains (losses) are largely offset by     the income or expense that is recorded on the economically     hedged item.

Bank of America     2010     157     Table of Contents         Sales and Trading     Revenue       The Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate     client transactions, for principal trading purposes, and to     manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and     liabilities. It is the Corporations policy to include     these derivative instruments in its trading activities which     include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. The     resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a portfolio     basis as part of the Corporations GBAM business     segment. The related sales and trading revenue generated within     GBAM is           recorded on various income statement line items including     trading account profits (losses) and net interest income as well     as other revenue categories. However, the vast majority of     income related to derivative instruments is recorded in trading     account profits (losses). The table below identifies the amounts     in the respective income statement line items attributable to     the Corporations sales and trading revenue categorized by     primary risk for 2010, 2009 and 2008.                                                                                  2010                 Trading                                                      Account                                                      Profits            Other            Net Interest                      (Dollars in millions)            (Losses)           Revenues     (1)           Income           Total               Interest rate risk        $   2,004           $   113           $   624           $   2,741              Foreign exchange risk            903               3                              906              Equity risk            1,670               2,506               21               4,197              Credit risk            4,791               617               3,652               9,060              Other risk            228               39               (142   )           125                                                                                Total sales and trading     revenue        $   9,596           $   3,278           $   4,155           $   17,029                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2009               Interest rate risk            $       3,145               $       33               $       1,068               $       4,246              Foreign exchange risk                972                   6                   26                   1,004              Equity risk                2,041                   2,613                   246                   4,900              Credit risk                4,433                   (2,576       )               4,637                   6,494              Other risk                1,084                   13                   (469       )               628                                                                                Total sales and trading     revenue            $       11,675               $       89               $       5,508               $       17,272                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2008               Interest rate risk            $       1,083               $       47               $       276               $       1,406              Foreign exchange risk                1,320                   6                   13                   1,339              Equity risk                (66       )               686                   99                   719              Credit risk                (8,276       )               (6,881       )               4,380                   (10,777       )          Other risk                130                   58                   (14       )               174                                                                                Total sales and trading     revenue            $       (5,809       )           $       (6,084       )           $       4,754               $       (7,139       )                                                                                    (1)   Represents investment and brokerage     services and other income recorded in GBAM that the     Corporation includes in its definition of sales and trading     revenue.                   Credit     Derivatives       The Corporation enters into credit derivatives primarily to     facilitate client transactions and to manage credit risk     exposures. Credit derivatives derive value based on an     underlying third party-referenced obligation or a portfolio of     referenced obligations and generally require the Corporation as     the seller of credit protection to make payments to a buyer upon     the occurrence of a predefined credit event. Such credit events     generally include bankruptcy of the           referenced credit entity and failure to pay under the     obligation, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment     repudiation or moratorium. For credit derivatives based on a     portfolio of referenced credits or credit indices, the     Corporation may not be required to make payment until a     specified amount of loss has occurred     and/or may     only be required to make payment up to a specified amount.               158     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents             Credit derivative instruments in which the Corporation is the     seller of credit protection and their expiration at     December 31, 2010 and 2009 are summarized below.

Bank of America     2010     159     Table of Contents             The notional amount represents the maximum amount payable by the     Corporation for most credit derivatives. However, the     Corporation does not solely monitor its exposure to credit     derivatives based on notional amount because this measure does     not take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As     such, the notional amount is not a reliable indicator of the     Corporations exposure to these contracts. Instead, a risk     framework is used to define risk tolerances and establish limits     to help ensure that certain credit risk-related losses occur     within acceptable, predefined limits.       The Corporation economically hedges its market risk exposure to     credit derivatives by entering into a variety of offsetting     derivative contracts and security positions. For example, in     certain instances, the Corporation may purchase credit     protection with identical underlying referenced names to offset     its exposure. The carrying amount and notional amount of written     credit derivatives for which the Corporation held purchased     credit derivatives with identical underlying referenced names     and terms at December 31, 2010 was $43.7 billion and     $1.4 trillion compared to $79.4 billion and $2.3 trillion     at December 31, 2009.       Credit-related notes in the table on page 159 include     investments in securities issued by CDOs, CLOs and credit-linked     note vehicles. These instruments are classified as trading     securities. The carrying value of these instruments equals the     Corporations maximum exposure to loss. The Corporation is     not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the     terms of the securities owned. The Corporation discloses     internal categorizations (i.e., investment-grade, non-investment     grade) consistent with how risk is managed for these instruments.     Credit Risk     Management of Derivatives and     Credit-related     Contingent Features       The Corporation executes the majority of its derivative     contracts in the     over-the-counter     market with large, international financial institutions,     including broker/dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety     of non-financial companies. Substantially all of the derivative     transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore,     events such as a credit ratings downgrade (depending on the     ultimate rating level) or a breach of credit covenants would     typically require an increase in the amount of collateral     required of the counterparty, where applicable,     and/or allow     the Corporation to take additional protective measures such as     early termination of all trades. Further, as previously     described on page 153, the Corporation enters into legally     enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by     permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the     same counterparty upon the occurrence of certain events.       Substantially all of the Corporations derivative contracts     contain credit risk-related contingent features, primarily in     the form of International Swaps and Derivatives Association,     Inc. (ISDA) master agreements that enhance the creditworthiness     of these instruments compared to other obligations of the           respective counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted     (e.g., other debt or equity). These contingent features may be     for the benefit of the Corporation as well as its counterparties     with respect to changes in the Corporations     creditworthiness. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the     Corporation held cash and securities collateral of     $76.0 billion and $67.7 billion, and posted cash and     securities collateral of $61.2 billion and     $62.2 billion in the normal course of business under     derivative agreements.       In connection with certain     over-the-counter     derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the     Corporation could be required to provide additional collateral     or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the     event of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of Bank of     America Corporation and its subsidiaries. The amount of     additional collateral required depends on the contract and is     usually a fixed incremental amount     and/or the     market value of the exposure. At December 31, 2010 and     2009, the amount of additional collateral and termination     payments that would have been required for such derivatives and     trading agreements was approximately $1.2 billion and     $2.1 billion if the long-term credit rating of the     Corporation was incrementally downgraded by one level by all     ratings agencies. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, a second     incremental one level downgrade by the ratings agencies would     have required approximately $1.1 billion and     $1.2 billion in additional collateral and termination     payments.       The Corporation records counterparty credit risk valuation     adjustments on derivative assets in order to properly reflect     the credit quality of the counterparty. These adjustments are     necessary as the market quotes on derivatives do not fully     reflect the credit risk of the counterparties to the derivative     assets. The Corporation considers collateral and legally     enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate its credit     exposure to each counterparty in determining the counterparty     credit risk valuation adjustment. All or a portion of these     counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments can be reversed     or otherwise adjusted in future periods due to changes in the     value of the derivative contract, collateral and     creditworthiness of the counterparty. During 2010 and 2009,     credit valuation gains (losses) of $731 million and     $3.1 billion ($(8) million and $1.7 billion, net     of hedges) for counterparty credit risk related to derivative     assets were recognized in trading account profits (losses). At     December 31, 2010 and 2009, the cumulative counterparty     credit risk valuation adjustment reduced the derivative assets     balance by $6.8 billion and $7.9 billion.       In addition, the fair value of the Corporations or its     subsidiaries derivative liabilities is adjusted to reflect     the impact of the Corporations credit quality. During 2010     and 2009, credit valuation gains (losses) of $331 million     and $(662) million ($262 million and     $(662) million, net of hedges) were recognized in trading     account profits (losses) for changes in the Corporations     or its subsidiaries credit risk. At December 31, 2010     and 2009, the Corporations cumulative credit risk     valuation adjustment reduced the derivative liabilities balance     by $1.1 billion and $732 million.               160     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents       NOTE 5 Securities        The table below presents the amortized cost, gross unrealized     gains and losses in accumulated OCI, and fair value of AFS debt     and marketable equity securities at December 31, 2010 and     2009.

(2)   Classified in other assets on the     Corporations Consolidated Balance Sheet.                   At December 31, 2010, the accumulated net unrealized gains     on AFS debt securities included in accumulated OCI were     $714 million, net of the related income tax expense of     $415 million. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the     Corporation had nonperforming AFS debt securities of     $44 million and $467 million.       At December 31, 2010, both the amortized cost and fair     value of HTM debt securities were $427 million. At     December 31, 2009, the amortized cost and fair value of HTM     debt securities were $9.8 billion and $9.7 billion,     which included ABS that were issued by the Corporations     credit card securitization trust and retained by the Corporation     with an amortized cost of $6.6 billion           and a fair value of $6.4 billion. As a result of the     adoption of new consolidation guidance, the Corporation     consolidated the credit card securitization trusts on     January 1, 2010 and the ABS were eliminated in     consolidation and the related consumer credit card loans were     included in loans and leases on the Corporations     Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, during the three     months ended June 30, 2010, $2.9 billion of debt     securities held in consolidated commercial paper conduits was     reclassified from HTM to AFS as a result of new regulatory     capital requirements related to asset-backed commercial paper     conduits.               Bank of America     2010     161     Table of Contents             The Corporation recorded OTTI losses on AFS debt securities as     presented in the table below in 2010 and 2009. Upon initial     impairment of a security, total OTTI losses represent the excess     of the amortized cost over the fair value. For subsequent     impairments of the same security, total OTTI losses represent     additional declines in fair value subsequent to the previously     recorded OTTI loss(es), if applicable. Unrealized OTTI losses     recognized in accumulated OCI represent the non-credit component     of OTTI losses on AFS           debt securities. Net impairment losses recognized in earnings     represent the credit component of OTTI losses on AFS debt     securities. In 2010, for certain securities, the Corporation     recognized credit losses in excess of unrealized losses in     accumulated OCI. In these instances, a portion of the credit     losses recognized in earnings has been offset by an unrealized     gain. Balances in the table exclude $51 million and     $582 million of gross gains recorded in accumulated OCI     related to these securities for 2010 and 2009.                                                                                                          2010                 Non-agency            Non-agency                                    Other                              Residential            Commercial            Non-U.S.            Corporate            Taxable                      (Dollars in millions)            MBS           MBS           Securities           Bonds           Securities           Total               Total OTTI losses (unrealized and realized)        $   (1,305   )       $   (19   )       $   (276   )       $   (6   )       $   (568   )       $   (2,174   )          Unrealized OTTI losses recognized in accumulated OCI            817               15               16               2               357               1,207                                                                                                                Net impairment losses recognized     in earnings        $   (488   )       $   (4   )       $   (260   )       $   (4   )       $   (211   )       $   (967   )                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2009               Total OTTI losses (unrealized and realized)            $       (2,240       )           $       (6       )           $       (360       )           $       (87       )           $       (815       )           $       (3,508       )          Unrealized OTTI losses recognized in accumulated OCI                672                                                                                               672                                                                                                                Net impairment losses recognized     in earnings            $       (1,568       )           $       (6       )           $       (360       )           $       (87       )           $       (815       )           $       (2,836       )                                                                                                                           The table below presents activity for 2010 and 2009 related to     the credit component recognized in earnings on debt securities     held by the Corporation for which a portion of the OTTI loss     remains in accumulated OCI. At December 31, 2010, those     debt securities with OTTI for which a portion of the OTTI loss     remains in accumulated OCI primarily consisted of non-agency     residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and CDOs.                                           (Dollars in millions)            2010               2009           Balance,     January 1        $   442               $                     Credit component of     other-than-temporary     impairment not reclassified to accumulated OCI in connection     with the cumulative effect transition     adjustment (1)                               22              Additions for the credit component on debt securities on which     other-than-temporary     impairment losses were not previously     recognized (2)            207                   420              Additions for the credit component on debt securities on which     other-than-temporary     impairment losses were previously     recognized (2)            406                                                                   Balance, December 31        $   1,055               $       442                                                        (1)   On January 1, 2009, the     Corporation had securities with $134 million of OTTI     previously recognized in earnings of which $22 million     represented the credit component and $112 million     represented the non-credit component which was reclassified to     accumulated OCI through a cumulative effect transition     adjustment.         (2)   In 2010 and 2009, the Corporation     recognized $354 million and $2.4 billion of OTTI     losses on debt securities on which no portion of OTTI loss     remained in accumulated OCI. OTTI losses related to these     securities are excluded from these amounts.                The Corporation estimates the portion of loss attributable to     credit using a discounted cash flow model and estimates the     expected cash flows of the underlying collateral using internal     credit, interest rate and prepayment risk models that     incorporate managements best estimate of current key     assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment     rates. Assumptions           used can vary widely from loan to loan and are influenced by     such factors as loan interest rate, geographical location of the     borrower, borrower characteristics and collateral type. The     Corporation then uses a third-party vendor to determine how the     underlying collateral cash flows will be distributed to each     security issued from the structure. Expected principal and     interest cash flows on an impaired debt security are discounted     using the book yield of each individual impaired debt security.       Based on the expected cash flows derived from the applicable     model, the Corporation expects to recover the unrealized losses     in accumulated OCI on non-agency RMBS. Annual constant     prepayment speed and loss severity rates are projected     considering collateral characteristics such as LTV,     creditworthiness of borrowers (FICO) and geographic     concentrations. The weighted-average severity by collateral type     was 41 percent for prime bonds, 48 percent for Alt-A     bonds and 53 percent for subprime bonds. Additionally,     default rates are projected by considering collateral     characteristics including, but not limited to LTV, FICO and     geographic concentration. Weighted-average life default rates by     collateral type were 38 percent for prime bonds,     58 percent for Alt-A bonds and 62 percent for subprime     bonds.       Significant assumptions used in the valuation of non-agency RMBS     at December 31, 2010 are presented in the table below.

AFS debt securities on which a portion of the OTTI loss     remains in OCI.         (2)   At December 31, 2010, the     amortized cost of approximately 8,500 AFS securities exceeded     their fair value by $4.5 billion. At December 31,     2009, the amortized cost of approximately 12,000 AFS securities     exceeded their fair value by $7.3 billion.                   The Corporation considers the length of time and extent to which     the fair value of AFS debt securities has been less than cost to     conclude that such securities were not     other-than-temporarily     impaired. The Corporation also considers other factors such as     the financial condition of the issuer of the security including     credit ratings and specific events affecting the operations of     the issuer, underlying assets that collateralize the debt     security, and other           industry and macroeconomic conditions. As the Corporation has no     intent to sell securities with unrealized losses and it is not     more-likely-than-not that the Corporation will be required to     sell these securities before recovery of amortized cost, the     Corporation has concluded that the securities are not impaired     on an     other-than-temporary     basis.

These     transactions were initiated following a review of corporate risk     objectives in light of proposed Basel regulatory capital changes     and liquidity targets. During 2010, the carrying value of the     non-agency RMBS portfolio was reduced $14.5 billion     primarily as a result of the aforementioned sales and     securitizations as well as paydowns. The Corporation recognized     net losses of $922 million on the series of transactions in     the AFS debt securities portfolio, and improved the overall     credit quality of the remaining portfolio such that the     percentage of the non-agency RMBS portfolio that is below     investment-grade was reduced significantly.               164     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents         Certain Corporate     and Strategic Investments       At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Corporation owned     25.6 billion shares representing approximately 10 and     11 percent of China Construction Bank (CCB). During 2010,     the Corporation sold its rights to participate in CCBs     secondary offering resulting in a pre-tax gain of     $432 million recorded in equity investment income. During     2009, the Corporation sold its initial investment of     19.1 billion common shares in CCB for a pre-tax gain of     $7.3 billion. During 2010, the Corporation recorded in     accumulated OCI a $6.7 billion after-tax unrealized gain on     23.6 billion shares of the Corporations investment in     CCB, which previously had been carried at cost. These shares     were reclassified to AFS during 2010 because the sales     restrictions on these shares expire within one year (August     2011), and therefore, in accordance with applicable accounting     guidance, the Corporation recorded the unrealized gain in     accumulated OCI, net of a 10 percent restriction discount.     Sales restrictions on the remaining two billion CCB shares     continue until August 2013, and these shares continue to be     carried at cost. At December 31, 2010, the cost basis of     all remaining CCB shares was $9.2 billion, the carrying     value was $19.7 billion and the fair value was     $20.8 billion. At December 31, 2009, both the cost     basis and the carrying value were $9.2 billion and the fair     value was $22.0 billion. Dividend income on this investment     is recorded in equity investment income and during 2010, the     Corporation recorded dividend income of $535 million from     CCB. The investment is recorded in other assets. The Corporation     remains a significant shareholder in CCB and intends to continue     the important long-term strategic alliance with CCB originally     entered into in 2005. As part of this alliance, the Corporation     expects to continue to provide advice and assistance to CCB.       During 2010, the Corporation sold various strategic investments     which included the Corporations investment of     188.4 million preferred shares and 56.5 million common     shares in Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A. (Itaú Unibanco)     at a price of $3.9 billion. The Itaú Unibanco     investment was accounted for at fair value and recorded as AFS     marketable equity securities in other assets with unrealized     gains recorded,     net-of-tax,     in accumulated OCI. The cost basis of this investment was     $2.6 billion and, after transaction costs, the pre-tax gain     was $1.2 billion which was recorded in equity investment     income. In addition, the Corporation sold its 24.9 percent     ownership interest in Grupo Financiero Santander, S.A.B. de C.V.     to an affiliate of its parent company, Banco Santander, S.A.,     the majority interest holder. The investment was accounted for     under the equity method of accounting and recorded in other     assets. This sale resulted in a pre-tax loss of     $428 million which was recorded in equity investment     income. The Corporation also sold all of its Class B units     in           MasterCard Worldwide, Inc. (MasterCard), which were acquired     primarily upon MasterCards initial public offering and     recorded in other assets. This sale resulted in a pre-tax gain     of $440 million which was recorded in equity investment     income. Also during the year, the Corporation sold its exposure     of $2.9 billion in certain private equity funds recorded in     other assets, comprised of $1.5 billion in capital and     $1.4 billion in unfunded commitments resulting in a loss of     $163 million which was recorded in equity investment income.       As part of the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, the Corporation     acquired an economic ownership in BlackRock Inc. (BlackRock), a     publicly traded investment company. During 2010, the Corporation     sold 51.2 million shares consisting of 48.9 million     preferred and 2.3 million common shares for net proceeds of     $8.3 billion resulting in a pre-tax gain of     $91 million, lowering its ownership to 13.6 million     preferred shares, or 7 percent. The carrying value of this     investment at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was     $2.2 billion and $10.0 billion and the fair value was     $2.6 billion and $15.0 billion. Following the sale,     the Corporations remaining interest is held at cost due to     restrictions that affect the marketability of the preferred     shares. The investment is recorded in other assets. During 2009,     BlackRock completed its purchase of Barclays Global Investors,     an asset management business, from Barclays PLC which had the     effect of diluting the Corporations ownership interest in     BlackRock from approximately 50 percent to approximately     34 percent and, for accounting purposes, was treated as a     sale of a portion of the Corporations ownership interest.     As a result, upon closing of this transaction, the Corporation     recorded an adjustment to its investment in BlackRock resulting     in a pre-tax gain of $1.1 billion which was recorded in     equity investment income.       In 2010, a third-party investor in a joint venture in which the     Corporation held a 46.5 percent ownership interest sold its     interest to the joint venture, resulting in an increase in the     Corporations ownership interest to 49 percent. The     joint venture was formed in 2009 with First Data Corporation     (First Data) creating Banc of America Merchant Services, LLC.     Under the terms of the agreement, the Corporation contributed     its merchant processing business to the joint venture and First     Data contributed certain merchant processing contracts and     personnel resources. In 2009, the Corporation recorded in other     income a pre-tax gain of $3.8 billion related to this     transaction. The investment in the joint venture, which was     initially recorded at a fair value of $4.7 billion, is     accounted for under the equity method of accounting with income     recorded in equity investment income. The carrying value at both     December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $4.7 billion.

(11)   Certain commercial loans are     accounted for under the fair value option and include U.S.     commercial loans of $1.6 billion and $3.0 billion,     non-U.S.     commercial loans of $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, and     commercial real estate loans of $79 million and     $90 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009. See     Note 22  Fair Value Measurements and     Note 23   Fair Value Option for     additional information.                   The Corporation mitigates a portion of its credit risk on the     residential mortgage portfolio through the use of synthetic     securitization vehicles. These vehicles issue long-term notes to     investors, the proceeds of which are held as cash collateral.     The Corporation pays a premium to the vehicles to purchase     mezzanine loss protection on a portfolio of residential     mortgages owned by the Corporation. Cash held in the vehicles is     used to reimburse the Corporation in the event that losses on     the mortgage portfolio exceed 10 basis points (bps) of the     original pool balance, up to the remaining amount of purchased     loss protection of $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion at     December 31, 2010 and 2009. The vehicles are variable     interest entities from which the Corporation purchases credit     protection and in which the Corporation does not have a variable     interest; accordingly, these vehicles are not consolidated by     the Corporation. Amounts due from the vehicles are recorded in     other income (loss) when the Corporation recognizes a     reimbursable loss, as described above. Amounts are collected     when reimbursable losses are realized through           the sale of the underlying collateral. At December 31, 2010     and 2009, the Corporation had a receivable of $722 million     and $1.0 billion from these vehicles for reimbursement of     losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, $53.9 billion     and $70.7 billion of residential mortgage loans were     referenced under these agreements. The Corporation records an     allowance for credit losses on these loans without regard to the     existence of the purchased loss protection as the protection     does not represent a guarantee of individual loans.       In addition, the Corporation has entered into long-term standby     agreements with FNMA and FHLMC on loans totaling     $14.3 billion and $6.6 billion at December 31,     2010 and 2009, providing full protection on residential mortgage     loans that become severely delinquent. The Corporation does not     record an allowance for credit losses on these loans as the     loans are individually insured.               166     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents         Nonperforming     Loans and Leases       The table below includes the Corporations nonperforming     loans and leases, including nonperforming TDRs, and loans     accruing past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2010     and 2009. Nonperforming loans and leases exclude performing TDRs     and loans accounted for under the fair value option.     Nonperforming LHFS are excluded from nonperforming loans and     leases as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of     cost or fair value. In addition, PCI, consumer credit card,     business card loans and in general, consumer           loans not secured by real estate, including renegotiated loans,     are not considered nonperforming and are therefore excluded from     nonperforming loans and leases in the table. See     Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting     Principles for further information on the criteria to     determine if a loan is classified as nonperforming. Real     estate-secured past due consumer loans insured by the FHA are     reported as performing since the principal repayment is insured     by the FHA.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, residential mortgage     includes $8.3 billion and $2.2 billion of loans that     are no longer accruing interest as interest has been curtailed     by the FHA although principal is still insured.         n/a = not applicable                      Included in certain loan categories in nonperforming loans and     leases in the table above are TDRs that were classified as     nonperforming. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the     Corporation had $3.0 billion and $2.9 billion of     residential mortgages, $535 million and $1.7 billion     of home equity, $75 million and $43 million of     discontinued real estate, $175 million and     $227 million of U.S. commercial, $770 million and     $246 million of commercial real estate and $7 million     and $13 million of     non-U.S. commercial     loans that were TDRs and classified as nonperforming.       As a result of new accounting guidance on PCI loans, beginning     January 1, 2010, modification of a PCI loan no longer     results in removal of the loan from the PCI loan pool. TDRs in     the consumer real estate portfolio that were removed from the     PCI loan portfolio prior to the adoption of the new accounting     guidance were $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion at     December 31, 2010 and 2009, of which $426 million and     $395 million were nonperforming. These nonperforming loans     are excluded from the table above.     Credit Quality     Indicators       The Corporation monitors credit quality within its three     portfolio segments based on primary credit quality indicators.     Within the home loans portfolio segment, the primary credit     quality indicators used are refreshed LTV and refreshed FICO     score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan           as a percentage of the value of property securing the loan,     refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are measured using     combined LTV which measures the carrying value of the combined     loans that have liens against the property and the available     line of credit as a percentage of the appraised value of the     property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. Refreshed FICO     score measures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the     financial obligations of the borrower and the borrowers     credit history. At a minimum, FICO scores are refreshed     quarterly, and in many cases, more frequently. Refreshed FICO     score is also a primary credit quality indicator for the credit     card and other consumer portfolio segment and the business card     portfolio within U.S. small business commercial. The     Corporations commercial loans are evaluated using pass     rated or reservable criticized as the primary credit quality     indicator. The term reservable criticized refers to those     commercial loans that are internally classified or listed by the     Corporation as special mention, substandard or doubtful. These     assets pose an elevated risk and may have a high probability of     default or total loss. Pass rated refers to all loans not     considered criticized. In addition to these primary credit     quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit quality     indicators for certain types of loans.

Impaired loans include     nonperforming commercial loans, all TDRs, including           both commercial and consumer TDRs, and the renegotiated credit     card, consumer lending and small business loan portfolios (the     renegotiated portfolio). Impaired loans exclude nonperforming     consumer loans unless they are classified as TDRs, all     commercial leases and all loans accounted for under the fair     value option.

The Corporation seeks to assist customers that are experiencing     financial difficulty by renegotiating loans within the     renegotiated portfolio while ensuring compliance with Federal     Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) guidelines.     Substantially all modifications in the renegotiated portfolio     are considered to be both TDRs and impaired loans. The     renegotiated portfolio may include modifications, both short-     and long-term, of interest rates or payment amounts or a     combination thereof. The Corporation makes loan           modifications, primarily utilizing internal renegotiation     programs via direct customer contact, that manage     customers debt exposures held only by the Corporation.     Additionally, the Corporation makes loan modifications with     consumers who have elected to work with external renegotiation     agencies and these modifications provide solutions to     customers entire unsecured debt structures. Under both     internal and external programs, customers receive reduced annual     percentage rates with fixed payments that amortize loan balances     over a     60-month     period. Under both programs, for credit card loans, a     customers charging privileges are revoked.               Bank of America     2010     169     Table of Contents               The following tables provide detailed information on the     Corporations primary modification programs for the     renegotiated portfolio. At December 31, 2010, all     renegotiated credit card and other consumer loans were     considered impaired and have a related allowance as shown in the     table below. The allowance for credit              card loans is based on the present value of projected cash     flows discounted using the interest rate in effect prior to     restructuring and prior to any risk-based or penalty-based     increase in rate.

The renegotiated TDR portfolio is     excluded from nonperforming loans as the Corporation generally     does not classify consumer loans not secured by real           estate as nonperforming as these loans are generally charged off     no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes     180 days past due. Current period amounts include the     impact of new consolidation guidance which resulted in the     consolidation of credit card and certain other securitization     trusts.               170     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents         Purchased     Credit-impaired Loans       PCI loans are acquired loans with evidence of credit quality     deterioration since origination for which it is probable at     purchase date that the Corporation will be unable to collect all     contractually required payments. In connection with the     Countrywide acquisition in 2008, the Corporation acquired PCI     loans, substantially all of which were residential mortgage,     home equity and discontinued real estate loans. In connection     with the Merrill Lynch acquisition in 2009, the Corporation     acquired PCI loans, substantially all of which were residential     mortgage and commercial loans.       The table below presents the remaining unpaid principal balance     and carrying amount, excluding the valuation reserve, for PCI     loans at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Prior to January 1,     2010, pooled loans that were modified subsequent to acquisition     were reviewed to compare modified contractual cash flows to           the PCI carrying value. If the present value of the modified     cash flows was less than the carrying value, the loan was     removed from the PCI loan pool at its carrying value, as well as     any related allowance for loan and lease losses, and was     classified as a TDR. The carrying value of PCI loan TDRs that     were removed from the PCI pool prior to January 1, 2010     totaled $2.1 billion. At December 31, 2010,     $1.6 billion of those classified as TDRs were on accrual     status. The carrying value of these modified loans, net of     allowance, was approximately 65 percent of the unpaid     principal balance.       The table below shows activity for the accretable yield on PCI     loans. The $14 million and $1.4 billion     reclassifications to nonaccretable difference during 2010 and     2009 reflect a reduction in estimated interest cash flows during     the year.

This compared to     $3.5 billion in 2009 and $750 million in 2008. The     amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses associated     with the PCI loan portfolio was $6.4 billion,     $3.9 billion and $750 million at December 31,     2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.       The other amount under allowance for loan and lease     losses for 2009 includes a $750 million reduction in the     allowance for loan and lease losses related to $8.5 billion     of credit card loans that were exchanged for a $7.8 billion     HTM debt security partially offset by a $340 million     increase associated with the reclassification to other assets of     the amount reimbursable under residential mortgage cash     collateralized synthetic securitizations. The 2008           other amount under allowance for loan and lease     losses includes the $1.2 billion addition of the     Countrywide allowance for loan losses as of July 1, 2008.       The other amount under the reserve for unfunded     lending commitments for 2009 includes the remaining balance of     the acquired Merrill Lynch reserve excluding those commitments     accounted for under the fair value option, net of accretion, and     the impact of funding previously unfunded positions. This amount     in 2010 represents primarily accretion of the Merrill Lynch     purchase accounting adjustment and the impact of funding     previously unfunded positions.

(3)   Outstanding loan and lease balances     and ratios do not include loans accounted for under the fair     value option. Loans accounted for under the fair value option     were $3.3 billion at December 31, 2010.             n/a = not applicable         172     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents            NOTE 8 Securitizations     and Other Variable Interest Entities        The Corporation utilizes VIEs in the ordinary course of business     to support its own and its customers financing and     investing needs. The Corporation routinely securitizes loans and     debt securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the     Corporation and as a means of transferring the economic risk of     the loans or debt securities to third parties. The Corporation     also administers structures or invests in other VIEs including     CDOs, investment vehicles and other entities.       A VIE is an entity that lacks equity investors or whose equity     investors do not have a controlling financial interest in the     entity through their equity investments. The entity that has a     controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the     primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. In accordance with     the new consolidation guidance effective January 1, 2010,     the Corporation is deemed to have a controlling financial     interest and is the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has both     the power to direct the activities of the VIE           that most significantly impact the VIEs economic     performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to     receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the     VIE. As a result of this change in accounting, the Corporation     consolidated certain VIEs and former QSPEs that were previously     unconsolidated. Incremental assets of newly consolidated VIEs on     January 1, 2010, after elimination of intercompany balances     and net of deferred taxes, included $69.7 billion in credit     card securitizations, $15.6 billion in commercial paper     conduits, $4.7 billion in home equity securitizations,     $4.7 billion in municipal bond trusts and $5.7 billion     in other VIEs. The net incremental impact of this accounting     change on the Corporations Consolidated Balance Sheet is     set forth in the table below. The net effect of the accounting     change on January 1, 2010 shareholders equity     was a $6.2 billion charge to retained earnings,     net-of-tax,     primarily from the increase in the allowance for loan and lease     losses, as well as a $116 million charge to accumulated     OCI,     net-of-tax,     for the net unrealized losses on AFS debt securities in newly     consolidated VIEs.

The tables also     present the Corporations maximum exposure to loss at     December 31, 2010 and 2009 resulting from its involvement     with consolidated VIEs and unconsolidated VIEs in which the     Corporation holds a variable interest. The Corporations     maximum exposure to loss is based on the unlikely event that all     of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and incorporates not     only potential losses associated with assets recorded on the     Corporations Consolidated Balance Sheet but also potential     losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments such as     unfunded liquidity commitments and other contractual     arrangements. The Corporations maximum exposure to loss     does not include losses previously recognized through     write-downs of assets on the Corporations Consolidated     Balance Sheet.       The Corporation invests in asset-backed securities issued by     third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of involvement.     These securities are included in Note 3      Trading Account Assets and Liabilities and     Note 5  Securities. In addition, the     Corporation uses VIEs such as trust preferred securities trusts     in connection with its funding activities as described in     Note 13  Long-term Debt. The Corporation     also uses VIEs in the form of synthetic securitization vehicles     to mitigate a portion of the credit risk on its residential     mortgage loan portfolio, as described in     Note 6  Outstanding Loans and Leases. The     Corporation uses VIEs, such as cash funds managed within     GWIM, to provide investment opportunities for clients.     Prior to 2010, the Corporation provided support to certain of     these cash funds in the form of capital commitments in the event     the net asset value per unit of a fund declined below certain     thresholds. The Corporation recorded a loss of           $195 million in 2009 as the result of these commitments,     which were terminated in 2009. These VIEs, which are not     consolidated by the Corporation, are not included in the tables     within this Note.       Except as described below and with regard to the cash funds, as     of December 31, 2010, the Corporation has not provided     financial support to consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs that it     was not previously contractually required to provide, nor does     it intend to do so.     Mortgage-related     Securitizations     First-lien     Mortgages       As part of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation     securitizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage     loans it originates or purchases from third parties, generally     in the form of MBS guaranteed by GSEs, or GNMA in the case of     FHA-insured and U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs     (VA)-guaranteed mortgage loans. Securitization occurs in     conjunction with or shortly after loan closing or purchase. In     addition, the Corporation may, from time to time, securitize     commercial mortgages it originates or purchases from other     entities. The Corporation typically services the loans it     securitizes. Further, the Corporation may retain beneficial     interests in the securitization trusts including senior and     subordinate securities and equity tranches issued by the trusts.     Except as described below and in Note 9      Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate     Guarantees, the Corporation does not provide guarantees or     recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard     representations and warranties.       The table below summarizes select information related to     first-lien mortgage securitizations for 2010 and 2009.

(2)   Substantially all of the first-lien     residential mortgage loans securitized are initially classified     as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. As such,     gains are recognized on these LHFS prior to securitization.     During 2010 and 2009, the Corporation recognized     $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion of gains on these LHFS,     net of hedges.                       In addition to cash proceeds as reported in the table above, the     Corporation received securities with an initial fair value of     $23.7 billion in connection with agency first-lien     residential mortgage securitizations in 2010. All of these     securities were initially classified as Level 2 assets     within the fair value hierarchy. During 2010, there were no     changes to the initial classification.       The Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or     securitization of first-lien mortgage loans. Servicing fee and     ancillary fee income on consumer mortgage loans serviced,     including securitizations where the Corporation has continuing     involvement, were $6.4 billion and $6.2 billion in     2010 and 2009. Servicing advances on consumer mortgage loans,     including securitizations where the Corporation has continuing     involvement, were $24.3 billion and $19.3 billion at     December 31, 2010 and 2009. The Corporation may have the     option to repurchase delinquent loans out of           securitization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing     advances it is required to make. During 2010 and 2009,     $14.5 billion and $13.1 billion of loans were     repurchased from first-lien securitization trusts as a result of     loan delinquencies or in order to perform modifications. The     majority of these loans repurchased were FHA insured mortgages     collateralizing GNMA securities. In addition, the Corporation     has retained commercial MSRs from the sale or securitization of     commercial mortgage loans. Servicing fee and ancillary fee     income on commercial mortgage loans serviced, including     securitizations where the Corporation has continuing     involvement, were $21 million and $49 million in 2010     and 2009. Servicing advances on commercial mortgage loans,     including securitizations where the Corporation has continuing     involvement, were $156 million and $109 million at     December 31, 2010 and 2009.               174     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents          The table below summarizes select information related to     first-lien mortgage securitization trusts in which the     Corporation held a variable interest at December 31, 2010     and 2009.

(2)   At December 31, 2010 and 2009,     $204 million and $15 million of the debt securities     classified as trading account assets were senior securities and     $5 million and $1 million were subordinate securities.         (3)   As a holder of these securities,     the Corporation receives scheduled principal and interest     payments. During 2010 and 2009, there were no OTTI losses     recorded on those securities classified as AFS debt securities.         (4)   At December 31, 2010 and 2009,     $35 million and $47 million represent subordinate debt     securities held. At December 31, 2009, $100 million     are residual interests classified as AFS debt securities.                       Under the terms of the Corporations home equity loan     securitizations, advances are made to borrowers when they draw     on their lines of credit and the Corporation is reimbursed for     those advances from the cash flows in the securitization. During     the revolving period of the securitization, this reimbursement     normally occurs within a short period after the advance.     However, when certain securitization transactions have begun a     rapid amortization period, reimbursement of the     Corporations advance occurs only after other parties in     the securitization have received all of the cash flows to which     they are entitled. This has the effect of extending the time     period for which the Corporations advances are     outstanding. In addition, if loan losses requiring draws on     monoline insurers policies, which protect the bondholders     in the securitization, exceed a specified threshold or duration,     the Corporation may not receive reimbursement for all of the     funds advanced to borrowers, as the senior bondholders and the     monoline insurers have priority for repayment.       Substantially all of the home equity loan securitizations for     which the Corporation has an obligation to provide subordinate     advances have entered rapid amortization. The Corporation     evaluates each of these securitizations for potential losses due     to non-recoverable advances by estimating the amount and timing     of future losses on the underlying loans, the excess spread     available to cover such losses and potential cash flow     shortfalls during rapid amortization. A maximum funding     obligation attributable to rapid           amortization cannot be calculated as a home equity borrower has     the ability to pay down and re-draw balances. At     December 31, 2010 and 2009, home equity loan securitization     transactions in rapid amortization, including both consolidated     and unconsolidated trusts, had $12.5 billion and     $14.1 billion of trust certificates outstanding. This     amount is significantly greater than the amount the Corporation     expects to fund. At December 31, 2010, the remaining     $93 million of trust certificates outstanding related to     these types of securitization transactions are expected to enter     rapid amortization during the next 12 months. The charges     that will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid     amortization events depend on the performance of the loans, the     amount of subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows.     At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the reserve for losses on     expected future draw obligations on the home equity loan     securitizations in or expected to be in rapid amortization was     $131 million and $178 million.       The Corporation has consumer MSRs from the sale or     securitization of home equity loans. The Corporation recorded     $79 million and $128 million of servicing fee income     related to home equity securitizations during 2010 and 2009. The     Corporation repurchased $17 million and $31 million of     loans from home equity securitization trusts in order to perform     modifications or pursuant to clean up calls during 2010 and 2009.               176     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents         Credit Card     Securitizations       The Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card     loans. The Corporations continuing involvement with the     securitization trusts includes servicing the receivables,     retaining an undivided interest (sellers interest) in the     receivables, and holding certain retained interests including     senior and subordinate securities, discount receivables,     subordinate interests in accrued interest and fees on the     securitized receivables, and cash reserve accounts. The     Corporation consolidated all credit card securitization trusts     on           January 1, 2010 in accordance with new consolidation     guidance. Certain retained interests, including senior and     subordinate securities, were eliminated in consolidation. The     sellers interest in the trusts, which is pari passu to the     investors interest, and the discount receivables continue     to be classified in loans and leases.

This commercial paper program was terminated in     2010.         (2)   As a holder of these securities,     the Corporation receives scheduled principal and interest     payments. During 2009, there were no OTTI losses recorded on     those securities classified as AFS or HTM debt securities.         (3)   At December 31, 2010 and 2009,     loans and leases includes $20.4 billion and     $10.8 billion of sellers interest and     $3.8 billion and $4.1 billion of discount receivables.         (4)   At December 31, 2010, all     other assets includes restricted cash accounts and unbilled     accrued interest and fees. At December 31, 2009, all other     assets includes discount subordinate interests in accrued     interest and fees on the securitized receivables, cash reserve     accounts and interest-only strips which are carried at fair     value.                       During 2010, $2.9 billion of new senior debt securities     were issued to external investors from the credit card     securitization trusts. There were no new debt securities issued     to external investors from the credit card securitization trusts     during 2009. Collections reinvested in revolving period     securitizations were $133.8 billion and cash flows received     on residual interests were $5.5 billion during 2009.       At December 31, 2009, there were no recognized servicing     assets or liabilities associated with any of the credit card     securitization transactions. The Corporation recorded     $2.0 billion in servicing fees related to credit card     securitizations during 2009.       During 2010 and 2009, subordinate securities with a notional     principal amount of $11.5 billion and $7.8 billion and     a stated interest rate of zero percent were issued by certain     credit card securitization trusts to the Corporation. In     addition, the Corporation has elected to designate a specified     percentage of new receivables transferred to the trusts as     discount           receivables such that principal collections thereon are     added to finance charges which increases the yield in the trust.     Through the designation of newly transferred receivables as     discount receivables, the Corporation has subordinated a portion     of its sellers interest to the investors interest.     These actions, which were specifically permitted by the terms of     the trust documents, were taken in an effort to address the     decline in the excess spread of the U.S. and U.K. Credit     Card Securitization Trusts. As these trusts were consolidated on     January 1, 2010, the issuance of subordinate securities and     the discount receivables election had no impact on the     Corporations consolidated results during 2010 or 2009. At     December 31, 2009, the carrying amount and fair value of     the retained subordinate securities were $6.6 billion and     $6.4 billion. These balances were eliminated on     January 1, 2010 with the consolidation of the trusts. The     outstanding principal balance of discount receivables, which are     classified in loans and leases, was $3.8 billion and     $4.1 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

scheduled principal and interest     payments. During 2010 and 2009, there were no significant OTTI     losses recorded on those securities classified as AFS debt     securities.         (2)   The retained senior and subordinate     securities were valued using quoted market prices or observable     market inputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).         (3)   The retained residual interests are     carried at fair value which was derived using model valuations     (Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy).               Resecuritization     Trusts       The Corporation transfers existing securities, typically MBS,     into resecuritization vehicles at the request of customers     seeking securities with specific characteristics. The     Corporation may also enter into resecuritizations of securities     within its investment portfolio for purposes of improving     liquidity and capital, and managing credit or interest rate     risk. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities     performed in a resecuritization trust and no single investor has     the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust.       During 2010, the Corporation resecuritized $97.7 billion of     MBS, including $71.3 billion of securities purchased from     third parties compared to $49.2 billion in 2009. Net losses     upon sale totaled $144 million during 2010 compared to net     gains of $213 million in 2009. The Corporation consolidates     a resecuritization trust if it has sole discretion over the     design of the trust, including the identification of securities     to be transferred in and the structure of securities to be     issued, and also retains a variable interest that could     potentially be significant to the trust. If one or a limited     number of third-party investors share responsibility for the     design of the trust and purchase a significant portion of     subordinate securities, the Corporation does not consolidate the     trust. Prior to 2010, these resecuritization trusts were     typically QSPEs and as such were not subject to consolidation by     the Corporation.         Municipal Bond     Trusts       The Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold     highly rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The vast     majority of the bonds are rated AAA or AA and some of the bonds     benefit from insurance provided by monolines. The trusts obtain     financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that     reprice on a weekly or other basis to third-party investors. The     Corporation may serve as remarketing agent     and/or     liquidity provider for the trusts. The floating-rate investors     have the right to tender the certificates at specified dates,     often with as little as seven days notice. Should the     Corporation be unable to remarket the tendered certificates, it     is generally obligated to purchase them at par under standby     liquidity facilities unless the bonds credit rating has     declined below investment-grade or there has been an event of     default or bankruptcy of the issuer and insurer.           178     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents               The Corporation also provides credit enhancement to investors in     certain municipal bond trusts whereby the Corporation guarantees     the payment of interest and principal on floating-rate     certificates issued by these trusts in the event of default by     the issuer of the underlying municipal bond. If a customer holds     the residual interest in a trust, that customer typically has     the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust at any time, while     the Corporation typically has the ability to trigger the     liquidation of that trust if the market value of the bonds held     in the trust declines below a specified threshold. This     arrangement is designed to limit market losses to an amount that     is less than the customers residual interest, effectively     preventing the Corporation from absorbing losses incurred on     assets held within that trust. The weighted-average remaining     life of bonds held in the trusts at December 31, 2010 was     13.3 years. There were no material write-downs or     downgrades of assets or issuers during 2010.       During 2010 and 2009, the Corporation was the transferor of     assets into unconsolidated municipal bond trusts and received     cash proceeds from new securitizations of $1.2 billion and     $664 million. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the     principal balance outstanding for unconsolidated municipal bond     securitization trusts for which the Corporation was transferor     was $2.2 billion and $6.9 billion.       The Corporations liquidity commitments to unconsolidated     municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation     was transferor, totaled $4.0 billion and $9.8 billion     at December 31, 2010 and 2009.     Automobile and     Other Securitization Trusts       The Corporation transfers automobile and other loans into     securitization trusts, typically to improve liquidity or manage     credit risk. At December 31, 2010, the Corporation serviced     assets or otherwise had continuing           involvement with automobile and other securitization trusts with     outstanding balances of $10.5 billion, including trusts     collateralized by automobile loans of $8.4 billion, student     loans of $1.3 billion, and other loans and receivables of     $774 million. At December 31, 2009, the Corporation     serviced assets or otherwise had continuing involvement with     automobile and other securitization trusts with outstanding     balances of $11.9 billion, including trusts collateralized     by automobile loans of $11.0 billion and other loans of     $905 million. The Corporation transferred $3.0 billion     of automobile loans, $1.3 billion of student loans and     $303 million of other receivables to the trusts during 2010     and $9.0 billion of automobile loans during 2009.     Multi-seller     Conduits       The Corporation previously administered four multi-seller     conduits which provided a low-cost funding alternative to the     conduits customers by facilitating access to the     commercial paper market. These customers sold or otherwise     transferred assets to the conduits, which in turn issued     short-term commercial paper that was rated high-grade and was     collateralized by the underlying assets. The Corporation     provided combinations of liquidity and SBLCs to the conduits for     the benefit of third-party investors. These commitments had an     aggregate notional amount outstanding of $34.5 billion at     December 31, 2009. The Corporation liquidated the four     conduits and terminated all liquidity and other commitments     during 2010. Liquidation of the conduits did not impact the     Corporations consolidated results of operations.       The table below summarizes select information related to     multi-seller conduits in which the Corporation held a variable     interest at December 31, 2009.

Synthetic CDOs enter into a portfolio of credit default swaps to     synthetically create exposure to fixed-income securities. CLOs     are a subset of CDOs which hold pools of loans, typically     corporate loans or commercial mortgages. CDOs are typically     managed by third-party portfolio managers. The Corporation     transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the     CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs, including     a credit default swap counterparty for synthetic CDOs. The           Corporation has also entered into total return swaps with     certain CDOs whereby the Corporation absorbs the economic     returns generated by specified assets held by the CDO. The     Corporation receives fees for structuring CDOs and providing     liquidity support for super senior tranches of securities issued     by certain CDOs.

The Corporations maximum loss exposure of     $6.8 billion at December 31, 2010 includes     $1.8 billion of super senior CDO exposure,     $2.2 billion of exposure to CDO financing facilities and     $2.8 billion of other non-super senior exposure. This     exposure is calculated on a gross basis and does not reflect any     benefit from insurance purchased from third parties other than     the CDO itself. Net of purchased insurance but including     securities retained from liquidations of CDOs, the     Corporations net exposure to super senior CDO-related     positions was $1.2 billion at December 31, 2010. The     CDO financing facilities, which are consolidated, obtain funding     from third parties for CDO positions which are principally     classified in trading account assets on the Corporations     Consolidated Balance Sheet. The CDO financing facilities     long-term debt at December 31, 2010 totaled     $2.6 billion, all of which has recourse to the general     credit of the Corporation.       At December 31, 2010, the Corporation had $951 million     notional amount of super senior CDO liquidity exposure,     including derivatives and other exposures with third parties     that hold super senior cash positions on the Corporations     behalf and to certain synthetic CDOs through which the     Corporation is obligated to purchase super senior CDO securities     at par value if the CDOs           need cash to make payments due under credit default swaps     written by the CDO vehicles. Liquidity-related commitments also     include $1.7 billion notional amount of derivative     contracts with unconsolidated special purpose entities (SPEs),     principally CDO vehicles, which hold non-super senior CDO debt     securities or other debt securities on the Corporations     behalf. These derivatives comprise substantially all of the     $1.7 billion notional amount of derivative contracts     through which the Corporation obtains funding from third-party     SPEs, as described in Note 14  Commitments     and Contingencies. The Corporations $2.7 billion     of aggregate liquidity exposure to CDOs at December 31,     2010 is included in the table above to the extent that the     Corporation sponsored the CDO vehicle or the liquidity exposure     is more than insignificant compared to total assets of the CDO     vehicle. Liquidity exposure included in the table is reported     net of previously recorded losses.       The Corporations maximum exposure to loss is significantly     less than the total assets of the CDO vehicles in the table     above because the Corporation typically has exposure to only a     portion of the total assets. The Corporation has also purchased     credit protection from some of the same CDO vehicles in which it     invested, thus reducing the Corporations maximum exposure     to loss.               180     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents      Customer     Vehicles       Customer vehicles include credit-linked and equity-linked note     vehicles, repackaging vehicles and asset acquisition vehicles,     which are typically created on behalf of customers who wish to     obtain market or credit exposure to a specific company or     financial instrument.

The vehicles purchase     high-grade assets as collateral and enter into credit default     swaps or equity derivatives to synthetically create the credit     or equity risk to pay the specified return on the notes. The     Corporation is typically the counterparty for some or all of the     credit and equity derivatives and, to a lesser extent, it may     invest in securities issued by the vehicles. The Corporation may     also enter into interest rate or foreign currency derivatives     with the vehicles. The Corporation also had approximately     $338 million of other liquidity commitments, including     written put options and collateral value guarantees, with     unconsolidated credit-linked and equity-linked note vehicles at     December 31, 2010.       Repackaging vehicles issue notes that are designed to     incorporate risk characteristics desired by customers. The     vehicles hold debt instruments such as corporate bonds,     convertible bonds or asset-backed securities with the desired     credit risk profile. The Corporation enters into derivatives     with the vehicles to change the interest rate or foreign     currency profile of the debt instruments. If a vehicle holds     convertible bonds and the Corporation retains           the conversion option, the Corporation is deemed to have     controlling financial interest and consolidates the vehicle.       Asset acquisition vehicles acquire financial instruments,     typically loans, at the direction of a single customer and     obtain funding through the issuance of structured notes to the     Corporation. At the time the vehicle acquires an asset, the     Corporation enters into total return swaps with the customer     such that the economic returns of the asset are passed through     to the customer. The Corporation is exposed to counterparty     credit risk if the asset declines in value and the customer     defaults on its obligation to the Corporation under the total     return swaps. The Corporations risk may be mitigated by     collateral or other arrangements. The Corporation consolidates     these vehicles because it has the power to manage the assets in     the vehicles and owns all of the structured notes issued by the     vehicles.       The Corporations maximum exposure to loss from customer     vehicles includes the notional amount of the credit or equity     derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty, net of     losses previously recorded, and the Corporations     investment, if any, in securities issued by the vehicles. It has     not been reduced to reflect the benefit of offsetting swaps with     the customers or collateral arrangements.

At     December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Corporations     consolidated investment vehicles had total assets of     $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion. The Corporation also     held investments in unconsolidated vehicles with total assets of     $7.9 billion and $8.8 billion at December 31,     2010 and 2009. The Corporations maximum exposure to loss     associated with both consolidated and unconsolidated investment     vehicles totaled $8.7 billion and $10.7 billion at     December 31, 2010 and 2009.       On January 1, 2010, the Corporation consolidated     $2.5 billion of investment vehicles. This amount included a     real estate investment fund with assets of $1.5 billion     which is designed to provide returns to clients through limited     partnership holdings. At that time, the Corporation was the     general partner and also had a limited partnership interest in     the fund. The Corporation provided support to the fund and     therefore considers the fund to be a VIE. In late 2010, the     Corporation transferred its general partnership interest to a     third party, conveying all ongoing management responsibilities     to that third party. As a result, the Corporation deconsolidated     the fund because it no longer has a controlling financial     interest. The Corporation continues to retain a limited     partnership interest, which is included in the table above.         Collective     Investment Funds       The Corporation is trustee for certain common and collective     investment funds that provide investment opportunities for     eligible clients of GWIM. These funds, which had total     assets of $21.2 billion at December 31, 2010, hold a     variety of cash, debt and equity investments. The Corporation     does not have a variable interest in these funds, except as     described below.       In 2010, the governing documents of a stable value collective     investment fund with total assets of $8.1 billion at     December 31, 2010 were modified to facilitate the planned     liquidation of the fund. The modifications resulted in the     termination of third-party insurance contracts which were     replaced by a guarantee from the Corporation of the net asset     value of the fund, which principally holds short-term     U.S. Treasury and agency securities. In addition, the     Corporation acquired the unilateral ability to replace the     funds asset manager. As a result of these changes, the     Corporation acquired a controlling financial interest in and     consolidated the fund. Consolidation did not have a significant     impact on the Corporations 2010 results of operations.     This fund was not previously consolidated because the     Corporation did not have the unilateral power to replace the     asset manager, nor did it have a variable interest in the fund     that was more than insignificant. Liquidation of the fund will     be finalized in 2011.               182     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents         Leveraged Lease     Trusts       The Corporations net investment in consolidated leveraged     lease trusts totaled $5.2 billion and $5.6 billion at     December 31, 2010 and 2009. The trusts hold long-lived     equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution     equipment, and commercial aircraft. The Corporation structures     the trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The net     investment represents the Corporations maximum loss     exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged     lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the leveraged     lease trusts is nonrecourse to the Corporation. The Corporation     has no liquidity exposure to these leveraged lease trusts.     Asset Acquisition     Conduits       The Corporation currently administers two asset acquisition     conduits which acquire assets on behalf of the Corporation or     its customers. The Corporation liquidated a third conduit during     2010. Liquidation of the conduit did not impact the     Corporations consolidated results of operations.         These conduits had total assets of $640 million and     $2.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. One of the     conduits acquires assets at the request of customers who wish to     benefit from the economic returns of the specified assets on a     leveraged basis, which consist principally of liquid     exchange-traded equity securities. The second conduit holds     subordinate AFS debt securities for the Corporations     benefit. The conduits obtain funding by issuing commercial paper     and subordinate certificates to third-party investors. Repayment     of the commercial paper and certificates is assured by total     return swaps between the Corporation and the conduits. When a     conduit acquires assets for the benefit of the     Corporations customers, the Corporation enters into     back-to-back     total return swaps with the conduit and the customer such that     the economic returns of the assets are passed through to the     customer. The Corporations exposure to the counterparty     credit risk of its customers is mitigated by the ability to     liquidate an asset held in the conduit if the customer defaults     on its obligation. The Corporation receives fees for serving as     commercial paper placement agent and for providing     administrative services to the conduits. At December 31,     2010 and 2009, the Corporation did not hold any commercial paper     issued by the asset acquisition conduits other than incidentally     and in its role as a commercial paper dealer.     Real Estate     Vehicles       The Corporation held investments in unconsolidated real estate     vehicles of $5.4 billion and $4.8 billion at     December 31, 2010 and 2009, which consisted of limited     partnership investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships     that finance the construction and rehabilitation of affordable     rental housing. An unrelated third party is typically the     general partner and has control over the significant activities     of the partnership. The Corporation earns a return primarily     through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the affordable     housing projects. The Corporations risk of loss is     mitigated by policies requiring that the project qualify for the     expected tax credits prior to making its investment. The     Corporation may from time to time be asked to invest additional     amounts to support a troubled project. Such additional     investments have not been and are not expected to be significant.     Other     Transactions       In 2010 and prior years, the Corporation transferred pools of     securities to certain independent third parties and provided     financing for approximately 75 percent of the purchase     price under asset-backed financing arrangements. At     December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Corporations maximum     loss exposure under these financing arrangements was     $6.5 billion and $6.8 billion, substantially all of     which was classified as loans on the Corporations     Consolidated Balance Sheet. All principal and interest payments     have been received when due in accordance with their contractual     terms. These arrangements are not included in the table on     page 182 because the purchasers are not VIEs.          NOTE 9 Representations     and Warranties Obligations and Corporate     Guarantees      Background       The Corporation securitizes first-lien residential mortgage     loans, generally in the form of MBS guaranteed by GSEs or GNMA     in the case of FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgage loans. In     addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain     subsidiaries have sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage     loans, home equity loans and other second-lien loans as     private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. In     connection with these transactions, the Corporation or certain     subsidiaries or legacy companies made various representations     and warranties. These representations and warranties, as     governed by the agreements, related to, among other things, the     ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the     loan, the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the     property securing the loan, the process used to select the loan     for inclusion in a transaction, the loans compliance with     any applicable loan criteria, including underwriting standards,     and the loans compliance with applicable federal, state     and local laws. Breaches of these representations and warranties     may result in a requirement to repurchase mortgage loans, or to     otherwise make whole or provide other remedy to a whole-loan     buyer or securitization trust. In such cases, the Corporation     would be exposed to any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage     loans. The Corporations credit loss would be reduced by     any recourse to sellers of loans (i.e., correspondents) for     representations and warranties previously provided. When a loan     was originated by a third-party correspondent, the Corporation     typically has the right to seek a recovery of related repurchase     losses from the correspondent originator. At December 31,     2010, loans purchased from correspondents comprised     approximately 25 percent of loans underlying outstanding     repurchase demands. During 2010, the Corporation experienced a     decrease in recoveries from correspondents, however, the actual     recovery rate may vary from period to period based upon the     underlying mix of correspondents (e.g., active, inactive,     out-of-business     originators) from which recoveries are sought.       Subject to the requirements and limitations of the applicable     agreements, these representations and warranties can be enforced     by the securitization trustee or the whole-loan buyer as     governed by the applicable agreement or, in certain first-lien     and home equity securitizations where monolines have insured all     or some of the related bonds issued, by the monoline insurer at     any time over the life of the loan. Importantly, in the case of     non-GSE loans, the contractual liability to repurchase arises if     there is a breach of the representations and warranties that     materially and adversely affects the interest of all investors,     or if there is a breach of other standards established by the     terms of the related sale agreement. The Corporation believes     that the longer a loan performs prior to default, the less     likely it is that an alleged underwriting breach of     representations and warranties had a material impact on the     loans performance. Historically, most demands for     repurchase have occurred within the first few years after     origination, generally after a loan has defaulted. However, in     recent periods the time horizon has lengthened due to increased     repurchase request activity across all vintages.       The Corporations current operations are structured to     limit the risk of repurchase and accompanying credit exposure by     seeking to ensure consistent production of mortgages in     accordance with its underwriting procedures and by servicing     those mortgages consistent with its contractual obligations. In     addition, certain securitizations include guarantees written to     protect certain purchasers of the loans from credit losses up to     a specified amount. The fair value of the probable losses to be     absorbed under the representations and warranties obligations     and the guarantees is recorded as an accrued liability when the     loans are sold. The liability for probable losses is updated by     accruing a representations and warranties provision in mortgage     banking income throughout the life of the loan as necessary when     additional relevant information becomes available. The     methodology used to estimate              Bank of America     2010     183     Table of Contents             the liability for representations and warranties is a function     of the representations and warranties given and considers a     variety of factors, which include, depending on the     counterparty, actual defaults, estimated future defaults,     historical loss experience, estimated home prices, probability     that a repurchase request will be received, number of payments     made by the borrower prior to default and probability that a     loan will be required to be repurchased. Historical experience     also considers recent events such as the agreements with the     GSEs on December 31, 2010, as discussed below. Changes to     any one of these factors could significantly impact the estimate     of the Corporations liability.       Although the timing and volume has varied, repurchase and     similar requests have increased in recent periods from buyers     and insurers, including monolines. The Corporation expects that     efforts to attempt to assert repurchase requests by monolines,     whole-loan investors and private-label securitization investors     may increase in the future. A     loan-by-loan     review of all properly presented repurchase requests is     performed and demands have been and will continue to be     contested to the extent not considered valid. In addition, the     Corporation may reach a bulk settlement with a counterparty (in     lieu of the     loan-by-loan     review process), on terms determined to be advantageous to the     Corporation.       On December 31, 2010, the Corporation reached agreements     with the GSEs under which the Corporation paid $2.8 billion     to resolve repurchase claims involving certain residential     mortgage loans sold directly to the GSEs by entities related to     legacy Countrywide. The agreements with FHLMC for     $1.28 billion extinguishes all outstanding and potential     mortgage repurchase and make-whole claims arising out of any     alleged breaches of selling representations and warranties     related to loans sold directly by legacy Countrywide to FHLMC     through 2008, subject to certain exceptions the Corporation does     not believe to be material. The agreement with FNMA for     $1.52 billion substantially resolves the existing pipeline     of repurchase and make-whole claims outstanding as of     September 20, 2010 arising out of alleged breaches of     selling representations and warranties related to loans sold     directly by legacy Countrywide to FNMA. These agreements with     the GSEs do not cover legacy Bank of America first-lien     residential mortgage loans sold directly to the GSEs, other     loans sold to the GSEs other than described above, loan     servicing obligations, other contractual obligations or loans     contained in private-label securitizations.       Overall, repurchase requests and disputes with buyers and     insurers regarding representations and warranties have increased     in recent periods which has resulted in an increase in     unresolved repurchase requests for monolines and other non-GSE     counterparties. Generally the volume of unresolved repurchase     requests from the FHA and VA for loans in GNMA-guaranteed     securities is not significant because the requests are limited     in number and are typically resolved quickly. The volume of     repurchase claims as a percentage of the volume of loans     purchased arising from loans sourced from brokers or purchased     from third-party sellers is relatively consistent with the           volume of repurchase claims as a percentage of the volume of     loans originated by the Corporation or its subsidiaries or     legacy companies.       The table below presents outstanding claims by counterparty and     product type at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The information     for 2010 reflects the impact of the recent agreements with the     GSEs.

The inclusion of these claims in the amounts     noted does not mean that the Corporation believes these claims     have satisfied the contractual thresholds to direct the     securitization trustee to take action or are otherwise     procedurally or substantively valid.                As presented in the table on page 185, during 2010 and 2009, the     Corporation paid $5.2 billion and $2.6 billion to     resolve $6.6 billion and $3.0 billion of repurchase     claims through repurchase or reimbursement to the investor or     securitization trust for losses they incurred, resulting in a     loss on the related loans at the time of repurchase or     reimbursement of $3.5 billion and $1.6 billion. The     amount of loss for loan repurchases is reduced by the fair value     of the underlying loan collateral. The repurchase of loans and     indemnification payments related to first-lien and home equity     repurchase claims generally resulted from material breaches of     representations and warranties related to the loans     material compliance with the applicable underwriting standards,     including borrower misrepresentation, credit exceptions without     sufficient compensating factors and non-compliance with     underwriting procedures, although the actual representations     made in a sales transaction and the resulting repurchase and     indemnification activity can vary by transaction or investor. A     direct relationship between the type of defect that causes the     breach of representations and warranties and the severity of the     realized loss has not been observed. Transactions to repurchase     or indemnification payments related to first-lien residential     mortgages primarily involved the GSEs while transactions to     repurchase or indemnification payments for home equity loans     primarily involved the monolines.               184     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents          The table below presents first-lien and home equity loan     repurchases and indemnification payments for 2010 and 2009.     These amounts include the agreement that was reached with FNMA     as discussed on page 184. These amounts do not include     $1.3 billion paid related to the agreement with FHLMC due     to the global nature of the agreement and, specifically, the     absence of a formal apportionment of the agreement amount     between current and future claims.

Generally, the     Corporation first becomes aware that a GSE is evaluating a     particular loan for repurchase when the Corporation receives a     request from a GSE to review the underlying loan file (file     request). Upon completing its review, the GSE may submit a     repurchase claim to the Corporation. Historically, most file     requests have not resulted in a repurchase claim. As soon as     practicable after receiving a repurchase request from either of     the GSEs, the Corporation evaluates the request and takes     appropriate action. Claim disputes are generally handled through     loan-level negotiations with the GSEs and the Corporation seeks     to resolve the repurchase request within 90 to 120 days of     the receipt of the request although tolerances exist for claims     that remain open beyond this timeframe. Experience with the GSEs     continues to evolve and any disputes are generally related to     areas including reasonableness of stated income, occupancy and     undisclosed liabilities in the vintages with the highest default     rates.     Monoline     Insurers       Unlike the repurchase protocols and experience established with     GSEs, experience with the monolines has been varied and the     protocols and experience with these counterparties has not been     as predictable as with the GSEs. The timetable for the loan file     request, the repurchase request, if any, response and resolution     varies by monoline. Where a breach of representations and     warranties given by the Corporation or subsidiaries or legacy     companies is confirmed on a given loan, settlement is generally     reached as to that loan within 60 to 90 days.       Properly presented repurchase requests for the monolines are     reviewed on a     loan-by-loan     basis. As part of an ongoing claims process, if the Corporation     does not believe a claim is valid, it will deny the claim and     generally indicate the reason for the denial to facilitate     meaningful dialogue with the counterparty although it is not     contractually obligated to do so. When there is disagreement as     to the resolution of a claim, meaningful dialogue and     negotiation is generally necessary between the parties to reach     conclusion on an individual claim. Certain monolines have     instituted litigation against legacy Countrywide and the     Corporation. When claims from these counterparties are denied,     the Corporation does not indicate its reason for denial as it is     not contractually obligated to do so. In the Corporations     experience, the monolines have been generally unwilling to     withdraw repurchase claims, regardless of whether and what     evidence was offered to refute a claim.             The pipeline of unresolved monoline claims where the Corporation     believes a valid defect has not been identified which would     constitute an actionable breach of representations and     warranties continued to grow in 2010. Through December 31,     2010, approximately 11 percent of monoline claims that the     Corporation initially denied have subsequently been resolved     through repurchase or make-whole payments and two percent have     been resolved through rescission. When a claim has been denied     and there has not been communication with the counterparty for     six months, the Corporation views these claims as inactive;     however, they remain in the outstanding claims balance until     resolution.       A liability for representations and warranties has been     established with respect to all monolines for monoline     repurchase requests based on valid identified loan defects and     for repurchase requests that are in the process of review based     on historical repurchase experience with a specific monoline to     the extent such experience provides a reasonable basis on which     to estimate incurred losses from repurchase activity. With     respect to certain monolines where the Corporation believes a     more consistent purchase experience has been established, a     liability has also been established related to repurchase     requests subject to negotiation and unasserted requests to     repurchase current and future defaulted loans. The Corporation     has had limited experience with most of the monoline insurers in     the repurchase process, including limited experience resolving     disputed claims. Also, certain monoline insurers have instituted     litigation against legacy Countrywide and Bank of America, which     limits the Corporations relationship and ability to enter     into constructive dialogue with these monolines to resolve the     open claims. For such monolines and other monolines with whom     the Corporation has limited repurchase experience, in view of     the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of those     repurchase requests where a valid defect has not been identified     or in predicting future claim requests and the related outcome     in the case of unasserted requests to repurchase loans from the     securitization trusts in which these monolines have insured all     or some of the related bonds, the Corporation cannot reasonably     estimate the eventual outcome. In addition, the timing of the     ultimate resolution or the eventual loss, if any, related to     those repurchase requests cannot be reasonably estimated. Thus,     with respect to these monolines, a liability for representations     and warranties has not been established related to repurchase     requests where a valid defect has not been identified, or in the     case of any unasserted requests to repurchase loans from the     securitization trusts in which such monolines have insured all     or some of the related bonds. However, certain monoline insurers     have engaged with the Corporation and legacy Countrywide in a     consistent              Bank of America     2010     185     Table of Contents             repurchase process and the Corporation has used that experience     to record a liability related to existing and future claims from     such counterparties.       At December 31, 2010, the unpaid principal balance of loans     related to unresolved repurchase requests previously received     from monolines was $4.8 billion, including     $3.0 billion in repurchase requests that have been reviewed     where it is believed a valid defect has not been identified     which would constitute an actionable breach of representations     and warranties and $1.8 billion in repurchase requests that     are in the process of review. As discussed on the previous page,     a portion of the repurchase requests that are initially denied     are ultimately resolved through repurchase or make-whole     payments, after additional dialogue and negotiation with the     monoline insurer. At December 31, 2010, the unpaid     principal balance of loans for which the monolines had requested     loan files for review but for which no repurchase request had     been received was $10.2 billion, excluding loans that had     been paid in full. There will likely be additional requests for     loan files in the future leading to repurchase requests. Such     requests may relate to loans that are currently in     securitization trusts or loans that have defaulted and are no     longer included in the unpaid principal balance of the loans in     the trusts. However, it is unlikely that a repurchase request     will be received for every loan in a securitization or every     file requested or that a valid defect exists for every loan     repurchase request. In addition, any claims paid related to     repurchase requests from a monoline are paid to the     securitization trust and may be used by the securitization trust     to repay any outstanding monoline advances or reduce future     advances from the monolines. To the extent that a monoline has     not advanced funds or does not anticipate that it will be     required to advance funds to the securitization trust, the     likelihood of receiving a repurchase request from a monoline may     be reduced as the monoline would receive limited or no benefit     from the payment of repurchase claims. Moreover, some monolines     are not currently performing their obligations under the     financial guaranty policies they issued which may, in certain     circumstances, impact their ability to present repurchase claims.     Whole Loan Sales     and Private-label Securitizations       The Corporation and its subsidiaries have limited experience     with private-label securitization repurchases as the number of     recent repurchase requests received has been limited as shown in     the outstanding claims table on page 184. The     representations and warranties, as governed by the private-label     securitizations, generally require that counterparties have the     ability to both assert a claim and actually prove that a loan     has an actionable defect under the applicable contracts. While a     securitization trustee may always investigate or demand     repurchase on its own action, in order for investors to direct     the securitization trustee to investigate loan files or demand     the repurchase of loans, the securitization agreements generally     require the security holders to hold a specified percentage,     such as 25 percent, of the voting rights of the outstanding     securities. In addition, the Corporation believes the agreements     for private-label securitizations generally contain less     rigorous representations and warranties and higher burdens on     investors seeking repurchases than the comparable agreements     with the GSEs.       The majority of repurchase requests that the Corporation has     received relate to whole loan sales. Most of the loans sold in     the form of whole loans were subsequently pooled with other     mortgages into private-label securitizations issued by     third-party buyers of the loans. The buyers of the whole loans     received representations and warranties in the sales transaction     and may retain those rights even when the loans are aggregated     with other collateral into private-label securitizations.     Properly presented repurchase requests for these whole loans are     reviewed on a     loan-by-loan     basis. If, after the Corporations review, it does not     believe a claim is valid, it will deny the claim and generally     indicate a reason for the denial. When the counterparty agrees     with the Corporations denial of the claim, the     counterparty may rescind the claim. When there is disagreement     as to the resolution of the claim, meaningful           dialogue and negotiation between the parties is generally     necessary to reach conclusion on an individual claim. Generally,     a whole loan sale claimant is engaged in the repurchase process     and the Corporation and the claimant reach resolution, either     through     loan-by-loan     negotiation or at times, through a bulk settlement. Through     December 31, 2010, approximately 17 percent of the     whole loan claims that the Corporation initially denied have     subsequently been resolved through repurchase or make-whole     payments and 53 percent have been resolved through     rescission or repayment in full by the borrower. Although the     timeline for resolution varies, once an actionable breach is     identified on a given loan, settlement is generally reached as     to that loan within 60 to 90 days. When a claim has been     denied and the Corporation does not have communication with the     counterparty for six months, the Corporation views these claims     as inactive; however, they remain in the outstanding claims     balance until resolution.       On October 18, 2010, Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, LP     (which changed its name to BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP), a     wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, in its capacity as     servicer on 115 private-label securitizations, which was     subsequently extended to 225 securitizations, received a letter     that asserts breaches of certain servicing obligations,     including an alleged failure to provide notice of breaches of     representations and warranties with respect to mortgage loans     included in the transactions. Additionally, the Corporation     received new claim demands totaling $1.7 billion in     correspondence from private-label securitization investors.     Private-label securitization investors generally do not have the     contractual right to demand repurchase of loans directly or the     right to access loan files. The inclusion of the     $1.7 billion in outstanding claims does not mean that the     Corporation believes these claims have satisfied the contractual     thresholds required for the private-label securitization     investors to direct the securitization trustee to take action or     are otherwise procedurally or substantively valid.     Liability for     Representations and Warranties and Corporate     Guarantees       The liability for representations and warranties and corporate     guarantees is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities     and the related provision is included in mortgage banking income.       The table below presents a rollforward of the liability for     representations and warranties and corporate guarantees.                                           (Dollars in millions)            2010               2009           Liability for representations     and warranties and corporate guarantees, beginning of     year        $   3,507               $       2,271              Merrill Lynch acquisition                               580              Additions for new sales            30                   41              Charge-offs            (4,803   )               (1,312       )          Provision            6,786                   1,851              Other            (82   )               76                                                Liability for representations     and warranties and corporate guarantees, December 31        $   5,438               $       3,507                                                        The liability for representations and warranties has been     established when those obligations are both probable and     reasonably estimable. As previously discussed, the Corporation     reached agreements with the GSEs resolving repurchase claims     involving certain residential mortgage loans sold to them by     entities related to legacy Countrywide. The Corporations     liability for obligations under representations and warranties     given to the GSEs considers the recent agreements and their     impact on the repurchase rates on future claims that may be     received on loans that have defaulted or that are estimated to     default. The Corporation believes that its remaining exposure to     repurchase obligations for first-lien residential mortgage loans     sold directly to the GSEs has been accounted for as a result of     these agreements and the associated adjustments to the recorded     liability for representations and              186     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents             warranties for first-lien residential mortgage loans sold     directly to the GSEs in 2010 and 2009, and for other loans sold     directly to the GSEs and not covered by these agreements. The     Corporation believes its predictive repurchase models, utilizing     its historical repurchase experience with the GSEs while     considering current developments, including the recent     agreements, projections of future defaults, as well as certain     assumptions regarding economic conditions, home prices and other     matters, allows it to reasonably estimate the liability for     representations and warranties on loans sold to the GSEs.     However, future provisions for representations and warranties     liability to the GSEs may be affected if actual experience is     different from the Corporations historical experience with     the GSEs or the Corporations projections of future     defaults and assumptions regarding economic conditions, home     prices and other matters that are incorporated in the provision     calculation. Although experience with non-GSE claims remains     limited, the Corporation expects additional activity in this     area going forward and the volume of repurchase claims from     monolines, whole-loan investors and investors in private-label     securitizations could increase in the future. It is reasonably     possible that future losses may occur and the Corporations     estimate is that the upper range of possible loss related to     non-GSE sales could be $7 billion to $10 billion over     existing accruals. This estimate does not represent a probable     loss, is based on currently available information, significant     judgment, and a number of assumptions that are subject to     change. A significant portion of this estimate relates to loans     originated through legacy Countrywide, and the repurchase     liability is generally limited to the original seller of the     loan. Future provisions and possible loss or range of loss may     be impacted if actual results are different from the     Corporations assumptions regarding economic conditions,     home prices and other matters and may vary by counterparty. The     resolution of the repurchase claims process with the non-GSE     counterparties will likely be a protracted process, and the     Corporation will vigorously contest any request for repurchase     if it concludes that a valid basis for repurchase claim does not     exist.      NOTE 10 Goodwill     and Intangible Assets      Goodwill       The table below presents goodwill balances by business segment     at December 31, 2010 and 2009. As discussed in more detail     in Note 26  Business Segment Information,     on January 1, 2010, the Corporation realigned the     former Global Banking and Global Markets business     segments. There was no impact on the reporting units used in     goodwill impairment testing. The reporting units utilized for     goodwill impairment tests are the business segments or one level     below the business segments as outlined in the following table.     Substantially all of the decline in goodwill in 2010 is the     result of $12.4 billion of goodwill impairment charges, as     described below. No goodwill impairment was recognized in 2009.     The decline in GWIM was attributable to the sale of     Columbia Managements long-term asset management business.

Under the Financial Reform Act and its amendment to the     Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Federal Reserve must     adopt rules within nine months of enactment of the Financial     Reform Act regarding the interchange fees that may be charged     with respect to electronic debit transactions. Those rules will     take effect one year after enactment of the Financial Reform     Act. The Financial Reform Act and the applicable rules are     expected to materially reduce the future revenues generated by     the debit card business of the Corporation. The     Corporations consumer and small business card products,     including the debit card business, are part of an integrated     platform within Global Card Services. During the three     months ended September 30, 2010, the Corporations     estimate of revenue loss due to the Financial Reform Act was     approximately $2.0 billion annually based on current     volumes. Accordingly, the Corporation performed an impairment     test for Global Card Services during the three months     ended September 30, 2010.       In step one of the impairment test, the fair value of Global     Card Services was estimated under the income approach where     the significant assumptions included the discount rate, terminal     value, expected loss rates and expected new account growth. The     Corporation also updated its estimated cash flows to reflect the     current strategic plan forecast and other portfolio assumptions.     Based on the results of step one of the impairment test, the     Corporation determined that the carrying amount of Global     Card Services, including goodwill, exceeded the fair value.     The carrying amount, fair value and goodwill for the Global     Card Services reporting unit were $39.2 billion,     $25.9 billion and $22.3 billion, respectively.     Accordingly, the Corporation performed step two of the goodwill     impairment test for this reporting unit. In step two, the     Corporation compared the implied fair value of the reporting     units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.     Under step two of the impairment test, significant assumptions     in measuring the fair value of the assets and liabilities     including discount rates, loss rates and interest rates were     updated to reflect the current economic conditions. Based on the     results of this goodwill impairment test for Global Card     Services, the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to the     reporting unit exceeded the implied fair value by     $10.4 billion. Accordingly, the Corporation recorded a     non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of     $10.4 billion to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in     Global Card Services from $22.3 billion to     $11.9 billion. The goodwill impairment test included     limited mitigation actions in Global Card Services to     recapture lost revenue. Although the Corporation has identified     other potential mitigation actions, the impact of these actions     going forward did not reduce the goodwill impairment charge     because these actions are in the early stages of development     and, additionally, certain of them may impact segments other     than Global Card Services (e.g., Deposits).       Due to the continued stress on Global Card Services as a     result of the Financial Reform Act, the Corporation concluded     that an additional impairment test should be performed for this     reporting unit during the three months ended December 31,     2010. In step one of the goodwill impairment test, the fair     value of Global Card Services was estimated under the     income approach. The significant assumptions under the income     approach included the discount rate, terminal value, expected     loss rates and expected new account growth. The carrying amount,     fair value and goodwill for the Global Card Services     reporting unit were $27.5 billion, $27.6 billion     and $11.9 billion, respectively. The estimated fair value     as a percent of the carrying amount at December 31, 2010     was 100 percent. Although the fair value exceeded the     carrying amount in step one of the Global Card Services     goodwill impairment test, to further substantiate the value     of goodwill, the Corporation also performed the step two test     for this reporting unit. Under step two of the goodwill     impairment test for this reporting unit, significant assumptions     in measuring the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the     reporting unit including discount rates, loss rates and interest     rates were updated to reflect the current economic conditions.     The results of step two of the goodwill impairment test     indicated that the remaining balance of goodwill of     $11.9 billion was not impaired as of December 31, 2010.           Bank of America     2010     187     Table of Contents               On December 16, 2010, the Federal Reserve released proposed     regulations to implement the Durbin Amendment of the Financial     Reform Act, which are scheduled to be effective July 21,     2011. The proposed regulations included two alternative     interchange fee standards that would apply to all covered     issuers: one based on each issuers costs, with a safe     harbor initially set at $0.07 per transaction and a cap     initially set at $0.12 per transaction, and the other a     stand-alone cap initially set at $0.12 per transaction. Although     the range of estimated revenue loss based on the proposed     regulations was slightly higher than the Corporations     original estimate of $2.0 billion, given the uncertainty     around the potential outcome, the Corporation did not change the     revenue loss estimate used in the goodwill impairment test     during the three months ended December 31, 2010. If the     final Federal Reserve rule sets interchange fee standards that     are significantly lower than the interchange fee assumptions the     Corporation used in this goodwill impairment test, the     Corporation will be required to perform an additional goodwill     impairment test. If the final interchange fee standards are at     the lowest proposed fee alternative, the Corporations     current estimate of the revenue loss could result in an     additional goodwill impairment charge for Global Card     Services. In view of the uncertainty with model inputs     including the final ruling, changes in the economic outlook and     the corresponding impact to revenues and asset quality, and the     impacts of mitigation actions, it is not possible to estimate     the amount or range of amounts of additional goodwill     impairment, if any.     Home     Loans & Insurance Impairment       During the three months ended December 31, 2010, the     Corporation performed an impairment test for the Home     Loans & Insurance reporting unit as it was likely     that there was a decline in its fair value as a result of     increased           uncertainties, including existing and potential litigation     exposure and other potential risks, higher current servicing     costs including loss mitigation efforts, foreclosure related     issues and the redeployment of centralized sales resources to     address servicing needs. In step one of the goodwill impairment     test, the fair value of Home Loans & Insurance     was estimated based on a combination of the market approach     and the income approach. Under the market approach valuation,     significant assumptions included market multiples and a control     premium. The significant assumptions for the valuation of     Home Loans & Insurance under the income     approach included cash flow estimates, the discount rate and the     terminal value. These assumptions were updated to reflect the     current strategic plan forecast and to address the increased     uncertainties referenced above. Based on the results of step one     of the impairment test, the Corporation determined that     the carrying amount of Home Loans & Insurance,     including goodwill, exceeded the fair value. The carrying     amount, fair value and goodwill for the Home     Loans & Insurance reporting unit were     $24.7 billion, $15.1 billion and $4.8 billion,     respectively. Accordingly, the Corporation performed step two of     the goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit. In step     two, the Corporation compared the implied fair value of the     reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that     goodwill. Under step two of the goodwill impairment test,     significant assumptions in measuring the fair value of the     assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including discount     rates, loss rates and interest rates were updated to reflect the     current economic conditions. Based on the results of step two of     the impairment test, the carrying value of the goodwill assigned     to Home Loans & Insurance exceeded the implied     fair value by $2.0 billion. Accordingly, the Corporation     recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment     charge of $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2010 to     reduce the carrying value of goodwill in the Home     Loans & Insurance reporting unit.

Amortization of intangibles expense was     $1.7 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion in     2010, 2009 and 2008. The Corporation estimates aggregate     amortization expense will be approximately $1.5 billion,     $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion, $1.0 billion and     $900 million for 2011 through 2015, respectively.        188     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents       NOTE 11 Deposits        The Corporation had U.S. certificates of deposit and other     U.S. time deposits of $100 thousand or more totaling     $60.5 billion and $99.4 billion at December 31,     2010 and 2009.

The majority of the floating rates are based on three- and     six-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).       Bank of America Corporation, Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.     and subsidiaries, and Bank of America, N.A. maintain various     U.S. and     non-U.S. debt     programs to offer both senior and subordinated notes. The notes     may be denominated in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies.     At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the amount of foreign     currency-denominated debt translated into U.S. dollars     included in total long-term debt was $145.9 billion and     $156.8 billion. Foreign currency contracts are used to     convert certain foreign currency-denominated debt into     U.S. dollars.             At December 31, 2010 and 2009, Bank of America Corporation     had approximately $88.4 billion and $119.1 billion of     authorized, but unissued, corporate debt and other securities     under its existing U.S. shelf registration statements.

The weighted-average effective interest rates for total     long-term debt, excluding senior structured notes, total     fixed-rate debt and total floating-rate debt, based on the rates     in effect at December 31, 2010, were 3.96 percent,     5.02 percent and 1.09 percent, respectively, at     December 31, 2010 and,              190     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents             based on the rates in effect at December 31, 2009, were     3.62 percent, 4.93 percent and 0.80 percent,     respectively, at December 31, 2009. The Corporations     ALM activities maintain an overall interest rate risk management     strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts to     manage fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate     volatility. The Corporations goal is to manage interest     rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not     significantly adversely affect net interest income. The above     weighted-average rates are the contractual interest rates on the     debt, and do not reflect the impacts of derivative transactions.       The weighted-average interest rate for debt, excluding senior     structured notes, issued by Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.     and subsidiaries was 4.11 percent and 3.73 percent at     December 31, 2010 and 2009. At December 31, 2010, the     Corporation has not assumed or guaranteed the     $120.9 billion of long-term debt that was issued or     guaranteed by Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. or its     subsidiaries prior to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch by the     Corporation.           Beginning late in the third quarter of 2009, in connection with     the update or renewal of certain Merrill Lynch     non-U.S. securities     offering programs, the Corporation agreed to guarantee debt     securities, warrants     and/or     certificates issued by certain subsidiaries of Merrill     Lynch & Co., Inc. on a going-forward basis. All     existing Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. guarantees of     securities issued by those same Merrill Lynch subsidiaries under     various     non-U.S. securities     offering programs will remain in full force and effect as long     as those securities are outstanding, and the Corporation has not     assumed any of those prior Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.     guarantees or otherwise guaranteed such securities.

Other structured notes have coupon or repayment terms     linked to the performance of debt or equity securities, indices,     currencies or commodities and the maturity may be accelerated     based on the value of a referenced index or security. In both     cases, the Corporation or a subsidiary may be required to settle     the obligation for cash or other securities prior to the     contractual maturity date. These borrowings are reflected in the     above table as maturing at their earliest put or redemption date.     Trust Preferred     and Hybrid Securities       Trust preferred securities (Trust Securities) are issued by     trust companies (the Trusts) that are not consolidated. These     Trust Securities are mandatorily redeemable preferred     security obligations of the Trusts. The sole assets of the     Trusts generally are junior subordinated deferrable interest     notes of the Corporation or its subsidiaries (the Notes). The     Trusts generally are 100 percent owned finance subsidiaries     of the Corporation. Obligations associated with the Notes are     included in the long-term debt table on page 190.       Certain of the Trust Securities were issued at a discount     and may be redeemed prior to maturity at the option of the     Corporation. The Trusts generally have invested the proceeds of     such Trust Securities in the Notes. Each issue of the Notes     has an interest rate equal to the corresponding     Trust Securities distribution rate. The Corporation has the     right to defer payment of interest on the Notes at any time or     from time to time for a period not exceeding five years provided     that no extension period may extend beyond the stated maturity     of the relevant Notes. During any such extension period,     distributions on the Trust Securities will also be deferred     and the Corporations ability to pay dividends on its     common and preferred stock will be restricted.       The Trust Securities generally are subject to mandatory     redemption upon repayment of the related Notes at their stated     maturity dates or their earlier redemption at a redemption price     equal to their liquidation amount plus accrued distributions to     the date fixed for redemption and the premium, if any, paid by     the Corporation upon concurrent repayment of the related Notes.             Periodic cash payments and payments upon liquidation or     redemption with respect to Trust Securities are guaranteed     by the Corporation or its subsidiaries to the extent of funds     held by the Trusts (the Preferred Securities Guarantee). The     Preferred Securities Guarantee, when taken together with the     Corporations other obligations including its obligations     under the Notes, generally will constitute a full and     unconditional guarantee, on a subordinated basis, by the     Corporation of payments due on the Trust Securities.       Hybrid Income Term Securities (HITS) totaling $1.6 billion     were also issued by the Trusts to institutional investors in     2007. The BAC Capital Trust XIII Floating-Rate Preferred     HITS have a distribution rate of three-month LIBOR plus     40 bps and the BAC Capital Trust XIV     Fixed-to-Floating-Rate     Preferred HITS have an initial distribution rate of     5.63 percent. Both series of HITS represent beneficial     interests in the assets of the respective capital trust, which     consist of a series of the Corporations junior     subordinated notes and a stock purchase contract for a specified     series of the Corporations preferred stock. The     Corporation will remarket the junior subordinated notes     underlying each series of HITS on or about the five-year     anniversary of the issuance to obtain sufficient funds for the     capital trusts to buy the Corporations preferred stock     under the stock purchase contracts.       In connection with the HITS, the Corporation entered into two     replacement capital covenants for the benefit of investors in     certain series of the Corporations long-term indebtedness     (Covered Debt). As of December 31, 2010, the     Corporations 6.625% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2036     constitute the Covered Debt under the covenant corresponding to     the Floating-Rate Preferred HITS and the Corporations     5.625% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2035 constitute the Covered     Debt under the covenant corresponding to the     Fixed-to-Floating-Rate     Preferred HITS. These covenants generally restrict the ability     of the Corporation and its subsidiaries to redeem or purchase     the HITS and related securities unless the Corporation has     obtained the prior approval of the Federal Reserve if required     under the Federal Reserves capital guidelines, the     redemption or purchase price of the HITS does not exceed the     amount received by the Corporation from the sale of certain     qualifying securities, and such replacement securities qualify     as Tier 1 Capital and are not restricted core capital     elements under the Federal Reserves guidelines.

These commitments     expose the Corporation to varying degrees of credit and market     risk and are subject to the same credit and market risk     limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the     Corporations Consolidated Balance Sheet.     Credit Extension     Commitments       The Corporation enters into commitments to extend credit such as     loan commitments, SBLCs and commercial letters of credit to meet     the financing needs of its customers. The table below shows the     notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments     net of amounts distributed (e.g., syndicated) to other financial     institutions of $23.3 billion and $30.9 billion at     December 31, 2010 and 2009. At December 31, 2010, the     carrying           amount of these commitments, excluding commitments accounted for     under the fair value option, was $1.2 billion, including     deferred revenue of $29 million and a reserve for unfunded     lending commitments of $1.2 billion. At December 31,     2009, the comparable amounts were $1.5 billion,     $34 million and $1.5 billion, respectively. The     carrying amount of these commitments is classified in accrued     expenses and other liabilities.       The table below also includes the notional amount of commitments     of $27.3 billion and $27.0 billion at     December 31, 2010 and 2009, that are accounted for under     the fair value option.

(2)   Includes business card unused lines     of credit.                     Legally binding commitments to extend credit generally have     specified rates and maturities. Certain of these commitments     have adverse change clauses that help to protect the Corporation     against deterioration in the borrowers ability to pay.     Other     Commitments     Global Principal     Investments and Other Equity Investments       At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Corporation had unfunded     equity investment commitments of approximately $1.5 billion     and $2.8 billion. In light of proposed Basel regulatory     capital changes related to unfunded           commitments, the Corporation has actively reduced these     commitments in a series of transactions involving its private     equity fund investments. For more information on these Basel     regulatory capital changes, see     Note 18  Regulatory Requirements and     Restrictions. In 2010, the Corporation completed the sale of     its exposure to certain private equity funds. For more     information on these transactions, see     Note 5  Securities. These     commitments generally relate to the Corporations Global     Principal Investments business which is comprised of a     diversified portfolio of investments in private equity, real     estate and other alternative investments. These investments are     made either directly in a company or held through a fund.               Bank of America     2010     193     Table of Contents         Loan     Purchases       In 2005, the Corporation entered into an agreement for the     committed purchase of retail automotive loans over a five-year     period that ended on June 22, 2010. Under this agreement,     the Corporation purchased $6.6 billion of such loans during     the six months ended June 30, 2010 and also the year ended     December 31, 2009. All loans purchased under this agreement     were subject to a comprehensive set of credit criteria. This     agreement was accounted for as a derivative liability with a     fair value of $189 million at December 31, 2009. As of     December 31, 2010, the Corporation was no longer committed     for any additional purchases. As part of this agreement, the     Corporation recorded a liability which may increase or decrease     based on credit performance of the purchased loans over a period     extending through 2016.       At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Corporation had other     commitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and     commercial real estate) of $2.6 billion and     $2.2 billion, which upon settlement will be included in     loans or LHFS.     Operating     Leases       The Corporation is a party to operating leases for certain of     its premises and equipment. Commitments under these leases are     approximately $3.0 billion, $2.6 billion,     $2.1 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion for     2011 through 2015, respectively, and $6.6 billion in the     aggregate for all years thereafter.     Other     Commitments       At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Corporation had     commitments to enter into forward-dated resale and securities     borrowing agreements of $39.4 billion and     $51.8 billion. In addition, the Corporation had commitments     to enter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending     agreements of $33.5 billion and $58.3 billion. All of     these commitments expire within the next 12 months.       The Corporation has entered into agreements with providers of     market data, communications, systems consulting and other     office-related services. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the     minimum fee commitments over the remaining terms of these     agreements totaled $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion.     Other     Guarantees     Bank-owned Life     Insurance Book Value Protection       The Corporation sells products that offer book value protection     to insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to     corporations, primarily banks. The book value protection is     provided on portfolios of intermediate investment-grade     fixed-income securities and is intended to cover any shortfall     in the event that policyholders surrender their policies and     market value is           below book value. To manage its exposure, the Corporation     imposes significant restrictions on surrenders and the manner in     which the portfolio is liquidated and the funds are accessed. In     addition, investment parameters of the underlying portfolio are     restricted. These constraints, combined with structural     protections, including a cap on the amount of risk assumed on     each policy, are designed to provide adequate buffers and guard     against payments even under extreme stress scenarios. These     guarantees are recorded as derivatives and carried at fair value     in the trading portfolio. At December 31, 2010 and 2009,     the notional amount of these guarantees totaled     $15.8 billion and $15.6 billion and the     Corporations maximum exposure related to these guarantees     totaled $5.0 billion and $4.9 billion with estimated     maturity dates between 2030 and 2040. As of December 31,     2010, the Corporation has not made a payment under these     products. The probability of surrender has increased due to the     deteriorating financial health of policyholders, but remains a     small percentage of total notional.     Employee     Retirement Protection       The Corporation sells products that offer book value protection     primarily to plan sponsors of Employee Retirement Income     Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) governed pension plans, such as     401(k) plans and 457 plans. The book value protection is     provided on portfolios of intermediate/short-term     investment-grade fixed-income securities and is intended to     cover any shortfall in the event that plan participants continue     to withdraw funds after all securities have been liquidated and     there is remaining book value. The Corporation retains the     option to exit the contract at any time. If the Corporation     exercises its option, the purchaser can require the Corporation     to purchase high quality fixed-income securities, typically     government or government-backed agency securities, with the     proceeds of the liquidated assets to assure the return of     principal. To manage its exposure, the Corporation imposes     significant restrictions and constraints on the timing of the     withdrawals, the manner in which the portfolio is liquidated and     the funds are accessed, and the investment parameters of the     underlying portfolio. These constraints, combined with     structural protections, are designed to provide adequate buffers     and guard against payments even under extreme stress scenarios.     These guarantees are recorded as derivatives and carried at fair     value in the trading portfolio. At December 31, 2010 and     2009, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled     $33.8 billion and $36.8 billion with estimated     maturity dates up to 2014 if the exit option is exercised on all     deals. As of December 31, 2010, the Corporation has not     made a payment under these products and has assessed the     probability of payments under these guarantees as remote.               194     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents         Indemnifications       In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into     various agreements that contain indemnifications, such as tax     indemnifications, whereupon payment may become due if certain     external events occur, such as a change in tax law. The     indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and     were entered into in the normal course of business based on an     assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. These     agreements typically contain an early termination clause that     permits the Corporation to exit the agreement upon these events.     The maximum potential future payment under indemnification     agreements is difficult to assess for several reasons, including     the occurrence of an external event, the inability to predict     future changes in tax and other laws, the difficulty in     determining how such laws would apply to parties in contracts,     the absence of exposure limits contained in standard contract     language and the timing of the early termination clause.     Historically, any payments made under these guarantees have been     de minimis. The Corporation has assessed the probability of     making such payments in the future as remote.     Merchant     Services       On June 26, 2009, the Corporation contributed its merchant     processing business to a joint venture in exchange for a     46.5 percent ownership interest in the joint venture.     During the second quarter of 2010, the joint venture purchased     the interest held by one of the three initial investors bringing     the Corporations ownership interest up to 49 percent.     For additional information on the joint venture agreement, see     Note 5  Securities.       The Corporation, on behalf of the joint venture, provides credit     and debit card processing services to various merchants by     processing credit and debit card transactions on the     merchants behalf. In connection with these services, a     liability may arise in the event of a billing dispute between     the merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the     cardholders favor and the merchant defaults on its     obligation to reimburse the cardholder. A cardholder, through     its issuing bank, generally has until the later of up to six     months after the date a transaction is processed or the delivery     of the product or service to present a chargeback to the joint     venture as the merchant processor. If the joint venture is     unable to collect this amount from the merchant, it bears the     loss for the amount paid to the cardholder. The joint venture is     primarily liable for any losses on transactions from the     contributed portfolio that occur after June 26, 2009.     However, if the joint venture fails to meet its obligation to     reimburse the cardholder for disputed transactions, then the     Corporation could be held liable for the disputed amount. In     2010 and 2009, the joint venture processed and settled     $265.5 billion and $250.0 billion of transactions and     it recorded losses of $17 million and $26 million.       At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Corporation, on behalf     of the joint venture, held as collateral $25 million and     $26 million of merchant escrow deposits which may be used     to offset amounts due from the individual merchants. The joint     venture also has the right to offset any payments with cash     flows otherwise due to the merchant. Accordingly, the     Corporation believes that the maximum potential exposure is not     representative of the actual potential loss exposure. The     Corporation believes the maximum potential exposure for     chargebacks would not exceed the total amount of merchant     transactions processed through Visa and MasterCard for the last     six months, which represents the claim period for the     cardholder, plus any outstanding delayed-delivery transactions.     As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the maximum potential     exposure totaled approximately $139.5 billion             and $131.0 billion. The Corporation does not expect to make     material payments in connection with these guarantees. The     maximum potential exposure disclosed does not include volumes     processed by First Data contributed portfolios.     Other Derivative     Contracts       The Corporation funds selected assets, including securities     issued by CDOs and CLOs, through derivative contracts, typically     total return swaps, with third parties and SPEs that are not     consolidated on the Corporations Consolidated Balance     Sheet. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the total notional     amount of these derivative contracts was approximately     $4.3 billion and $4.9 billion with commercial banks     and $1.7 billion and $2.8 billion with SPEs. The     underlying securities are senior securities and substantially     all of the Corporations exposures are insured.     Accordingly, the Corporations exposure to loss consists     principally of counterparty risk to the insurers. In certain     circumstances, generally as a result of ratings downgrades, the     Corporation may be required to purchase the underlying assets,     which would not result in additional gain or loss to the     Corporation as such exposure is already reflected in the fair     value of the derivative contracts.     Other     Guarantees       The Corporation sells products that guarantee the return of     principal to investors at a preset future date. These guarantees     cover a broad range of underlying asset classes and are designed     to cover the shortfall between the market value of the     underlying portfolio and the principal amount on the preset     future date. To manage its exposure, the Corporation requires     that these guarantees be backed by structural and investment     constraints and certain pre-defined triggers that would require     the underlying assets or portfolio to be liquidated and invested     in zero-coupon bonds that mature at the preset future date. The     Corporation is required to fund any shortfall between the     proceeds of the liquidated assets and the purchase price of the     zero-coupon bonds at the preset future date. These guarantees     are recorded as derivatives and carried at fair value in the     trading portfolio. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the     notional amount of these guarantees totaled $666 million     and $2.1 billion. These guarantees have various maturities     ranging from two to five years. As of December 31, 2010 and     2009, the Corporation had not made a payment under these     products and has assessed the probability of payments under     these guarantees as remote.       The Corporation has entered into additional guarantee agreements     and commitments, including lease-end obligation agreements,     partial credit guarantees on certain leases, real estate joint     venture guarantees, sold risk participation swaps, divested     business commitments and sold put options that require gross     settlement. The maximum potential future payment under these     agreements was approximately $3.4 billion and     $3.6 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The     estimated maturity dates of these obligations extend up to 2033.     The Corporation has made no material payments under these     guarantees.       In addition, the Corporation has guaranteed the payment     obligations of certain subsidiaries of Merrill Lynch on certain     derivative transactions. The aggregate notional amount of such     derivative liabilities was approximately $2.1 billion and     $2.5 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. In the     normal course of business, the Corporation periodically     guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of     transactions including ISDA-related transactions and non     ISDA-related transactions such as commodities trading,     repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and other     transactions.               Bank of America     2010     195     Table of Contents         Payment     Protection Insurance Claims Matter       In the U.K., the Corporation sells payment protection insurance     (PPI) through its Global Card Services business to credit     card customers and has previously sold this insurance to     consumer loan customers. PPI covers a consumers loan or     debt repayment if certain events occur such as loss of job or     illness. In response to an elevated level of customer complaints     of misleading sales tactics across the industry, heightened     media coverage and pressure from consumer advocacy groups, the     U.K. Financial Services Authority (FSA) has investigated and     raised concerns about the way some companies have handled     complaints relating to the sale of these insurance policies. In     August 2010, the FSA issued a policy statement on the assessment     and remediation of PPI claims which is applicable to the     Corporations U.K. consumer businesses and is intended to     address concerns among consumers and regulators regarding the     handling of PPI complaints across the industry. The policy     statement sets standards for the sale of PPI that apply to     current and prior sales, and in the event a company does not or     did not comply with the standards, it is alleged that the     insurance was incorrectly sold, giving the customer rights to     remedies. The FSA gave companies until December 1, 2010 to     comply with the new regulations, but the judicial review to     assess compliance is still underway. Given the new regulatory     guidance, as of December 31, 2010, the Corporation has a     liability of $630 million based on its current claims     history and an estimate of future claims that have yet to be     asserted against the Corporation. The liability is included in     accrued expenses and other liabilities and the related expense     is included in insurance income. The policy statement also     requires companies to review their sales practices and to     proactively remediate non-complaining customers if evidence of a     systematic breach of the newly articulated sales standards is     discovered, which could include refunding premiums paid. Subject     to the outcome of the Corporations review and the new     regulatory guidance, it is possible that an additional liability     may be required. Industry groups have challenged the policy     statement through a judicial review process. The judicial review     is not expected to be completed until the end of the first     quarter of 2011. Therefore, the Corporation is unable to     reasonably estimate the total amount of additional possible loss     or a range of loss as of December 31, 2010.     Litigation and     Regulatory Matters       In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its     subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many     pending and threatened legal actions and proceedings, including     actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants. These     actions and proceedings are generally based on alleged     violations of consumer protection, securities, environmental,     banking, employment and other laws. In some of these actions and     proceedings, claims for substantial monetary damages are     asserted against the Corporation and its subsidiaries.       In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its     subsidiaries are also subject to regulatory examinations,     information gathering requests, inquiries and investigations.     Certain subsidiaries of the Corporation are registered     broker/dealers or investment advisors and are subject to     regulation by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory     Authority (FINRA), the New York Stock Exchange, the FSA and     other domestic, international and state securities regulators.     In connection with formal and informal inquiries by those     agencies, such subsidiaries receive numerous requests, subpoenas     and orders for documents, testimony and information in     connection with various aspects of their regulated activities.       In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of     such litigation and regulatory matters, particularly where the     claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the     matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number     of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict what the     eventual outcome of the pending matters will be, what the timing     of           the ultimate resolution of these matters will be, or what the     eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter     may be.       In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the     Corporation establishes an accrued liability for litigation and     regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies     that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may     be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. When a     loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the     Corporation does not establish an accrued liability. As a     litigation or regulatory matter develops, the Corporation, in     conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter,     evaluates on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a     loss contingency that is probable and estimable. If, at the time     of evaluation, the loss contingency related to a litigation or     regulatory matter is not both probable and estimable, the matter     will continue to be monitored for further developments that     would make such loss contingency both probable and estimable.     Once the loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory     matter is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the     Corporation will establish an accrued liability with respect to     such loss contingency and record a corresponding amount of     litigation-related expense. The Corporation continues to monitor     the matter for further developments that could affect the amount     of the accrued liability that has been previously established.     Excluding fees paid to external legal service providers,     litigation-related expense of $2.6 billion was recognized     in 2010 compared to $1.0 billion for 2009.       For a limited number of the matters disclosed in this Note for     which a loss is probable or reasonably possible in future     periods, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or     where there is no accrued liability, the Corporation is able to     estimate a range of possible loss. In determining whether it is     possible to provide an estimate of loss or range of possible     loss, the Corporation reviews and evaluates its material     litigation and regulatory matters on an ongoing basis, in     conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in     light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments.     These may include information learned through the discovery     process, rulings on dispositive motions, settlement discussions,     and other rulings by courts, arbitrators or others. In cases in     which the Corporation possesses sufficient appropriate     information to develop an estimate of loss or range of possible     loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below. There may     be other disclosed matters for which a loss is probable or     reasonably possible but such an estimate may not be possible.     For those matters where an estimate is possible, management     currently estimates the aggregate range of possible loss is     $145 million to $1.5 billion in excess of the accrued     liability (if any) related to those matters. This estimated     range of possible loss is based upon currently available     information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety     of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters     underlying the estimated range will change from time to time,     and actual results may vary significantly from the current     estimate. Those matters for which an estimate is not possible     are not included within this estimated range. Therefore, this     estimated range of possible loss represents what the Corporation     believes to be an estimate of possible loss only for certain     matters meeting these criteria. It does not represent the     Corporations maximum loss exposure. Information is     provided below regarding the nature of all of these     contingencies and, where specified, the amount of the claim     associated with these loss contingencies. Based on current     knowledge, management does not believe that loss contingencies     arising from pending matters, including the matters described     herein, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated     financial position or liquidity of the Corporation. However, in     light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters,     some of which are beyond the Corporations control, and the     very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these     matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters     could be material to the Corporations results of     operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period.           196     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           Auction Rate     Securities Litigation       Since October 2007, the Corporation, Merrill Lynch and certain     affiliates have been named as defendants in a variety of     lawsuits and other proceedings brought by customers and both     individual and institutional investors regarding ARS. These     actions generally allege that the defendants: (i) misled     the plaintiffs into believing that there was a deeply liquid     market for ARS, and (ii) failed to adequately disclose     their or their affiliates practice of placing their own     bids to support ARS auctions. Plaintiffs assert that ARS     auctions started failing from August 2007 through February 2008     when the defendants and other broker-dealers stopped placing     those support bids. In addition to the matters     described in more detail below, numerous arbitrations and     individual lawsuits have been filed against the Corporation,     Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates by parties who purchased     ARS and are seeking relief that includes compensatory and     punitive damages totaling in excess of $1.8 billion, as     well as rescission, among other relief.     Securities     Actions       The Corporation and Merrill Lynch face a number of civil actions     relating to the sales of ARS and management of ARS auctions,     including two putative class action lawsuits in which the     plaintiffs seek to recover the alleged losses in market value of     ARS securities purportedly caused by the defendants     actions. Plaintiffs also seek unspecified damages, including     rescission, other compensatory and consequential damages, costs,     fees and interest. The first action, In Re Merrill Lynch     Auction Rate Securities Litigation, is the result of the     consolidation of two separate class action suits in the     U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.     These suits were brought by two customers of Merrill Lynch, on     behalf of all persons who purchased ARS in auctions managed by     Merrill Lynch, against Merrill Lynch and its subsidiary Merrill     Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPFS). On     March 31, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the     Southern District of New York granted Merrill Lynchs     motion to dismiss. On April 22, 2010, a lead plaintiff     filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for     the Second Circuit, which is currently pending. The second     action, Bondar v. Bank of America Corporation, was     brought by a putative class of ARS purchasers against the     Corporation and Banc of America Securities, LLC (BAS) and is     currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the     Northern District of California. The Corporation and BAS have     filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which remains     pending.     Antitrust     Actions       The Corporation, Merrill Lynch and other financial institutions     were also named in two putative antitrust class actions in the     U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.     Plaintiffs in both actions assert federal antitrust claims under     Section 1 of the Sherman Act based on allegations that     defendants conspired to restrain trade in ARS by placing support     bids in ARS auctions, only to collectively withdraw those bids     in February 2008, which allegedly caused ARS auctions to fail.     The plaintiff in the first action, Mayor and City Council of     Baltimore, Maryland v. Citigroup, Inc., et al., seeks     to represent a class of issuers of ARS that the defendants     underwrote between May 12, 2003 and February 13, 2008.     This issuer action seeks to recover, among other relief, the     alleged above-market interest payments that ARS issuers     allegedly have had to make after the defendants allegedly     stopped placing support bids in ARS auctions. The     plaintiff in the second action, Mayfield, et al. v.     Citigroup, Inc., et al., seeks to represent a class of     investors that purchased ARS from the defendants and held those     securities when ARS auctions failed on February 13, 2008.     Plaintiff seeks to recover, among other relief, unspecified     damages for losses in the ARS market value, and rescission     of the investors ARS purchases. Both actions also seek     treble damages and attorneys fees under the Sherman     Acts private civil remedy. On January 25, 2010, the     court dismissed both actions with prejudice and the           plaintiffs respective appeals are currently pending in the     U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.     Checking Account     Overdraft Litigation       Bank of America, N.A. (BANA) is currently a defendant in several     consumer suits challenging certain deposit account-related     business practices. Three of the suits are presently part of a     multi-district litigation (MDL) proceeding involving     approximately 65 individual cases against 30 financial     institutions assigned by the Judicial Panel on Multi-district     Litigation to the U.S. District Court for the Southern     District of Florida. The three cases, Tornes v. Bank of     America, N.A., Yourke, et al. v. Bank of America, N.A., et     al. and Knighten v. Bank of America, N.A.,     allege that BANA improperly and unfairly increased the number of     overdraft fees it assessed on consumer deposit accounts by     various means. The cases challenge the practice of reordering     debit card transactions to post     high-to-low     and BANAs failure to notify customers at the point of sale     that the transaction may result in an overdraft charge. The     cases also allege that BANAs disclosures and advertising     regarding the posting of debit card transactions are false,     deceptive and misleading. These cases assert claims including     breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,     conversion, unjust enrichment and violation of the unfair and     deceptive practices statutes of various states. Plaintiffs     generally seek restitution of all overdraft fees paid to BANA as     a result of BANAs allegedly wrongful business practices,     as well as disgorgement, punitive damages, injunctive relief,     pre-judgment interest and attorneys fees. Omnibus motions     to dismiss many of the complaints involved in the MDL, including     Tornes, Yourke and Knighten, were denied on     March 12, 2010. Trial is currently scheduled for     March 26, 2012. A fourth putative class action,     Phillips, et al. v. Bank of America, N.A., which     includes similar allegations, will shortly become part of the     MDL proceedings.       In December 2004, BANA was also named as the defendant in     Closson, et al. v. Bank of America, et al., a     putative class action currently pending in the California Court     of Appeal, First District, Division 1, which also     challenges BANAs practice of reordering debit card     transactions to post deposits in     high-to-low     order. Closson asserts claims for violations of     California state law, and seeks restitution, disgorgement,     actual and punitive damages, a corrective advertising campaign     and injunctive relief. BANA entered into a settlement in     Closson, which received final approval by the Superior     Court of the State of California for the County of     San Francisco on August 3, 2009. The settlement     provides for a $35 million payment by BANA in exchange for     a release of the claims against BANA by the members of the     nationwide settlement class. Several settlement class members     who objected to the final approval of the settlement have     appealed. If the Closson settlement is affirmed, it will     likely bar the claims of many of the putative class members in     Tornes, Yourke and Knighten, as many of those     class members are covered by the putative class in     Closson.       On January 27, 2011, the Corporation reached a settlement     in principle with the lead plaintiffs in the MDL, subject to     complete final documentation and court approvals. The settlement     will provide for a payment by the Corporation of     $410 million (which amount was fully accrued by the     Corporation as of December 31, 2010) in exchange for a     complete release of claims asserted against the Corporation in     the MDL. The settlement also contemplates that a stay will be     requested in the Closson appeal and that, when this     settlement becomes effective, the appeal in Closson will     be withdrawn and the settlement in Closson will be     effectuated according to its terms.     Countrywide Bond     Insurance Litigation       The Corporation, Countrywide Financial Corporation (CFC) and     various other Countrywide entities are subject to claims from     several monoline bond insurance companies. These claims     generally relate to bond insurance policies provided by the     insurers on certain securitized pools of home equity lines              Bank of America     2010     197     Table of Contents             of credit and fixed-rate second-lien mortgage loans. Plaintiffs     in these cases generally allege that they have paid claims as a     result of defaults in the underlying loans and assert that these     defaults are the result of improper underwriting by the     defendants.     MBIA       The Corporation, CFC and various other Countrywide entities are     named as defendants in two actions filed by MBIA Insurance     Corporation (MBIA). The first action, MBIA Insurance     Corporation, Inc. v. Countrywide Home Loans, et al., is     pending in New York Supreme Court, New York County. In     April 2010, the court granted in part and denied in part the     Countrywide defendants motion to dismiss and denied the     Corporations motion to dismiss. The parties have filed     cross-appeals from this order. On December 22, 2010, the     court issued an order on MBIAs motion for use of sampling     at trial, in which the court held that MBIA may attempt to prove     its breach of contract and fraudulent inducement claims through     examination of statistically significant samples of the     securitizations at issue. In its order, the court did not     endorse any of MBIAs specific sampling proposals and     stated that defendants have significant valid     challenges to MBIAs methodology that they may     present at trial, together with defendants own views and     evidence.       The second MBIA action, MBIA Insurance Corporation,     Inc. v. Bank of America Corporation, Countrywide Financial     Corporation, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., Countrywide     Securities Corporation, et al., is pending in the Superior     Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles. MBIA     purports to bring this action as subrogee to the note holders     for certain securitized pools of home equity lines of credit and     fixed-rate second-lien mortgage loans and seeks unspecified     damages and declaratory relief. On May 17, 2010, the court     dismissed the claims against the Countrywide defendants with     leave to amend, but denied the request to dismiss MBIAs     successor liability claims against the Corporation. On     June 21, 2010, MBIA filed an amended complaint re-asserting     its previously dismissed claims against the Countrywide     defendants, re-asserting the successor liability claim against     the Corporation and adding Countrywide Capital Markets, LLC as a     defendant. The Countrywide defendants filed a demurrer to the     amended complaint, but the court declined to rule on the     demurrer and instead entered an order which stays this case     until August 1, 2011.     Syncora       The Corporation, CFC and various other Countrywide entities are     named as defendants in an action filed by Syncora Guarantee Inc.     (Syncora) entitled Syncora Guarantee Inc. v. Countrywide     Home Loans, Inc., et al. This action, currently pending in     New York Supreme Court, New York County, relates to bond     insurance policies provided by Syncora on certain securitized     pools of home equity lines of credit. In March 2010, the court     issued an order that granted in part and denied in part the     Countrywide defendants motion to dismiss. Syncora and the     Countrywide defendants have filed cross-appeals from this order.     In May 2010, Syncora amended its complaint. Defendants filed an     answer to Syncoras amended complaint on July 9, 2010,     as well as a counterclaim for breach of contract and declaratory     judgment. The parties have agreed to stay the counterclaim until     August 15, 2011.     FGIC       The Corporation, CFC and various other Countrywide entities are     named as defendants in an action filed by Financial Guaranty     Insurance Company (FGIC) entitled Financial Guaranty     Insurance Co. v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. This     action, currently pending in New York Supreme Court, New York     County, relates to bond insurance policies provided by FGIC on     certain securitized pools of home equity lines of credit and     fixed-rate second-lien mortgage loans. In June 2010, the court     entered an order that granted in part and denied in part the     Countrywide defendants motion to dismiss. FGIC and the           Countrywide defendants have filed cross-appeals from this order.     Defendants filed an answer to FGICs amended complaint on     July 19, 2010. On March 24, 2010, CFC and certain     other Countrywide entities filed a separate but related action     against FGIC in New York Supreme Court seeking monetary damages     of at least $100 million against FGIC in connection with     FGICs failure to pay claims under certain bond insurance     policies.     Ambac       The Corporation, CFC and various other Countrywide entities are     named as defendants in an action filed by Ambac Assurance     Corporation (Ambac) entitled Ambac Assurance Corporation and     The Segregated Account of Ambac Assurance Corporation v.     Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., et al. This action, currently     pending in New York Supreme Court, New York County, relates to     bond insurance policies provided by Ambac on certain securitized     pools of home equity lines of credit and fixed-rate second-lien     mortgage loans. On December 10, 2010, defendants filed     answers to the complaint.     Countrywide     Equity and Debt Securities Matters       Certain New York state and municipal pension funds have     commenced litigation in the U.S. District Court for the     Central District of California, entitled In re Countrywide     Financial Corporation Securities Litigation, against CFC,     certain other Countrywide entities and several former CFC     officers and directors. This action alleges violations of the     antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and     Sections 11 and 12 of the Securities Act of 1933.     Plaintiffs claim losses in excess of $25.0 billion that     plaintiffs allegedly experienced on certain CFC equity and debt     securities. Plaintiffs also assert additional claims against     BAS, MLPFS and other underwriter defendants under     Sections 11 and 12 of the Securities Act of 1933.     Plaintiffs allege that CFC made false and misleading     statements in certain SEC filings and elsewhere concerning the     nature and quality of its loan underwriting practices and its     financial results. On April 2, 2010, the parties reached an     agreement in principle to settle this action for     $624 million in exchange for a dismissal of all claims with     prejudice. On August 2, 2010, the court preliminarily     approved the settlement. On December 1, 2010, CFC and the     plaintiffs agreed to amend the settlement to allow CFC to use up     to $22.5 million of the settlement funds for a two-year     period following final approval of the settlement to resolve any     claims asserted by investors who chose to exclude themselves     from the class. On January 7, 2011, the court preliminarily     approved this amendment. The settlement remains subject to final     court approval.     Interchange and     Related Litigation       A group of merchants have filed a series of putative class     actions and individual actions with regard to interchange fees     associated with Visa and MasterCard payment card transactions.     These actions, which have been consolidated in the     U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York     under the caption In Re Payment Card Interchange Fee and     Merchant Discount Anti-Trust Litigation     (Interchange), name Visa, MasterCard and several     banks and bank holding companies, including the Corporation, as     defendants. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants conspired to     fix the level of default interchange rates, which represent the     fee an issuing bank charges an acquiring bank on every     transaction. Plaintiffs also challenge as unreasonable     restraints of trade under Section 1 of the Sherman Act     certain rules of Visa and MasterCard related to merchant     acceptance of payment cards at the point of sale. Plaintiffs     seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief based on their     assertion that interchange would be lower or eliminated absent     the alleged conduct. On January 8, 2008, the court granted     defendants motion to dismiss all claims for pre-2004     damages. Motions to dismiss the remainder of the complaint and     plaintiffs motion for class certification are pending.       In addition, plaintiffs filed supplemental complaints against     certain defendants, including the Corporation, relating to     initial public offerings (the              198     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents             IPOs) of MasterCard and Visa. Plaintiffs allege that the     MasterCard and Visa IPOs violated Section 7 of the Clayton     Act and Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Plaintiffs also     assert that the MasterCard IPO was a fraudulent conveyance.     Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and to undo the IPOs.     Motions to dismiss both supplemental complaints remain pending.       The Corporation and certain of its affiliates previously entered     into loss-sharing agreements with Visa and other financial     institutions in connection with certain antitrust litigation     against Visa, including Interchange. The Corporation and     these same affiliates have now entered into additional     loss-sharing agreements for Interchange that cover all     defendants, including MasterCard. Collectively, the loss-sharing     agreements require the Corporation     and/or     certain affiliates to pay 11.6 percent of the monetary     portion of any comprehensive Interchange settlement. In     the event of an adverse judgment, the agreements require the     Corporation     and/or     certain affiliates to pay 12.8 percent of any damages     associated with Visa-related claims (Visa-related damages),     9.1 percent of any damages associated with     MasterCard-related claims, and 11.6 percent of any damages     associated with internetwork claims (internetwork damages) or     not associated specifically with Visa or MasterCard-related     claims (unassigned damages).       Pursuant to Visas publicly-disclosed Retrospective     Responsibility Plan (the RRP), Visa placed certain proceeds from     its IPO into an escrow fund (the Escrow). Under the RRP, funds     in the Escrow may be accessed by Visa and its members, including     Bank of America, to pay for a comprehensive settlement or     damages in Interchange, with the Corporations     payments from the Escrow capped at 12.81 percent of the     funds that Visa places therein. Subject to that cap, the     Corporation may use Escrow funds to cover: 66.7 percent of     its monetary payment towards a comprehensive Interchange     settlement, 100 percent of its payment for any     Visa-related damages and 66.7 percent of its payment for     any internetwork and unassigned damages.     In re Initial     Public Offering Securities Litigation       BAS, Merrill Lynch, MLPFS, and certain of their subsidiaries,     along with other underwriters, and various issuers and others,     were named as defendants in a number of putative class action     lawsuits that have been consolidated in the U.S. District     Court for the Southern District of New York as In re Initial     Public Offering Securities Litigation. Plaintiffs contend,     among other things, that defendants failed to make certain     required disclosures in the registration statements and     prospectuses for applicable offerings regarding alleged     agreements with institutional investors that tied allocations in     certain offerings to the purchase orders by those investors in     the aftermarket. Plaintiffs allege that such agreements allowed     defendants to manipulate the price of the securities sold in     these offerings in violation of Section 11 of the     Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities     Exchange Act of 1934, and SEC rules promulgated thereunder. The     parties agreed to settle the matter, for which the court granted     final approval. Some putative class members have filed an     appeal, which remains pending, in the U.S. Court of Appeals     for the Second Circuit seeking reversal of the final approval.     Lehman Brothers     Holdings, Inc. Litigation       Beginning in September 2008, BAS, MLPFS, Countrywide Securities     Corporation (CSC) and LaSalle Financial Services Inc., along     with other underwriters and individuals, were named as     defendants in several putative class action lawsuits filed in     federal and state courts. All of these cases have since been     transferred or conditionally transferred to the     U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York     under the caption In re Lehman Brothers Securities and ERISA     Litigation. Plaintiffs allege that the underwriter     defendants violated Section 11 of the Securities Act of     1933, as well as various state laws, by making false or     misleading disclosures about the real estate-related investments     and mortgage lending practices of Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc.     (LBHI) in connection with various debt and convertible stock           offerings of LBHI. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages. On     June 4, 2010, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the     complaint, which remains pending.     Lehman Setoff     Litigation       In 2008, following the bankruptcy filing of LBHI, Lehman     Brothers Special Financing Inc. (LBSF) owed money to BANA as a     result of various terminated derivatives transactions entered     into pursuant to one or more ISDA Master Agreements between the     parties. The net termination values of these derivative     transactions resulted in estimated claims by BANA against LBSF     in excess of $1.0 billion. LBHI had guaranteed this     exposure and, as part of an arrangement through which various     LBHI subsidiaries and affiliates would retain an ability to     overdraw their accounts during working hours, had     $500 million in cash (plus $1.8 million in accrued     interest) on deposit with BANA in a deposit account (the Deposit     Account).       On November 10, 2008, BANA exercised its right of setoff     against the Deposit Account to partially satisfy claims that     BANA had asserted against LBSF and LBHI pursuant to the ISDA     agreements and the LBHI guarantee. At the same time, BANA     exercised its right of set off against five other LBHI accounts     holding an additional $7.5 million (one of which, in the     amount of approximately $500,000, was later reversed). On     November 26, 2008, BANA commenced an adversary proceeding     against LBSF and LBHI in their Chapter 11 bankruptcy     proceedings in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern     District of New York. BANA sought a declaration that its setoff     of LBHIs funds was proper and not in violation of the     automatic stay imposed under the Bankruptcy Code. In response,     LBHI filed counterclaims against BANA alleging that BANA had no     right to set off against the $502 million held in the     Deposit Account, and that the entire setoff was in violation of     the automatic stay. LBHI sought the return of the set-off funds     plus prejudgment interest and unspecified damages for violation     of the automatic stay, including attorneys fees and     interest. LBSF and LBHI also argued in their summary judgment     papers that the entire setoff was in violation of the automatic     stay, although they did not plead turnover of the funds held in     the other accounts.       On December 3, 2010, the Bankruptcy Court entered summary     judgment against BANA with respect to setoff of the Deposit     Account and directed BANA to pay to LBSF and LBHI     $502 million, plus interest at nine percent per annum from     November 10, 2008 through the date of the judgment. The     court conducted a status conference on January 19, 2011 and     directed the parties to discuss and present a further order     regarding LBHIs request for sanctions pertaining to     BANAs alleged violation of the automatic stay. LBSF and     LBHI publicly indicated that they would request turnover of the     $7 million that was set off from the other accounts plus an     additional amount to account for changes in foreign exchange     rates. The parties have since agreed in principle to settle both     the sanctions issue and the question of turnover of the     additional $7 million for an irrevocable payment of     $1.5 million by BANA. The settlement, which has still to be     finally documented and is subject to approval of the Bankruptcy     Court, would express that BANA admits no liability or wrongdoing     with respect to sanctions, and that LBHI and LBSF reserve no     rights to seek recovery of the $7 million, on appeal or     otherwise. BANA will oppose that request. BANA has preserved its     appellate rights as to the December 3 order and intends to file     an appeal upon entry of a final order approving the settlement.     MBIA Insurance     Corporation CDO Litigation       On April 30, 2009, MBIA and LaCrosse Financial Products,     LLC filed a complaint in New York State Supreme Court, New York     County, against MLPFS and Merrill Lynch International     (MLI) under the caption MBIA Insurance Corporation and     LaCrosse Financial Products, LLC v. Merrill Lynch Pierce     Fenner and Smith Inc., and Merrill Lynch International.     The complaint relates to certain credit default swap and     insurance agreements by which plaintiffs provided credit     protection to MLPFS and MLI and other parties on CDO              Bank of America     2010     199     Table of Contents             securities. Plaintiffs claim that MLPFS and MLI did not     adequately disclose the credit quality and other risks of the     CDO securities and underlying collateral. The complaint alleges     claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of the     implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and breach of     contract and seeks rescission and unspecified compensatory and     punitive damages, among other relief. On April 9, 2010, the     court granted defendants motion to dismiss as to the     fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of the implied     covenant of good faith and fair dealing and rescission claims,     as well as a portion of the breach of contract claim. Plaintiffs     have appealed the dismissal of their claims and MLI has     cross-appealed the denial of its motion to dismiss the breach of     contract claim in its entirety. On February 1, 2011, the     appellate court dismissed the case against MLI in its entirety.     MBIA has filed a request to appeal the appellate courts     decision to the New York State Court of Appeals and has     requested permission from the trial court to file an amended     complaint.     Merrill Lynch     Acquisition-related Matters       Since January 2009, the Corporation and certain of its current     and former officers and directors, among others, have been named     as defendants in a variety of actions filed in state and federal     courts relating to the Corporations acquisition of Merrill     Lynch (the Acquisition). These acquisition-related cases consist     of securities actions, derivative actions and actions under     ERISA. The claims in these actions generally concern     (i) the Acquisition; (ii) the financial condition and     2008 fourth-quarter losses experienced by the Corporation and     Merrill Lynch; (iii) due diligence conducted in connection     with the Acquisition; (iv) the Corporations agreement     that Merrill Lynch could pay up to $5.8 billion in bonus     payments to Merrill Lynch employees; (v) the     Corporations discussions with government officials in     December 2008 regarding the Corporations consideration of     invoking the material adverse change clause in the Acquisition     agreement and the possibility of obtaining government assistance     in completing the Acquisition;     and/or     (vi) alleged material misrepresentations     and/or     material omissions in the proxy statement and related materials     for the Acquisition.     Securities     Actions       Plaintiffs in the putative securities class actions in the In     re Bank of America Securities, Derivative and Employment     Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Litigation     (Securities Plaintiffs) represent all (i) purchasers of     the Corporations common and preferred securities between     September 15, 2008 and January 21, 2009;     (ii) holders of the Corporations common stock or     Series B Preferred Stock as of October 10, 2008; and     (iii) purchasers of the Corporations common stock     issued in the offering that occurred on or about October 7,     2008. During the purported class period, the Corporation had     between 4,560,112,687 and 5,017,579,321 common shares     outstanding and the price of those securities declined from     $33.74 on September 12, 2008 to $6.68 on January 21,     2009. Securities Plaintiffs claim violations of     Sections 10(b), 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange     Act of 1934, and SEC rules promulgated thereunder. Securities     Plaintiffs amended complaint also alleges violations of     Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933     related to an offering of the Corporations common stock     that occurred on or about October 7, 2008, and names BAS     and MLPFS, among others, as defendants on the Section 11     and 12(a)(2) claims. The Corporation and its co-defendants filed     motions to dismiss, which the court granted in part by     dismissing certain of the Securities Plaintiffs claims     under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.     Securities Plaintiffs have filed a second amended complaint     which seeks to replead some of the dismissed claims as well as     add claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities     Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of holders of certain debt,     preferred securities and option securities. The Corporation and     its co-defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the second     amended complaints new and amended           allegations, which remains pending. Securities Plaintiffs seek     unspecified monetary damages, legal costs and attorneys     fees.       Several individual plaintiffs have opted to pursue claims apart     from the In re Bank of America Securities, Derivative, and     Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Litigation     and, accordingly, have initiated individual actions relying on     substantially the same facts and claims as the Securities     Plaintiffs in the U.S. District Court for the Southern     District of New York.       On January 13, 2010, the Corporation, Merrill Lynch and     certain of the Corporations current and former officers     and directors were named in a purported class action filed in     the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New     York entitled Dornfest v. Bank of America Corp., et     al. The action is purportedly brought on behalf of investors     in Corporation option contracts between September 15, 2008     and January 22, 2009 and alleges that during the class     period approximately 9.5 million Corporation call option     contracts and approximately eight million Corporation put option     contracts were already traded on seven of the Options Clearing     Corporation exchanges. The complaint alleges that defendants     violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities     Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC rules promulgated thereunder. On     April 9, 2010, the court consolidated this action with the     consolidated securities action in the In re Bank of America     Securities, Derivative and Employment Retirement Income Security     Act (ERISA) Litigation, and ruled that the plaintiffs may     pursue the action as an individual action. Plaintiffs seek     unspecified monetary damages, legal costs and attorneys     fees.     Derivative     Actions       Several of the derivative actions related to the Acquisition     that were pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery were     consolidated under the caption In re Bank of America     Corporation Stockholder Derivative Litigation. In addition,     the MDL ordered the transfer of actions related to the     Acquisition that had been pending in various federal courts to     the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New     York for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. These     actions have been separately consolidated and are now pending     under the caption In re Bank of America Securities,     Derivative, and Employment Retirement Income Security Act     (ERISA) Litigation.       On October 9, 2009, plaintiffs in the derivative actions in     the In re Bank of America Securities, Derivative and     Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Litigation     (the Derivative Plaintiffs) filed a consolidated amended     derivative and class action complaint. The amended complaint     names as defendants certain of the Corporations current     and former directors, officers and financial advisors, and     certain of Merrill Lynchs current and former directors and     officers. The Corporation is named as a nominal defendant with     respect to the derivative claims. The amended complaint asserts     claims for, among other things: (i) violation of federal     securities laws; (ii) breach of fiduciary duties;     (iii) the return of incentive compensation that is alleged     to be inappropriate in view of the work performed and the     results achieved by certain of the defendants; and     (iv) contribution in connection with the Corporations     exposure to significant liability under state and federal law.     The amended complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages,     equitable remedies and other relief. On February 8, 2010,     the Derivative Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims     against each of the former Merrill Lynch officers and directors     without prejudice. The Corporation and its co-defendants filed     motions to dismiss, which were granted in part on     August 27, 2010. On October 18, 2010, the Corporation     and its co-defendants answered the remaining allegations     asserted by the Derivative Plaintiffs.       On February 17, 2010, an alleged shareholder of the     Corporation filed a purported derivative action, entitled     Bahnmaier v. Lewis, et al., in the     U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.     The complaint names as defendants certain of the     Corporations current and former directors and officers,     and one of Merrill Lynchs former officers. The complaint     alleges, among other things, that the individual defendants     breached their fiduciary              200     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents             duties by failing to provide accurate and complete information     to shareholders regarding: (i) certain Acquisition-related     events; (ii) the potential for litigation resulting from     Countrywides lending practices; and (iii) the risk     posed to the Corporations capital levels as a result of     Countrywides loan losses. The complaint also asserts     claims against the individual defendants for breach of fiduciary     duty by failing to maintain adequate internal controls, unjust     enrichment, abuse of control and gross mismanagement in     connection with the supervision and management of the     operations, business and disclosure controls of the Corporation.     The Corporation is named as a nominal defendant only and no     monetary relief is sought against it. The complaint seeks, among     other things, unspecified monetary damages, equitable remedies     and other relief. On December 14, 2010, the court entered     an order dismissing the complaint without prejudice.       The Corporation and certain of its current and former directors     are also named as defendants in several putative class and     derivative actions in the Delaware Court of Chancery, including     Rothbaum v. Lewis; Southeastern Pennsylvania     Transportation Authority v. Lewis; Tremont Partners     LLC v. Lewis; Kovacs v. Lewis; Stern v.     Lewis; and Houx v. Lewis, brought by     shareholders alleging breaches of fiduciary duties and waste of     corporate assets in connection with the Acquisition. On     April 27, 2009, the Delaware Court of Chancery consolidated     the derivative actions under the caption In re Bank of     America Corporation Stockholder Derivative Litigation. The     complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified monetary     damages, equitable remedies and other relief. On April 30,     2009, the putative class claims in the Stern v. Lewis     and Houx v. Lewis actions were voluntarily     dismissed without prejudice. Trial is scheduled for October 2012.     ERISA     Actions       On October 9, 2009, plaintiffs in the ERISA actions in the     In re Bank of America Securities, Derivative and Employment     Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Litigation (the ERISA     Plaintiffs) filed a consolidated amended complaint for breaches     of duty under ERISA. The amended complaint is brought on behalf     of a purported class that consists of participants in the     Corporations 401(k) Plan, the Corporations 401(k)     Plan for Legacy Companies, the CFC 401(k) Plan (collectively,     the 401(k) Plans) and the Corporations Pension Plan. The     amended complaint alleges violations of ERISA, based on, among     other things: (i) an alleged failure to prudently and     loyally manage the 401(k) Plans and Pension Plan by continuing     to offer the Corporations common stock as an investment     option or measure for participant contributions; (ii) an     alleged failure to monitor the fiduciaries of the 401(k) Plans     and Pension Plan; (iii) an alleged failure to provide     complete and accurate information to the 401(k) Plans and     Pension Plan participants with respect to the Merrill Lynch and     Countrywide acquisitions and related matters; and     (iv) alleged co-fiduciary liability for these purported     fiduciary breaches. The amended complaint seeks unspecified     monetary damages, equitable remedies and other relief. On     August 27, 2010, the court dismissed the complaint brought     by plaintiffs in the consolidated ERISA action in its entirety.     The ERISA Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the     courts dismissal of their actions. The parties then     stipulated to the dismissal of the appeal with the agreement     that the ERISA Plaintiffs can reinstate their appeal at any time     up until July 27, 2011.     NYAG     Action       On February 4, 2010, the New York Attorney General (NYAG)     filed a civil complaint in the Supreme Court of New York State,     entitled People of the State of New York v. Bank of     America, et al. The complaint names as defendants the     Corporation and the Corporations former CEO and CFO, and     alleges violations of Sections 352, 352-c(1)(a),     352-c(1)(c), and 353 of the New York General Business Law,     commonly known as the Martin Act, and Section 63(12) of the     New York Executive Law. The complaint seeks an           unspecified amount in disgorgement, penalties, restitution, and     damages and other equitable relief. The court has ordered fact     discovery to be complete by September 30, 2011.     Montgomery       The Corporation, several of its current and former officers and     directors, BAS, MLPFS and other unaffiliated underwriters have     been named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the     U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York     entitled Montgomery v. Bank of America, et al.     Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on January 14, 2011.     Plaintiff seeks to sue on behalf of all persons who acquired     certain series of preferred stock offered by the Corporation     pursuant to a shelf registration statement dated May 5,     2006. Plaintiffs claims arise from three offerings dated     January 24, 2008, January 28, 2008 and May 20,     2008, from which the Corporation allegedly received proceeds of     $15.8 billion. The amended complaint asserts claims under     Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933,     and alleges that the prospectus supplements associated with the     offerings: (i) failed to disclose that the     Corporations loans, leases, CDOs and commercial MBS were     impaired to a greater extent than disclosed;     (ii) misrepresented the extent of the impaired assets by     failing to establish adequate reserves or properly record losses     for its impaired assets; (iii) misrepresented the adequacy     of the Corporations internal controls in light of the     alleged impairment of its assets; (iv) misrepresented the     Corporations capital base and Tier 1 leverage ratio     for risk-based capital in light of the allegedly impaired     assets; and (v) misrepresented the thoroughness and     adequacy of the Corporations due diligence in connection     with its acquisition of Countrywide. The amended complaint seeks     rescission, compensatory and other damages.     Mortgage-backed     Securities Litigation       The Corporation and its affiliates, Countrywide entities and     their affiliates, and Merrill Lynch entities and their     affiliates have been named as defendants in several cases     relating to their various roles as issuer, originator, seller,     depositor, sponsor, underwriter     and/or     controlling entity in MBS offerings, pursuant to which the MBS     investors were entitled to a portion of the cash flow from the     underlying pools of mortgages. These cases generally include     purported class action suits and actions by individual MBS     purchasers. Although the allegations vary by lawsuit, these     cases generally allege that the registration statements,     prospectuses and prospectus supplements for securities issued by     securitization trusts contained material misrepresentations and     omissions, in violation of Sections 11 and 12 of the     Securities Act of 1933     and/or state     securities laws and other state statutory and common laws.       These cases generally involve allegations of false and     misleading statements regarding: (i) the process by which     the properties that served as collateral for the mortgage loans     underlying the MBS were appraised; (ii) the percentage of     equity that mortgage borrowers had in their homes;     (iii) the borrowers ability to repay their mortgage     loans; and (iv) the underwriting practices by which those     mortgage loans were originated (collectively, the MBS Claims).     In addition, several of the cases discussed below assert claims     related to the ratings given to the different tranches of MBS by     rating agencies. Plaintiffs in these cases generally seek     unspecified compensatory damages, unspecified costs and legal     fees and, in some instances, seek rescission.     Luther     Litigation and Related Actions       David H. Luther and various pension funds (collectively, Luther     Plaintiffs) commenced a putative class action against CFC,     several of its affiliates, BAS, MLPFS and other entities and     individuals in California Superior Court for Los Angeles County     entitled Luther v. Countrywide Financial Corporation,     et al (the Luther Action). The Luther Plaintiffs claim     that they and other unspecified investors purchased MBS issued     by subsidiaries of CFC in 429 offerings              Bank of America     2010     201     Table of Contents             between January 2005 and December 2007. The Luther Plaintiffs     certified that they collectively purchased securities in 61 of     the 429 offerings for approximately $216 million. On     January 6, 2010, the court granted CFCs motion to     dismiss, with prejudice, due to lack of subject matter     jurisdiction. The Luther Plaintiffs appeal to the     California Court of Appeal is currently pending.       Following the dismissal of the Luther Action, the Maine State     Retirement System filed a putative class action in the     U.S. District Court for the Central District of California,     entitled Maine State Retirement System v. Countrywide     Financial Corporation, et al. (the Maine Action). The Maine     Action names the same defendants as the Luther Action, as well     as the Corporation and NB Holdings Corporation, and asserts     substantially the same allegations regarding 427 of the MBS     offerings that were at issue in the Luther Action. On     May 14, 2010, the court appointed the Iowa Public     Employees Retirement System (IPERS) as Lead Plaintiff. On     July 13, 2010, IPERS filed an amended complaint, which     added additional pension fund plaintiffs (collectively, the     Maine Plaintiffs). The Maine Plaintiffs certified that they     purchased securities in 81 of those 427 offerings, for     approximately $538 million. On November 4, 2010, the     court granted CFCs motion to dismiss the amended complaint     in its entirety, and ordered the Maine Plaintiffs to file a     second amended complaint within 30 days. In so doing, the     court held that the Maine Plaintiffs only have standing to sue     over the 81 offerings in which they actually purchased MBS. The     court also held that the applicable statute of limitations could     be tolled by the filing of the Luther Action only with respect     to the offerings in which the Luther Plaintiffs actually     purchased MBS. On December 6, 2010, the Maine Plaintiffs     filed a second amended complaint that relates to 14 MBS     offerings.       Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust Fund (Western     Teamsters) filed suit against the same defendants named in the     Maine Action on November 17, 2010 in the Superior Court of     California, Los Angeles County, entitled Western Conference     of Teamsters Pension Trust Fund v. Countrywide     Financial Corporation, et al. Western Teamsters claims that     it and other unspecified investors purchased MBS issued in the     428 offerings that were also at issue in the Luther Action. The     Western Teamsters action has been stayed by the Superior Court     pending resolution of the appeal of the Luther Action.       The New Mexico State Investment Council, New Mexico Educational     Retirement Board and New Mexico Public Employees Retirement     Association (the New Mexico Plaintiffs) have also brought an     action against CFC and several of its affiliates, current and     former officers, as well as third-party underwriters in New     Mexico District Court for the County of Santa Fe, entitled     New Mexico State Investment Council, et al. v.     Countrywide Financial Corporation, et al. A related action     was later filed against the individual defendants in California     Superior Court, entitled New Mexico State Investment Council,     et al. v. Stanford L. Kurland, et al. On     November 15, 2010, the parties agreed to resolve and     dismiss these two cases in their entirety with prejudice for an     amount that is not material to the Corporations results of     operations.       Putnam Bank filed a putative class action lawsuit on     January 27, 2011 against CFC, the Corporation, certain of     their subsidiaries, and certain individuals in the     U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut,     entitled Putnam Bank v. Countrywide Financial     Corporation, et al. Putnam Bank alleges that it purchased     approximately $33 million in eight MBS offerings issued by     subsidiaries of CFC between August 2005 and September 2007. All     eight offerings were also included in the Luther Action and the     Maine Action. In addition to certain MBS Claims, Putnam Bank     contends among other things that defendants made false and     misleading statements regarding: (i) the number of mortgage     loans in each offering that were originated under reduced     documentation programs; (ii) the method by which mortgages     were selected for inclusion in the collateral pools underlying     the offerings; and (iii) the analysis conducted by ratings     agencies prior to assigning ratings to the MBS.             Countrywide may also be subject to contractual indemnification     obligations for the benefit of certain defendants involved in     the MBS matters discussed above.     IndyMac     Litigation       In 2006 and 2007, MLPFS, CSC and other financial institutions     participated as underwriters in MBS offerings in which IndyMac     MBS, Inc. securitized residential mortgage loans originated or     acquired by IndyMac Bank, F.S.B. (IndyMac Bank) and created     trusts that issued MBS. In 2009, the Corporation was named as an     underwriter defendant, along with several other financial     institutions, in its alleged capacity as     successor-in-interest     to MLPFS and CSC in a consolidated class action in the     U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York,     entitled In re IndyMac Mortgage-Backed Securities     Litigation. In their complaint, plaintiffs assert MBS Claims     relating to 106 offerings of IndyMac-related MBS. On     June 21, 2010, the court dismissed the Corporation from the     action because the plaintiffs failed to plead sufficient facts     to support their allegation that the Corporation is the     successor-in-interest     to MLPFS and CSC. On August 3, 2010, plaintiffs filed a     motion to add MLPFS and CSC as defendants, which MLPFS and CSC     have opposed.     Merrill Lynch     MBS Litigation       Merrill Lynch, MLPFS, Merrill Lynch Mortgage Investors, Inc.     (MLMI) and certain current and former directors of MLMI are     named as defendants in a putative consolidated class action in     the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New     York, entitled Public Employees Ret. System of     Mississippi v. Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. In     addition to MBS Claims, plaintiffs also allege that the offering     documents for the MBS misrepresented or omitted material facts     regarding the credit ratings assigned to the securities. In     March 2010, the court dismissed claims related to 65 of 84     offerings with prejudice due to lack of standing as no named     plaintiff purchased securities in those offerings. On     November 8, 2010, the court dismissed claims related to 1     of 19 remaining offerings on separate grounds. MLPFS was the     sole underwriter of these 18 offerings. On December 1,     2010, the defendants filed an answer to the consolidated amended     complaint.     Cambridge     Place Investment Management Litigation       Cambridge Place Investment Management Inc. (CPIM), as the     alleged exclusive assignee of certain entities that allegedly     purchased MBS offered or sold by BAS, MLPFS and CSC, brought an     action against BAS, MLPFS, CSC and several of their affiliates     in Massachusetts Superior Court, Suffolk County, entitled     Cambridge Place Investment Management Inc. v. Morgan     Stanley & Co., Inc., et al. CPIM also brought     claims against more than 50 other defendants in this action. In     addition to MBS Claims, CPIM contends that BAS, MLPFS, CSC and     their affiliates made false and misleading statements in     violation of the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act regarding:     (i) due diligence performed by the underwriters on the     mortgage loans and the mortgage originators underwriting     practices; and (ii) the credit enhancements applicable to     certain tranches of the MBS. On August 13, 2010, certain     defendants removed the case to the U.S. District Court for     the District of Massachusetts. On September 13, 2010, CPIM     filed a motion to remand the case back to state court. On     October 12, 2010, the court referred the motion to remand     to a Magistrate Judge for consideration. On December 28,     2010, the Magistrate Judge issued a report and recommendation     that the action be remanded to state court. On January 18,     2011, the defendants filed an objection to that recommendation,     which CPIM opposed on February 1, 2011. The objection to     the Magistrate Judges recommendation remains pending.       On February 11, 2011, CPIM commenced a separate civil     action in Massachusetts Superior Court, Suffolk County,     captioned Cambridge Place Investment Management Inc. v.     Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc., et al., in              202     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents             connection with the offering or sale of certain additional     mortgage-backed securities by BAS, MLPFS, CSC, several of their     affiliates and more than 40 other defendants. CPIM alleges that     it is the assignee of the claims of certain entities that     allegedly purchased mortgage-backed securities issued or sold by     BAS, MLPFS and CSC in various offerings. In addition to MBS     Claims, CPIM contends that BAS, MLPFS, CSC and their affiliates     made false and misleading statements in violation of the     Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act in connection with these     offerings regarding: (i) due diligence performed by the     underwriters on the mortgage loans and the mortgage     originators underwriting practices; (ii) the credit     enhancements applicable to certain tranches of the MBS; and     (iii) the validity of each issuing trusts title to     the mortgage loans comprising the pool for that securitization.     Federal Home     Loan Bank Litigation       The Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB Atlanta) filed a     complaint on January 18, 2011 against the Corporation, CFC,     CSC and Countrywide Home Loans (CHL) in the State Court of     Georgia, Fulton County, entitled Federal Home Loan Bank of     Atlanta v. Countrywide Financial Corporation, et al. In     addition to certain MBS Claims, FHLB Atlanta contends that     defendants made false and misleading statements regarding:     (i) the credit ratings of the securities; and (ii) the     transfer and assignment of the loans to the trusts.       The Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (FHLB Chicago) filed a     complaint against the Corporation, BAS, MLPFS and CSC in the     Illinois Circuit Court, Cook County, entitled Federal Home     Loan Bank of Chicago v. Banc of America Funding Corp.,     et al. (the Illinois Action). FHLB Chicago also filed a     complaint against BAS, CFC and subsidiaries of CFC in the     Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County, entitled     Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago v. Banc of America     Securities LLC, et al. (the California Action). In addition     to certain MBS Claims, FHLB Chicago contends that defendants     made false and misleading statements regarding among other     things, the guidelines for extending mortgages to borrowers and     the due diligence performed on repurchased and pooled loans.     Both actions have been removed to federal court.       The Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLB Pittsburgh)     commenced an action against CFC, CSC and certain other     Countrywide affiliates, as well as several ratings agencies, in     the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County Pennsylvania,     entitled Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh v.     Countrywide Securities Corporation et al. FHLB Pittsburgh     claims to have purchased MBS issued by subsidiaries of CFC in     five offerings for approximately $366 million. In addition     to certain MBS Claims, FHLB Pittsburgh contends that defendants     made false and misleading statements regarding the risk     associated with the MBS based on their credit ratings.     Countrywides motion to dismiss was denied on     November 29, 2010.       The Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle (FHLB Seattle) filed four     separate complaints, each against different defendants,     including the Corporation and several of its subsidiaries,     Countrywide and Merrill Lynch, as well as certain other     defendants, in the Superior Court of Washington for King County     concerning four separate issuances entitled Federal Home Loan     Bank of Seattle v. UBS Securities LLC, et al.;     Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle v. Countrywide     Securities Corp., et al.; Federal Home Loan Bank of     Seattle v. Banc of America Securities LLC, et al.     and Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle v. Merrill     Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., et al. In     addition to certain MBS Claims, FHLB Seattle contends that     defendants made false and misleading statements regarding the     number of borrowers who actually lived in the houses that     secured the mortgage loans and the business practices of the     lending institutions that made the mortgage loans. FHLB Seattle     claims that the sales violated the Securities Act of Washington.     On October 18, 2010, the Corporation entities and     Countrywide entities named as defendants in three of the cases     filed a consolidated motion to dismiss the amended complaints,     which is currently pending. On the same date, the           Merrill Lynch entities named as defendants in the fourth case     filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which is     currently pending.       The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB     San Francisco) filed two actions against various affiliates     of the Corporation, as well as various Countrywide and Merrill     Lynch entities in the Superior Court of California, County of     San Francisco, entitled: (i) Federal Home Loan Bank     of San Francisco v. Credit Suisse Securities (USA)     LLC, et al., which asserts claims against CFC, CSC, BAS and     several of their affiliates; and (ii) Federal Home Loan     Bank of San Francisco v. Deutsche Bank Securities     Inc., et al., which asserts claims against CSC and MLPFS. In     addition to certain MBS Claims, FHLB San Francisco contends     that defendants made false and misleading statements regarding     the original mortgage lenders guidelines for extending the     loans to borrowers. FHLB San Francisco also claims that     defendants failed to disclose that third-party ratings     services credit ratings of the MBS did not take into     account defendants false and misleading statements about     the mortgage loans underlying the MBS. On November 5, 2010,     FHLB San Francisco sought permission from the court to     amend its complaint in the first action to include the     Corporation as a defendant and, among other things, to assert     control person liability claims against the Corporation under     state and federal securities laws and to assert that the     Corporation succeeded to CFCs interests. Defendants had     removed the state court actions to federal court, but on     December 20, 2010, the U.S. District Court, Northern     District of California remanded the cases to state court and     denied a motion to amend the complaint as moot when it granted     remand. On November 5, 2010, FHLB San Francisco also     filed a declaratory action in the Superior Court of California,     County of San Francisco, entitled Federal Home Loan Bank     of San Francisco v. Bank of America Corporation and     Does 1-10, seeking a determination that the Corporation is a     successor to the liabilities of CFC including the liabilities at     issue in Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco v.     Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, et al.     Charles Schwab     Litigation       The Charles Schwab Corporation (Schwab) has filed an action     against the Corporation, BAS, Countrywide, and several of their     affiliates, in the Superior Court of California, County of     San Francisco, on July 15, 2010 entitled The     Charles Schwab Corp. v. BNP Paribas Securities Corp., et     al. This action is in connection with the purchase by Schwab     of approximately $577 million of MBS, $166 million of     which relates to claims with respect to the Corporation and BAS     and $411 million of which relates to claims with respect to     Countrywide. In addition to MBS Claims, Schwab contends that the     Corporation, BAS and Countrywide are liable for false and     misleading statements regarding among other things, the business     practices of the lending institution that made the original loan     and MBS credit ratings. In September 2010, the Corporation, BAS     and Countrywide joined in or consented to the removal of this     action to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District     of California. Schwab has filed a motion to remand the action to     California state court, which remains pending.     Allstate     Litigation       Allstate Insurance Company, Allstate Life Insurance Company,     Allstate Life Insurance Company of New York and American     Heritage Life Insurance Company (collectively, the Allstate     Plaintiffs) filed an action on December 27, 2010 against     CFC, the Corporation, several of their affiliates and several     individuals in the U.S. District Court for the Southern     District of New York, entitled Allstate Insurance Company, et     al., v. Countrywide Financial Corporation, et al. (the     Allstate Action). The Allstate Plaintiffs allege that they     purchased MBS issued by CFC related entities in 25 offerings     between March 2005 and June 2007. All but three of the 25     offerings in the Allstate Action are also at issue in the Luther     and Western Teamsters Actions. Two of the 25 offerings in the     Allstate Action are also at issue in the second amended     complaint filed by plaintiffs in              Bank of America     2010     203     Table of Contents             the Maine Action on December 6, 2010. In addition to     certain MBS Claims, the Allstate Plaintiffs contend that     defendants made false and misleading statements regarding:     (i) the number of borrowers who used the properties     securing the mortgage loans as their primary residence;     (ii) the number of mortgage loans in each offering that     were originated under reduced documentation programs; and     (iii) the standards by which the mortgage loans were     serviced after origination.     Regulatory     Investigations       In addition to the MBS litigation discussed beginning on     page 201, the Corporation has also received a number of     subpoenas and other informal requests for information from     federal regulators regarding MBS matters, including inquiries     related to the Corporations underwriting and issuance of     MBS and its participation in certain CDO offerings.     Municipal     Derivatives Matters       The SEC, the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Internal Revenue     Service (IRS), the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC),     the Federal Reserve and a Working Group of State Attorneys     General (the Working Group) have investigated the Corporation,     BANA and BAS concerning possible anticompetitive practices in     the municipal derivatives industry dating back to the early     1990s. These investigations have focused on the bidding     practices for guaranteed investment contracts, the investment     vehicles in which the proceeds of municipal bond offerings are     deposited, as well as other types of derivative transactions     related to municipal bonds. On January 11, 2007, the     Corporation entered a Corporate Conditional Leniency Letter with     the DOJ, under which the DOJ agreed not to prosecute the     Corporation for criminal antitrust violations in connection with     matters the Corporation has reported to the DOJ, subject to the     Corporations continued cooperation. On December 7,     2010, the Corporation and its affiliates settled inquiries with     the SEC, OCC, IRS and the Working Group for an aggregate amount     that is not material to the Corporations results of     operations. In addition, the Corporation entered into an     agreement with the Federal Reserve providing for additional     oversight and compliance risk management.       BANA and Merrill Lynch, along with other financial institutions,     are named as defendants in several substantially similar class     actions and individual actions, filed in various state and     federal courts by several municipalities that issued municipal     bonds, as well as purchasers of municipal derivatives. These     actions generally allege that defendants conspired to violate     federal and state antitrust laws by allocating customers, and     fixing or stabilizing rates of return on certain municipal     derivatives from 1992 to the present. These actions seek     unspecified damages, including treble damages. However, as a     result of the Corporations receipt of the Corporate     Leniency Letter from the DOJ referenced above, the Corporation     is eligible to seek a ruling that certain civil plaintiffs are     limited to single, rather than treble, damages and relief from     joint and several liability with co-defendants in the civil     suits discussed below. All of the actions have been transferred     to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New     York and consolidated in a single proceeding, entitled In re     Municipal Derivatives Antitrust Litigation. Defendants other     than BANA and Merrill Lynch filed motions to dismiss     plaintiffs complaints, which the court denied in large     part in April 2010. The action has otherwise been largely stayed     while the DOJ completes its criminal trials concerning other     parties.     Ocala     Litigation       BNP Paribas Mortgage Corporation and Deutsche Bank AG each filed     claims (the 2009 Actions) against BANA in the U.S. District     Court for the Southern District of New York entitled BNP     Paribas Mortgage Corporation v. Bank of America, N.A.     and Deutsche Bank AG v. Bank of America, N.A.     Plaintiffs allege that BANA failed to properly perform its     duties as indenture trustee, collateral agent, custodian and     depositary for Ocala Funding, LLC (Ocala), a home           mortgage warehousing facility, resulting in the loss of     plaintiffs investment in Ocala. Ocala was a wholly-owned     subsidiary of Taylor, Bean & Whitaker Mortgage Corp.     (TBW), a home mortgage originator and servicer which is alleged     to have committed fraud that led to its eventual bankruptcy.     Ocala provided funding for TBWs mortgage origination     activities by issuing notes, the proceeds of which were to be     used by TBW to originate home mortgages. Such mortgages and     other Ocala assets in turn were pledged to BANA, as collateral     agent, to secure the notes. Plaintiffs lost most or all of their     investment in Ocala when, as the result of the alleged fraud     committed by TBW, Ocala was unable to repay the notes purchased     by plaintiffs and there was insufficient collateral to satisfy     Ocalas debt obligations. Plaintiffs allege that BANA     breached its contractual, fiduciary and other duties to Ocala,     thereby permitting TBWs alleged fraud to go undetected.     Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages and other relief from BANA,     including interest and attorneys fees, in an unspecified     amount, but which plaintiffs allege exceeds $1.6 billion.     BANAs motions to dismiss these actions are currently     pending.       On August 30, 2010, plaintiffs each filed a new lawsuit     (the 2010 Actions) against BANA in the U.S. District Court     for the Southern District of Florida entitled BNP Paribas     Mortgage Corporation v. Bank of America, N.A. and     Deutsche Bank AG v. Bank of America, N.A., which the     parties agreed to transfer to the U.S. District Court for     the Southern District of New York as related to the 2009     Actions. The 2010 Actions assert an alternative theory for     plaintiffs to recover a portion of their Ocala losses from BANA.     Plaintiffs allege that BANAs commercial division purchased     from TBW participation interests in pools of mortgage loans that     allegedly included loans that were already pledged as collateral     for plaintiffs Ocala notes. Plaintiffs allege that the     purchase of these participation interests constituted conversion     of the underlying mortgage loans and that BANA is thus required     to reimburse plaintiffs for the value of these loans. Plaintiffs     seek compensatory and other damages, interest and     attorneys fees in amounts that are unspecified but which     plaintiffs allege exceed approximately $665 million,     representing a portion of the same losses alleged in the 2009     Actions. BANAs motion to dismiss the 2010 Actions was     argued in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District     of New York on January 26, 2011.       On October 1, 2010, BANA, on behalf of Ocalas     investors, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the     District of Columbia against the Federal Deposit Insurance     Corporation (FDIC) as receiver of Colonial Bank (TBWs     primary bank) and Platinum Community Bank (a wholly-owned     subsidiary of TBW) entitled Bank of America, National     Association as indenture trustee, custodian and collateral agent     for Ocala Funding, LLC v. Federal Deposit Insurance     Corporation. The suit seeks judicial review of the     FDICs denial of the administrative claims brought by BANA,     on behalf of Ocala, in the FDICs Colonial and Platinum     receivership proceedings. BANAs claims allege that     Ocalas losses were in whole or in part the result of     Colonials and Platinums participation in TBWs     alleged fraud. BANA seeks a court order requiring the FDIC to     allow BANAs claims in an amount equal to Ocalas     losses and, accordingly, to permit BANA, as trustee, collateral     agent, custodian and depositary for Ocala, to share     appropriately in distributions of any receivership assets that     the FDIC makes to creditors of the two failed banks.     Parmalat       On November 23, 2005, the Official Liquidators of Food     Holdings Limited and Dairy Holdings Limited, two entities in     liquidation proceedings in the Cayman Islands, filed a complaint     in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New     York, entitled Food Holdings Ltd, et al. v. Bank of     America Corp., et al., against the Corporation and several     related entities. Plaintiffs allege that the Corporation and     other defendants conspired with Parmalat, which was admitted to     insolvency proceedings in Italy in December 2003, in carrying     out transactions involving the plaintiffs in connection with the     funding of Parmalats Brazilian entities. Plaintiffs assert     claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of     fiduciary duty and other related claims. The complaint              204     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents             seeks in excess of $400 million in compensatory damages and     interest, among other relief. On February 17, 2010, the     court dismissed all of plaintiffs claims. On     March 18, 2010, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the     U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and on     April 1, 2010, the Corporation filed a cross-appeal.     Briefing was completed in December 2010.      NOTE 15 Shareholders     Equity      Common     Stock       In October 2010, July 2010, April 2010 and January 2010, the     Board declared the fourth, third, second and first     quarters cash dividends of $0.01 per common share, which     were paid on December 24, 2010, September 24, 2010,     June 25, 2010 and March 26, 2010 to common     shareholders of record on December 3, 2010,     September 3, 2010, June 4, 2010 and March 5,     2010, respectively. In addition, in January 2011, the Board     declared a first quarter cash dividend of $0.01 per common share     payable on March 25, 2011 to common shareholders of record     on March 4, 2011.       On February 23, 2010, the Corporation held a special     meeting of stockholders at which it obtained shareholder     approval of an amendment to the Corporations amended and     restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of     authorized shares of common stock from 10.0 billion to     11.3 billion. On April 28, 2010, at the     Corporations 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the     Corporation obtained shareholder approval of an amendment to the     Corporations amended and restated certificate of     incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of     common stock from 11.3 billion to 12.8 billion.       In January 2009, the Corporation issued 1.4 billion shares     of common stock in connection with its acquisition of Merrill     Lynch. For additional information regarding the Merrill Lynch     acquisition, see Note 2  Merger and     Restructuring Activity. During 2009 and 2008, in connection     with preferred stock issuances to the U.S. government under     the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the Corporation issued     warrants to purchase 121.8 million shares of common stock     at an exercise price of $30.79 per share and 150.4 million     shares of common stock at an exercise price of $13.30 per share.     The U.S. Treasury auctioned these warrants in March 2010.       In May 2009, the Corporation issued 1.3 billion shares of     its common stock at an average price of $10.77 per share through     an     at-the-market     issuance program resulting in gross proceeds of approximately     $13.5 billion.       Through a 2008 authorized share repurchase program, the     Corporation had the ability to repurchase shares of its common     stock, subject to certain restrictions, from time to time, in     the open market or in private transactions. The 2008 authorized     repurchase program expired on January 23, 2010. There is no     existing Board authorized share repurchase program. In 2010, the     Corporation did not repurchase any shares of common stock and     issued approximately 98.6 million shares under employee     stock plans. At December 31, 2010, the Corporation had     reserved 1.5 billion unissued shares of common stock for     future issuances under employee stock plans, common stock     warrants, convertible notes and preferred stock.     Preferred     Stock       During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the aggregate dividends declared on     preferred stock were $1.4 billion, $4.5 billion and     $1.3 billion, respectively. This included $474 million     and $536 million in 2010 and 2009 related to preferred     stock issued or remaining outstanding as a part of the Merrill     Lynch acquisition.             In connection with the Merrill Lynch acquisition, Merrill Lynch     non-convertible preferred shareholders received Bank of America     Corporation preferred stock having substantially identical     terms. On October 15, 2010, all of the outstanding shares     of the mandatory convertible preferred stock of Merrill Lynch     automatically converted into an aggregate of 50 million     shares of the Corporations Common Stock in accordance with     the terms of these preferred securities.       In October 2008, in connection with TARP, the Corporation issued     to the U.S. Treasury non-voting perpetual preferred stock     and warrants for $15.0 billion. In addition, in January     2009, in connection with TARP and the Merrill Lynch acquisition,     the Corporation issued additional preferred stock for     $30.0 billion.       In December 2009, the Corporation repurchased the non-voting     perpetual preferred stock previously issued to the     U.S. Treasury (TARP Preferred Stock) through the use of     $25.7 billion in excess liquidity and $19.3 billion in     proceeds from the sale of 1.3 billion Common Equivalent     Securities (CES) valued at $15.00 per unit. The CES consisted of     depositary shares representing interests in shares of Common     Equivalent Junior Preferred Stock, Series S (Common     Equivalent Stock) and contingent warrants to purchase an     aggregate of 60 million shares of the Corporations     common stock. On February 23, 2010, the Corporation held a     special meeting of stockholders at which it obtained shareholder     approval of an amendment to the Corporations amended and     restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of     authorized shares of common stock. Accordingly, the Common     Equivalent Stock automatically converted in full into     1.286 billion shares of common stock on February 24,     2010. In addition, as a result, the contingent warrants expired     without having become exercisable and the CES ceased to exist.       During 2009, the Corporation entered into agreements with     certain holders of non-government perpetual preferred stock to     exchange their holdings of approximately $7.3 billion     aggregate liquidation preference, before third-party issuance     costs, of approximately 323 million shares of perpetual     preferred stock for approximately 545 million shares of     common stock with a fair value of stock issued of     $6.1 billion. In addition, the Corporation exchanged     approximately $3.9 billion aggregate liquidation     preference, before third-party issuance costs, of approximately     144 million shares of non-government preferred stock for     approximately 200 million shares of common stock in an     exchange offer with a fair value of stock issued of     $2.5 billion. In total, these exchanges resulted in the     exchange of approximately $11.3 billion aggregate     liquidation preference, before third-party issuance costs, of     approximately 467 million shares of preferred stock into     approximately 745 million shares of common stock with a     fair value of stock issued of $8.6 billion.       In addition, during 2009, the Corporation exchanged     3.6 million shares, or $3.6 billion aggregate     liquidation preference of Series L 7.25% Non-Cumulative     Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock into 255 million     shares of common stock valued at $2.8 billion, which was     accounted for as an induced conversion of preferred stock.       As a result of these exchanges, the Corporation recorded an     increase to retained earnings and net income (loss) applicable     to common shareholders of $576 million. This represents the     net of a $2.62 billion benefit due to the excess of the     carrying value of the Corporations non-convertible     preferred stock over the fair value of the common stock     exchanged.

Each share of the Series L     Preferred Stock may be converted at any time, at the option of     the holder, into 20 shares of the Corporations common     stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. On or after     January 30, 2013, the Corporation may cause some or all of     the Series L Preferred Stock, at its option, at any time or     from time to time, to be converted into shares of common stock     at the then-applicable conversion rate if, for 20 trading days     during any period of 30 consecutive trading days, the closing     price of common stock exceeds 130 percent of the     then-applicable conversion price of the Series L Preferred     Stock. If the Corporation exercises its rights to cause the     automatic conversion of Series L Preferred Stock on     January 30, 2013, it will still pay any accrued dividends     payable on January 30, 2013 to the applicable holders of     record.       All series of preferred stock on the previous page have a par     value of $0.01 per share, are not subject to the operation of a     sinking fund, have no participation rights, and with the     exception of the Series L Preferred Stock, are           not convertible.

All preferred stock of the Corporation     outstanding has preference over the Corporations common     stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution     of the Corporations assets in the event of a liquidation     or dissolution. If any dividend payable on these series is in     arrears for three or more semi-annual or six or more quarterly     dividend periods, as applicable (whether consecutive or not),     the holders of these series and any other class or series of     preferred stock ranking equally as to payment of dividends and     upon which equivalent voting rights have been conferred and are     exercisable (voting as a single class) will be entitled to vote     for the election of two additional directors. These voting     rights terminate when the Corporation has paid in full dividends     on these series for at least two semi-annual or four quarterly     dividend periods, as applicable, following the dividend     arrearage.

Due to the net loss applicable to common shareholders for 2010     and 2009, no dilutive potential common shares were included in     the calculation of diluted EPS because they would have been     antidilutive.       For 2010, 2009 and 2008, average options to purchase     271 million, 315 million and 181 million shares,     respectively, of common stock were outstanding but not included     in the computation of EPS because they were antidilutive under     the treasury stock method. For 2010 and 2009, average warrants     to purchase 272 million and 265 million shares of     common stock were outstanding but not included in the     computation of EPS because they were antidilutive under the     treasury stock method. For 2010 and 2009, 107 million and     147 million average dilutive potential common shares     associated with the convertible Series L Preferred Stock,     and the mandatory convertible Preferred Stock Series 2 and     Series 3 of Merrill Lynch were excluded from the diluted     share count because the result would have been antidilutive     under the if-converted method. For 2009,     81 million average dilutive potential common shares     associated with the CES were also excluded from the diluted     share count because the result would have been antidilutive     under the if-converted method. For 2008,     128 million average dilutive potential common shares     associated with the convertible Series L Preferred Stock     were excluded from the diluted share count because the result     would have been antidilutive under the if-converted     method.       For purposes of computing basic EPS, CES were considered to be     participating securities prior to February 24, 2010,     however, due to a net loss for 2010, CES were not allocated     earnings. The two-class method prohibits the allocation of an     undistributed loss to participating securities. For purposes of     computing diluted EPS, there was no dilutive effect of the CES,     which were outstanding prior to February 24, 2010, due to a     net loss for 2010.       For 2009, as a result of repurchasing the TARP Preferred Stock,     the Corporation accelerated the remaining accretion of the     issuance discount on the TARP Preferred Stock of     $4.0 billion and recorded a corresponding charge to     retained earnings and income (loss) applicable to common     shareholders in the calculation of diluted earnings per common     share. In addition, in 2009, the Corporation recorded an     increase to retained earnings and net income (loss) available to     common shareholders of $576 million related to the     Corporations preferred stock exchange for common stock.          NOTE 18 Regulatory     Requirements and Restrictions        The Federal Reserve requires the Corporations banking     subsidiaries to maintain reserve balances based on a percentage     of certain deposits. Average daily reserve balances required by     the Federal Reserve were $12.9 billion and     $10.9 billion for 2010 and 2009. Currency and coin residing     in branches and cash vaults (vault cash) are used to partially     satisfy the reserve requirement. The average daily reserve     balances, in excess of vault cash, held with the Federal Reserve     amounted to $5.5 billion and $3.4 billion for 2010 and     2009.       The primary sources of funds for cash distributions by the     Corporation to its shareholders are dividends received from its     banking subsidiaries, Bank of America, N.A. and FIA Card     Services, N.A. In 2010, the Corporation received     $4.6 billion in dividends from Bank of America, N.A. In     2011, Bank of America, N.A. and FIA Card Services, N.A. can     declare and pay dividends to the Corporation of     $5.8 billion and $0 plus an additional amount equal to     their net profits for 2011, as defined by statute, up to the     date of any such dividend declaration. The other subsidiary     national banks can pay dividends in aggregate in 2011 of     $53 million plus an additional amount equal to their net     profits for 2011, as defined by statute, up to the date of any     such dividend declaration. The amount of dividends that each     subsidiary bank may declare in a calendar year without approval     by the OCC is the subsidiary banks net profits for that     year combined with its net retained profits, as defined, for the     preceding two years.       The Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC and Office of Thrift Supervision     (collectively, joint agencies) have in place regulatory capital     guidelines for U.S. banking organizations. Failure to meet     the capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and     discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material     effect on the Corporations financial position. The     regulatory capital guidelines measure capital in relation to the     credit and market risks of both on- and off-balance sheet items     using various risk weights. Under the regulatory capital     guidelines, Total capital consists of three tiers of capital.     Tier 1 capital includes qualifying common     shareholders equity, CES, qualifying noncumulative     perpetual preferred stock, qualifying Trust Securities,     hybrid securities and qualifying non-controlling interests, less     goodwill and other adjustments. Tier 2 capital consists of     qualifying subordinated debt, a limited portion of the              208     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents             allowance for loan and lease losses, a portion of net unrealized     gains on AFS marketable equity securities and other adjustments.     Tier 3 capital includes subordinated debt that is     unsecured, fully paid, has an original maturity of at least two     years, is not redeemable before maturity without prior approval     by the Federal Reserve and includes a lock-in clause precluding     payment of either interest or principal if the payment would     cause the issuing banks risk-based capital ratio to fall     or remain below the required minimum. Tier 3 capital can     only be used to satisfy the Corporations market risk     capital requirement and may not be used to support its credit     risk requirement. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the     Corporation had no subordinated debt that qualified as     Tier 3 capital.       Certain corporate-sponsored trust companies which issue     Trust Securities are not consolidated. In accordance with     Federal Reserve guidance, Trust Securities continue to qualify     as Tier 1 capital with revised quantitative limits that     will be effective on March 31, 2011. As a result, the     Corporation includes Trust Securities in Tier 1     capital. The Financial Reform Act includes a provision under     which the Corporations previously issued and outstanding     Trust Securities in the aggregate amount of     $19.9 billion (approximately 137 bps of Tier 1     capital) at December 31, 2010, will no longer qualify as     Tier 1 capital effective January 1, 2013. This amount     excludes $1.6 billion of hybrid Trust Securities that     are expected to be converted to preferred stock prior to the     date of implementation. The exclusion of Trust Securities     from Tier 1 capital will be phased in incrementally over a     three-year phase-in period. The treatment of     Trust Securities during the phase-in period remains unclear     and is subject to future rulemaking.       Current limits restrict core capital elements to 15 percent     of total core capital elements for internationally active bank     holding companies. Internationally active bank holding companies     are those that have significant activities in     non-U.S. markets     with consolidated assets greater than $250 billion or     on-balance sheet     non-U.S. exposure     greater than $10 billion. In addition, the Federal Reserve     revised the qualitative standards for capital instruments     included in regulatory capital. At December 31, 2010, the     Corporations restricted core capital elements comprised     11.4 percent of total core capital elements. The     Corporation is and expects to remain fully compliant with the     revised limits.             To meet minimum, adequately capitalized regulatory requirements,     an institution must maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of four     percent and a Total capital ratio of eight percent. A     well-capitalized institution must generally maintain     capital ratios 200 bps higher than the minimum guidelines.     The risk-based capital rules have been further supplemented by a     Tier 1 leverage ratio, defined as Tier 1 capital     divided by quarterly average total assets, after certain     adjustments. Well-capitalized bank holding companies     must have a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of four percent.     National banks must maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at     least five percent to be classified as     well-capitalized. At December 31, 2010, the     Corporations Tier 1 capital, Total capital and     Tier 1 leverage ratios were 11.24 percent,     15.77 percent and 7.21 percent, respectively. This     classifies the Corporation as well-capitalized for     regulatory purposes, the highest classification.       Net unrealized gains or losses on AFS debt securities and     marketable equity securities, net unrealized gains and losses on     derivatives, and employee benefit plan adjustments in     shareholders equity are excluded from the calculations of     Tier 1 common capital as discussed below, Tier 1     capital and leverage ratios. The Total capital ratio excludes     all of the above with the exception of up to 45 percent of     the pre-tax net unrealized gains on AFS marketable equity     securities.       The Corporation calculates Tier 1 common capital as     Tier 1 capital including any CES less preferred stock,     qualifying Trust Securities, hybrid securities and     qualifying noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries. CES was     included in Tier 1 common capital based upon applicable     regulatory guidance and the expectation at December 31,     2009 that the underlying Common Equivalent Junior Preferred     Stock, Series S would convert into common stock following     shareholder approval of additional authorized shares.     Shareholders approved the increase in the number of authorized     shares of common stock and the Common Equivalent Stock converted     into common stock on February 24, 2010. Tier 1 common     capital was $125.1 billion and $120.4 billion and the     Tier 1 common capital ratio was 8.60 percent and     7.81 percent at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

While     economic capital is measured to cover unexpected losses, the     Corporation also manages regulatory capital to adhere to     regulatory standards of capital adequacy.       The Basel II Final Rule (Basel II Rules), which was     published on December 7, 2007, established requirements for     the U.S. implementation and provided detailed requirements     for a new regulatory capital framework related to credit and     operational risk (Pillar 1), supervisory requirements (Pillar     2) and disclosure requirements (Pillar 3). The Corporation     began Basel II parallel implementation on April 1,     2010.       Subsequently, amended rules issued by the Basel Committee on     Bank Supervision known as Basel III were published in     December 2010 along with final Market Risk Rules issued by the     Federal Reserve. The Basel III rules and the Financial     Reform Act seek to disqualify trust preferred securities and     other hybrid capital securities from Tier 1 capital     treatment with the Financial Reform Act proposing it to be     phased in over a period from 2013 to 2015. Basel III also     proposes the deduction of certain assets from capital (deferred     tax assets, MSRs, investments in financial firms and pension     assets, among others, within prescribed limitations certain of     which may be significant), increased capital for counterparty     credit risk, and three capital buffers to strengthen capital     levels which would be also phased in over time. The three     capital buffers include a capital conservation buffer, a     countercyclical buffer and a systematically important financial     institution buffer, which would result in a minimum Total     capital ratio of at least eight percent by 2013. Market Risk     Rules include additional VaR based measurements, among others,     that are meant to further strengthen capital levels. The     Corporation continues to monitor the development and potential     impact of these rules, and has determined that given current     initiatives and continued focus on all of these rules by the     date of full implementation in 2018, the Corporation must have a     Tier 1 common capital ratio of seven percent which it     anticipates it will meet. The Corporation does not expect the     need to issue any common stock to meet the new Basel proposals.       There remains significant uncertainty on the final impacts as     the U.S. has issued final rules only for Basel II and     a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the Market Risk Rules at     this time. Impacts may change as the U.S. finalizes rules     for Basel III and the regulatory agencies interpret the final     rules during the implementation process.      NOTE 19 Employee     Benefit Plans      Pension and     Postretirement Plans       The Corporation sponsors noncontributory trusteed pension plans     that cover substantially all officers and employees, a number of     noncontributory nonqualified pension plans, and postretirement     health and life plans. The plans provide defined benefits based     on an employees compensation and years of service. The     Bank of America Pension Plan (the Pension Plan) provides     participants with compensation credits, generally based on years     of service. For account balances based on compensation credits     prior to January 1, 2008, the Pension Plan allows     participants to select from various earnings measures, which are     based on the returns of certain funds or common stock of the     Corporation. The participant-selected earnings measures     determine the earnings rate on the individual participant     account balances in the Pension Plan. Participants may elect to     modify earnings measure allocations on a periodic basis subject     to the provisions of the Pension Plan. For account balances     based on compensation credits subsequent to December 31,     2007, the account balance earnings rate is based on a benchmark     rate. For eligible employees in the Pension Plan on or after     January 1, 2008, the benefits become vested upon completion     of three years of service. It is the           policy of the Corporation to fund not less than the minimum     funding amount required by ERISA.       The Pension Plan has a balance guarantee feature for account     balances with participant-selected earnings, applied at the time     a benefit payment is made from the plan that effectively     provides principal protection for participant balances     transferred and certain compensation credits. The Corporation is     responsible for funding any shortfall on the guarantee feature.       In May 2008, the Corporation and the IRS entered into a closing     agreement resolving all matters relating to an audit by the IRS     of the Pension Plan and the Bank of America 401(k) Plan. The     audit included a review of voluntary transfers by participants     of 401(k) Plan accounts to the Pension Plan. In connection with     the agreement, during 2009 the Pension Plan transferred     approximately $1.2 billion of assets and liabilities     associated with the transferred accounts to a newly established     defined contribution plan.       As a result of acquisitions, the Corporation assumed the     obligations related to the pension plans of FleetBoston, MBNA,     U.S. Trust Corporation, LaSalle and Countrywide. These     five acquired pension plans have been merged into a separate     defined benefit pension plan, which, together with the Pension     Plan, are referred to as the Qualified Pension Plans. The     benefit structures under these acquired plans have not changed     and remain intact in the merged plan. Certain benefit structures     are substantially similar to the Pension Plan discussed above;     however, certain of these structures do not allow participants     to select various earnings measures; rather the earnings rate is     based on a benchmark rate. In addition, these benefit structures     include participants with benefits determined under formulas     based on average or career compensation and years of service     rather than by reference to a pension account. Certain of the     other benefit structures provide participants retirement     benefits based on the number of years of benefit service and a     percentage of the participants average annual compensation     during the five highest paid consecutive years of the last ten     years of employment.       As a result of the Merrill Lynch acquisition, the Corporation     assumed the obligations related to the plans of Merrill Lynch.     These plans include a terminated U.S. pension plan,     non-U.S. pension     plans, nonqualified pension plans and postretirement plans. The     non-U.S.     pension plans vary based on the country and local practices. The     terminated U.S. pension plan is referred to as the Other     Pension Plan.       In 1988, Merrill Lynch purchased a group annuity contract that     guarantees the payment of benefits vested under the terminated     U.S. pension plan. The Corporation, under a supplemental     agreement, may be responsible for, or benefit from actual     experience and investment performance of the annuity assets. The     Corporation made no contribution in 2010 and contributed     $120 million during 2009 under this agreement. Additional     contributions may be required in the future under this agreement.       The Corporation sponsors a number of noncontributory,     nonqualified pension plans (the Nonqualified Pension Plans). As     a result of acquisitions, the Corporation assumed the     obligations related to the noncontributory, nonqualified pension     plans of certain legacy companies including Merrill Lynch. These     plans, which are unfunded, provide defined pension benefits to     certain employees.       In addition to retirement pension benefits, full-time, salaried     employees and certain part-time employees may become eligible to     continue participation as retirees in health care     and/or life     insurance plans sponsored by the Corporation. Based on the other     provisions of the individual plans, certain retirees may also     have the cost of these benefits partially paid by the     Corporation. The obligations assumed as a result of acquisitions     are substantially similar to the Corporations     postretirement health and life plans, except for Countrywide     which did not have a postretirement health and life plan.     Collectively, these plans are referred to as the Postretirement     Health and Life Plans.               210     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents             The table below summarizes the changes in the fair value of plan     assets, changes in the projected benefit obligation (PBO), the     funded status of both the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO)     and the PBO, and the weighted-average assumptions used to     determine benefit obligations for the pension plans and     postretirement plans at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Amounts     recognized at December 31, 2010 and 2009 are reflected in     other assets, and accrued expenses and other liabilities on the     Consolidated Balance Sheet. The discount rate assumption is     based on a cash flow matching           technique and is subject to change each year. This technique     utilizes yield curves that are based on Aa-rated corporate bonds     with cash flows that match estimated benefit payments of each of     the plans to produce the discount rate assumptions. The asset     valuation method for the Qualified Pension Plans recognizes     60 percent of the prior years market gains or losses     at the next measurement date with the remaining 40 percent     spread equally over the subsequent four years.

        The net periodic benefit cost (income) for each of the plans in     2010 and 2009 includes Merrill Lynch. The net periodic benefit     cost (income) of the Merrill Lynch Nonqualified and Other     Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans was     $(20) million and $18 million in 2009 using a blended     discount rate of 5.59 percent at January 1, 2009.       Net periodic postretirement health and life expense was     determined using the projected unit credit actuarial     method. Gains and losses for all benefits except postretirement     health care are recognized in accordance with the standard     amortization provisions of the applicable accounting guidance.     For the Postretirement Health Care Plans, 50 percent of the     unrecognized gain or           loss at the beginning of the fiscal year (or at subsequent     remeasurement) is recognized on a level basis during the year.       The discount rate and expected return on plan assets impact the     net periodic benefit cost (income) recorded for the plans. With     all other assumptions held constant, a 25-basis point decline in     the discount rate and expected return on plan assets would     result in an increase of approximately $50 million and     $41 million, respectively, for the Qualified Pension Plans.     For the     Non-U.S. Pension     Plans, the Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and     Postretirement Health and Life Plans, the 25-basis point decline     in rates would not have a significant impact.           212     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents               Assumed health care cost trend rates affect the postretirement     benefit obligation and benefit cost reported for the     Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The assumed health care     cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of benefits     covered by the Postretirement Health and Life Plans was     7.50 percent for 2011, reducing in steps to     5.00 percent in 2017 and later years. A     one-percentage-point increase in assumed health care cost trend     rates would have increased the service and interest costs and     the           benefit obligation by $4 million and $62 million in     2010. A one-percentage-point decrease in assumed health care     cost trend rates would have lowered the service and interest     costs and the benefit obligation by $4 million and     $58 million in 2010.

The     Corporations policy is to invest the trust assets in a     prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits     to participants and defraying reasonable expenses of     administration. The Corporations investment strategy is     designed to provide a total return that, over the long term,     increases the ratio of assets to liabilities. The strategy     attempts to maximize the investment return on assets at a level     of risk deemed appropriate by the Corporation while complying     with ERISA and any applicable regulations and laws. The     investment strategy utilizes asset allocation as a principal     determinant for establishing the risk/return profile of the     assets. Asset allocation ranges are established, periodically     reviewed and adjusted as funding levels and liability     characteristics change. Active and passive investment managers     are employed to help enhance the risk/return profile of the     assets. An additional aspect of the investment strategy used to     minimize risk (part of the asset allocation plan) includes     matching the equity exposure of participant-selected earnings     measures. For example, the common stock of the Corporation held     in the trust is maintained as an offset to the exposure related     to participants who elected to receive an earnings measure           based on the return performance of common stock of the     Corporation. No plan assets are expected to be returned to the     Corporation during 2011.       The assets of the     Non-U.S. Pension     Plans are primarily attributable to the U.K. pension plan. The     U.K. pension plans assets are invested prudently so that     the benefits promised to members are provided with consideration     given to the nature and the duration of the plans     liabilities. The current planned investment strategy was set     following an asset-liability study and advice from the     trustees investment advisors. The selected asset     allocation strategy is designed to achieve a higher return than     the lowest risk strategy while maintaining a prudent approach to     meeting the plans liabilities.       The Expected Return on Asset assumption (EROA assumption) was     developed through analysis of historical market returns,     historical asset class volatility and correlations, current     market conditions, anticipated future asset allocations, the     funds past experience, and expectations on potential     future market returns. The EROA assumption is determined using     the calculated market-related value for the Qualified Pension     Plans and the Other Pension Plan and the fair value for the     Non-U.S. Pension     Plans and Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The EROA     assumption represents a long-term average view of the     performance of the assets in the Qualified Pension Plans, the     Non-U.S. Pension     Plans, the Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health and     Life Plans, a return that may or may not be achieved during any     one              Bank of America     2010     213     Table of Contents             calendar year. Some of the building blocks used to arrive at the     long-term return assumption include an implied return from     equity securities of 8.75 percent, debt securities of     5.75 percent and real estate of 7.00 percent for the     Qualified Pension Plans, the     Non-U.S. Pension     Plans, the Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health and     Life Plans. The terminated U.S. pension plan is solely     invested in a group annuity contract which primarily invested in     fixed-           income securities structured such that asset maturities match     the duration of the plans obligations.

Defined     Contribution Plans       The Corporation maintains qualified defined contribution     retirement plans and nonqualified defined contribution     retirement plans. As a result of the Merrill Lynch acquisition,     the Corporation also maintains the defined contribution plans of     Merrill Lynch which include the 401(k) Savings &     Investment Plan, the Retirement and Accumulation Plan (RAP) and     the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). The Corporation     contributed approximately $670 million, $605 million     and $454 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in           cash, to the qualified defined contribution plans. At     December 31, 2010 and 2009, 208 million shares and     203 million shares of the Corporations common stock     were held by plans. Payments to the plans for dividends on     common stock were $8 million, $8 million and     $214 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.       In addition, certain     non-U.S. employees     within the Corporation are covered under defined contribution     pension plans that are separately administered in accordance     with local laws.               216     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents          NOTE 20 Stock-based     Compensation Plans        The Corporation administers a number of equity compensation     plans, including the Key Employee Stock Plan, the Key Associate     Stock Plan and the Merrill Lynch Employee Stock Compensation     Plan. Descriptions of the material features of the equity     compensation plans are below. Under these plans, the Corporation     grants long-term stock-based awards, including stock options,     restricted stock shares and RSUs. For 2010, restricted stock     awards generally vest in three equal annual installments     beginning one year from the grant date, with the exception of     certain awards to financial advisors that vest eight years from     the grant date, and an award of restricted stock shares that was     vested on the grant date but released from restrictions over     18 months.       For most awards, expense is generally recognized ratably over     the vesting period net of estimated forfeitures, unless the     associate meets certain retirement eligibility criteria. For     associate awards that meet retirement eligibility criteria, the     Corporation records the expense upon grant. For associates that     become retirement eligible during the vesting period, the     Corporation recognizes expense from the grant date to the date     on which the associate becomes retirement eligible, net of     estimated forfeitures. The compensation cost for the following     stock-based plans was $2.0 billion, $2.4 billion and     $885 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The     related income tax benefit was $727 million,     $892 million and $328 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008,     respectively.     Key Employee     Stock Plan       The Key Employee Stock Plan, as amended and restated, provided     for different types of awards including stock options,     restricted stock shares and RSUs. Under the plan,     10-year     options to purchase approximately 260 million shares of     common stock were granted through December 31, 2002 to     certain employees at the closing market price on the respective     grant dates. At December 31, 2010, approximately     36 million fully vested options were outstanding under this     plan. No further awards may be granted.     Key Associate     Stock Plan       The Key Associate Stock Plan became effective January 1,     2003. It provides for different types of long-term awards,     including stock options, restricted stock shares and RSUs. As of     December 31, 2010, the shareholders had authorized     approximately 1.1 billion shares for grant under this plan.     Additionally, any shares covered by awards under the Key     Employee Stock Plan or certain legacy company plans that cancel,     terminate, expire, lapse or settle in cash after a specified     date may be re-granted under the Key Associate Stock Plan.       In February 2010, the Corporation issued approximately     191 million RSUs to certain employees under the Key     Associate Stock Plan. These awards generally vest in three equal     annual installments beginning one year from the grant date.     Vested RSUs will be settled in cash unless the Corporation     authorizes settlement in common shares. Certain awards contain     clawback provisions which permit the Corporation to cancel all     or a portion of the award under specified circumstances. The     compensation cost for cash-settled awards and awards subject to     certain clawback provisions is accrued over the vesting period     and adjusted to fair value based upon changes in the share price     of the Corporations common stock. The compensation cost     for the remaining awards is fixed and based on the share price     of the common stock on the date of grant, or the date upon which     settlement in common stock has been authorized. The Corporation     hedges a portion of its exposure to variability in the expected     cash flows for unvested awards using a combination of economic     and cash flow hedges as described in Note 4      Derivatives. During 2010, the Corporation authorized     approximately 100 million RSUs to be settled in common     shares and terminated a portion of the corresponding economic     and cash flow hedges. As a result of the decision to     share-settle these RSUs, these share-settled RSUs are no longer     adjusted to fair value based upon changes in the share price of     the Corporations common stock.             At December 31, 2010, approximately 140 million     options were outstanding under this plan. There were no options     granted under this plan during 2010 or 2009.     Merrill Lynch     Employee Stock Compensation Plan       The Corporation assumed the Merrill Lynch Employee Stock     Compensation Plan. Shares can be granted under this plan in the     future. Approximately 34 million shares of RSUs were     granted in 2009 which generally vest in three equal annual     installments beginning one year from the grant date. Awards     granted prior to 2009 generally vest in four equal annual     installments beginning one year from the grant date. There were     no shares granted under this plan during 2010. At     December 31, 2010, there were approximately 28 million     shares outstanding.     Other Stock     Plans       As a result of the Merrill Lynch acquisition, the Corporation     assumed the obligations of outstanding awards granted under the     Merrill Lynch Financial Advisor Capital Accumulation Award Plans     (FACAAP) and the Merrill Lynch Employee Stock Purchase Plan     (ESPP). The FACAAP is no longer an active plan and no awards     were granted in 2010 or 2009. Awards granted in 2003 and     thereafter are generally payable eight years from the grant date     in a fixed number of the Corporations common stock. For     outstanding awards granted prior to 2003, payment is generally     made ten years from the grant date in a fixed number of the     Corporations common shares unless the fair value of such     shares is less than a specified minimum value, in which case the     minimum value is paid in cash. At December 31, 2010, there     were 18 million shares outstanding under this plan.       The ESPP allows eligible associates to invest from one percent     to 10 percent of eligible compensation to purchase the     Corporations common stock, subject to legal limits.     Purchases were made at a discount of up to five percent of the     average high and low market price on the relevant purchase date     and the maximum annual contribution per employee was $23,750 in     2010. Up to 107 million shares have been authorized for     issuance under the ESPP in 2010. There were 12 million     shares available at January 1, 2010 and 3 million     shares purchased during the year. There were 9 million     shares available at December 31, 2010.       The weighted-average fair value of the ESPP stock purchase     rights (i.e., the five percent discount on the     Corporations common stock purchases) exercised by     employees in 2010 is $0.80 per stock purchase right.     Restricted     Stock/Unit Details       The following table presents the status of the share-settled     restricted stock/unit awards at December 31, 2010 and     changes during 2010.

The total fair value     of restricted stock vested in 2010 was $2.4 billion. In     2010, the amount of cash used to settle equity instruments was     $186 million.

At December 31, 2010, there was no aggregate intrinsic     value of options outstanding, exercisable, and vested and     expected to vest. The weighted-average remaining contractual     term of options outstanding was 3.0 years, options     exercisable was 3.0 years, and options vested and expected     to vest was 3.1 years at December 31, 2010. These     remaining contractual terms are similar because options have not     been granted since 2008 and they generally vest in three years.       The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted in     2008 was $8.92. No options were granted in 2010 or 2009.       The table below presents the assumptions used to estimate the     fair value of stock options granted on the date of grant using     the lattice option-pricing model for 2008. No stock options were     granted in 2010 or 2009. Lattice option-pricing models     incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs and those ranges     are disclosed in the table below. The risk-free interest rate     for periods within the contractual life of the stock option is     based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the     time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on implied     volatilities from traded stock options on the Corporations     common stock, historical volatility of the Corporations     common stock, and other factors. The Corporation uses historical     data to estimate stock option exercise and employee termination     within the model. The expected term of stock options granted is     derived from the output of the model and represents the period     of time that stock options granted are expected to be     outstanding. The estimates of fair value from these models are     theoretical values for stock options and changes in the     assumptions used in the models could result in materially     different fair value estimates. The actual value of the stock     options will depend on the market value of the     Corporations common stock when the stock options are     exercised.                                           2008               Risk-free interest rate                2.05  3.85       %          Dividend yield                5.3              Expected volatility                26.00  36.00              Weighted-average volatility                32.8              Expected lives (years)                6.6                                              Excluded from the previous table are assumptions used to     estimate the fair value of 108 million stock options     assumed in connection with the Merrill Lynch acquisition with an     aggregate fair value of $1.1 billion. The fair value of     these awards was estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing     model. Similar to options valued using the lattice     option-pricing model described above, key assumptions used     include the implied volatility based on the Corporations     common stock of 75 percent, the risk-free interest rate     based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at     December 31, 2008, an expected dividend yield of     4.2 percent and the expected life of the options based on     their actual remaining term.

As a result of these tax     effects, accumulated OCI decreased $3.2 billion and     $1.6 billion in 2010 and 2009, and increased     $5.9 billion in 2008. In addition, total income tax expense     (benefit) does not reflect tax effects associated with the     Corporations employee stock plans which decreased common     stock and additional paid-in capital $98 million,     $295 million and $9 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008,     respectively.             218     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents             Income tax expense (benefit) for 2010, 2009 and 2008 varied from     the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rate to     income (loss) before income taxes. A reconciliation between the     expected U.S. federal           income tax expense using the federal statutory tax rate of     35 percent to the Corporations actual income tax     expense (benefit) and resulting effective tax rate for 2010,     2009 and 2008 is presented in the table below.                                                                                                          2010               2009               2008         (Dollars in millions)            Amount           Percent               Amount               Percent               Amount               Percent               Expected U.S. federal income tax expense (benefit)        $   (463   )           35.0   %           $       1,526                   35.0       %           $       1,550                   35.0       %          Increase (decrease) in taxes resulting from:                                                                                                           State tax expense (benefit), net of federal effect            233               (17.6   )               (42       )               (1.0       )               27                   0.6              Goodwill impairment and other            4,508               (341.0   )                                                                                      U.K. corporate tax rate reduction            392               (29.7   )                                                                                      Nondeductible expenses            99               (7.5   )               69                   1.6                   79                   1.8              Leveraged lease tax differential            98               (7.4   )               59                   1.4                   216                   4.9              Change in federal deferred tax asset valuation allowance            (1,657   )           125.4                   (650       )               (14.9       )                                                Tax-exempt income, including dividends            (981   )           74.2                   (863       )               (19.8       )               (631       )               (14.3       )          Low income housing credits/other credits            (732   )           55.4                   (668       )               (15.3       )               (722       )               (16.3       )      Non-U.S. tax     differential            (190   )           14.4                   (709       )               (16.3       )               (192       )               (4.3       )          Changes in prior period UTBs (including interest)            (349   )           26.4                   87                   2.0                   169                   3.8              Loss on certain     non-U.S.     subsidiary stock                                              (595       )               (13.7       )                                                Other            (43   )           3.2                   (130       )               (3.0       )               (76       )               (1.7       )                                                                                                            Total income tax expense     (benefit)        $   915               (69.2   )%           $       (1,916       )               (44.0       )%           $       420                   9.5       %                                                                                                                        The reconciliation of the beginning unrecognized tax benefits     (UTB) balance to the ending balance is presented in the table     below.

Included     in the UTB balance are some items the recognition of which would     not affect the effective tax rate, such as the tax effect of     certain temporary differences, the portion of gross state UTBs     that would be offset by the tax benefit of the associated     federal deduction and the portion of gross     non-U.S. UTBs     that would be offset by tax reductions in other jurisdictions.       The Corporation is under examination by the IRS and other tax     authorities in countries and states in which it has significant     business operations. The table below summarizes the status of     significant examinations for the Corporation and various     acquired subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010.

(2)   The     2001-2002 years     in Appeals process relate to the separate returns of a     subsidiary.                        In addition to the above examinations, the Corporation is in the     process of appealing an adverse decision by the U.S. Tax     Court with respect to a 1987 Merrill Lynch transaction. The     income tax associated with this matter has been remitted and is     included in the UTB balance above.       The IRS proposed adjustments for two issues in the audit of     Merrill Lynch for the tax year 2004 which have been protested to     the Appeals Office. The issues involve eligibility for the     dividends received deduction and foreign tax credits with     respect to a structured investment transaction. The Corporation     also intends to protest any adjustments the IRS proposes for     these same issues in tax years 2005 through 2007. The IRS has     proposed similar adjustments in the Bank of America Corporation     audit cycles currently in the Appeals process and is expected to     propose further adjustments disallowing foreign tax credits     related to certain structured investment transactions. The     Corporation intends to protest these adjustments in all relevant     tax years.       The Corporation files income tax returns in more than     100 state and     non-U.S. jurisdictions     each year and is under continuous examination by various state     and     non-U.S. taxing     authorities. While many of these examinations are resolved every     year, the Corporation does not anticipate that resolutions     occurring within the next twelve months will result in a     material change to the Corporations financial position.       Considering all U.S. federal and     non-U.S. examinations,     it is reasonably possible that the UTB balance will decrease by     as much as $1.0 billion during the next twelve months,     since resolved items will be removed from the balance whether     their resolution resulted in payment or recognition.           Bank of America     2010     219     Table of Contents               During 2010 and 2009, the Corporation recognized in income tax     expense $99 million and $184 million of interest and     penalties,     net-of-tax.     At both December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Corporations     accrual for interest and penalties that related to income taxes,     net of taxes and remittances, was $1.1 billion.

On July 1, 2010,     the Corporation adopted new accounting guidance on embedded     credit derivatives and the related fair value option election     and the transition adjustment included an increase of     $128 million in retained earnings which is offset against     net deferred tax assets.       The U.S. federal deferred tax asset excludes     $56 million related to certain employee stock plan     deductions that will be recognized and will increase additional     paid-in capital when realized.

Due to     change-in-control     limitations in the three years prior to and following the change     in ownership, this unlimited carryforward period may be     jeopardized by certain major changes in the nature or conduct of     the U.K. businesses.         (2)     The NOL and related valuation     allowance for U.S. states before considering the benefit of     federal deductions were $3.4 billion and $1.3 billion.                    The Corporation concluded that no valuation allowance is     necessary to reduce the U.K. NOL, U.S. NOL and general     business credit carryforwards since estimated future taxable     income will be sufficient to utilize these assets prior to their     expiration. With the acquisition of Merrill Lynch on     January 1, 2009, the Corporation established a valuation     allowance to reduce certain other deferred tax assets to the     amount more-likely-than-not to be realized before their     expiration. During 2010 and 2009, the Corporation released     $1.7 billion and $650 million of the valuation     allowance attributable to Merrill Lynchs capital loss     carryforward due to utilization against net capital gains     realized in 2010 and 2009. The valuation allowance also     increased due primarily to increases in operating loss     carryforwards generated in certain state jurisdictions for which     management believes it is more-likely-than-not that realization     of these assets will not occur.       At December 31, 2010 and 2009, U.S. federal income     taxes had not been provided on $17.9 billion and     $16.7 billion of undistributed earnings of     non-U.S. subsidiaries     earned prior to 1987 and after 1997 that have been reinvested     for an indefinite period of time. If the earnings were     distributed, an additional $2.6 billion and     $2.5 billion of tax expense, net of credits for     non-U.S. taxes     paid on such earnings and for the related     non-U.S. withholding     taxes, would have resulted as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.      NOTE 22 Fair     Value Measurements        Under applicable accounting guidance, fair value is defined as     the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid     to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most     advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly     transaction between market participants on the measurement date.     The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial     instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established under     applicable accounting guidance which requires an entity to     maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of     unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three     levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. For     more information regarding the fair value hierarchy and how the     Corporation measures fair value, see Note 1      Summary of Significant Accounting Principles. The     Corporation accounts for certain corporate loans and loan     commitments, LHFS, structured reverse repurchase agreements,     long-term deposits and long-term debt under the fair value     option. For more informations, see Note 23      Fair Value Option.     Level 1, 2     and 3 Valuation Techniques       Financial instruments are considered Level 1 when the     valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for     identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 financial     instruments are valued using quoted prices for similar assets or     liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or     models using inputs that are observable or can be corroborated     by observable market data for substantially the full term of the     assets or liabilities. Financial instruments are considered     Level 3 when their values are determined using pricing     models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar     techniques, and at least one significant model assumption or     input is unobservable and when determination of the fair value     requires significant management judgment or estimation.       The Corporation uses market indices for direct inputs to certain     models where the cash settlement is directly linked to     appreciation or depreciation of that particular index (primarily     in the context of structured credit products). In those cases,     no material adjustments are made to the index-based values. In     other cases, the use of market indices is inherently limited     because the fair value of an individual position being valued     may not move in tandem with changes in fair value of a specific     market index. Accordingly, market indices are used as inputs to     the valuation, but are adjusted for trade specific factors such     as rating, credit quality, vintage and other factors.           220     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents           Trading Account     Assets and Liabilities and     Available-for-Sale     Debt Securities       The fair values of trading account assets and liabilities are     primarily based on actively traded markets where prices are     based on either direct market quotes or observed transactions.     The fair values of AFS debt securities are generally based on     quoted market prices or market prices for similar assets.     Liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the     fair values of trading account assets and liabilities and AFS     debt securities. Market price quotes may not be readily     available for some positions, or positions within a market     sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or     ceased. Some of these instruments are valued using a discounted     cash flow model, which estimates the fair value of the     securities using internal credit risk, interest rate and     prepayment risk models that incorporate managements best     estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss     severity and prepayment rates. Principal and interest cash flows     are discounted using an observable discount rate for similar     instruments with adjustments that management believes a market     participant would consider in determining fair value for the     specific security. Others are valued using a net asset value     approach which considers the value of the underlying securities.     Underlying assets are valued using external pricing services,     where available, or matrix pricing based on the vintages and     ratings. Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by     the markets perception of credit uncertainty regarding a     single company or a specific market sector. In these instances,     fair value is determined based on limited available market     information and other factors, principally from reviewing the     issuers financial statements and changes in credit ratings     made by one or more ratings agencies.     Derivative Assets     and Liabilities       The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in     the     over-the-counter     (OTC) market are determined using quantitative models that     utilize multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices     and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and     volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market     inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external     sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party     pricing services. Estimation risk is greater for derivative     asset and liability positions that are either option-based or     have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are     less readily available or are unobservable, in which case,     quantitative-based extrapolations of rate, price or index     scenarios are used in determining fair values. The fair values     of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for     market liquidity, counterparty credit quality and other deal     specific factors, where appropriate. The Corporation     incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC     derivatives the net credit differential between the counterparty     credit risk and the Corporations own credit risk. An     estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination     of fair value, primarily based on market data.     Corporate Loans     and Loan Commitments       The fair values of loans and loan commitments are based on     market prices, where available, or discounted cash flow analyses     using market-based credit spreads of comparable debt instruments     or credit derivatives of the specific borrower or comparable     borrowers. Results of discounted cash flow calculations may be     adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect other market conditions or     the perceived credit risk of the borrower.     Mortgage     Servicing Rights       The fair values of MSRs are determined using models that rely on     estimates of prepayment rates, the resultant weighted-average     lives of the MSRs and           the OAS levels. For more information on MSRs, see     Note 25  Mortgage Servicing Rights.     Loans     Held-for-Sale       The fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market prices, where     available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows     using interest rates approximating the Corporations     current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect     the inherent credit risk.     Other     Assets       The fair values of AFS marketable equity securities are     generally based on quoted market prices or market prices for     similar assets. However, non-public investments are initially     valued at the transaction price and subsequently adjusted when     evidence is available to support such adjustments.     Securities     Financing Agreements       The fair values of certain reverse repurchase agreements,     repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are     determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash     flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs     including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous     yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of     market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through     external sources, including brokers, market transactions and     third-party pricing services.     Deposits,     Commercial Paper and Other Short-term Borrowings       The fair values of deposits, commercial paper and other     short-term borrowings are determined using quantitative models,     including discounted cash flow models that require the use of     multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to     generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility     factors. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and     can be validated through external sources, including brokers,     market transactions and third-party pricing services. The     Corporation considers the impact of its own credit spreads in     the valuation of these liabilities. The credit risk is     determined by reference to observable credit spreads in the     secondary cash market.     Long-term     Borrowings       The Corporation issues structured notes that have coupons or     repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity     securities, indices, currencies or commodities. The fair value     of structured notes is estimated using valuation models for the     combined derivative and debt portions of the notes accounted for     under the fair value option. These models incorporate observable     and, in some instances, unobservable inputs including security     prices, interest rate yield curves, option volatility, currency,     commodity or equity rates and correlations between these inputs.     The impact of the Corporations own credit spreads is also     included based on the Corporations observed secondary bond     market spreads.     Asset-backed     Secured Financings       The fair values of asset-backed secured financings are based on     external broker bids, where available, or are determined by     discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates     approximating the Corporations current origination rates     for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk.

(2)   Net derivatives at     December 31, 2010 include derivative assets of     $18.8 billion and derivative liabilities of     $11.0 billion.         (3)   Amounts represent items which are     accounted for under the fair value option.         (4)   Other assets is primarily comprised     of AFS marketable equity securities.                   During 2010, the more significant transfers into Level 3     included $3.2 billion of trading account assets,     $3.5 billion of AFS debt securities, $1.1 billion of     net derivative contracts and $1.9 billion of long-term     debt. Transfers into Level 3 for trading account assets     were driven by reduced price transparency as a result of lower     levels of trading activity for certain municipal auction rate     securities and corporate debt securities as well as a change in     valuation methodology for certain ABS to a discounted cash flow     model. Transfers into Level 3 for AFS debt securities were     due to an increase in the number of non-agency RMBS and other     taxable securities priced using a discounted cash flow model.     Transfers into Level 3 for net derivative contracts were     primarily related to a lack of price observability for certain     credit default and total return           swaps. Transfers in and transfers out of Level 3 for     long-term debt are primarily due to changes in the impact of     unobservable inputs on the value of certain equity-linked     structured notes.       During 2010, the more significant transfers out of Level 3     were $3.4 billion of trading account assets and     $1.8 billion of long-term debt. Transfers out of     Level 3 for trading account assets were driven by increased     price verification of certain mortgage-backed securities,     corporate debt and     non-U.S. government     and agency securities. Transfers out of Level 3 for     long-term debt were the result of a decrease in the significance     of unobservable pricing inputs for certain equity-linked     structured notes.               224

NOTE 23 Fair     Value Option      Corporate Loans     and Loan Commitments       The Corporation elected to account for certain large corporate     loans and loan commitments which exceeded the Corporations     single name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair     value option. Lending commitments, both funded and unfunded, are     actively managed and monitored and, as appropriate, credit risk     for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use     of credit derivatives, with the Corporations public side     credit view and market perspectives determining the size and     timing of the hedging activity. These credit derivatives do not     meet the requirements for derivatives designated as accounting     hedges and therefore are carried at fair value with changes in     fair value recorded in other income (loss). Electing the fair     value option allows the Corporation to carry these loans and     loan commitments at fair value, which is more consistent with     managements view of the underlying economics and the     manner in which they are managed. In addition, accounting for     these loans and loan commitments at fair value reduces the     accounting asymmetry that would otherwise result from carrying     the loans at historical cost and the credit derivatives at fair     value.     Loans     Held-for-Sale       The Corporation elected to account for certain LHFS at fair     value. Electing the fair value option allows a better offset of     the changes in fair values of the           loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge     them. The Corporation has not elected to account for other LHFS     under the fair value option primarily because these loans are     floating-rate loans that are not economically hedged using     derivative instruments. Residential mortgage LHFS, commercial     mortgage LHFS and other LHFS are accounted for under the fair     value option with interest income on these LHFS recorded in     other interest income. The changes in fair value are largely     offset by hedging activities. An immaterial portion of these     amounts was attributable to changes in instrument-specific     credit risk.     Other     Assets       The Corporation elected to account for certain other assets     under the fair value option including private equity investments.     Securities     Financing Agreements       The Corporation elected to account for certain securities     financing agreements, including resale and repurchase     agreements, under the fair value option based on the tenor of     the agreements, which reflects the magnitude of the interest     rate risk. The majority of securities financing agreements     collateralized by U.S. government securities were excluded     from the fair value option election as these contracts are     generally short-dated and therefore the interest rate risk is     not significant.     Long-term     Deposits       The Corporation elected to account for certain long-term     fixed-rate and rate-linked deposits, which are economically     hedged with derivatives, under the fair value option. Election     of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the     accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the     accounting asymmetry created by accounting for the financial     instruments at historical cost and the economic hedges at fair     value. The Corporation did not elect to carry other long-term     deposits at fair value because they were not economically hedged     using derivatives.     Commercial Paper     and Other Short-term Borrowings       The Corporation elected to account for certain commercial paper     and other short-term borrowings under the fair value option.     This debt is risk-managed on a fair value basis.     Long-term     Debt       The Corporation elected to account for certain long-term debt,     primarily structured notes that were acquired as part of the     Merrill Lynch acquisition, under the fair value option. This     long-term debt is risk-managed on a fair value basis. Election     of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the     accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the     accounting asymmetry created by accounting for these financial     instruments at historical cost and the related economic hedges     at fair value.     Asset-backed     Secured Financings       The Corporation elected to account for certain asset-backed     secured financings that were acquired as part of the Countrywide     acquisition, which are classified in commercial paper and other     short-term borrowings, under the fair value option. Election of     the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the     accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the     accounting asymmetry created by accounting for the asset-backed     secured financings at historical cost and the corresponding     mortgage LHFS securing these financings at fair value.               230     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents          The table below provides information about the fair value     carrying amount and the contractual principal outstanding of     assets or liabilities accounted for under the fair value option     at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Contents             NOTE 24 Fair     Value of Financial Instruments        The fair values of financial instruments have been derived using     methodologies described in Note 22  Fair     Value Measurements. The following disclosures include     financial instruments where only a portion of the ending     balances at December 31, 2010 and 2009 is carried at fair     value on the Corporations Consolidated Balance Sheet.     Short-term     Financial Instruments       The carrying value of short-term financial instruments,     including cash and cash equivalents, time deposits placed,     federal funds sold and purchased, resale and certain repurchase     agreements, commercial paper and other short-term investments     and borrowings approximates the fair value of these instruments.     These financial instruments generally expose the Corporation to     limited credit risk and have no stated maturities or have     short-term maturities and carry interest rates that approximate     market. The Corporation elected to account for certain     structured reverse repurchase agreements under the fair value     option.     Loans       Fair values were generally determined by discounting both     principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected using     an observable discount rate for similar instruments with     adjustments that the Corporation believes a market participant     would consider in determining fair value. The Corporation     estimates the cash flows expected to be collected using internal     credit risk, interest rate and prepayment risk models that     incorporate the Corporations best estimate of current key     assumptions, such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment     speeds for the life of the loan. The carrying value of loans is     presented net of the applicable allowance for loan and lease     losses and excludes leases. The Corporation elected to account     for certain large corporate loans which exceeded the     Corporations single name credit risk concentration     guidelines under the fair value option.     Deposits       The fair value for certain deposits with stated maturities was     determined by discounting contractual cash flows using current     market rates for instruments with similar maturities. The     carrying value of     non-U.S. time     deposits approximates fair value. For deposits with no stated     maturities, the carrying amount was considered to approximate     fair value and does not take into account the significant value     of the cost advantage and stability of the Corporations     long-term relationships with depositors. The Corporation     accounts for certain long-term fixed-rate deposits which are     economically hedged with derivatives under the fair value option.     Long-term     Debt       The Corporation uses quoted market prices, when available, to     estimate fair value for its long-term debt. When quoted market     prices are not available, fair value is estimated based on     current market interest rates and credit spreads for debt with     similar terms and maturities. The Corporation accounts for     certain structured notes under the fair value option.         Fair Value of     Financial Instruments       The carrying values and fair values of certain financial     instruments that are not carried at fair value at     December 31, 2010 and 2009 are presented in the table below.

The Corporation economically     hedges these MSRs with certain derivatives and securities     including MBS and U.S. Treasuries. The securities that     economically hedge the MSRs are classified in other assets with     changes in the fair value of the securities and the related     interest income recorded in mortgage banking income.       The table below presents activity for residential first mortgage     MSRs for 2010 and 2009.

The Corporation uses an OAS valuation approach to determine the     fair value of MSRs which factors in prepayment risk. This     approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under     multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash     flows using risk-adjusted discount rates. The key economic     assumptions used in determining the fair value of MSRs at     December 31, 2010 and 2009 are presented below.

These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with     caution. As the amounts indicate, changes in fair value based on     variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated     because the relationship of the change in assumption to the     change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a     variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of MSRs     that continue to be held by the Corporation is calculated     without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in     one factor may result in changes in another, which might magnify     or counteract the sensitivities. The below sensitivities do not     reflect any hedge strategies that may be undertaken to mitigate     such risk.       Commercial and residential reverse mortgage MSRs, which are     carried at the lower of cost or market value and accounted for     using the amortization method, totaled $278 million and     $309 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and are     not included in the table below.

Effective     January 1, 2010, the Corporation realigned the Global     Corporate and Investment Banking portion of the former Global     Banking business segment with the former Global Markets     business segment to form GBAM and to reflect     Global Commercial Banking as a standalone segment. In     addition, the Corporation may periodically reclassify business     segment results based on modifications to its management     reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment.     Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to     current period presentation.     Deposits   Deposits includes the results of consumer deposits     activities which consist of a comprehensive range of products     provided to consumers and small businesses. In addition,     Deposits includes an allocation of ALM activities.     Deposit products include traditional savings accounts, money     market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, and noninterest- and     interest-bearing checking accounts. These products provide a     relatively stable source of funding and liquidity. The     Corporation earns net interest spread revenue from investing     this liquidity in earning assets through client-facing lending     and ALM activities. The revenue is allocated to the deposit     products using a funds transfer pricing           process which takes into account the interest rates and maturity     characteristics of the deposits. Deposits also generates     fees such as account service fees, non-sufficient funds fees,     overdraft charges and ATM fees. In addition, Deposits     includes the net impact of migrating customers and their     related deposit balances between GWIM and     Deposits. Subsequent to the date of migration, the     associated net interest income, service charges and noninterest     expense are recorded in the business to which deposits were     transferred.     Global Card     Services   Global Card Services provides a broad offering of     products including U.S. consumer and business card,     consumer lending, international card and debit card to consumers     and small businesses. The Corporation reports its Global Card     Services current period results in accordance with new     consolidation guidance that was effective on January 1,     2010. Under this new consolidation guidance, the Corporation     consolidated all previously unconsolidated credit card trusts.     Accordingly, current year results are comparable to prior year     results that were presented on a managed basis, which was     consistent with the way that management evaluated the results of     the business. Managed basis assumed that securitized loans were     not sold and presented earnings on these loans in a manner     similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held     loans) are presented. Loan securitization is an alternative     funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify     funding sources. Global Card Services managed income     statement line items differ from a held basis as follows:     managed net interest income includes Global Card Services     net interest income on held loans and interest income on the     securitized loans less the internal funds transfer pricing     allocation related to securitized loans; managed noninterest     income includes Global Card Services noninterest income     on a held basis less the reclassification of certain components     of card income (e.g., excess servicing income) to record     securitized net interest income and provision for credit losses;     and provision for credit losses represents the provision for     credit losses on held loans combined with realized credit losses     associated with the securitized loan portfolio.     Home     Loans & Insurance   Home Loans & Insurance provides an extensive     line of consumer real estate products and services to customers     nationwide. Home Loans & Insurance products     include fixed and adjustable-rate first-lien mortgage loans for     home purchase and refinancing needs, reverse mortgages, home     equity lines of credit and home equity loans. First mortgage     products are either sold into the secondary mortgage market to     investors while retaining MSRs and the Bank of America customer     relationships, or are held on the Corporations     Consolidated Balance Sheet for ALM purposes and reported in     All Other. Home Loans & Insurance is not     impacted by the Corporations first mortgage production     retention decisions as Home Loans & Insurance     is compensated for the decision on a management accounting     basis with a corresponding offset recorded in All Other.     Funded home equity lines of credit and home equity loans are     held on the Corporations Consolidated Balance Sheet. In     addition, Home Loans & Insurance offers     property, casualty, life, disability and credit insurance.     Home Loans & Insurance also includes the impact     of migrating customers and their related loan balances between     GWIM and Home Loans & Insurance based on     client segmentation thresholds. Subsequent to the date of     migration, the associated net interest income and noninterest     expense are recorded in the business segment to which loans were     transferred.               Bank of America     2010     233     Table of Contents           Global Commercial     Banking   Global Commercial Banking provides a wide range of     lending-related products and services, integrated working     capital management and treasury solutions to clients through the     Corporations network of offices and client relationship     teams along with various product partners.

GWIM also provides retirement     and benefit plan services, philanthropic management and asset     management to individual and institutional clients. In addition,     GWIM includes the results of BofA Capital Management, the     cash and liquidity asset management business that the     Corporation retained following the sale of the Columbia     long-term asset management business, and other miscellaneous     items. GWIM also reflects the impact of migrating clients     and their related deposit and loan balances to or from GWIM     and Deposits, Home Loans & Insurance and     the Corporations ALM activities. Subsequent to the date of     migration, the associated net interest income, noninterest     income and noninterest expense are recorded in the business to     which the clients migrated.     All     Other   All Other consists of equity investment activities     including Global Principal Investments, Strategic Investments,     the residential mortgage portfolio associated with ALM     activities, the impact of the cost allocation processes, merger           and restructuring charges, intersegment eliminations, and the     results of certain businesses that are expected to be or have     been sold or are in the process of being liquidated. All     Other also includes certain amounts associated with ALM     activities, amounts associated with the change in the value of     derivatives used as economic hedges of interest rate and foreign     exchange rate fluctuations, the impact of foreign exchange rate     fluctuations related to revaluation of foreign     currency-denominated debt, fair value adjustments related to     certain structured notes, certain gains (losses) on sales of     whole mortgage loans, gains (losses) on sales of debt     securities, OTTI write-downs on certain AFS securities and for     periods prior to January 1, 2010, a securitization offset     which removed the securitization impact of sold loans in     Global Card Services in order to present the consolidated     results of the Corporation on a GAAP basis (i.e., held basis).     Basis of     Presentation       The management accounting and reporting process derives segment     and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for     revenue and expense. The net income derived for the businesses     is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an     activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other     methodologies and assumptions management believes are     appropriate to reflect the results of the business.       Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest     income on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis and noninterest     income. The adjustment of net interest income to a FTE basis     results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The     segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense     methodologies that are utilized to determine net income. The net     interest income of the businesses includes the results of a     funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and     liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity     characteristics. For presentation purposes, in segments where     the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are     generally deposit-taking segments, the Corporation allocates     assets to match liabilities. Net interest income of the business     segments also includes an allocation of net interest income     generated by the Corporations ALM activities.       The Corporations ALM activities include an overall     interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use     of interest rate contracts to manage fluctuations in earnings     that are caused by interest rate volatility. The     Corporations goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity     so that movements in interest rates do not significantly     adversely affect net interest income. The Corporations ALM     activities are allocated to the business segments and fluctuate     based on performance. ALM activities include external product     pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the     effects of the Corporations internal funds transfer     pricing process and the net effects of other ALM activities.       Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific     business segment are allocated to the segments. The most     significant of these expenses include data and item processing     costs and certain centralized or shared functions. Data     processing costs are allocated to the segments based on     equipment usage. Item processing costs are allocated to the     segments based on the volume of items processed for each     segment. The costs of certain centralized or shared functions     are allocated based on methodologies that reflect utilization.               234     Bank     of America 2010          Table of Contents          The following tables present total revenue, net of interest     expense, on a FTE basis and net income (loss) for 2010, 2009 and     2008, and total assets at December 31, 2010 and 2009 for     each business segment, as well as All Other.

          Bank of America     2010     239     Table of Contents       NOTE 28 Performance     by Geographical Area        Since the Corporations operations are highly integrated,     certain asset, liability, income and expense amounts must be     allocated to arrive at total assets, total revenue, net of     interest expense, income (loss) before income taxes and net     income (loss) by geographic area. The Corporation identifies its     geographic performance based on the business unit structure used     to manage the capital or expense deployed in the region as     applicable. This requires certain judgments related to the     allocation of revenue so that revenue can be appropriately     matched with the related expense or capital deployed in the     region.

Changes     in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and     Financial Disclosure        There were no changes in or disagreements with accountants on     accounting and financial disclosure.           Item 9A.    Controls     And Procedures       Disclosure     Controls and Procedures       As of the end of the period covered by this report and pursuant     to     Rule 13a-15     of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), Bank of     Americas           management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief     Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness     and design of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that     term is defined in     Rule 13a-15(e)     of the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, Bank of     Americas Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial     Officer concluded that Bank of Americas disclosure     controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the     period covered by this report, in recording, processing,     summarizing and reporting information required to be disclosed,     within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and     forms.               Bank of America     2010     241     Table of Contents    Report     of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm             To the Board of     Directors of Bank of America Corporation:       We have examined, based on criteria established in Internal     Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee     of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, Bank of     America Corporations (the Corporation)     assertion, included under Item 9A, that the     Corporations disclosure controls and procedures were     effective as of December 31, 2010 (Managements     Assertion). Disclosure controls and procedures mean     controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to     ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in     reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange     Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported     within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange     Commissions rules and forms, and that information required     to be disclosed by an issuer in reports that it files or submits     under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and     communicated to the issuers management, including its     principal executive and principal financial officer, or persons     performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely     decisions regarding required disclosure. The Corporations     management is responsible for maintaining effective disclosure     controls and procedures and for Managements Assertion of     the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures. Our     responsibility is to express an opinion on Managements     Assertion based on our examination.       There are inherent limitations to disclosure controls and     procedures. Because of these inherent limitations, effective     disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable     assurance of achieving the intended objectives. Disclosure     controls and procedures may not prevent, or detect and correct,     material misstatements, and they may not identify all     information relating to the Corporation to be accumulated and     communicated to the Corporations management to allow     timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Also,     projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods           are subject to the risk that disclosure controls and procedures     may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that     the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may     deteriorate.       We conducted our examination in accordance with attestation     standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight     Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and     perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about     whether effective disclosure controls and procedures were     maintained in all material respects. Our examination included     obtaining an understanding of the Corporations disclosure     controls and procedures and testing and evaluating the design     and operating effectiveness of the Corporations disclosure     controls and procedures based on the assessed risk. Our     examination also included performing such other procedures as we     considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our     examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our     examination was not conducted for the purpose of expressing an     opinion, and accordingly we express no opinion, on the accuracy     or completeness of the Corporations disclosures in its     reports, or whether such disclosures comply with the rules and     regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.       In our opinion, Managements Assertion that the     Corporations disclosure controls and procedures were     effective as of December 31, 2010 is fairly stated, in all     material respects, based on criteria established in Internal     Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee     of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

The Report of our Independent Registered Public     Accounting Firm with respect to the Corporations internal     control over financial reporting is set forth on page 136     and incorporated herein by reference.     Changes in     Internal Control Over Financial Reporting       There have been no changes in our internal control over     financial reporting (as defined in     Rule 13a-15(f)     of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31,     2010, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to     materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.           Item 9B.    Other     Information         On February 24, 2011, the Board approved amendments to the     Corporations Bylaws that provide for the number of     directors to be established by resolution of the Board as well     as other non-substantive changes, such as updating the names of     the Board committees. The prior Bylaw provision stated that the     number of directors would be no less than five nor more than 30     with the minimum and maximum to be established by the Board. The     description of the           Amended and Restated Bylaws does not purport to be complete and     is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended and     Restated Bylaws, which are attached as Exhibit 3(b) to this     report.       On February 24, 2011, the company and Brian T. Moynihan,     President and Chief Executive Officer, entered into a     non-exclusive aircraft time sharing agreement (the     Agreement), which will permit Mr. Moynihan to     lease the companys aircraft for his use. Mr. Moynihan     will pay the company for such use of the aircraft pursuant to     the terms of the Agreement, provided such payment does not     exceed the maximum amount allowed under Federal Aviation     Administration regulations. The Agreement automatically renews     each year and each party shall have the right to terminate the     Agreement at anytime with 30 days written notice to     the other party. The Agreement also shall terminate immediately     if Mr. Moynihan no longer serves as the companys     Chief Executive Officer. The company and Pilot In Command retain     the authority to determine what flights may be scheduled under     the Agreement and when a flight may be cancelled or changed for     safety reasons. The description of the Agreement does not     purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by     reference to the Agreement, which is attached as     Exhibit 10(jjj) to this report.

No additional awards were granted under these     plans following the respective dates of acquisition.         (2)   This table does not include     outstanding options to purchase 9,560,763 shares of the     Corporations common stock that were assumed by the     Corporation in connection with the Merrill Lynch acquisition,     which were originally issued under certain Merrill Lynch plans.

These Merrill     Lynch plans were frozen at the time of the acquisition and no     additional awards may be granted under these plans. However, as     previously approved by the Corporations shareholders, if     any of the outstanding awards under these frozen plans     subsequently are cancelled, forfeited or settled in cash, the     shares relating to such awards thereafter will be available for     future awards issued under the Corporations Key Associate     Stock Plan (KASP).

Options have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of     the stock on the date of grant. Options granted under the ESCP     expire not more than 10 years from the date of grant, and     the applicable grant documentation specifies the extent to which     options may be exercised during their respective terms,     including in the event of an associates death, disability     or termination of employment.
