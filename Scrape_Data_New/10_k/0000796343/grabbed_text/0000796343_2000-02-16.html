EXCLUDING REVENUE FROM BUSINESSES DIVESTED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 1998, REVENUE INCREASED 16%. THE PRINT PUBLISHING SEGMENT PROVIDED THE MAJORITY OF THE FISCAL 1999 REVENUE GROWTH, WITH A 30% INCREASE FROM $272.2&NBSP;MILLION IN FISCAL 1998 TO $353.9&NBSP;MILLION IN FISCAL 1999. THE INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM THIS SEGMENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED LICENSING OF OUR PUBLISHING COLLECTION PRODUCT AND THE INTRODUCTION OF INDESIGN, A NEW PAGE&NBSP;LAYOUT APPLICATION SOFTWARE PRODUCT, IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 1999.

THIS INCREASE WAS DUE TO THE RELEASE OF ACROBAT 4.0 IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE YEAR, WITH A HIGHER NUMBER OF UNITS LICENSED AS A RESULT OF GROWING CUSTOMER ADOPTION OF ADOBE ACROBAT AND ADOBE PORTABLE DOCUMENT FORMAT ("PDF") TECHNOLOGY.</FONT></P> <P><FONT SIZE=2>&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;THE WEB PUBLISHING SEGMENT ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE REVENUE GROWTH AS IT GREW 11% IN FISCAL 1999 TO $394.1&NBSP;MILLION COMPARED TO $354.2&NBSP;MILLION IN FISCAL 1998. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RELEASE OF GOLIVE, OUR NEW INTERNET APPLICATION SOFTWARE PRODUCT INTRODUCED IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 1999.

THE INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM THIS SEGMENT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN REVENUE FROM ADOBE PHOTODELUXE, DUE TO REDUCED PRICING, AND A DECLINE IN REVENUE FROM PAGEMILL, DUE TO PRODUCT LIFECYCLE TIMING.</FONT></P> <P><FONT SIZE=2>&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;THE INCREASE IN REVENUE IN FISCAL 1999 IN THE ABOVE OPERATING SEGMENTS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN REVENUE FROM THE OEM POSTSCRIPT AND OTHER SEGMENT OF $72.2&NBSP;MILLION, OR 34%, COMPARED TO FISCAL 1998. OEM POSTSCRIPT LICENSING REVENUE HAS EXPERIENCED A DECLINE OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ONGOING WEAKNESS IN THE MONOCHROME LASER PRINTER MARKET AS A RESULT OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: LOSS OF ROYALTY REVENUE FROM HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY'S ("HP") DESKTOP MONOCHROME LASER PRINTER DIVISION, WHICH HAS BEEN INCORPORATING A CLONE VERSION OF ADOBE POSTSCRIPT SOFTWARE INTO ITS PRODUCTS SINCE THE FALL OF 1997; A DECLINE IN THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE OF MONOCHROME LASER PRINTERS; AND AN INCREASE IN THE USE OF INKJET PRINTERS, RESULTING IN THE WEAKNESS IN THE MONOCHROME LASER PRINTER MARKET. IN ADDITION, IN FISCAL 1998, WE RECEIVED $20.2&NBSP;MILLION IN REVENUE IN THIS SEGMENT FROM BUSINESSES WE DIVESTED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 1998, RESULTING IN A DECLINE OF REVENUE IN FISCAL 1999 FROM THE ABSENCE OF THESE BUSINESSES.</FONT></P> <P><FONT SIZE=2>&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;WE CONTINUE TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT REVENUE FROM OUR OEM POSTSCRIPT AND OTHER SEGMENT BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUING WEAKNESS IN THE MONOCHROME LASER PRINTER MARKET AND THE UNCERTAIN TIMING OF OEM CUSTOMER INTRODUCTIONS OF PRODUCTS INCORPORATING ADOBE'S LATEST TECHNOLOGIES.

THE PRINT PUBLISHING SEGMENT DECREASED 15% IN FISCAL 1998 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1997, DUE TO A DECLINE IN REVENUE FROM OUR PAGEMAKER, FRAMEMAKER, AND ADOBE TYPE MANAGER PRODUCTS, NONE OF WHICH HAD UPGRADES RELEASED DURING THE YEAR, AND A DECLINE IN REVENUE FROM OUR ILLUSTRATOR PRODUCT AS ITS LATEST UPGRADE WAS NOT RELEASED UNTIL LATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.

A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR REVENUE FOR APPLICATION PRODUCTS IS FROM A SINGLE DISTRIBUTOR. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF REVISING OUR CHANNEL PROGRAM TO REDUCE THE OVERALL NUMBER OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS WORLDWIDE AND FOCUS OUR CHANNEL EFFORTS ON LARGER DISTRIBUTORS. THIS REVISION OF THE CHANNEL PROGRAM HAS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN OUR DEPENDENCE ON A SMALLER NUMBER OF DISTRIBUTORS SELLING THROUGH A LARGER AMOUNT OF OUR PRODUCTS.

SOME OF THESE COMPANIES ARE THINLY CAPITALIZED AND MAY BE UNABLE TO WITHSTAND CHANGES IN BUSINESS CONDITIONS. OUR BUSINESS COULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF SOME OF THESE THIRD PARTIES SUBSTANTIALLY WEAKENS OR IF OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM DETERIORATE.

WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE AND BELIEVE THAT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE HARMED BY IT. THE WEAKNESS IN THE MONOCHROME LASER PRINTER AND JAPANESE MARKETS WERE FACTORS CAUSING THE REVENUE DECLINE. IN ADDITION, IN THE FALL OF FISCAL 1997, HP BEGAN TO SHIP A CLONE VERSION OF ADOBE POSTSCRIPT TECHNOLOGY IN SOME PRINTERS, RESULTING IN LOWER LICENSING REVENUE TO US IN FISCAL 1999 AND 1998. EVEN THOUGH WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH HP PRINTER OPERATIONS TO INCORPORATE ADOBE POSTSCRIPT AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES INTO OTHER HP PRODUCTS, WE EXPECT CONTINUED LOWER REVENUE IN THIS SEGMENT FROM HP IN FISCAL 2000. IF OTHER SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS ALSO DECIDE TO INCORPORATE A CLONE VERSION INSTEAD OF ADOBE POSTSCRIPT TECHNOLOGY, IT COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS. FURTHER, OEM CUSTOMERS ON OCCASION SEEK TO RENEGOTIATE THEIR ROYALTY ARRANGEMENTS. WE EVALUATE THESE REQUESTS ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.

DURING THE SECOND, THIRD, AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF FISCAL 1999, WE EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN APPLICATION REVENUE FROM OUR JAPANESE OPERATION BUT STILL CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN OEM POSTSCRIPT AND OTHER REVENUE. IN ADDITION, AT THE END OF FISCAL 1997, INVENTORY LEVELS FOR APPLICATION PRODUCTS AT OUR JAPANESE DISTRIBUTORS REMAINED HIGHER THAN WHAT WE CONSIDER NORMAL. DURING FISCAL 1998, WE WORKED WITH OUR MAJOR DISTRIBUTORS IN JAPAN TO REDUCE CHANNEL INVENTORY TO WHAT WE CONSIDER A REASONABLE LEVEL. DESPITE THE SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT IN THE JAPANESE ECONOMY IN THE SECOND, THIRD, AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF FISCAL 1999, THESE ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY CONTINUE IN THE SHORT TERM, AND THEY MAY CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS.

COMPETITION FOR HIGH-QUALITY PERSONNEL, ESPECIALLY HIGHLY SKILLED ENGINEERS, IS EXTREMELY INTENSE.

ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE UNCERTAIN WHETHER THE RECENT WEAKNESS EXPERIENCED IN THE JAPAN, ASIA PACIFIC, AND LATIN AMERICA MARKETS WILL CONTINUE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE DUE TO POSSIBLE CURRENCY DEVALUATION AND LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS IN THESE REGIONS. WHILE MOST OF THE REVENUE OF OUR EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARIES IS DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS, THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE DERIVED FROM JAPAN IS DENOMINATED IN YEN, AND THE MAJORITY OF ALL OUR SUBSIDIARIES' OPERATING EXPENSES ARE DENOMINATED IN THEIR LOCAL CURRENCIES. AS A RESULT, OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. TO DATE, THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF SUCH FLUCTUATIONS HAS NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT. OUR HEDGING POLICY ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE SOME OF THESE RISKS, BASED ON OUR BEST JUDGMENT OF THE APPROPRIATE TRADE-OFFS AMONG RISK, OPPORTUNITY, AND EXPENSE. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A HEDGING PROGRAM TO HEDGE OUR EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, PRIMARILY OF THE JAPANESE YEN. OUR HEDGING PROGRAM IS NOT COMPREHENSIVE, AND OUR PROGRAM MAY NOT OFFSET MORE THAN A PORTION OF THE ADVERSE FINANCIAL IMPACT RESULTING FROM UNFAVORABLE MOVEMENT IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.</FONT></P> <P><FONT SIZE=2>&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;IN CONNECTION WITH THE ENFORCEMENT OF OUR OWN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR IN CONNECTION WITH DISPUTES RELATING TO THE VALIDITY OR ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS, WE HAVE BEEN AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE SUBJECT TO COMPLEX, PROTRACTED LITIGATION AS PART OF OUR POLICY TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LITIGATION IS TYPICALLY VERY COSTLY AND CAN BE DISRUPTIVE TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS BY DIVERTING THE ATTENTION AND ENERGIES OF MANAGEMENT AND KEY TECHNICAL PERSONNEL. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDED PAST LITIGATION, WE MAY NOT PREVAIL IN ANY ONGOING OR FUTURE LITIGATION. ADVERSE DECISIONS IN SUCH LITIGATION COULD HAVE NEGATIVE RESULTS, INCLUDING SUBJECTING US TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES, REQUIRING US TO SEEK LICENSES FROM OTHERS, PREVENTING US FROM MANUFACTURING OR LICENSING CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS, OR CAUSING SEVERE DISRUPTIONS TO OUR OPERATIONS OR THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE, ANY ONE OF WHICH COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS.</FONT></P> <P><FONT SIZE=2>&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;WE PREPARE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ("GAAP").
